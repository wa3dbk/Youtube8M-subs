00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.430 
to be rude and we won't need this piece
right<00:02:40.850> now<00:02:40.910> we'll<00:02:41.180> take<00:02:41.360> this<00:02:41.480> out<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.870> way

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.790 

now

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
now

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.400 
now
when<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.670> take<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.090> apart<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.630> I've<00:02:48.080> taken

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
when you take this apart and I've taken

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.870 
when you take this apart and I've taken
this<00:02:48.590> apart<00:02:49.190> already

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
this apart already

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.940 
this apart already
so<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.390> sealant<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:50.930> me<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.200> going<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.410> break

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
so the sealant for me is going to break

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.340 
so the sealant for me is going to break
loose<00:02:54.910> keep<00:02:55.910> working<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.780> working<00:02:57.019> this

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
loose keep working this and working this

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.880 
loose keep working this and working this
and<00:02:57.500> working<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:58.010> slowly<00:02:58.970> slowly<00:02:59.890> you'll

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
and working this slowly slowly you'll

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.259 
and working this slowly slowly you'll
come<00:03:01.160> apart<00:03:02.140> now<00:03:03.760> when<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.850> get<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.150> this

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
come apart now when you get to this

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.840 
come apart now when you get to this
pulley<00:03:05.920> we're<00:03:06.920> going<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.130> clean<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.549> later

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
pulley we're going to clean this later

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.140 
pulley we're going to clean this later
we're<00:03:08.299> not<00:03:08.420> worried<00:03:08.690> about<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:11.739> now<00:03:12.850> this<00:03:13.850> is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
we're not worried about that now this is

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.110 
we're not worried about that now this is
the<00:03:14.769> chopper<00:03:15.769> piece<00:03:16.070> now<00:03:17.060> what<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.660> use<00:03:18.579> is<00:03:19.579> a

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
the chopper piece now what I use is a

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.050 
the chopper piece now what I use is a
9/16<00:03:21.019> socket<00:03:21.100> with<00:03:22.100> my<00:03:22.280> Dewalt<00:03:22.670> impact<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.650> I

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
9/16 socket with my Dewalt impact and I

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.150 
9/16 socket with my Dewalt impact and I
kept<00:03:26.060> hitting<00:03:26.239> it<00:03:26.510> hitting<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:28.010> won't

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
kept hitting it hitting it and I won't

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.650 
kept hitting it hitting it and I won't
point<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.670> didn't<00:03:29.030> break<00:03:29.150> loose

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
point it didn't break loose

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.460 
point it didn't break loose
so<00:03:29.959> with<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:30.739> slope<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.610> assembled<00:03:32.570> sure<00:03:33.290> that

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
so with this slope I assembled sure that

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.920 
so with this slope I assembled sure that
before<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.160> actually<00:03:34.730> put<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.060> screwdriver<00:03:35.390> in

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
before I actually put a screwdriver in

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.620 
before I actually put a screwdriver in
there<00:03:36.370> um<00:03:37.370> but<00:03:37.820> I<00:03:37.850> didn't<00:03:38.090> know<00:03:38.150> need<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.480> take

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
there um but I didn't know need to take

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.410 
there um but I didn't know need to take
this<00:03:38.780> off<00:03:39.130> so<00:03:40.130> if<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.430> take<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:40.820> off<00:03:41.060> first

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
this off so if you take this off first

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.199 
this off so if you take this off first
you<00:03:41.890> may<00:03:42.890> just<00:03:43.070> get<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> pair<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.549> pliers<00:03:43.730> and

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
you may just get a pair of pliers and

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.370 
you may just get a pair of pliers and
hold<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:45.340> hit<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.390> nut<00:03:47.390> with<00:03:47.870> an<00:03:47.989> impact

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
hold this hit the nut with an impact

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.150 
hold this hit the nut with an impact
socket<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.570> break<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.750> loose<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.200> take<00:03:51.980> this

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
socket and break it loose and take this

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.020 
socket and break it loose and take this
off<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:54.230> what<00:03:54.500> we<00:03:54.620> got<00:03:54.829> now<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.430> the

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
off this is what we got now in the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.500 
off this is what we got now in the
garbage<00:03:56.359> disposal<00:03:57.609> now<00:03:58.609> I<00:03:59.230> checked<00:04:00.230> around

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
garbage disposal now I checked around

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.060 
garbage disposal now I checked around
first<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.750> tried<00:04:03.079> to<00:04:03.109> clean<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.590> off<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.859> see

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
first and tried to clean it off to see

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.400 
first and tried to clean it off to see
where<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.370> got<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:04.609> leak<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:05.120> was<00:04:05.810> thinking<00:04:06.260> maybe

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.980 
the top to see it's a seal in the
garbage<00:04:25.070> disposals<00:04:25.610> leaking<00:04:26.000> if<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.660> seals

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990

leaking
I<00:04:27.650> looked<00:04:28.370> online<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:29.390> can't<00:04:29.660> find<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.290> after

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
I looked online you can't find it after

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.910 
I looked online you can't find it after
you<00:04:31.370> make<00:04:31.580> some<00:04:31.760> kind<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.170> ring<00:04:33.170> on<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.500> top<00:04:33.680> I

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
you make some kind of ring on the top I

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.740 
you make some kind of ring on the top I
put<00:04:34.340> some<00:04:34.520> water<00:04:34.730> in<00:04:34.940> there<00:04:35.860> then<00:04:37.390> put<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.540> nut

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
put some water in there then put the nut

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.750 
put some water in there then put the nut
back<00:04:38.960> on<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:41.240> slowly<00:04:42.190> turned<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:44.510> entire

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
back on and I slowly turned the entire

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.820 
back on and I slowly turned the entire
motor<00:04:46.760> slowly<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:48.080> see<00:04:48.260> if<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.440> water<00:04:48.650> would

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
motor slowly to see if the water would

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.120 
motor slowly to see if the water would
leave<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:51.370> actually<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.460> water<00:04:52.640> did<00:04:53.030> not

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
leave and actually the water did not

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:01.150 
leave and actually the water did not
drip<00:04:55.130> out<00:04:55.310> from<00:04:55.730> there<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:57.520> from<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.760> I<00:05:00.160> went

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
drip out from there so from that I went

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.150 
drip out from there so from that I went
ahead<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.460> started<00:05:01.850> to<00:05:02.120> take<00:05:02.300> this<00:05:02.480> off<00:05:02.720> I

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
ahead and started to take this off I

went ahead with my screwdriver and

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.610 
went ahead with my screwdriver and
started<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.000> remove<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:10.820> crud<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.500> then<00:05:12.500> I

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
noticed that right here

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:29.890 
noticed that right here
I<00:05:21.970> have<00:05:25.540> pinholes<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:27.080> rust<00:05:27.950> of<00:05:28.190> uh<00:05:28.669> of<00:05:28.970> this

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
I have pinholes and rust of uh of this

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.220 
I have pinholes and rust of uh of this
piece<00:05:30.169> now<00:05:30.950> this<00:05:31.190> is<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.490> motor<00:05:31.990> they<00:05:32.990> don't

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
piece now this is the motor they don't

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.350
