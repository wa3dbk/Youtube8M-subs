few<00:00:55.110> years<00:00:55.289> ago<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.770> Ubisoft<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> working<00:00:56.760> on

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
few years ago and Ubisoft is working on

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.580

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.090 
pretty sure and that's cool i'm really
into<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> Gears<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.260> War<00:02:19.350> Collection<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.950> just

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
into a Gears of War Collection it just

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.260 
into a Gears of War Collection it just
makes<00:02:20.250> sense<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.580> another<00:02:20.790> one<00:02:20.910> coming<00:02:21.180> out

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
makes sense with another one coming out

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.309 
makes sense with another one coming out
they<00:02:21.420> released<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> older<00:02:21.959> ones<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> know

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
they released the older ones you know

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.600 
they released the older ones you know
it's<00:02:22.440> going<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.650> HD<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.520> be

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
it's going to be HD it's going to be

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.190 
it's going to be HD it's going to be
1080p<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.569> 60<00:02:24.840> frames<00:02:25.110> per

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
1080p it's going to be 60 frames per

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.380 
1080p it's going to be 60 frames per
second<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.920> stuff<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.550> cool<00:02:26.910> maybe<00:02:27.209> it's

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
second all that stuff so cool maybe it's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.730 
second all that stuff so cool maybe it's
in<00:02:27.480> better<00:02:27.510> condition<00:02:28.020> than<00:02:28.050> master<00:02:28.560> chief

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
in better condition than master chief

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.870 
in better condition than master chief
collection<00:02:28.770> now<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.520> one<00:02:29.670> might<00:02:29.850> be

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
collection now this one might be

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.820 
collection now this one might be
reaching<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.600> little<00:02:31.050> bit<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.410> do<00:02:31.500> think

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
reaching a little bit but I do think

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.380 
reaching a little bit but I do think
it's<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.250> gonna<00:02:32.370> happen<00:02:32.610> because<00:02:32.880> Bioware

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
it's it's gonna happen because Bioware

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.880 
it's it's gonna happen because Bioware
isn't<00:02:33.600> working<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.959> anything<00:02:34.200> else<00:02:34.440> from<00:02:34.709> what

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
isn't working on anything else from what

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.170 
isn't working on anything else from what
I<00:02:34.920> know<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.130> i'll<00:02:35.340> get<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.580> later<00:02:35.790> but

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
I know of i'll get to that later but

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.790 
I know of i'll get to that later but
mass<00:02:36.360> effect<00:02:36.690> 4<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.200> think<00:02:37.380> we're<00:02:37.500> gonna<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.770> a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
mass effect 4 I think we're gonna see a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.470 
mass effect 4 I think we're gonna see a
little<00:02:38.040> bit<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.220> gameplay<00:02:38.580> here<00:02:38.850> EA<00:02:39.060> has<00:02:39.300> its

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
little bit of gameplay here EA has its

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.699 
little bit of gameplay here EA has its
own<00:02:39.570> presser<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.020> year<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.380> does<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.680> a

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
own presser this year and it does have a

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.350 
own presser this year and it does have a
lot<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.130> things<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.670> show<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.060> think<00:02:42.270> they

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
lot of things to show but I think they

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.580 
lot of things to show but I think they
can<00:02:42.510> cram<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.959> little<00:02:43.170> mass<00:02:43.290> effect

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
can cram in a little mass effect

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.720 
can cram in a little mass effect
gameplay<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.190> would<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.670> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
gameplay there I would really like that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.190 
gameplay there I would really like that
I<00:02:44.910> know<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.120> lot<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.330> people<00:02:45.420> would<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:46.020> like

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
I know a lot of people would really like

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.690 
I know a lot of people would really like

on<00:03:25.620> even<00:03:25.860> though<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.010> think<00:03:26.130> that's<00:03:26.400> likely<00:03:26.610> or

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
on even though I think that's likely or

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.580 
on even though I think that's likely or
the<00:03:27.000> visceral<00:03:27.390> game<00:03:27.570> but<00:03:28.079> I've<00:03:28.200> also<00:03:28.380> heard

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
the visceral game but I've also heard

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.660 
the visceral game but I've also heard
murmurs<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:28.950> knights<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.400> old<00:03:29.489> republic

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
murmurs of knights of the old republic

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.670 
murmurs of knights of the old republic
name<00:03:30.239> being<00:03:30.450> brought<00:03:30.750> back<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.350> kind<00:03:31.590> of

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
name being brought back and that kind of

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.960 
name being brought back and that kind of
makes<00:03:31.890> sense<00:03:32.040> because<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.610> said<00:03:32.670> right

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
