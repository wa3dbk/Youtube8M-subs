00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.330 
basic offense move is this a pinwheel
type<00:01:41.670> attack<00:01:42.110> which<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.560> any<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
type attack which you can do with any of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.600 
type attack which you can do with any of
the<00:01:44.460> three<00:01:44.670> buttons<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.009> light<00:01:47.430> kick

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the three buttons so the light kick

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730 
the three buttons so the light kick
version<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.149> course<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> safest<00:01:48.869> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
version is of course the safest but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.710 
version is of course the safest but
actually<00:01:50.159> off<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.340> forward<00:01:50.909> version<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
actually off the forward version if you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.999 
actually off the forward version if you
can<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> forward<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.799> actually

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
can go to the forward you can actually

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.910 
can go to the forward you can actually
link<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> old<00:01:53.640> trap<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.470> well<00:01:55.470> maybe<00:01:55.770> not

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
link the old trap of that well maybe not

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.340 
link the old trap of that well maybe not
this<00:01:56.070> time<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.450> link<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.079> ultra

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
this time but you can link the ultra

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.660 
this time but you can link the ultra
after<00:01:58.619> some<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.890> these<00:01:58.950> setups<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
after some of these setups but it's a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.069 
after some of these setups but it's a
good<00:01:59.820> basic<00:02:00.180> way<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> keep<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> offense

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
good basic way to keep on the offense

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.410 
good basic way to keep on the offense
you<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.100> one<00:02:02.250> observes<00:02:02.670> rare<00:02:02.850> punches<00:02:03.270> there

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you see one observes rare punches there

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.929 
you see one observes rare punches there
she's<00:02:03.630> done<00:02:03.930> jab<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.380> strong<00:02:04.790> she's<00:02:05.790> got

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
she's done jab and strong she's got

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.190 
she's done jab and strong she's got
punched<00:02:06.240> moves<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.840> actually<00:02:06.990> her

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
punched moves that was actually her

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.210

and then bounce off you can juggle again
after<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.100> that's<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.940> mechanic<00:02:34.420> we've<00:02:34.570> seen

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
after that that's a mechanic we've seen

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.120 
after that that's a mechanic we've seen
somewhere<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.470> some<00:02:35.650> previous<00:02:35.830> street

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
lot of range options to jump around as

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.920 
lot of range options to jump around as
well<00:02:51.700> as<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.940> lot<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.480> different<00:02:52.750> kind<00:02:52.870> of

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
well as a lot of different kind of

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.780 
well as a lot of different kind of
juggling<00:02:53.230> options<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.860> frankly<00:02:54.520> one<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
juggling options and frankly one of the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.540 
juggling options and frankly one of the
best<00:02:54.970> looking<00:02:55.090> characters<00:02:55.600> in<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.780> game<00:02:55.810> so

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
best looking characters in the game so

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.860 
best looking characters in the game so
she<00:02:57.550> has<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.670> take<00:02:57.880> some<00:02:58.090> chances<00:02:58.120> basically

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
she has to take some chances basically

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.750 
she has to take some chances basically
to<00:02:58.959> generate<00:02:59.290> some<00:02:59.440> often<00:02:59.740> so<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.430> she's<00:03:00.580> got

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
to generate some often so but she's got

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.980 
to generate some often so but she's got
a<00:03:00.790> lot<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.030> different<00:03:01.360> options<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:01.780> she's

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
a lot of different options so she's

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.530 
a lot of different options so she's
she's<00:03:02.530> affected<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:03.220> close<00:03:03.550> has<00:03:04.120> some<00:03:04.390> decent

he did flips her right out of there so

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.550 
he did flips her right out of there so
that<00:03:37.700> is<00:03:37.850> one<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.180> Judy's<00:03:38.780> liabilities<00:03:39.350> she's

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
that is one of Judy's liabilities she's

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.990 
that is one of Judy's liabilities she's
got<00:03:39.710> a<00:03:39.740> lot<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:39.950> offensive<00:03:40.430> options<00:03:40.820> from<00:03:40.880> a

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
got a lot of offensive options from a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.910 
got a lot of offensive options from a
different<00:03:41.300> ranges<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:42.020> she's<00:03:42.230> slightly<00:03:42.530> weak

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
different ranges but she's slightly weak

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.470 
different ranges but she's slightly weak
she<00:03:43.190> takes<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.520> little<00:03:43.670> bit<00:03:43.820> more<00:03:44.000> damage<00:03:44.390> and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
she takes a little bit more damage and

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.480 
she takes a little bit more damage and
she<00:03:44.630> also<00:03:44.780> doesn't<00:03:45.110> hit<00:03:45.320> super<00:03:45.980> hard<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:46.430> you

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
she also doesn't hit super hard so you

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.370 
she also doesn't hit super hard so you
basically<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:47.450> have<00:03:47.570> more<00:03:47.960> chances<00:03:48.320> to

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
basically you have more chances to

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.470 
basically you have more chances to
create<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:48.830> lot<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.070> offensive<00:03:49.880> opportunities

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
create a lot of offensive opportunities

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.390 
create a lot of offensive opportunities
but<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.020> need<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.320> have<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.860> need<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.130> be<00:03:52.280> able

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
but you need to have you need to be able

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.010 
but you need to have you need to be able
to<00:03:52.610> set<00:03:52.820> people<00:03:52.970> up<00:03:53.150> more<00:03:53.450> than<00:03:53.630> once<00:03:53.870> it

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
to set people up more than once it
