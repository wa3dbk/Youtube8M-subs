before<00:01:41.790> you've<00:01:42.329> done<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:42.930> least<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.590> me

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
before you've done it at least for me

gone so it seems to be a one-time-only
thing<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:47.880> does<00:01:48.149> kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.600> suck<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.530> is

it's basically on these rocks as you saw
and<00:02:20.710> this<00:02:21.130> one<00:02:21.370> turned<00:02:22.150> me<00:02:22.270> into<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> pigeon<00:02:22.750> now

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
and this one turned me into a pigeon now

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.810 
and this one turned me into a pigeon now
what<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.740> can<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> pigeon<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.580> pretty

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
what you can do as a pigeon it's pretty

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.880 
what you can do as a pigeon it's pretty
funny<00:02:25.090> there's<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> thing<00:02:25.900> called<00:02:25.930> an<00:02:26.380> attack

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
funny there's a thing called an attack

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.560 
funny there's a thing called an attack
like<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:27.910> hit<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.180> right<00:02:28.330> trigger

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
like that you can hit the right trigger

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.170 
like that you can hit the right trigger
to<00:02:28.840> attack<00:02:29.290> quote-unquote<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.250> as<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.970> saw

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
to attack quote-unquote and as you saw

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.510 
to attack quote-unquote and as you saw
me<00:02:31.390> doing<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.260> bird<00:02:32.440> let's<00:02:33.130> say<00:02:33.310> he

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
me doing it the bird let's say he

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.550 
me doing it the bird let's say he
dropped<00:02:33.850> some<00:02:34.090> presents<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.690> some<00:02:34.930> people<00:02:35.290> so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
dropped some presents for some people so

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.690 
dropped some presents for some people so
it's<00:02:35.830> pretty<00:02:35.980> funny<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.340> don't<00:02:36.490> know<00:02:36.550> if<00:02:36.610> that

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
it's pretty funny I don't know if that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.220 
it's pretty funny I don't know if that
actually<00:02:36.790> hurts<00:02:37.270> people<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:37.930> hard<00:02:38.200> to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
actually hurts people it's so hard to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.890 
actually hurts people it's so hard to
control<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.680> pigeon<00:02:39.100> or<00:02:39.190> any<00:02:39.880> bird<00:02:40.150> really<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.870> I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
control a pigeon or any bird really so I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.480 
control a pigeon or any bird really so I
couldn't<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.260> test<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.650> out<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:42.220> much

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
couldn't really test it out that much

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.460 
couldn't really test it out that much
you<00:02:43.120> can<00:02:43.330> land<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.810> basically<00:02:44.110> if<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.320> guys

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
you can land and basically if you guys

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.080 
you can land and basically if you guys
were<00:02:44.650> wondering<00:02:44.710> there's<00:02:45.460> two<00:02:45.760> ways<00:02:45.910> to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
were wondering there's two ways to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.910 
were wondering there's two ways to
actually<00:02:46.240> get<00:02:46.570> out<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.959> animal<00:02:47.350> one<00:02:47.740> you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
actually get out of the animal one you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.190 
actually get out of the animal one you
can<00:02:48.040> either<00:02:48.190> die<00:02:48.430> or<00:02:48.730> two<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.810> can<00:02:49.990> hit<00:02:50.170> I

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
can either die or two you can hit I

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.360 
can either die or two you can hit I
think<00:02:50.320> it's<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.920> right<00:02:51.040> on<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.220> d-pad
