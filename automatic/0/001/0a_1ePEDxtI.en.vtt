00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that the camera makes it look not as

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.830 
that the camera makes it look not as
orange<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.190> maybe<00:01:00.000> against<00:01:00.719> the

because<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> lot<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.050> guys<00:03:00.080> think<00:03:00.560> that

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
because a lot of you guys think that

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.010 
because a lot of you guys think that
it's<00:03:00.890> jet<00:03:01.160> black<00:03:01.340> natural<00:03:01.850> uh-uh<00:03:02.000> not<00:03:02.660> true

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
it's jet black natural uh-uh not true

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.110 
it's jet black natural uh-uh not true
anyway<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:04.010> camera<00:03:04.400> definitely<00:03:04.910> does<00:03:05.090> not

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
anyway the camera definitely does not

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.720 
anyway the camera definitely does not
pick<00:03:05.540> up<00:03:05.690> vibrancy<00:03:06.380> as<00:03:06.590> much<00:03:06.860> as<00:03:07.070> in<00:03:07.250> real<00:03:07.489> life

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
pick up vibrancy as much as in real life

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.910 
pick up vibrancy as much as in real life
so<00:03:08.000> probably<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.959> outcome<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.380> still<00:03:09.769> gonna

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
so probably the outcome is still gonna

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.590 
so probably the outcome is still gonna
look<00:03:10.130> black<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.730> guys<00:03:10.910> but<00:03:11.120> I'm<00:03:11.239> going<00:03:11.420> for
