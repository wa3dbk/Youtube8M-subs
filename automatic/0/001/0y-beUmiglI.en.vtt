mixing bed 3 quart mixing boat and he's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.260 
mixing bed 3 quart mixing boat and he's
off<00:00:46.070> just<00:00:46.670> dumped<00:00:47.390> out<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:49.270> cleaning

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
off just dumped out the cleaning

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.040 
off just dumped out the cleaning
solution<00:00:50.450> and<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.710> did<00:00:52.280> half<00:00:53.239> of<00:00:53.449> that<00:00:53.539> rumor

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
solution and I did half of that rumor

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.100 
solution and I did half of that rumor
that<00:00:54.350> we<00:00:54.620> use<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:54.980> hydrate<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:55.730> east<00:00:55.910> he's<00:00:56.899> got

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
that we use to hydrate to east he's got

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.660 
that we use to hydrate to east he's got
that<00:00:57.289> in<00:00:57.440> there<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:57.800> now<00:00:58.100> he's<00:00:58.340> going<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.550> add

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
that in there and now he's going to add

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.720 
that in there and now he's going to add
one<00:00:59.420> pack<00:00:59.660> of<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.960> flavor<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.440> crystals<00:01:00.949> one

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
one pack of the flavor of crystals one

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.610 
one pack of the flavor of crystals one
packet<00:01:02.149> like<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.449> said<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:02.930> all<00:01:03.199> came<00:01:03.410> with

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
packet like I said this all came with

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.109 
packet like I said this all came with
two<00:01:03.800> packets<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:04.430> can<00:01:04.580> make<00:01:04.699> two<00:01:04.940> batches

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
two packets so you can make two batches

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.270 
two packets so you can make two batches
so<00:01:05.600> we're<00:01:06.470> going<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.649> put<00:01:06.710> these<00:01:06.890> folding

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
so we're going to put these folding

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.370 
so we're going to put these folding
crystals<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:07.880> there<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.119> says<00:01:08.300> gently<00:01:08.750> stir<00:01:09.050> in

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
crystals in there it says gently stir in

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.230 
crystals in there it says gently stir in
the<00:01:09.440> favoring<00:01:10.340> one<00:01:10.550> pack<00:01:10.789> their<00:01:10.940> favorite

so just put half that you know that one

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.580 
so just put half that you know that one
water<00:01:56.659> in<00:01:56.840> there<00:01:56.960> I'm<00:01:57.170> gonna<00:01:57.229> have<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.470> be

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590

sugar and stir that in a little bit get

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.530 
sugar and stir that in a little bit get
that<00:02:31.730> story<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:34.340> as<00:02:34.489> all<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.120> there<00:02:35.299> and

it's also called for one cup of white

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.690 
it's also called for one cup of white
granulated<00:02:39.260> sugar<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.190> regular<00:02:40.489> cane

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
granulated sugar so I just regular cane

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.880 
granulated sugar so I just regular cane
sugar<00:02:40.970> Andrew<00:02:41.900> back<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.260> measure<00:02:42.470> out<00:02:42.680> here

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
sugar Andrew back that measure out here

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.759 
sugar Andrew back that measure out here
to<00:02:43.750> see<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:45.019> coming<00:02:45.260> dump<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.739> there

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
to see this coming dump that in there

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:53.030 
to see this coming dump that in there
get<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.430> stirred<00:02:46.670> up

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.209 

so<00:02:53.760> that's<00:02:54.090> our<00:02:54.269> form<00:02:54.560> formats<00:02:55.560> are<00:02:55.680> sugars<00:02:56.069> I

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
so that's our form formats are sugars I

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.179 
so that's our form formats are sugars I
best<00:02:57.019> or<00:02:58.019> for<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.349> rhythms<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.709> our<00:02:58.829> sugars

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
best or for the rhythms and our sugars

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.270 
best or for the rhythms and our sugars
there<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:00.510> gotta<00:03:00.689> let<00:03:01.019> some<00:03:01.159> liquid<00:03:02.159> here

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
there and we gotta let some liquid here

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.440 
there and we gotta let some liquid here
to<00:03:02.459> leave<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.730> tad<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:04.260> basically<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.859> cuts<00:03:05.069> us

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
to leave a tad so basically just cuts us

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.809 
to leave a tad so basically just cuts us
stir<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.480> gently<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:08.280> we're<00:03:08.519> going<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.730> add

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
stir that gently but we're going to add

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.240 
stir that gently but we're going to add
two<00:03:10.280> tablespoons<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:13.140> root<00:03:13.379> beer<00:03:13.650> mix

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
two tablespoons of that root beer mix

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.780 
two tablespoons of that root beer mix
the<00:03:14.790> liquid<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.099> shaking<00:03:17.939> shake<00:03:18.659> well

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
the liquid and so is shaking shake well

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.039 
the liquid and so is shaking shake well
shake<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.909> very<00:03:21.120> well<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:23.480> they<00:03:24.480> want<00:03:24.750> two

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
shake it very well and they want two

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.020 
shake it very well and they want two
tablespoons<00:03:25.859> in<00:03:26.069> one<00:03:26.519> teaspoon<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:29.030> so

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
tablespoons in one teaspoon of that so

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.789 
tablespoons in one teaspoon of that so
we<00:03:30.329> got<00:03:30.510> everything<00:03:30.900> setting<00:03:31.470> out<00:03:31.560> there

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
we got everything setting out there

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.149 
we got everything setting out there
those<00:03:32.370> are<00:03:32.639> tablespoons<00:03:33.829> he's<00:03:34.829> going<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.040> do

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
those are tablespoons he's going to do

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:41.110 
those are tablespoons he's going to do
to<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.459> now<00:03:37.459> there's<00:03:38.459> one<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.930> looks<00:03:40.109> dark

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
ones that's a teaspoon there we live now

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.740 
ones that's a teaspoon there we live now
there's<00:03:50.340> enough<00:03:50.549> left<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:50.909> bet<00:03:51.209> for<00:03:51.599> that

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
there's enough left for bet for that

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.179 
there's enough left for bet for that
other<00:03:52.109> kits<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.760> he'll<00:03:54.209> just<00:03:54.359> stir<00:03:54.599> that<00:03:54.629> up

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
other kits and he'll just stir that up

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.449 
other kits and he'll just stir that up
and<00:03:56.189> we'll<00:03:57.470> go<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.859> next<00:03:59.040> step<00:03:59.250> and

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
and we'll go on to the next step and

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.979 
and we'll go on to the next step and
it's<00:03:59.669> going<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.879> be<00:03:59.970> borrowing<00:04:00.389> this<00:04:00.569> stuff<00:04:00.810> up

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
it's going to be borrowing this stuff up

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
everything dissolved here all the brown

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.870 
everything dissolved here all the brown
sugar<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.470> sugar<00:04:16.500> dissolved<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.280> he's<00:04:17.700> going

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
sugar the sugar dissolved and he's going

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.300 
sugar the sugar dissolved and he's going
to<00:04:17.940> pitch<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.330> yeast<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.810> here<00:04:18.959> now<00:04:19.110> we<00:04:20.040> was

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
to pitch this yeast in here now we was

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.280 
to pitch this yeast in here now we was
hydrated<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:21.030> he's<00:04:21.360> goes<00:04:21.510> could<00:04:21.660> have<00:04:21.750> pulled

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
hydrated it he's goes could have pulled

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.490 
hydrated it he's goes could have pulled
in<00:04:22.560> there<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.890> stirred<00:04:23.190> up<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:24.110> then<00:04:25.110> we<00:04:25.290> have

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
in there and stirred up and then we have

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.190 
in there and stirred up and then we have
to<00:04:25.530> pour<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:26.010> solution<00:04:26.340> back<00:04:26.730> into<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.210> 1<00:04:27.390> 1

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
to pour this solution back into the 1 1

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.290 
to pour this solution back into the 1 1
gallon<00:04:28.470> container<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:29.460> we<00:04:29.580> have<00:04:29.730> over<00:04:29.760> warm

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
gallon container that we have over warm

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.030 
gallon container that we have over warm
water<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:31.200> I'm<00:04:31.440> going<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.620> give<00:04:31.710> him<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.860> hand

water so I'm going to give him a hand
with<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:32.700> let<00:04:33.120> him<00:04:33.240> start<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.720> yeast

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
with that so let him start this yeast

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.360 
with that so let him start this yeast
and<00:04:34.140> they<00:04:34.260> get<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.470> in<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.100> will<00:04:35.550> be<00:04:35.640> back
