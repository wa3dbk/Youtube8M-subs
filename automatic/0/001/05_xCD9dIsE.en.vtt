00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and that's actually how you get it see

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.510

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
a row and I was like a couple months ago

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.670 
a row and I was like a couple months ago
or<00:01:13.799> not<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> couple<00:01:14.250> months<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.820> month<00:01:15.150> ago

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680

gonna want to have a hundred KT to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.530 
gonna want to have a hundred KT to
actually<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.340> max<00:01:23.610> level<00:01:24.030> from<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.420> I've

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
actually be max level from what I've

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.060 
actually be max level from what I've
heard<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> research<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.920> I've<00:01:26.040> done

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
heard like the research that I've done

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.609 
heard like the research that I've done
in<00:01:26.340> watching<00:01:26.670> videos<00:01:27.060> you're<00:01:28.049> gonna<00:01:28.110> need<00:01:28.259> 100

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
in watching videos you're gonna need 100

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.100 
in watching videos you're gonna need 100
KT<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.570> you're<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> keep<00:01:31.049> doing

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
KT and you're just going to keep doing

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
KT and you're just going to keep doing
this<00:01:31.439> method<00:01:31.650> till<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.189> max<00:01:32.430> rank<00:01:32.670> it's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
this method till you get max rank it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
this method till you get max rank it's
kind<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> gets<00:01:33.630> boring<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.079> you're

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
kind of kind of gets boring but you're

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
kind of kind of gets boring but you're
gonna<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:34.890> least<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> skull

gonna want to do it at least to a skull

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.819 
gonna want to do it at least to a skull
level<00:01:36.049> because<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> lot<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> people<00:01:37.470> will<00:01:37.680> just

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
level because a lot of people will just

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.039 
level because a lot of people will just
leave<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> game<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.640> you're<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:38.939> passed<00:01:39.659> I

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
finally take doesn't take that long when

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.879 
finally take doesn't take that long when
you're<00:03:55.829> on<00:03:55.950> round<00:03:56.459> 20<00:03:56.940> start<00:03:57.450> out<00:03:57.600> as<00:03:57.889> around

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
you're on round 20 start out as around

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.370 
you're on round 20 start out as around
15<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.609> takes<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.910> lot<00:04:00.180> longer<00:04:00.389> so<00:04:00.600> around<00:04:01.019> 20

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
15 just takes a lot longer so around 20

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.849 
15 just takes a lot longer so around 20
I'm<00:04:01.560> here<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.130> now<00:04:03.060> I'm<00:04:03.180> just<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.690> jump<00:04:04.139> down<00:04:04.230> so

I'm here and now I'm just I jump down so

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.610 
I'm here and now I'm just I jump down so
um<00:04:05.819> because<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.569> ran<00:04:06.750> into<00:04:06.810> ammo<00:04:07.139> one<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.500> my

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
um because I ran into ammo one of my

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.460 
um because I ran into ammo one of my
pistols<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.269> ran<00:04:09.540> into<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.780> room<00:04:10.079> beside

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
pistols so I ran into that room beside

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.920 
pistols so I ran into that room beside
the<00:04:10.799> staircase<00:04:11.340> grab<00:04:12.060> juggernaut<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.630> grab

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
the staircase grab juggernaut and grab

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.349 
the staircase grab juggernaut and grab
the<00:04:13.079> mp5<00:04:13.470> off<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.829> wall<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.370> then<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.299> came

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
the mp5 off the wall and then I came

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.150 
the mp5 off the wall and then I came
down<00:04:15.750> here<00:04:15.959> just<00:04:16.139> jumped<00:04:16.500> down<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.650> started

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
down here just jumped down and started

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.069 
down here just jumped down and started
running<00:04:17.430> around<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:17.790> circles<00:04:18.209> lining<00:04:18.630> them<00:04:18.720> up

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
running around in circles lining them up

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.210 
running around in circles lining them up
and<00:04:19.289> then<00:04:19.409> you'll<00:04:19.530> eventually<00:04:19.769> get<00:04:20.099> an

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
and then you'll eventually get an

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.189 
and then you'll eventually get an
insta-kill<00:04:20.639> with<00:04:21.060> your<00:04:21.180> mp5<00:04:21.629> then<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.019> just

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
insta-kill with your mp5 then you just

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.100 
insta-kill with your mp5 then you just
pretty<00:04:22.500> much<00:04:22.680> kill<00:04:22.949> them<00:04:23.129> all<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.360> got<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.720> 111
