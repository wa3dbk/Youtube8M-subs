00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.810 
well as all the other players on the
server<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.740> our<00:01:46.950> fashion<00:01:47.460> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
server so as you can see our fashion is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.660 
server so as you can see our fashion is
a<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.899> rich<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.159> even<00:01:50.399> got<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
a really rich right now it's even got a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.249 
a really rich right now it's even got a
sign<00:01:50.880> saying<00:01:51.090> Yolo<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.840> we're<00:01:52.110> probably

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
sign saying Yolo so we're probably

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319 
sign saying Yolo so we're probably
tramps<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> hippies<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.280> stuff<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:54.119> that

this<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> mean<00:02:07.680> by<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
this is what I mean by like there is a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.859 
this is what I mean by like there is a
little<00:02:08.670> bit<00:02:08.819> lag<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.119> course

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
little bit lag of course

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.720 
little bit lag of course
but<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.619> will<00:02:10.769> be<00:02:10.799> operating<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.280> servicing

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
but we will be operating on servicing

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.399 
but we will be operating on servicing

money and I could go buy some TNT for
this<00:02:43.069> all<00:02:44.069> right<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.280> they're<00:02:44.459> actually<00:02:44.810> using

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
this all right so they're actually using

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.349 
this all right so they're actually using
it<00:02:46.019> free<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:46.680> eggs<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:47.160> blow<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.700> place<00:02:48.000> down

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359

now<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.780> I'm<00:02:49.590> pretty<00:02:49.799> sure<00:02:49.950> that's<00:02:50.129> just

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
now and I'm pretty sure that's just

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.809 
now and I'm pretty sure that's just
glitch<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.359> there<00:02:51.540> he's<00:02:51.810> not<00:02:51.989> actually<00:02:52.170> flying

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
glitch in there he's not actually flying

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.220 
glitch in there he's not actually flying
hopefully<00:02:53.819> not<00:02:53.940> yeah<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:54.599> just<00:02:54.870> glitching

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
hopefully not yeah it's just glitching

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.860 
hopefully not yeah it's just glitching
