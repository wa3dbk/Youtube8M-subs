to see you Tommy yeah well I think the

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.189 
to see you Tommy yeah well I think the
fundamental<00:00:43.429> design<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.269> just<00:00:44.569> about<00:00:44.690> every

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
fundamental design of just about every

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.559 
fundamental design of just about every
BMW<00:00:45.710> out<00:00:45.859> there<00:00:46.129> lets<00:00:46.729> it<00:00:46.940> go<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.329> track

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:47.569 
BMW out there lets it go to the track

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.049 
BMW out there lets it go to the track
and<00:00:47.600> also<00:00:48.289> perform<00:00:48.710> very<00:00:49.010> well<00:00:49.100> but<00:00:49.789> if<00:00:49.909> you're

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
and also perform very well but if you're

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.309 
and also perform very well but if you're
one<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.239> those<00:00:50.389> guys<00:00:50.629> that<00:00:50.690> likes<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.199> go<00:00:51.289> to

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
one of those guys that likes to go to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:52.809 
one of those guys that likes to go to
the<00:00:51.499> track<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:51.769> really<00:00:52.159> perform<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.609> little

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
the track and really perform a little

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.459 
the track and really perform a little
bit<00:00:52.909> more<00:00:53.089> than<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.479> other<00:00:53.629> guys<00:00:54.199> out<00:00:54.409> there

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
bit more than the other guys out there

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.289 
bit more than the other guys out there
you<00:00:54.889> can<00:00:55.249> add<00:00:55.429> the<00:00:55.579> performance<00:00:56.030> parts

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
you can add the performance parts

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.319 
you can add the performance parts
features<00:00:56.749> and<00:00:57.079> really<00:00:57.739> take<00:00:58.519> take<00:00:58.999> it<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.239> the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
features and really take take it to the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.610 
features and really take take it to the
next<00:00:59.449> level<00:00:59.629> I<00:01:00.019> think<00:01:00.260> that's<00:01:00.440> what

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
next level I think that's what

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.289 
next level I think that's what
performance<00:01:01.129> parts<00:01:01.370> offers<00:01:01.699> if<00:01:02.059> you're

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
performance parts offers if you're

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.699 
performance parts offers if you're
someone<00:01:02.600> who's<00:01:02.719> interested<00:01:02.899> in<00:01:03.170> racing<00:01:03.350> or
