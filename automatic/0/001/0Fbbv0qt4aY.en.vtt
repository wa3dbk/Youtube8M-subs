unfortunately

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.819 

so<00:00:44.480> far<00:00:44.690> I've<00:00:44.810> been<00:00:45.020> underneath<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.680> vehicle

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
so far I've been underneath the vehicle

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.440 
so far I've been underneath the vehicle
and<00:00:46.160> I<00:00:46.220> have<00:00:46.310> noticed<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.940> exhaust<00:00:47.270> is

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
and I have noticed that the exhaust is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.210 
and I have noticed that the exhaust is
in<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.690> way<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:48.110> did<00:00:48.500> not<00:00:48.650> find<00:00:48.860> one<00:00:49.040> of<00:00:49.070> these

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
in the way I did not find one of these

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.190 
in the way I did not find one of these
videos<00:00:49.610> online<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.329> I<00:00:50.360> hope<00:00:50.809> this<00:00:50.960> will<00:00:51.140> help

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
videos online so I hope this will help

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.220 
videos online so I hope this will help
you<00:00:51.410> out<00:00:51.730> again<00:00:52.730> this<00:00:53.360> is<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.540> 2000<00:00:54.200> Chevy

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
you out again this is a 2000 Chevy

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:08.870 
you out again this is a 2000 Chevy
Corvette<00:00:54.830> automatic<00:00:55.430> replacing<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.329> starter

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.600 

right<00:01:09.450> underneath<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> vehicle

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.450 

we<00:01:13.120> notice<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:13.810> starter

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
we notice that the starter

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.610 
we notice that the starter
it's<00:01:16.910> positioning<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.750> knife

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
it's positioning the knife

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.190 
it's positioning the knife
tight<00:01:20.250> spot

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.749 

we're<00:01:27.799> going<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.009> attempt<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.340> get<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.580> out<00:01:28.729> of

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
we're going to attempt to get it out of

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.130 
we're going to attempt to get it out of
Leo<00:01:29.119> I'm<00:01:29.270> going<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.479> have<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.689> remove<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
Leo I'm going to have to remove the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.950 
Leo I'm going to have to remove the
exhaust<00:01:31.570> at<00:01:32.570> least<00:01:32.780> unbolted<00:01:33.380> from<00:01:33.409> this<00:01:33.770> side

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
exhaust at least unbolted from this side

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.380 
exhaust at least unbolted from this side
and/or<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.170> mounts<00:01:37.030> directly<00:01:38.030> into<00:01:38.299> the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
and/or it mounts directly into the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.889 
and/or it mounts directly into the
transmission<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.320> more<00:01:39.590> than<00:01:39.770> likely<00:01:40.720> on<00:01:41.720> the

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
transmission and more than likely on the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.710 
transmission and more than likely on the
other<00:01:42.080> side<00:01:42.290> by<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.500> oil<00:01:42.770> filter<00:01:43.070> and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
other side by the oil filter and

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.660 
other side by the oil filter and
hopefully<00:01:44.720> that<00:01:44.899> will<00:01:45.049> allow<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.009> exhaust<00:01:46.490> to

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
hopefully that will allow the exhaust to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.550 
hopefully that will allow the exhaust to
hang<00:01:46.909> down<00:01:46.940> enough<00:01:47.509> where<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.229> get<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.470> the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
hang down enough where I can get to the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.399 
hang down enough where I can get to the
starter<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:50.180> does<00:01:50.390> appear<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:51.049> you<00:01:51.170> can<00:01:51.289> get

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
starter it does appear that you can get

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.160 
starter it does appear that you can get
it<00:01:51.530> out<00:01:51.680> but<00:01:52.100> honestly<00:01:52.850> there<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.750> no<00:01:53.930> room

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
it out but honestly there is no room

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.710 
it out but honestly there is no room
here

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.590 

so<00:01:57.260> we're<00:01:57.380> going<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.620> give<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.040> try<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:59.060> as

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
so we're going to give this a try so as

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.590 
so we're going to give this a try so as
I<00:02:00.310> assumed<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.820> do<00:02:02.000> need<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.270> drop<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
I assumed you do need to drop the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.080 
I assumed you do need to drop the
exhaust<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.410> here's<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.340> video<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.850> need<00:02:05.000> to

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
exhaust so here's the video you need to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.220 
exhaust so here's the video you need to
drop<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.330> from<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.690> front

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
drop it from the front

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:14.670 
drop it from the front
middle<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.370> rear

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.930 

so<00:02:15.250> now<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.790> access<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.540> starter

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
so now I have access to the starter

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.180 
so now I have access to the starter
I've<00:02:19.300> dropped<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.780> from<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.200> exhaust<00:02:20.770> flange

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
I've dropped it from the exhaust flange

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:30.780 
I've dropped it from the exhaust flange
here<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.710> other<00:02:23.800> side<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.800 

hanger<00:02:31.629> Springs<00:02:32.129> right<00:02:33.129> by<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.400> h-pipe

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
hanger Springs right by the h-pipe

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.400 
hanger Springs right by the h-pipe
and<00:02:36.319> from<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> rear<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.490> car<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:38.720> both

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.130 
and from the rear of the car on both
sides<00:02:40.270> this<00:02:41.270> has<00:02:41.450> gained<00:02:41.690> me<00:02:41.840> access<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:44.140> the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
sides this has gained me access to the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.960 
sides this has gained me access to the
complete<00:02:45.410> starter<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.400> should<00:02:46.670> have<00:02:46.819> no

complete starter and I should have no
more<00:02:47.150> problems<00:02:47.330> getting<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.990> out

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
more problems getting it out

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
alright as as I've already said you need

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.840 
alright as as I've already said you need
to<00:03:06.090> lower<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.210> exhaust<00:03:07.330> all<00:03:08.230> away<00:03:08.800> from<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
to lower the exhaust all away from the

front<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.410> back<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.180 

transmission<00:03:17.870> cooler<00:03:18.200> line<00:03:20.890> there's<00:03:21.890> this

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
transmission cooler line there's this

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.640 
transmission cooler line there's this
bracket<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:24.680> mounts<00:03:25.130> behind<00:03:25.520> it<00:03:25.730> oh<00:03:26.650> how

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
bracket that mounts behind it oh how

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.410 
bracket that mounts behind it oh how
well<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:27.980> can<00:03:28.099> see<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.580> but<00:03:28.910> there's<00:03:29.120> two

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
well you can see this but there's two

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.170 
well you can see this but there's two
ten<00:03:29.690> millimeter<00:03:30.170> bolts<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:31.760> hold<00:03:32.000> this

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
ten millimeter bolts that hold this

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.010 
ten millimeter bolts that hold this
bracket<00:03:32.780> right<00:03:33.650> here<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.120> side<00:03:35.780> of<00:03:35.959> the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
bracket right here to the side of the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.860 
bracket right here to the side of the
engine<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.880> starter<00:03:38.239> will<00:03:38.360> not<00:03:38.540> come<00:03:38.720> out

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
engine the starter will not come out

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.729 
engine the starter will not come out
without<00:03:39.170> removing<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.010> plastic<00:03:43.510> now<00:03:44.739> after

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
without removing this plastic now after

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.399 
without removing this plastic now after
that's<00:03:45.890> out<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.519> starter<00:03:47.410> will<00:03:48.410> have<00:03:48.590> to

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
that's out the starter will have to

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.629 
that's out the starter will have to
go<00:03:50.950> back<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.870> up<00:03:52.870> above<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.709> exhaust<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.579> you

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
go back and up above the exhaust so you

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.360 
go back and up above the exhaust so you
can<00:03:54.790> start<00:03:55.030> getting<00:03:55.239> some<00:03:55.629> of<00:03:55.689> these<00:03:56.370> starter

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
can start getting some of these starter

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.500 
can start getting some of these starter
wires<00:03:57.579> off<00:03:57.879> it

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.449 

and<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:01.950> very<00:04:02.280> time-consuming<00:04:04.310> first<00:04:05.310> time

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
and it is very time-consuming first time

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.369 
and it is very time-consuming first time
I've<00:04:05.580> done<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.390> particular<00:04:06.750> model

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
I've done this on this particular model

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.640 
I've done this on this particular model
but<00:04:08.390> it's<00:04:09.390> not<00:04:09.659> as<00:04:09.870> difficult<00:04:10.080> as<00:04:10.470> I'd

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
but it's not as difficult as I'd

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.020 
but it's not as difficult as I'd
imagined<00:04:12.980> something<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.220> may<00:04:14.370> think<00:04:14.730> about

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
imagined something you may think about

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.599 
imagined something you may think about
if<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.780> are<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.560> process<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:17.220> doing<00:04:17.400> this

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
if you are in the process of doing this

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.740 
if you are in the process of doing this
maybe<00:04:20.609> replacing<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.479> o2<00:04:21.750> sensors<00:04:23.600> we're<00:04:24.600> not

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
maybe replacing the o2 sensors we're not

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.850 
maybe replacing the o2 sensors we're not
going<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.930> do<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.229> on<00:04:25.350> this<00:04:25.440> car<00:04:25.770> because

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
going to do that on this car because

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.909 
going to do that on this car because
it's<00:04:26.630> that's<00:04:27.630> not<00:04:28.110> something<00:04:28.440> he's<00:04:28.560> concerned

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
it's that's not something he's concerned

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:37.939 
it's that's not something he's concerned
with<00:04:29.419> also<00:04:31.160> right<00:04:32.160> here<00:04:33.169> is<00:04:34.760> your<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:36.949> believe

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
with also right here is your I believe

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.080 
with also right here is your I believe
your<00:04:38.280> crankshaft<00:04:38.820> position<00:04:39.270> sensor<00:04:40.039> now<00:04:41.090> it's

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
your crankshaft position sensor now it's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.570 
your crankshaft position sensor now it's
not<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.900> expensive<00:04:43.139> apart<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.160> while

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
not that expensive apart and while

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.890 
not that expensive apart and while
you're<00:04:44.789> here<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.090> may<00:04:45.210> as<00:04:45.240> well<00:04:45.389> change<00:04:45.720> out

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
you're here you may as well change out

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.260 
you're here you may as well change out
as<00:04:46.020> well<00:04:46.229> because<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:47.039> get<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.610> you're

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
as well because to get to that you're

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.150 
as well because to get to that you're
going<00:04:48.449> to<00:04:48.510> have<00:04:48.600> to<00:04:48.720> do<00:04:48.840> all<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.289> over<00:04:49.500> again

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
going to have to do all this over again

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.430 
going to have to do all this over again

might<00:04:58.169> not<00:04:58.199> be<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.620> bad<00:04:58.800> idea<00:04:58.860> especially<00:04:59.280> if

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
might not be a bad idea especially if
