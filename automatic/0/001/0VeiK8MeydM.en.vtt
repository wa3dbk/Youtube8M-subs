00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.940
 In some cities on the Lower Rhine this morning the sirens cried the 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.410
 Fire brigades in Dusseldorf Krefeld and Dormagen have a trial alarm 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.769
 carried out 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.509
 In Düsseldorf alone, 43 new warning systems have been installed in recent years 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.439
 installed after the early sixties, the old sirens leads 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.439
 had been declared redundant and dismantled 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.369
 and at 11 o'clock they start the alarm sirens over the city 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.349
 the titles remained a few passers-by but no trace of excitement 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.400
 in contrast, the telephones are in the control center of the Düsseldorf fire department 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.700
 not resting now 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.620
 the emergency call of the fire brigade Dusseldorf 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.610
 for a laying 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.660
 we alone have 80 emergency calls and must register 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.720
 Percent of the population was in transition and elsewhere, and why and why 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.120
 wanted to know what's going on 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.710
 and of course that's supposed to happen on a throne did not happen to it 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.190
 is not enough for an emergency 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.780
 although we had informed the media in advance, despite being turned 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.320
 the quotes on these emergency call lines 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 then blocked the emergency call for transsexuals 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.340
 therefore, these assumptions are not just about the engineering disciplines 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.050
 to control 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.990
 First and foremost, the citizens should learn to react properly 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 know that even from earlier wartime the citizen action percent 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.680
 They do not know because you really have to go for that but it's hard 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.780
 so long way but I am grossly exaggerated 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.690
 a leaflet for the citizens should help 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.940
 here everything is explained exactly one look is enough and then you have it 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.870
 actually the constant tone is the all-clear only up and down the siren 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.620
 means danger and that means 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.500
 a man named Noah Glass will be opening up some building 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.140
 and steered through the left ass that is pure luck let the radio 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.720
 switch on taken off 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.170
 really good care of you close doors and windows turn on the radio WDR 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.230
 2 and iPhone can 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.540
 in no case the emergency call of police or fire department
