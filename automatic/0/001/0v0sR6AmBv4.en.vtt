gonna be so since we're gonna make this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
gonna be so since we're gonna make this
goal<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.880> excuse<00:01:06.299> me<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.049> called

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
goal or excuse me this out was it called

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.929 
goal or excuse me this out was it called
the<00:01:07.260> target<00:01:07.680> ball<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> Bucky<00:01:08.340> face<00:01:08.670> whatever

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the target ball the Bucky face whatever

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.179 
the target ball the Bucky face whatever
let's<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.750> ahead<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.049> load<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.260> Bucky<00:01:10.979> ball

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
let's go ahead and load that Bucky ball

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.600 
let's go ahead and load that Bucky ball
in<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.520> can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
in first and now we can just what we can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.480 
in first and now we can just what we can
edit<00:01:14.790> everything<00:01:15.150> from<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> guess<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
edit everything from here I guess so the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
edit everything from here I guess so the
first<00:01:17.729> thing<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.210> wanted<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.689> actually

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
first thing I wanted to do actually

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
first thing I wanted to do actually
probably<00:01:19.619> easier<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.670> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
probably easier if I just do that so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.539 
probably easier if I just do that so
close<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.040> first<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.460> I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
close out of that and the first thing I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.249 
close out of that and the first thing I
want<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.090> change<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.840> settings

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
want to do is change the settings

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.399 
want to do is change the settings
because<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:26.479> if<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.630> play<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
because right now if we just play it it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.929 
because right now if we just play it it
looks<00:01:28.650> kind<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> weird<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.729> default

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
looks kind of weird this is the default

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.870 
looks kind of weird this is the default
settings<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.670> thing

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
settings it just is like that one thing

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
settings it just is like that one thing
shakin<00:01:33.329> around<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> looks<00:01:35.400> like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
shakin around like it kind of looks like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.600 
shakin around like it kind of looks like
a<00:01:35.549> spray<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> first<00:01:38.159> thing<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.369> wanted<00:01:38.549> to

the regular properties set this to 360
so<00:01:51.090> now<00:01:51.270> whenever<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.780> hit<00:01:51.930> Enter

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so now whenever you hit Enter

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.280 
so now whenever you hit Enter
it<00:01:52.890> doesn't<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.909> spray<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.079> one

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it doesn't just spray in that one

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.600 
it doesn't just spray in that one
direction<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:56.070> spraying<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
direction like you're spraying with a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.819 
direction like you're spraying with a
Windex<00:01:57.030> bottle<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.869> actually<00:01:58.290> I'll<00:01:58.619> show<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
Windex bottle it actually I'll show you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.530 
Windex bottle it actually I'll show you
guys<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.130> these<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.460> one<00:01:59.670> by<00:01:59.790> one<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
guys what these do one by one it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
guys what these do one by one it
actually<00:02:00.930> sprays<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.619> every<00:02:01.950> direction<00:02:02.189> kind

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
actually sprays in every direction kind

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.289 
actually sprays in every direction kind
of<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.509> an<00:02:03.719> explosion<00:02:04.759> now<00:02:05.759> after<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
of more like an explosion now after this

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.529 
of more like an explosion now after this
what<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.229> set<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> speed<00:02:08.550> equal

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
what you can do is set the speed equal

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.690 
what you can do is set the speed equal
to<00:02:10.220> 100<00:02:11.220> actually<00:02:11.670> not

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
to 100 actually not

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.730 
to 100 actually not
b-day<00:02:13.700> with<00:02:13.880> 200<00:02:14.420> words<00:02:14.840> right<00:02:15.230> here<00:02:15.260> speeder

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
b-day with 200 words right here speeder

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.850 
b-day with 200 words right here speeder
and<00:02:15.800> miser<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.850> got<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> 100<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.840> what<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.710> is

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
and miser you got a 100 and what this is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.230 
and miser you got a 100 and what this is
gonna<00:02:18.980> do<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.460> it's<00:02:19.490> gonna<00:02:19.730> make<00:02:20.030> your

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
gonna do is it's gonna make your

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.440 
gonna do is it's gonna make your
particles<00:02:20.990> more<00:02:21.350> random<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.270> good

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
particles more random and this is good

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.090 
particles more random and this is good
because<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:24.230> don't<00:02:24.260> want<00:02:24.590> all<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.830> your

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
because you don't want all of your

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.860 
because you don't want all of your
particles<00:02:25.610> coming<00:02:25.850> out<00:02:25.970> at<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.270> exact<00:02:26.660> same

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
particles coming out at the exact same

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.780 
particles coming out at the exact same
velocity<00:02:27.200> or<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.740> gonna<00:02:27.920> look<00:02:28.130> kind<00:02:28.730> of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
velocity or it's gonna look kind of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.120 
velocity or it's gonna look kind of
weird<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.870> let's<00:02:30.320> go<00:02:30.440> ahead<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.680> change<00:02:31.070> that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
weird so let's go ahead and change that

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.550 
weird so let's go ahead and change that
speed<00:02:31.460> randomizer<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.930> last<00:02:33.230> thing<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
speed randomizer and the last thing I

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.100 
speed randomizer and the last thing I
want<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.890> do<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.730> right<00:02:35.720> now<00:02:35.870> whenever

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
want to do is this right now whenever

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.280 
want to do is this right now whenever
you<00:02:36.350> play<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:37.330> okay<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.840> kind<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.110> looks

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
you play it okay so it kind of looks

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.760 
you play it okay so it kind of looks
like<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.470> constant<00:02:40.220> stream<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.700> like<00:02:41.570> not<00:02:42.560> an

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
like a constant stream of like not an

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.530 
like a constant stream of like not an
explosion<00:02:43.190> just<00:02:43.220> like<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.520> constant<00:02:44.060> stream<00:02:44.360> of

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
explosion just like a constant stream of

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.490 
explosion just like a constant stream of
crap<00:02:44.930> being<00:02:46.030> sprayed<00:02:47.030> at<00:02:47.300> ya<00:02:47.480> or<00:02:47.630> something<00:02:47.990> so

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
crap being sprayed at ya or something so

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.060 
crap being sprayed at ya or something so
we<00:02:48.800> want<00:02:49.040> one<00:02:49.180> blast<00:02:50.180> one<00:02:50.660> explosion<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.920> how

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
we want one blast one explosion so how

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.510 
we want one blast one explosion so how
do<00:02:52.130> we<00:02:52.190> do<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.580> well<00:02:53.360> if<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.570> go<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.900> type<00:02:54.740> let

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
do we do that well if we go to type let

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.520 
do we do that well if we go to type let
me<00:02:55.640> try<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.850> find<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.320> type<00:02:57.320> right<00:02:57.500> here

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
me try to find it type right here

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
me try to find it type right here
continuous<00:02:58.280> spray<00:02:58.490> go<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.360> one<00:03:00.140> shot<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.250> now

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
continuous spray go to one shot and now

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.220 
continuous spray go to one shot and now
I<00:03:01.580> never<00:03:01.850> do<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.210> it's<00:03:02.390> gonna<00:03:02.510> just<00:03:02.810> blow<00:03:02.990> up

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
I never do that it's gonna just blow up

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.010 
I never do that it's gonna just blow up
one<00:03:03.650> time<00:03:04.270> how<00:03:05.270> awesome<00:03:05.570> is<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:06.820> refresh<00:03:08.020> so

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
one time how awesome is that refresh so

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.200 
one time how awesome is that refresh so
that<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.560> pretty<00:03:10.010> much<00:03:10.190> exactly<00:03:10.370> what<00:03:10.850> we<00:03:10.970> want

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
that is pretty much exactly what we want

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.580 
that is pretty much exactly what we want
one<00:03:11.630> big<00:03:12.230> burst<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:14.420> now<00:03:14.960> that<00:03:15.020> we<00:03:15.350> got<00:03:15.530> our

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
one big burst so now that we got our

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.100 
one big burst so now that we got our
explosion<00:03:16.400> taken<00:03:17.150> care<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.390> when<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.900> learn

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
explosion taken care of when you learn

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.860 
explosion taken care of when you learn
how<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.290> make<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.530> cool<00:03:18.890> explosion<00:03:19.459> effect<00:03:19.970> what

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
how to make a cool explosion effect what

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.960 
how to make a cool explosion effect what
we<00:03:21.110> need<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.380> do<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.830> add<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.310> logic<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.730> say

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
we need to do is add the logic to say

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.320 
we need to do is add the logic to say
okay<00:03:23.300> add<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:24.380> effect<00:03:24.880> whenever<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.120> ball

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
okay add this effect whenever the ball

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.900 
okay add this effect whenever the ball
or<00:03:26.690> whenever<00:03:27.590> we<00:03:28.010> reach<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.459> goal<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.880> ball

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
or whenever we reach the goal the ball

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.020 
or whenever we reach the goal the ball
is<00:03:29.300> destroyed<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.560> head<00:03:30.860> over<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.490> your<00:03:31.640> event

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
is destroyed so head over to your event

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.480 
is destroyed so head over to your event
sheet<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.650> first<00:03:33.890> thing<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.100> want<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.340> do

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
sheet and the first thing you want to do

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.880 
sheet and the first thing you want to do
is<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.030> want<00:03:35.270> to<00:03:35.420> add<00:03:35.630> another<00:03:36.170> action<00:03:36.650> for

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
is you want to add another action for

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.460 
is you want to add another action for
the<00:03:37.010> on<00:03:37.160> collision<00:03:38.120> with<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.450> ground<00:03:38.720> because

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
the on collision with the ground because

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.140 
the on collision with the ground because
we<00:03:39.500> already<00:03:39.800> got<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.370> two<00:03:40.610> events<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.060> we

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
we already got the two events that we

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.230 
we already got the two events that we
need<00:03:42.250> these<00:03:43.250> are<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.580> two<00:03:43.730> events<00:03:44.060> basically

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
need these are the two events basically

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.600 
need these are the two events basically
whenever<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.990> balls<00:03:45.170> are<00:03:45.350> destroyed<00:03:45.800> so<00:03:46.430> add

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
whenever the balls are destroyed so add

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.230 
whenever the balls are destroyed so add
action<00:03:47.120> right<00:03:47.660> here<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:49.700> action<00:03:50.090> of

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
action right here and the action of

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.510 
action right here and the action of
course<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.780> going<00:03:50.990> to<00:03:51.140> be<00:03:51.260> what<00:03:52.250> we're<00:03:52.400> gonna

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
course is going to be what we're gonna

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.280 
course is going to be what we're gonna
do<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:53.030> actually<00:03:53.300> spawn<00:03:53.930> another<00:03:54.470> object<00:03:54.830> so

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
do is actually spawn another object so

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.220 
do is actually spawn another object so
hit<00:03:57.290> target<00:03:57.709> ball<00:04:00.130> spawn<00:04:01.130> another<00:04:01.370> object<00:04:01.640> and

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
hit target ball spawn another object and

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.020 
hit target ball spawn another object and
the<00:04:03.230> object<00:04:03.260> is<00:04:03.920> oh<00:04:05.050> let<00:04:06.050> me<00:04:06.110> do<00:04:06.230> this<00:04:06.410> first

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the object is oh let me do this first

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.820 
the object is oh let me do this first
this<00:04:08.030> might<00:04:08.300> be<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.420> little<00:04:08.780> easier<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.410> see

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
this might be a little easier to see

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.350 
this might be a little easier to see
take<00:04:10.700> this<00:04:10.850> particle<00:04:11.420> effect<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.110> name<00:04:12.230> it

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
take this particle effect and name it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.650 
take this particle effect and name it
explosion<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:15.110> basically<00:04:16.239> now<00:04:17.239> we<00:04:17.299> can<00:04:17.540> go

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
explosion so basically now we can go

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.430 
explosion so basically now we can go
ahead<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:17.959> add<00:04:18.410> another<00:04:18.530> object<00:04:18.859> target<00:04:19.580> ball

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
ahead and add another object target ball

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.000 
ahead and add another object target ball
spawn<00:04:21.440> another<00:04:22.430> object<00:04:23.169> that<00:04:24.169> explosion

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
spawn another object that explosion

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.960 
spawn another object that explosion
right<00:04:25.220> here

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
right here

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.340 
right here
they<00:04:26.210> kind<00:04:26.420> of<00:04:26.450> look<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.630> same<00:04:26.720> before<00:04:27.140> so

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
they kind of look the same before so

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.050 
they kind of look the same before so
that's<00:04:27.440> why<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:27.650> had<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:27.890> name<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.490> of

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
that's why I had to name it and of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.490 
that's why I had to name it and of
course<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.540> layer<00:04:29.720> that<00:04:29.960> we<00:04:30.020> want<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.440> to

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
course the layer that we want this to

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.680 
course the layer that we want this to
appear<00:04:30.890> on<00:04:31.070> is<00:04:31.310> one<00:04:31.700> because<00:04:32.300> that's<00:04:32.510> where

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
appear on is one because that's where

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.870 
appear on is one because that's where
all<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.900> cool<00:04:33.050> stuff<00:04:33.260> is<00:04:33.500> an<00:04:33.710> image<00:04:34.580> point

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
all the cool stuff is an image point

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.000 
all the cool stuff is an image point
zero<00:04:35.270> pretty<00:04:35.690> much<00:04:35.840> means<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.320> originates<00:04:36.800> for

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
zero pretty much means it originates for

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.570 
zero pretty much means it originates for
the<00:04:37.100> center<00:04:37.460> just<00:04:37.940> like<00:04:38.060> before<00:04:39.160> so<00:04:40.160> basically

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
the center just like before so basically

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.190 
the center just like before so basically
now<00:04:40.940> when<00:04:41.210> this<00:04:41.330> ball<00:04:41.570> collides<00:04:41.870> with<00:04:42.050> the

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
now when this ball collides with the

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.440 
now when this ball collides with the
ground<00:04:42.470> destroy<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.310> original<00:04:43.400> ball<00:04:43.940> make<00:04:44.420> it

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
ground destroy the original ball make it

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.160 
ground destroy the original ball make it
disappear<00:04:44.990> and<00:04:45.170> add<00:04:45.920> your<00:04:46.070> explosion<00:04:46.790> and

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
disappear and add your explosion and

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.270 
disappear and add your explosion and
also<00:04:48.170> the<00:04:48.290> same<00:04:48.500> for<00:04:48.530> this<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:49.130> target<00:04:49.670> ball

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
also the same for this so target ball

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.640 
also the same for this so target ball
spawned<00:04:52.280> another<00:04:52.520> object<00:04:52.790> and<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:54.620> object

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
spawned another object and the object

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
spawned another object and the object
for<00:04:55.160> this<00:04:55.250> is<00:04:55.520> also<00:04:56.000> explosion<00:04:56.720> on<00:04:56.990> layer<00:04:57.290> one

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
for this is also explosion on layer one

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.740 
for this is also explosion on layer one
so<00:04:58.670> now<00:04:58.850> whenever<00:04:59.150> we<00:04:59.270> hit<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.600> with<00:04:59.690> a

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
so now whenever we hit it with a

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.960 
so now whenever we hit it with a
meatball<00:05:00.020> or<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:00.980> collides<00:05:01.670> with<00:05:01.790> the

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
meatball or this collides with the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.080 
meatball or this collides with the
ground<00:05:02.860> we<00:05:03.860> can<00:05:03.980> go<00:05:04.100> ahead<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.610> make<00:05:05.030> it

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
ground we can go ahead and make it

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.710 
ground we can go ahead and make it
explode<00:05:05.510> and<00:05:06.290> we<00:05:06.890> can<00:05:07.010> get<00:05:07.160> this<00:05:07.340> out<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:08.510> the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
explode and we can get this out of the

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.120 
explode and we can get this out of the
way<00:05:08.870> for<00:05:08.930> right<00:05:09.230> now<00:05:09.320> we<00:05:09.620> might<00:05:09.770> have<00:05:09.920> to<00:05:10.010> edit

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
way for right now we might have to edit

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.010 
way for right now we might have to edit
that<00:05:10.280> later<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:10.910> it<00:05:11.060> will<00:05:11.240> we'll<00:05:11.630> just<00:05:11.780> keep<00:05:11.900> it

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
that later so it will we'll just keep it

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.930 
that later so it will we'll just keep it
off-screen<00:05:15.130> so<00:05:16.130> now<00:05:16.280> let<00:05:16.490> me<00:05:16.550> go<00:05:16.670> ahead<00:05:16.790> and

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
off-screen so now let me go ahead and

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.780 
off-screen so now let me go ahead and
just<00:05:17.300> fire<00:05:17.600> your<00:05:17.780> meatball<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:19.580> time

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
just fire your meatball and that time

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.270 
just fire your meatball and that time
the<00:05:19.910> meatball<00:05:20.270> hit<00:05:20.450> it<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.990> now<00:05:21.830> let<00:05:22.070> me<00:05:22.130> go

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
the meatball hit it and now let me go

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.970 
the meatball hit it and now let me go
ahead<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.700> have<00:05:23.540> it<00:05:23.630> hit<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.870> ground<00:05:24.080> you

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
ahead and have it hit the ground you

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.550 
ahead and have it hit the ground you
check<00:05:25.220> it<00:05:25.340> out<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:26.120> again<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.840> looks<00:05:27.110> really

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
check it out so again it looks really

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.350 
check it out so again it looks really
cool<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:27.919> actually<00:05:28.669> what<00:05:28.910> I<00:05:28.940> would<00:05:29.120> probably

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
cool and actually what I would probably

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.409 
cool and actually what I would probably
do<00:05:29.720> is<00:05:30.130> I<00:05:31.130> don't<00:05:31.520> really<00:05:31.700> like<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.150> that<00:05:32.390> a

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
do is I don't really like it that a

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.300 
do is I don't really like it that a
bunch<00:05:32.720> of<00:05:32.870> little<00:05:33.380> balls<00:05:33.680> so<00:05:34.070> I<00:05:34.100> would

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
bunch of little balls so I would

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.020 
bunch of little balls so I would
probably<00:05:34.490> um<00:05:34.820> make<00:05:35.720> this<00:05:35.870> new<00:05:36.230> explosion<00:05:37.220> use

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
probably um make this new explosion use

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.760 
probably um make this new explosion use
like<00:05:38.180> a<00:05:38.210> fire<00:05:38.630> image<00:05:39.080> or<00:05:39.230> something<00:05:39.590> like<00:05:39.710> that

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
like a fire image or something like that

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.010 
like a fire image or something like that
but<00:05:40.400> that<00:05:40.460> was<00:05:40.730> pretty<00:05:40.880> cool<00:05:41.120> for<00:05:41.360> now<00:05:41.390> I<00:05:41.690> just

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
but that was pretty cool for now I just

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.659 
but that was pretty cool for now I just
want<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.440> teach<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.650> guys<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:42.830> basics<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.520> how

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
want to teach you guys the basics of how

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.620 
want to teach you guys the basics of how
to<00:05:43.700> add<00:05:43.940> particles<00:05:44.419> and<00:05:45.070> also<00:05:46.070> um<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:47.510> know

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
to add particles and also um you know

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.110 
to add particles and also um you know
like<00:05:47.870> how<00:05:48.020> to<00:05:48.080> add<00:05:48.229> cool<00:05:48.500> effects<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.160> spawn

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
like how to add cool effects and spawn

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.020 
like how to add cool effects and spawn
another<00:05:50.510> image<00:05:50.990> or<00:05:51.200> a<00:05:51.260> particle<00:05:52.250> effect<00:05:52.490> right

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
another image or a particle effect right

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.820 
another image or a particle effect right
from<00:05:53.300> there<00:05:53.479> whenever<00:05:53.930> you're<00:05:54.080> destroyed<00:05:54.350> I'm

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
from there whenever you're destroyed I'm
