comfortable it's less crunchy to wear
but<00:02:59.430> what<00:02:59.549> they've<00:02:59.670> done<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.909> that<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.090> impact

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
but what they've done is that the impact

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.599 
but what they've done is that the impact
panels<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:00.930> reinforce<00:03:01.560> them<00:03:01.829> with<00:03:02.190> aramid

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
panels they reinforce them with aramid

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.970 
panels they reinforce them with aramid
which<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:02.940> kevlar<00:03:03.480> derivative<00:03:03.989> fiber<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:04.769> on

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
which is a kevlar derivative fiber so on

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.379 
which is a kevlar derivative fiber so on
any<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.430> impact<00:03:05.760> areas<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.090> don't<00:03:06.180> see<00:03:06.329> it

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
any of the impact areas you don't see it

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.430 
any of the impact areas you don't see it
on<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.510> outside<00:03:06.599> but<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.139> see<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.319> on<00:03:07.349> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
on the outside but you see it on the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.530 
on the outside but you see it on the
inside<00:03:07.829> between<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.579> jacket<00:03:09.030> shell<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
inside between the jacket shell and the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.809 
inside between the jacket shell and the
armor<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.989> going<00:03:10.139> to<00:03:10.290> be<00:03:10.470> an<00:03:10.620> era<00:03:11.129> mid<00:03:11.430> panel

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
armor is going to be an era mid panel

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.399 
armor is going to be an era mid panel
for<00:03:12.030> impact<00:03:12.420> resistance<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.079> like<00:03:13.260> that

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
for impact resistance and I like that

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.539 
for impact resistance and I like that
they've<00:03:13.530> done<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.829> it's<00:03:14.220> something<00:03:14.400> we

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
they've done that it's something we

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.830 
they've done that it's something we
haven't<00:03:14.670> seen<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.849> lot<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.090> manufacturers<00:03:15.690> do

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
haven't seen a lot of manufacturers do

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.449 
haven't seen a lot of manufacturers do
but<00:03:16.109> it<00:03:16.200> adds<00:03:16.319> kind<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:16.799> style<00:03:17.129> in<00:03:17.310> line

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
but it adds kind of this style in line

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.949 
but it adds kind of this style in line
of<00:03:17.639> it<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.849> also<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.510> fact<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.780> they've

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
of it I also like the fact that they've

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.949 
of it I also like the fact that they've
completely<00:03:19.319> refined<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:19.949> jacket<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.970> 2013

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
completely refined this jacket for 2013

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.119 
completely refined this jacket for 2013
they<00:03:22.079> got<00:03:22.230> rid<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> pit<00:03:22.739> zips<00:03:22.980> they

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
they got rid of the pit zips they

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.470 
they got rid of the pit zips they
dropped<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.579> internal<00:03:23.940> liners<00:03:24.209> they<00:03:24.329> beam

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
dropped the internal liners they beam

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.939 
dropped the internal liners they beam
over<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:24.720> outer<00:03:24.840> shell<00:03:25.049> but<00:03:25.230> again<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.680> style

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
over the outer shell but again the style

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.170 
over the outer shell but again the style
of<00:03:26.069> it<00:03:26.160> we<00:03:26.280> haven't<00:03:26.430> seen<00:03:26.609> first<00:03:26.879> gear<00:03:27.030> do

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
of it we haven't seen first gear do

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.970 
of it we haven't seen first gear do
really<00:03:27.449> a<00:03:27.480> silver<00:03:27.870> black<00:03:28.079> option<00:03:28.379> and<00:03:28.650> it's

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
really a silver black option and it's

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.860 
really a silver black option and it's
nice<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.220> see<00:03:29.579> this<00:03:29.760> now<00:03:30.180> thinking<00:03:30.690> through

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
nice to see this now thinking through

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.930 
nice to see this now thinking through
the<00:03:30.959> first<00:03:31.199> gear<00:03:31.379> line<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:32.280> know<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.730> have

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
the first gear line you know you have

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.819 
the first gear line you know you have
that<00:03:33.150> Katmandu<00:03:33.810> jacket<00:03:34.199> which<00:03:34.319> is<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.590> baby

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
that Katmandu jacket which is the baby

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.710 
that Katmandu jacket which is the baby
brother<00:03:35.129> to<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.459> guy<00:03:35.639> it's<00:03:36.090> not<00:03:36.180> going<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.629> be

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
brother to this guy it's not going to be

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.720 
brother to this guy it's not going to be
using<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.199> waterproof<00:03:37.620> liner<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:38.160> has<00:03:38.340> this

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
using the waterproof liner this has this

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.670 
using the waterproof liner this has this
has<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.120> Kona<00:03:39.540> waterproof<00:03:40.109> breathable<00:03:40.230> liner

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
has the Kona waterproof breathable liner

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.319 
has the Kona waterproof breathable liner
so<00:03:41.099> it's<00:03:41.310> going<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.519> be<00:03:41.579> waterproof<00:03:42.120> it's

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
so it's going to be waterproof it's

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.939 
so it's going to be waterproof it's
bonded<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.780> outer<00:03:42.900> shell<00:03:43.169> and<00:03:43.379> it's<00:03:43.620> actually

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
bonded the outer shell and it's actually

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.800 
bonded the outer shell and it's actually
heat<00:03:44.190> activated<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.120> claim<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.359> cacoa

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
heat activated the claim that cacoa

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.659 
heat activated the claim that cacoa
makes<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.440> your<00:03:46.590> body<00:03:46.829> heat<00:03:47.160> actively

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
makes is that your body heat actively

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.849 
makes is that your body heat actively
speeds<00:03:48.540> up<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> transfer<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.500> moisture

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
speeds up the transfer of the moisture

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.199 
speeds up the transfer of the moisture
away<00:03:49.980> from<00:03:50.129> your<00:03:50.340> body<00:03:50.459> out<00:03:50.819> through<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
it gore-tex is still the gold standard

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.140 
it gore-tex is still the gold standard

for waterproof breathability and comfort

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.259 
for waterproof breathability and comfort
but<00:03:58.109> again<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:59.099> other<00:03:59.430> manufacturers<00:04:00.000> are

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
but again the other manufacturers are

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.490 
but again the other manufacturers are
doing<00:04:00.329> these<00:04:00.599> waterproof<00:04:00.840> reader<00:04:01.199> memories

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
doing these waterproof reader memories

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.990 
doing these waterproof reader memories
are<00:04:01.650> getting<00:04:01.949> better<00:04:02.099> over<00:04:02.340> time<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.849> their

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
are getting better over time and their

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.610 
are getting better over time and their
shells<00:04:03.239> are<00:04:03.359> becoming<00:04:03.659> more<00:04:03.900> technical<00:04:04.349> so

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
shells are becoming more technical so

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.479 
shells are becoming more technical so
again<00:04:04.799> you're<00:04:04.949> getting<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.220> full
