00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.139
 I'll show you the htc explorer today 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 plus stands for a stronger processor 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.270
 a better against and a stronger one 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.640
 Battery as with the predecessor model HTC 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.429
 onex the htc evo ix plus has as well 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.009
 android 4.1 serbia installed and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.719
 comes with the manufacturer 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 user interface sense 4+ as well 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.530
 a new user interface than with the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 predecessor model and the innovations of the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.739
 software i will show you in now 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.510
 this video 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.300
 Now we have both devices again 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 in front of us are the white htc evo 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 ix with the android version 4.0 point 4 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.809
 ice cream sandwich and the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.090
 user interface sense 4.1 and us 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.570
 have the black red htc evo 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.730
 ix plus with the new android version 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:07.680
 4.1.1 jelly bean and the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.740
 user interface htc sense 4+ what as 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.740
 the first thing to keep in mind is htc sense 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.540
 4+ that the user interface crispier 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.780
 the dog is the background 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.390
 uniformly darker what the symbols are 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.490
 a little bit better and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.140
 The icons themselves are also redesigned 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.570
 have been and thus act a bit 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 crisp you can see that especially here 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.770
 in this pdf viewer at the old one 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.740
 version was the edge much thicker 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.329
 here he is smaller and thus becomes one 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.259
 a bit sharper another change 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.619
 is here 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.930
 this button deposited it blue 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 at htc sense 4 plus at the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.210
 predecessor version that was still in green 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.630
 colour 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.970
 Of course these are little things 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 the exciting starts here with this 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.759
 notification bar here i have 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.009
 once access to the same 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.430
 energy saving options I either 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.460
 can activate or deactivate 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.070
 it works that way and where i also individual 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.480
 can just turn elements on or off 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.580
 depending on 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.850
 what i just considered advisable in the today 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.900
 I can notify you as well 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.090
 I also see information on the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.060
 received messages to the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.820
 missed calls facebook messages 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.570
 I get here and get already 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.220
 here via the google assistant my 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.230
 google betting one of the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.940
 updates from android jelly bean and 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.320
 can give your game a whole potential 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.370
 not yet here in Germany 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.900
 I have for example as a sports club 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.760
 go now Paul entered 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.500
 there can meet the news one 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.670
 not because nothing happens but because 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.380
 obviously not here yet 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.700
 works but what in 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.250
 Germany can be used from this 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.290
 are traffic information and im 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.110
 weather data is pretty cold outside 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.830
 I have the same I look for work 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.790
 me already on it 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.220
 otherwise there is also the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.640
 something has been revised 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.150
 at android delling and here with sense 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.520
 4+ here when I open the photo album 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.100
 different folders and not 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.590
 equal to all albums already when I next 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.310
 can come what is actually with 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.730
 my picasa album will open now 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.140
 and here everything I want 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.610
 this can work 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.459
 Of course, for the other application 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.690
 I can also directly in dropbox photos 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.150
 Upload everything you want with the camera 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.630
 record that is then automatically 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.430
 for example, another new function 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:45.320
 is here is the camera and 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.880
 Although I can in self portrait mode 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.590
 do that now so i have one 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.750
 self- timer I think about the 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.980
 Settings here and can set 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.670
 how many seconds that somehow now 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.670
 should run 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.590
 well I suppose 5 and if I then 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.670
 trigger the device with the 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.620
 seconds down and for a smartphone 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.049
 interesting, of course, is also interesting 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.810
 browser jelly bean comes by default 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.940
 now with the chrome browser we 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.169
 see here 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.669
 but no more meat 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.229
 supports the mag for some people 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.300
 Not 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.610
 be a problem but are still 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.320
 people who support themselves in flash 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.040
 your web browser on the smartphone 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.220
 to wish 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.960
 and for HTC now offers on with 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.669
 the sense surface one more 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.510
 Alternatively, I'm over here 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.810
 this will find this symbol 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.680
 and then when I go into the option 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.820
 I see that I am in flash player 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.650
 can activate 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.419
 and of course I find this device 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.410
 the htc of ex also htc own 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.690
 We have installed application here 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.310
 This is once htc best deals 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.320
 Bargain apps we display 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.600
 which discount offers near here 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.240
 are of course only from the 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.169
 We have htc partner companies from htc 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.020
 to transfer media link hd 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.780
 wirelessly from multimedia files like 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.090
 photos or videos on compatible 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.180
 TV sets and finally we have 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.789
 here for example also htc watch the 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.380
 Video service of the manufacturer if we look 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.030
 in comparison to once again in the 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.160
 quick review here, somehow the htc 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.680
 evo ix with android ice cream sandwich 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.080
 we see notification 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.979
 bar the energy saving option are here 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.610
 unavailable 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.250
 the start menu with the green 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.530
 button no great changes 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.050
 otherwise everything is on the big side 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.550
 all kind of similar just missing it 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.910
 one or the other application no 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.289
 big deal i would say android 4.1 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.930
 of course, bees also brings 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.979
 a performance boost overall for 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.070
 the smartphone 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.990
 that's because that 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.640
 google as different measures under 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.740
 the project better griffin has a total of 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.880
 Everything is running smoother and faster 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.970
 you notice that especially when 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.100
 wake up applications from retirement 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.100
 otherwise the device comes in a uni 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.200
 carbonate housing offers no 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.520
 changeable memory card slot here 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.550
 above is a Micro SIM card pure 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.400
 it has a 47 inch lcd two 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.320
 touchscreen with hd resolutions an 8 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.680
 megapixel camera on the back with 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.320
 Great Aperture Beats Audio Support 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.840
 So for this sound technology of the 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.820
 partners and the device comes with 32 or 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.890
 64 GB storage capacity for mobile 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.380
 data transfers support hspa plus 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.510
 but no lte in the vehicle you can 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.640
 say that HTC Evo ix offers more power 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.340
 and a beefed - up user interface 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.930
 the lighter and easier to use 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.580
 makes faster and new android 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.130
 functions such as in the 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.110
 google who virtual assistant 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.580
 the htc evo ix wants to buy 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.320
 but of course much more money 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.990
 as for the htc evo ix 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.970
 the htc evo ix plus is currently being sold 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.860
 630 in german trade 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.780
 there are, however, also here 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.680
 Differences depending on the memory variant 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.680
 of the device and
