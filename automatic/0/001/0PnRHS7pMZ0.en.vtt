curl<00:02:12.819> which<00:02:13.030> I'll<00:02:13.150> do<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.360> little<00:02:13.569> later<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:16.060> I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
curl which I'll do a little later but I

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.789 
curl which I'll do a little later but I
think<00:02:16.390> she<00:02:16.540> did<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:16.810> good<00:02:17.260> job<00:02:22.739> um<00:02:23.739> I

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
think she did a really good job um I

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.830 
think she did a really good job um I
didn't<00:02:24.730> really<00:02:24.849> know<00:02:25.090> what<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.269> tell<00:02:25.569> him<00:02:25.690> as

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
didn't really know what to tell him as

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.690 
didn't really know what to tell him as
far<00:02:26.049> as<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> size<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.829> grade<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.400> just

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
far as the size of the grade so I just

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.699 
far as the size of the grade so I just
said<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.090> too<00:02:28.269> big<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.540> too<00:02:28.810> small<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.590> I

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
said not too big not too small and I

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.470 
said not too big not too small and I
guess<00:02:29.890> they<00:02:30.069> knew<00:02:30.250> without<00:02:30.400> what<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.180> meant

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
guess they knew without what I meant

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.750 
guess they knew without what I meant
because<00:02:31.709> they're<00:02:32.709> not<00:02:32.890> too<00:02:33.130> big<00:02:33.340> not<00:02:33.370> too

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
because they're not too big not too

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.120 
because they're not too big not too
small<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.170> would<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.470> taken<00:02:35.650> me<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> lot

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
small and this would have taken me a lot

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.770 
small and this would have taken me a lot
longer<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:37.000> would<00:02:37.150> have<00:02:37.239> taken<00:02:37.390> me<00:02:37.599> probably

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
longer this would have taken me probably

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.039 
longer this would have taken me probably
a<00:02:38.349> day<00:02:39.040> or<00:02:39.819> more<00:02:39.849> because<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.720> would<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:40.930> my

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
a day or more because it would be my

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.580 
a day or more because it would be my
first<00:02:41.230> time<00:02:41.380> versus<00:02:41.980> two<00:02:42.160> hours<00:02:43.530> for<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
first time versus two hours for the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.259 
first time versus two hours for the
greater<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:45.040> do<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.549> I'm<00:02:45.640> really<00:02:45.880> really

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
greater to do it so I'm really really

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.789 
greater to do it so I'm really really
