00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.930 
mud dobbers
that<00:00:51.510> build<00:00:51.780> mud<00:00:52.079> nests<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.670> tried<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that build mud nests and I just tried to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
that build mud nests and I just tried to
give<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.449> less<00:00:54.660> place<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> build<00:00:55.260> their

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
give them one less place to build their

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.610 
give them one less place to build their
nest<00:00:56.090> let's<00:00:57.090> go<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> attic<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> look<00:00:58.469> at

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
nest let's go into the attic and look at

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
nest let's go into the attic and look at
the<00:00:58.770> wireless<00:00:59.370> repeater<00:01:00.680> okay<00:01:02.059> sorry<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.270> was

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the wireless repeater okay sorry I was

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.670 
the wireless repeater okay sorry I was
just<00:01:03.870> way<00:01:04.110> too<00:01:04.140> close<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:06.439> this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
just way too close for that this is a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.109 
just way too close for that this is a
wireless<00:01:07.950> repeater<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.280> by<00:01:11.460> me<00:01:11.880> put

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
wireless repeater you can see by me put

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.480 
wireless repeater you can see by me put
my<00:01:12.270> hand<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> mean<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.979> actually

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
my hand up there I mean it it's actually

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.770 
my hand up there I mean it it's actually
really<00:01:14.850> small<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.689> 65<00:01:16.500> DB<00:01:17.750> which<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
really small this is a 65 DB which is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.920 
really small this is a 65 DB which is
industry<00:01:19.560> standard<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
industry standard so it really is a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.550 
industry standard so it really is a
pretty<00:01:22.229> good<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.860> works<00:01:23.130> great<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
pretty good one it works great if you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.819 
pretty good one it works great if you
have<00:01:25.740> any<00:01:26.009> signal<00:01:26.460> whatsoever<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:28.020> works

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
have any signal whatsoever this works

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.630 
have any signal whatsoever this works
great<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.390> point<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.810> antenna<00:01:30.960> on

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
great you have to point the antenna on

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.999 
great you have to point the antenna on
the<00:01:32.640> outside<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> building<00:01:33.799> towards<00:01:34.799> your

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the outside of the building towards your

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.980 
the outside of the building towards your
an<00:01:35.189> antenna<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> you're<00:01:36.420> getting<00:01:36.630> self

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
an antenna that you're getting self

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200 
an antenna that you're getting self
service<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.970> where

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
service from so you have to know where

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.620 
service from so you have to know where
that<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that is

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.550 
that is
and<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> lights<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.030> there<00:01:42.560> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and you can see the lights on there the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.389 
and you can see the lights on there the
one<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.130> lit<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.000> green<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:49.159> don't<00:01:50.159> think

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
one that is lit is green I don't think

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.670 
one that is lit is green I don't think
it's<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> focus<00:01:51.290> but<00:01:52.290> that's<00:01:52.500> your

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it's going to focus but that's your

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.289 
it's going to focus but that's your
ghost<00:01:52.920> signal<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.490> got<00:01:53.670> everything<00:01:54.090> right

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
ghost signal you got everything right

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.490 
ghost signal you got everything right
when<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:54.750> lit<00:01:56.270> before<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.509> was<00:01:57.990> getting<00:01:58.170> oh

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
when that's lit before I was getting oh

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
when that's lit before I was getting oh
inside<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> shop<00:02:01.890> building<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.610> I'd<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
inside the shop building and I'd get the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.920 
inside the shop building and I'd get the
tower<00:02:03.659> signals<00:02:04.020> sometimes<00:02:04.530> I'd<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.659> one<00:02:06.659> bar

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
tower signals sometimes I'd get one bar

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.949 
tower signals sometimes I'd get one bar
and<00:02:07.489> basically<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.910> can't<00:02:09.149> talk<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.660> was<00:02:09.780> too

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
and basically you can't talk I was too

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.050 
and basically you can't talk I was too
far<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.379> range

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
far out of range

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.540 
far out of range
I<00:02:11.290> was<00:02:12.610> about<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:14.000> think<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.290> was<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:16.099> don't

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
I was about I think it was it I don't

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.890 
I was about I think it was it I don't
understand<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.209> stuff<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.660> think

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
understand this stuff but I think

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.949 
understand this stuff but I think
there's<00:02:18.050> like<00:02:18.170> -<00:02:18.620> 107<00:02:19.370> or<00:02:19.459> 107<00:02:20.300> DB<00:02:20.690> which

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
there's like - 107 or 107 DB which

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.350 
there's like - 107 or 107 DB which
