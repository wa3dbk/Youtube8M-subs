moved<00:01:57.149> around<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.710> take<00:01:58.920> damage

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
moved around and they can take damage

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.819 
moved around and they can take damage
during<00:02:00.000> activation<00:02:00.509> each<00:02:00.930> register<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
during activation each register is

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.700 
during activation each register is
resolved<00:02:02.310> separately<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.990> player<00:02:04.380> turn

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
resolved separately and the player turn

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.800 
resolved separately and the player turn
order<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.250> determined<00:02:05.729> by<00:02:05.850> priority<00:02:06.509> number

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
order is determined by priority number

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
order is determined by priority number
so<00:02:06.990> each<00:02:07.170> card<00:02:07.619> has<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> priority<00:02:08.700> number<00:02:09.000> in

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
so each card has a priority number in

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.720 
so each card has a priority number in
its<00:02:09.420> upper<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.500> players<00:02:11.220> will<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.550> in

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
its upper right and players will go in

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.970 
its upper right and players will go in
order<00:02:11.910> from<00:02:12.030> highest<00:02:12.360> prey

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
order from highest prey

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.220 
order from highest prey
to<00:02:13.400> lowest<00:02:13.670> priority<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.420> each<00:02:14.540> robot<00:02:14.780> moves

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
to lowest priority so each robot moves

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.930 
to lowest priority so each robot moves
forwards<00:02:15.770> or<00:02:16.010> backwards<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.640> number<00:02:16.849> of

Robo rally that level of randomness in
the<00:04:47.640> game<00:04:47.880> is<00:04:48.030> also<00:04:48.210> really<00:04:48.510> great<00:04:48.660> for

beginner players you can introduce a
player<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.420> this<00:04:51.540> game<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:51.780> they're<00:04:52.050> not

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
player to this game and they're not

player to this game and they're not
going<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.740> be<00:04:52.920> at<00:04:53.160> such<00:04:53.790> an<00:04:53.910> incredible

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
going to be at such an incredible

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.300 
going to be at such an incredible
disadvantage<00:04:55.110> if<00:04:55.740> they're<00:04:55.920> playing<00:04:56.130> with

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
disadvantage if they're playing with

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.770 
disadvantage if they're playing with
more<00:04:56.520> experienced<00:04:57.000> players<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.510> because<00:04:57.690> of

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
more experienced players just because of

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.840 
more experienced players just because of
that<00:04:57.870> randomness<00:04:58.590> it's<00:04:58.800> it's<00:04:59.010> really<00:04:59.550> it

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
that randomness it's it's really it

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.250 
that randomness it's it's really it
makes<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.240> into<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.450> leveling<00:05:00.840> level

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
makes it into a leveling level

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.420 
makes it into a leveling level
playground<00:05:01.650> which<00:05:01.830> is<00:05:01.980> which<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.280> really

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
playground which is which is really

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.900 
playground which is which is really
great<00:05:03.110> really<00:05:04.340> unfortunately<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.400> negative<00:05:05.820> to

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
great really unfortunately a negative to

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.090 
great really unfortunately a negative to
this<00:05:06.000> game<00:05:06.210> though<00:05:06.420> is<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:07.590> fact<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.890> it

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
this game though is the fact that it

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.560 
this game though is the fact that it
really<00:05:08.400> does<00:05:08.550> depend<00:05:08.670> on<00:05:09.060> spatial<00:05:09.300> reasoning

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
really does depend on spatial reasoning

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.440 
really does depend on spatial reasoning
so<00:05:09.990> if<00:05:10.140> you're<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.380> kind<00:05:10.650> of<00:05:10.740> person<00:05:10.800> who's

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
so if you're the kind of person who's

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.020 
so if you're the kind of person who's
finds<00:05:12.450> that<00:05:12.630> challenging<00:05:13.490> moving<00:05:14.490> your<00:05:14.670> robot

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
finds that challenging moving your robot

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.570 
finds that challenging moving your robot
around<00:05:15.420> and<00:05:15.720> picturing<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.200> in<00:05:16.290> your<00:05:16.440> mind<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
around and picturing it in your mind the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.880 
around and picturing it in your mind the
geometry<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.270> it<00:05:18.510> can<00:05:18.870> frustrate<00:05:19.410> some<00:05:19.440> people

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
geometry of it can frustrate some people

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.650 
geometry of it can frustrate some people
and<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:21.000> know<00:05:21.090> there<00:05:21.240> are<00:05:21.360> really<00:05:21.510> some

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
and you know there are really some

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.870 
and you know there are really some
people<00:05:21.900> who<00:05:22.020> find<00:05:22.800> that<00:05:22.920> enough<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.550> turn<00:05:23.730> them

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
people who find that enough to turn them

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.880 
people who find that enough to turn them
off<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.090> game<00:05:24.240> entirely<00:05:24.590> another<00:05:25.590> thing<00:05:25.770> that

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
off the game entirely another thing that

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
Riley is that very randomness that makes

Riley is that very randomness that makes
it<00:05:29.850> such<00:05:30.120> silly<00:05:30.480> fun<00:05:30.780> if<00:05:31.620> you're<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.460> player<00:05:32.820> who

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
it such silly fun if you're a player who

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.630 
it such silly fun if you're a player who
really<00:05:33.600> likes<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:34.020> plan<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.470> strategy<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:35.400> play

it<00:05:43.170> might<00:05:43.350> be<00:05:43.380> a<00:05:43.530> really<00:05:43.770> nice<00:05:44.010> release<00:05:44.460> or<00:05:44.790> a

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
it might be a really nice release or a

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.140 
it might be a really nice release or a
nice<00:05:45.030> difference<00:05:46.280> some<00:05:47.280> of<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:47.490> challenge

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
nice difference some of that challenge

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.870 
nice difference some of that challenge
that<00:05:48.510> comes<00:05:48.870> from<00:05:49.470> both<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.980> randomness<00:05:50.610> and

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
that comes from both the randomness and

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.120 
that comes from both the randomness and
all<00:05:51.660> of<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.170> spatial<00:05:52.500> reasoning<00:05:52.800> that

all of the spatial reasoning that

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.320 
all of the spatial reasoning that
happens<00:05:53.460> doesn't<00:05:53.700> mean<00:05:53.850> that<00:05:53.910> the<00:05:54.030> game<00:05:54.180> can

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
happens doesn't mean that the game can

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.880 
happens doesn't mean that the game can
also<00:05:54.420> drag<00:05:54.870> a<00:05:54.900> little<00:05:55.080> bit<00:05:55.350> with<00:05:55.530> larger

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
also drag a little bit with larger

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.490 
also drag a little bit with larger
groups<00:05:56.160> once<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.240> get<00:05:57.360> up<00:05:57.510> above<00:05:57.870> about<00:05:58.200> 4<00:05:58.470> or

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
groups once you get up above about 4 or

groups once you get up above about 4 or
5<00:05:58.650> players<00:05:59.250> it<00:05:59.700> can<00:05:59.880> take<00:06:00.060> a<00:06:00.090> bunch<00:06:00.360> of<00:06:00.510> time<00:06:00.840> to

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
5 players it can take a bunch of time to

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.600 
5 players it can take a bunch of time to
resolve<00:06:01.350> all<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.620> registers<00:06:02.070> people<00:06:02.460> can

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
resolve all the registers people can

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.490 
resolve all the registers people can
take<00:06:02.790> longer<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.390> program<00:06:03.750> their<00:06:03.930> robots<00:06:04.260> and

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
take longer to program their robots and

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.890 
take longer to program their robots and
it<00:06:04.980> distance<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.580> drag<00:06:05.850> more<00:06:06.270> than<00:06:06.570> such<00:06:06.870> a

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
it distance to drag more than such a

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.680 
it distance to drag more than such a
light<00:06:07.290> silly<00:06:07.650> game<00:06:07.980> should<00:06:08.400> now<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.540> being

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
light silly game should now that being

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.300 
light silly game should now that being
said<00:06:09.810> this<00:06:10.140> is<00:06:10.260> still<00:06:10.500> one<00:06:10.710> of<00:06:10.800> my<00:06:10.830> favorite

games as well what I really love is all
of<00:06:15.330> the<00:06:15.480> different<00:06:15.870> courses<00:06:16.350> not<00:06:17.130> only<00:06:17.400> is

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
of the different courses not only is

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.670 
of the different courses not only is
there<00:06:17.670> a<00:06:17.700> lot<00:06:17.820> of<00:06:18.030> replay<00:06:18.810> value<00:06:18.990> which<00:06:19.470> is

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
there a lot of replay value which is

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.220 
there a lot of replay value which is
always<00:06:19.980> nice<00:06:20.490> but<00:06:21.450> you<00:06:21.510> can<00:06:21.660> really<00:06:22.020> tailor

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
always nice but you can really tailor

the game to what you want they're very
different<00:06:24.870> in<00:06:25.350> terms<00:06:25.410> of<00:06:25.770> difficulty<00:06:26.370> they're

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
different in terms of difficulty they're

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.740 
different in terms of difficulty they're
very<00:06:26.760> different<00:06:27.150> in<00:06:27.240> terms<00:06:27.270> of<00:06:27.540> how<00:06:27.690> many

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
very different in terms of how many

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.930 
very different in terms of how many
players<00:06:28.110> they<00:06:28.410> support<00:06:28.890> how<00:06:29.370> long<00:06:29.670> they're

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
players they support how long they're

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.210 
players they support how long they're
gonna<00:06:30.060> play<00:06:30.360> for<00:06:30.660> and<00:06:30.930> you<00:06:31.380> can<00:06:31.530> really<00:06:31.890> tailor

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220
