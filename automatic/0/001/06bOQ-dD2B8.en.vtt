00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 the mobilization of passengers of the line 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.299
 1 of the lime meter has increased to 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.740
 220 thousand per day in the next report 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.929
 friends when we have the new 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.000
 application for mobile devices that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.250
 allows you to know the real time in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.660
 real time the schedule of each train of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.430
 the interconnection with the broker 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.310
 metropolitan and the most 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.279
 common that are captured by the cameras 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.900
 no way security cameras how to 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.080
 they call and that surely you are going to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.850
 be very useful to see that cream 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.500
 the start-up of the 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.180
 new electric trains to the grades and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.430
 to the positive effects of the transfer of 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.950
 passengers before the frequency between each 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.480
 train was 12 to 13 minutes currently 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.330
 at peak times the time has been reduced 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.430
 6 minutes we had to 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.940
 recently an average of 80 thousand clients 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.470
 by day then it happened to us when we just 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 we announced that the new trains were leaving 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.350
 we had more or less 110,000 then a 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.489
 average of 130 thousand in the last week 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.110
 we are being 21,000 to the boards of 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.549
 orientation where the hours of 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.500
 arrival and departure of trains in each 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.570
 station has been added another novelty 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.130
 tool an application for smart 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.320
 as mobile devices where the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.790
 client user will be able to know the time of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.229
 arrival and departure of each train and the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.479
 hours of greater affluence to be able 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 plan your trip as best suits you 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.700
 what this tells us is that the next 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700
 train with direction 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.780
 that the train is coming not then 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.220
 this helps the client that from home 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.140
 at any time you can plan 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.230
 we for the needs to enter the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.230
 website our allies 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.630
 the application also allows the 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.070
 users who have lost documents or 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.350
 objects and the citations have the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.330
 option to retrieve information for 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.330
 The client found documents 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.659
 there we see the documents are the dni that 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.490
 are found from different customers 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.920
 the objects found if not the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.439
 we publish here because for a subject of 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.079
 security is not to say that someone loses 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.729
 some some object on line one can 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.649
 approach any station to 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.489
 claim it for research to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.379
 see the interconnection between the metro 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.269
 Lima and the metropolitan corridor launched 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.500
 25 days ago through these buses 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.540
 feeders that carry and bring 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.280
 passengers from the central station 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.799
 to the gamarra station and start 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.510
 give desired results whether is 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.170
 running the feeder for the first time 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.590
 from gamarra 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.060
 4 in 10 minutes 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.030
 we have calculated that from the station 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.329
 Central here comes in approximately 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.390
 between 15 to 8 minutes how much is the price 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.730
 that the user must pay to come 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.350
 pays a short but what has generated 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.880
 concern are the measures of 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.680
 security of the exteriors of some 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.480
 stations such as grau and gamarra 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.959
 where more than one user has been a victim 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.910
 of assaults in our system line 1 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.280
 it boasts of being very safe we have not 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.320
 had a single theft inside the 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.060
 station however out of the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.650
 station if we have information that they have 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.030
 there were some problems with some 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.709
 clients then what we want 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.420
 It is precisely to work together with 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.520
 the municipalities with the police like 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.230
 elena to avoid thefts to guarantee 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.459
 the safety in every three is willing 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.890
 the permanence of two agents 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.330
 uninterruptedly in the stations 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.310
 video surveillance cameras 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.900
 complement that task and are also 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.280
 great help to prevent any kind 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.400
 of accident that the client 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.670
 went over the turnstile to a 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.670
 moment 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.470
 the tourniquet effect and we have to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.629
 go quickly to stop him and tell him 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.519
 when he is in the room to enter 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.290
 although it seems incredible these cameras 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.569
 they also catch as some minors 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.550
 ordered by their parents goes under 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.959
 of the tourniquet without paying and also 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.000
 adults who simulate a failure in their 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.980
 card or are rushed up by 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.629
 above the railing made that by 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.549
 now they only appear as an occurrence but 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.670
 that in the future will be drastically 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.670
 sanctioned 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.140
 one day I was
