blitz well because that's where it's the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.540 
blitz well because that's where it's the
most<00:01:28.070> effective<00:01:28.720> like<00:01:29.720> if<00:01:30.380> you're<00:01:30.920> not<00:01:31.070> using

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550

most effective like if you're not using
this<00:01:31.790> on<00:01:31.970> blitz<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:32.680> mean<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:33.830> can<00:01:34.010> still<00:01:34.280> be

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
this on blitz I mean it can still be

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.219 
this on blitz I mean it can still be
good<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:34.760> mean<00:01:34.820> I've<00:01:35.090> done<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.170> think

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
good I mean I've done it and I think

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.260 
good I mean I've done it and I think
it's<00:01:36.590> still<00:01:36.800> very<00:01:37.190> good<00:01:37.400> but<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:38.240> just

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's still very good but it's it just

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.660 
it's still very good but it's it just
you're<00:01:39.080> kind<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.470> missing<00:01:39.619> out<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:39.950> its<00:01:40.340> full

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
you're kind of missing out on its full

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.810 
you're kind of missing out on its full
potential<00:01:41.360> because<00:01:42.160> one<00:01:43.160> of<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.340> things<00:01:43.610> with

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
potential because one of the things with

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.170 
potential because one of the things with
flack<00:01:44.150> is<00:01:44.510> like<00:01:45.470> only<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:45.920> center<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.910> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
flack is like only the center of the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.560 
flack is like only the center of the
explosion<00:01:47.960> will<00:01:48.460> will<00:01:49.460> do<00:01:49.640> significant

damage like if you're kind on the outer
edge<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.820> explosion<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.390> won't<00:01:53.780> take<00:01:54.050> a

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
edge of the explosion you won't take a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.580 
edge of the explosion you won't take a
lot<00:01:54.440> of<00:01:54.470> damage<00:01:54.770> it's<00:01:55.130> like<00:01:56.050> yeah<00:01:57.050> it's<00:01:57.229> it's

barrel<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.739> fire<00:02:16.100> off<00:02:16.340> all<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.760> rockets

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
barrel and fire off all the rockets

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.420 
barrel and fire off all the rockets
won't<00:02:17.900> happen<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.320> lot<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.680> that's<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.160> that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
won't happen a lot so that's that that

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.670 
won't happen a lot so that's that that
won't<00:02:19.640> quite<00:02:20.000> work<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.360> won't<00:02:20.840> quite<00:02:21.019> cut<00:02:21.320> it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
won't quite work that won't quite cut it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.360 
won't quite work that won't quite cut it
uh<00:02:22.360> but<00:02:23.360> yeah<00:02:23.540> why<00:02:24.170> do<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.380> pick<00:02:24.680> hex<00:02:24.980> barrel

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
uh but yeah why do I pick hex barrel

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.770 
uh but yeah why do I pick hex barrel
obviously<00:02:26.120> because<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.980> most

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
obviously because it's just the most

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:39.340 
obviously because it's just the most
rockets<00:02:29.780> jack<00:02:30.410> tops<00:02:30.650> yeah<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.750> kind<00:02:39.170> of

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
rockets jack tops yeah you I kind of

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.840 
rockets jack tops yeah you I kind of
like<00:02:39.500> using<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.950> aluminum<00:02:40.100> stock<00:02:40.549> because

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
like using the aluminum stock because

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.090 
like using the aluminum stock because
you<00:02:40.940> get<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.330> most<00:02:41.540> aimed<00:02:41.900> accuracy<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.680> as<00:02:42.890> I

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
you get the most aimed accuracy and as I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.539 
you get the most aimed accuracy and as I
said<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.610> really<00:02:44.120> want<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:45.130> your<00:02:46.130> target

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
said you really want this your target

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.610 
said you really want this your target
has<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.880> stand<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.420> center<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.260> flak

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
has to stand in the center of the flak

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.009 
has to stand in the center of the flak
otherwise<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.610> just<00:02:49.640> won't<00:02:49.940> won't<00:02:50.450> don't<00:02:50.840> do

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
otherwise it just won't won't don't do

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.470 
otherwise it just won't won't don't do
it<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.760> will<00:02:52.970> need<00:02:53.150> some

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
what corkscrew this is it as you can see

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.789 
what corkscrew this is it as you can see
here<00:03:14.030> if<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.269> don't<00:03:14.329> use<00:03:14.690> core<00:03:14.989> through<00:03:15.290> all<00:03:15.500> the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
rockets are kind of spread out across

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.580 
rockets are kind of spread out across

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
the storm with a horse cruise corkscrew

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.830 
the storm with a horse cruise corkscrew
I<00:03:30.730> got<00:03:31.239> worse

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
I got worse

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.179 
I got worse
you<00:03:32.769> can<00:03:33.359> annihilate<00:03:34.359> your<00:03:34.840> enemy<00:03:35.170> like<00:03:35.530> one

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
you can annihilate your enemy like one

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.979 
you can annihilate your enemy like one
enemy<00:03:36.549> or<00:03:36.760> multiple<00:03:37.269> enemies<00:03:37.540> but<00:03:37.659> it's<00:03:37.840> just

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
enemy or multiple enemies but it's just

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.410 
enemy or multiple enemies but it's just
way<00:03:38.230> more<00:03:38.260> centered<00:03:38.980> that's<00:03:39.879> what<00:03:40.060> I'm<00:03:40.180> trying

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
way more centered that's what I'm trying

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.289 
way more centered that's what I'm trying
to<00:03:40.480> say<00:03:40.750> Center<00:03:41.319> it's<00:03:41.439> all<00:03:41.890> very<00:03:42.489> compact<00:03:43.090> it

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
to say Center it's all very compact it

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.500 
to say Center it's all very compact it
fires<00:03:43.689> six<00:03:44.469> rockets<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:45.219> I<00:03:45.489> think<00:03:46.269> that's<00:03:46.420> very

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
fires six rockets so I think that's very

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.379 
fires six rockets so I think that's very
cool<00:03:46.959> property<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> house<00:03:47.859> salvo<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:49.209> know

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
cool property a house salvo and you know

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.379 
cool property a house salvo and you know
corkscrew<00:03:50.019> interact<00:03:50.439> it's<00:03:50.879> probably<00:03:51.879> yeah

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
corkscrew interact it's probably yeah

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.580 
corkscrew interact it's probably yeah
it's<00:03:52.629> it's<00:03:52.930> awesome

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
it's it's awesome

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.369 
it's it's awesome
I<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.269> not<00:03:55.420> have<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> more<00:03:56.139> accurate

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
I can to not have a more accurate

you<00:04:24.580> can<00:04:24.729> switch<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.389> contact<00:04:25.930> manual<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:27.280> do

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
you can switch the contact manual you do

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.810 
you can switch the contact manual you do
get<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.669> little<00:04:27.789> bit<00:04:28.000> less<00:04:28.180> damage<00:04:28.630> but<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:28.900> can

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
get a little bit less damage but you can

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.089 
get a little bit less damage but you can
detonate<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:31.210> better<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:32.349> that's<00:04:32.680> something

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
detonate it better so that's something

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.550 
detonate it better so that's something
and<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.669> that's<00:04:34.419> what<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.139> probably<00:04:35.349> want

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
and that that's what you probably want

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
and that that's what you probably want
to<00:04:35.770> use<00:04:35.919> if<00:04:36.099> you're<00:04:36.190> not<00:04:36.400> playing<00:04:36.639> on<00:04:36.820> blitz

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
kinda can aim at the ground in front

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.430 
kinda can aim at the ground in front
underneath<00:04:47.530> your<00:04:47.919> enemy<00:04:48.669> and<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:49.180> can<00:04:49.440> put

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
underneath your enemy and you can put

underneath your enemy and you can put
some<00:04:50.560> laser<00:04:50.800> guns<00:04:51.099> on<00:04:51.370> there<00:04:51.580> instead<00:04:51.729> so<00:04:52.449> you

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
some laser guns on there instead so you

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.480 
some laser guns on there instead so you
can<00:04:52.690> kind<00:04:52.900> of<00:04:52.990> guide<00:04:53.229> your<00:04:53.560> thingy<00:04:53.949> better<00:04:54.250> you

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
can kind of guide your thingy better you

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.640 
can kind of guide your thingy better you
know<00:04:54.580> last-minute<00:04:55.110> Corrections<00:04:56.110> but<00:04:56.289> it<00:04:56.440> does

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
know last-minute Corrections but it does

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.420 
know last-minute Corrections but it does
have<00:04:56.919> a<00:04:56.949> major<00:04:57.310> damage<00:04:57.820> penalty<00:04:58.210> so<00:04:59.280> maybe<00:05:00.280> you

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
have a major damage penalty so maybe you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.600 
have a major damage penalty so maybe you
do<00:05:00.610> not<00:05:00.759> want<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.120> do<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.690> know<00:05:01.840> you<00:05:02.770> it

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
do not want to do that you know you it

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.909 
do not want to do that you know you it
has<00:05:03.729> its<00:05:03.940> downside<00:05:04.479> so<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.810> like<00:05:05.349> the<00:05:05.560> vanilla

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
has its downside so I like the vanilla

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.950 
has its downside so I like the vanilla
version<00:05:06.370> without<00:05:06.639> all<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.240> fancy<00:05:07.479> stuff

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
version without all the fancy stuff

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.010 
version without all the fancy stuff
better<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:08.470> think<00:05:09.509> but<00:05:11.669> lays<00:05:12.669> against<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.330> such

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
better I think but lays against and such

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.540 
better I think but lays against and such
could<00:05:14.259> definitely<00:05:14.440> work<00:05:14.889> for<00:05:14.919> you<00:05:15.310> if<00:05:15.370> it's

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
could definitely work for you if it's

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.790 
could definitely work for you if it's
there's<00:05:16.620> it's<00:05:17.620> not<00:05:17.800> really<00:05:18.220> I<00:05:18.370> won't

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.360 

understand

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
understand

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.390 
understand
so<00:05:24.849> yeah<00:05:24.970> you<00:05:25.030> can<00:05:25.360> modify<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.259> a<00:05:26.470> bit<00:05:26.650> by<00:05:27.340> the

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
so yeah you can modify that a bit by the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.939 
so yeah you can modify that a bit by the
way<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:27.610> also<00:05:27.789> works<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.930> can<00:05:29.080> also<00:05:29.229> use<00:05:29.470> it<00:05:29.650> in

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
way it also works you can also use it in

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.040 
way it also works you can also use it in
combination<00:05:30.250> with<00:05:30.669> pyro<00:05:31.030> although<00:05:31.599> there<00:05:31.870> is

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
combination with pyro although there is

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.689 
combination with pyro although there is
some<00:05:32.320> wonkiness<00:05:32.830> with<00:05:33.130> that<00:05:33.250> going<00:05:33.490> on<00:05:33.639> I

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
some wonkiness with that going on I

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.570 
some wonkiness with that going on I
don't<00:05:34.050> kind<00:05:35.050> of<00:05:35.169> night<00:05:35.469> I<00:05:35.710> don't<00:05:35.770> really<00:05:36.279> like

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
don't kind of night I don't really like

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.310 
don't kind of night I don't really like
the<00:05:36.729> pirate<00:05:37.060> version<00:05:37.240> but<00:05:37.539> you<00:05:37.570> can<00:05:38.020> make<00:05:38.289> sure

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
the pirate version but you can make sure

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.650 
the pirate version but you can make sure
your<00:05:38.710> enemies<00:05:39.070> stay<00:05:39.310> on<00:05:39.580> fire<00:05:39.909> at<00:05:40.150> least<00:05:40.360> for

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
your enemies stay on fire at least for

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.710 
your enemies stay on fire at least for
duration<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:42.160> flack<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:43.390> can<00:05:43.540> kind

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
duration of the the flack you can kind

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.660 
duration of the the flack you can kind
of<00:05:43.810> finish<00:05:44.110> them<00:05:44.260> up<00:05:44.350> with<00:05:44.560> secondary<00:05:45.040> weapon

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
of finish them up with secondary weapon

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.630 
of finish them up with secondary weapon
as<00:05:45.970> with<00:05:46.270> most<00:05:46.480> most<00:05:47.050> burst<00:05:47.710> fire<00:05:48.070> weapons

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
as with most most burst fire weapons

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.140 
as with most most burst fire weapons
your<00:05:49.090> best<00:05:49.920> secondary<00:05:50.920> would<00:05:51.280> be<00:05:51.520> something

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
your best secondary would be something

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.830 
your best secondary would be something
along<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.660> lines<00:05:52.840> of<00:05:53.020> her<00:05:54.300> full<00:05:55.300> auto<00:05:55.480> weapon

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
along the lines of her full auto weapon

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.870 
along the lines of her full auto weapon
like<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:55.990> flood<00:05:56.350> of<00:05:56.380> beam<00:05:56.740> beams<00:05:57.430> or<00:05:57.640> great

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
like a flood of beam beams or great

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.440 
like a flood of beam beams or great
finishers<00:05:58.360> so<00:05:59.010> that's<00:06:00.010> that's<00:06:00.670> definitely<00:06:00.880> I

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
finishers so that's that's definitely I

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.630 
finishers so that's that's definitely I
would<00:06:01.690> recommend<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.590> beam<00:06:02.800> its<00:06:03.040> secondary

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
would recommend a beam its secondary

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.530 
would recommend a beam its secondary
maybe<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.360> rifle<00:06:05.520> something<00:06:06.520> that's<00:06:06.700> not<00:06:06.910> it's

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
maybe a rifle something that's not it's

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.880 
maybe a rifle something that's not it's
kind<00:06:07.720> of<00:06:07.780> an<00:06:07.870> all-round<00:06:08.380> weapon<00:06:08.800> because<00:06:09.720> like

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
kind of an all-round weapon because like

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.070 
kind of an all-round weapon because like
you<00:06:11.890> can't<00:06:12.220> fire<00:06:12.610> this<00:06:12.880> weapon<00:06:13.330> multiple

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
you can't fire this weapon multiple

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.770 
you can't fire this weapon multiple
times<00:06:14.350> in<00:06:14.560> a<00:06:14.620> fight<00:06:14.860> very<00:06:15.400> effectively<00:06:15.940> you

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
times in a fight very effectively you

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.020 
times in a fight very effectively you
know<00:06:16.900> you<00:06:16.990> have<00:06:17.200> to<00:06:17.410> reload<00:06:17.920> which<00:06:18.310> is<00:06:18.520> like<00:06:18.820> it

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
know you have to reload which is like it

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.700 
know you have to reload which is like it
is<00:06:19.120> like<00:06:19.180> a<00:06:19.420> let<00:06:19.930> me<00:06:19.990> see<00:06:20.200> it'll<00:06:20.440> look<00:06:20.500> like<00:06:20.650> a

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
is like a let me see it'll look like a

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.600 
is like a let me see it'll look like a
two<00:06:21.100> point<00:06:22.470> two<00:06:23.470> point<00:06:23.710> six<00:06:23.890> second<00:06:24.310> reload

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
two point two point six second reload

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.570 
two point two point six second reload
time<00:06:24.880> so<00:06:25.090> that's<00:06:25.300> quite<00:06:25.600> long<00:06:25.810> and<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:27.460> have

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
time so that's quite long and you have

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.760 
time so that's quite long and you have
to<00:06:27.700> load<00:06:28.330> it<00:06:28.360> up<00:06:28.630> again<00:06:28.990> and<00:06:29.290> then<00:06:29.440> you<00:06:29.560> have<00:06:29.680> to

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
to load it up again and then you have to

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.860 
to load it up again and then you have to
make<00:06:29.920> sure<00:06:30.160> you're<00:06:30.400> dying<00:06:30.610> since<00:06:31.030> P<00:06:31.600> in<00:06:31.840> your

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
make sure you're dying since P in your

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.050 
make sure you're dying since P in your
fishin<00:06:32.590> so<00:06:32.800> that's<00:06:33.250> not<00:06:33.430> it's<00:06:33.700> not<00:06:33.850> very
