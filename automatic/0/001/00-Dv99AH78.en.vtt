00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi all guys with you spirit 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.520
 some people say what to watch 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.130
 cartoons 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.559
 it's not cool but i'm very 18 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.540
 I like to watch different cartoons and not 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.180
 I think this is something strange and unusual 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.310
 time flies fast and many have already forgotten 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.390
 about one of the best children's TV channels 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 this 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.720
 jetix channel jetix rush began his 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.840
 broadcast on January 1, 2005 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.570
 but it was closed on August 10, 2010 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.390
 during this time many people have loved him very much 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.329
 watched it constantly that time with me 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.090
 there is no computer too so I am whole 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.210
 I could watch my darling for days 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.309
 tv channel 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.230
 and now I'll talk about those cartoons 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.899
 which I remember most 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.090
 first and best cartoon on this 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.710
 I think the channel is shaman king or 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.809
 differently the king of shamans 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.149
 before i learned of existence and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.640
 cartoon series avatar legend of aang 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.550
 I thought shaman king was better than multicam 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.000
 the whole world and about land morka 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.540
 amidamaru she sig 33 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.700
 Layserg Faust juku and other characters 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 made me worry with some and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.490
 I always wanted more episodes but 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.280
 Unfortunately, season 2 of the shaman never came out 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 I also remember the cartoon of galaxies 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.770
 football 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.350
 oh if such a football was 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.630
 for real I would go to every match 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.750
 or even play with a team and try 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.509
 to make your way to the stadium genesis for everything 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.640
 the time that I remember I lost my account 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.310
 how many different versions of rangers I 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.380
 looked but from the mystical power of martial 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.229
 rangers for me is considered the most 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.659
 I also loved the best Pokemon 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.810
 look and how I wanted to myself 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.899
 pokemonchik friend but unfortunately its me 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.960
 never found i certainly can't but 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.810
 mention you star race despite 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.820
 on the simplified drawing of living frame 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.890
 some places will be me very 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.100
 understandably for the most part because 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.180
 most races they are incredibly navi storyline 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.090
 the line was but 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.610
 cartoon serial with andy is pretty funny 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.830
 and cheerful from some of the series I was in 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.070
 delighted think soon revise this 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.380
 epic cartoon sonic x there was a time when i 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.810
 watched Sonic after that I tried 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.300
 find all the games that I could about 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.820
 Sonic spent a lot of time in 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.310
 sonic dx and sonic hiros 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.340
 battle law is one of the most uprooted 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.739
 cartoons that I just watched after 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.840
 of this cartoon I was thinking what if 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.320
 cats and cats are actually different 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.320
 the planets 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.900
 but the port itself of the animated series is 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.550
 navel it's just life also been and 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.640
 other interesting cartoons 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.760
 team galaxy spiderman here einstein 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.730
 Toth Spice Naruto sorceress for sex kor 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.970
 and others but if you remember them all 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.519
 it will take a lot of time so I 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.890
 I suggest you write your cartoons 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.709
 which you remember the most 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.900
 but here I say goodbye to you put big 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.900
