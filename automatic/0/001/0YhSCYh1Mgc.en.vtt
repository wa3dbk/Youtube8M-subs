00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.780 
right go ahead and repeat this procedure
go<00:03:19.200> about<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.500> fingers<00:03:19.950> width<00:03:20.129> in<00:03:20.370> I'm<00:03:20.610> just

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
go about a fingers width in I'm just

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.610 
go about a fingers width in I'm just
using<00:03:21.000> my<00:03:21.180> index<00:03:21.510> finger<00:03:21.599> as<00:03:21.900> measurement<00:03:22.290> and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
using my index finger as measurement and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.009 
using my index finger as measurement and
then<00:03:23.220> with<00:03:23.400> your<00:03:23.519> thumb<00:03:23.810> divide<00:03:24.810> your<00:03:24.840> hair

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
then with your thumb divide your hair

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.130 
then with your thumb divide your hair
into<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.620> vertical<00:03:25.920> section<00:03:26.580> straight<00:03:26.879> up

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
into a vertical section straight up

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.270 
into a vertical section straight up
attaching<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.379> bottom<00:03:28.650> piece<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.159> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
attaching it to the bottom piece of the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.380 
attaching it to the bottom piece of the
grade<00:03:30.319> combine<00:03:31.319> those<00:03:31.470> two<00:03:31.680> pieces<00:03:32.390> bring

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
grade combine those two pieces bring

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.830 
grade combine those two pieces bring
them<00:03:33.540> over<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.810> middle<00:03:34.159> all<00:03:35.159> right<00:03:35.370> now<00:03:36.120> bring

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
them over the middle all right now bring

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.220 
them over the middle all right now bring
our<00:03:37.110> top<00:03:37.560> piece<00:03:37.769> over<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> middle

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.860 

and<00:03:41.519> tight<00:03:42.519> all<00:03:43.030> right<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:43.659> that's

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
and tight all right so that's

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.770 
and tight all right so that's
essentially<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.920> again<00:03:45.580> this<00:03:45.849> collect

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
essentially it is again this collect

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.110 
essentially it is again this collect
hair<00:03:47.019> vertically<00:03:47.530> up<00:03:47.700> adding<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.790> into<00:03:48.940> the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
hair vertically up adding it into the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.570 
hair vertically up adding it into the
brain<00:03:49.360> ringing<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.049> bottom<00:03:50.440> over<00:03:51.159> the<00:03:51.190> middle

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
brain ringing the bottom over the middle

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.789 
brain ringing the bottom over the middle
and<00:03:51.790> then<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.629> top<00:03:52.810> over<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.409> middle<00:03:53.680> without

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
and then the top over the middle without

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.550 
and then the top over the middle without
adding<00:03:54.280> any<00:03:54.430> hair<00:03:55.019> now<00:03:56.019> remember<00:03:56.319> we're

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
adding any hair now remember we're

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.070 
adding any hair now remember we're
trying<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.890> break<00:03:57.069> make<00:03:57.340> this<00:03:57.519> horizontal<00:03:58.510> so

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
trying to break make this horizontal so

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.110 
trying to break make this horizontal so
it<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.500> trying<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.400> imagine<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.819> in<00:04:00.970> your

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
it just trying to imagine that in your

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.940 
it just trying to imagine that in your
head<00:04:01.299> as<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.510> go<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.019> don't<00:04:02.319> make<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.650> brain

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
head as you go and don't make this brain

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.300 
head as you go and don't make this brain
decrease<00:04:03.910> diagonally<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:05.709> would<00:04:05.890> be<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.069> very

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
decrease diagonally that would be a very

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.740 
decrease diagonally that would be a very
nice<00:04:06.580> look<00:04:06.819> to<00:04:06.849> it<00:04:07.060> just<00:04:07.420> would<00:04:07.599> be<00:04:07.720> a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
nice look to it just would be a

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.449 
nice look to it just would be a
different<00:04:08.140> sound<00:04:08.470> when<00:04:08.920> we're<00:04:09.099> trying<00:04:09.250> to

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
different sound when we're trying to

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:19.059 
different sound when we're trying to
achieve<00:04:09.549> today

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:19.069

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
once you're about halfway you might need

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.439 
once you're about halfway you might need
to<00:04:21.660> start<00:04:22.049> tucking<00:04:22.740> your<00:04:23.160> chin<00:04:23.490> into<00:04:24.030> your

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
really care too much about the ends here

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.159 
really care too much about the ends here
once<00:05:37.580> we're<00:05:37.820> at<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.210> step<00:05:38.479> you've<00:05:38.750> got<00:05:38.900> two

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169
