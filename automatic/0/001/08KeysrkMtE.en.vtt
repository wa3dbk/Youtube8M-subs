00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
think the idea is to to up the game

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.670 
think the idea is to to up the game
completely<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.250> season<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> said<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.590> know

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
completely this season so I said we know

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.289 
completely this season so I said we know
we've<00:01:55.829> seen<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> lot<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> new<00:01:56.579> dance<00:01:56.790> forms<00:01:57.180> on

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
we've seen a lot of new dance forms on

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.719 
we've seen a lot of new dance forms on
jhalak<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.990> previous<00:01:58.229> seasons<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
jhalak in the previous seasons and I

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.920 
jhalak in the previous seasons and I
think<00:01:59.939> there<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> certain<00:02:00.450> kind<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
think there was a certain kind of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.800 
think there was a certain kind of
element<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.530> us<00:02:02.030> watching<00:02:03.030> our<00:02:03.479> words

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
element of us watching our words

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.039 
element of us watching our words
watching<00:02:04.649> what<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.130> say<00:02:05.460> being<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.450> careful

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
watching what we say being very careful

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.600 
watching what we say being very careful
and<00:02:07.259> mincing<00:02:07.649> hours<00:02:07.950> sometimes<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.580> not

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and mincing hours sometimes and not

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.119 
and mincing hours sometimes and not
really<00:02:09.119> sometimes<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.050> know<00:02:10.129> projecting

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
really sometimes you know projecting

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.990 
really sometimes you know projecting
what<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.640> feel

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
what we really feel

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.090 
what we really feel
but<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.960> competition<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.770> so

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
but because the competition is so

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.550 
but because the competition is so
tremendous<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> contestants<00:02:15.720> are<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.230> I

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
tremendous and the contestants are so I

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.580 
tremendous and the contestants are so I
think<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.850> thinkwell<00:02:18.150> worst<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.840> dance<00:02:19.170> even<00:02:19.440> if

in<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.330> entertainment<00:02:21.480> business<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.710> idea

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
in the entertainment business the idea

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.370 
in the entertainment business the idea

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
is to up the game in every which way so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.350 
is to up the game in every which way so
there<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> certain<00:02:26.520> level<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
there will be a certain level of the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.180 
there will be a certain level of the
lack<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.720> better<00:02:27.750> word<00:02:27.960> rigidness<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
lack of a better word rigidness and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.100 
lack of a better word rigidness and
strictness<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:29.850> our<00:02:30.060> judgment<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.020> think

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
strictness in our judgment so I think

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.050 
strictness in our judgment so I think
it's<00:02:31.290> not<00:02:31.530> about<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.950> dance<00:02:32.130> form<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:32.760> about

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it's not about the dance form it's about

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.660 
it's not about the dance form it's about
really<00:02:33.330> kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.930> being<00:02:34.590> very<00:02:34.650> vigilant<00:02:35.190> about

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
really kind of being very vigilant about

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.270 
really kind of being very vigilant about
what<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.150> say<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:37.380> will<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.740> projected

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
what we say and that will be projected

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.970 
what we say and that will be projected
in<00:02:38.490> our<00:02:38.760> scores<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.720> well<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.470> think<00:02:40.590> this

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
in our scores as well so I think this

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.580

innumerable<00:06:29.570> amount<00:06:29.990> of<00:06:30.290> words<00:06:30.440> so<00:06:30.920> there<00:06:31.100> are

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
innumerable amount of words so there are

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.310 
innumerable amount of words so there are
many<00:06:31.340> factors<00:06:31.580> that<00:06:31.820> determine<00:06:32.480> the<00:06:33.080> final

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
many factors that determine the final

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.310 
many factors that determine the final
winner<00:06:33.770> and<00:06:34.150> sometimes<00:06:35.150> unfortunately<00:06:35.630> it's

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
winner and sometimes unfortunately it's

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.070 
winner and sometimes unfortunately it's
not<00:06:36.440> just<00:06:36.920> dance<00:06:37.190> yeah<00:06:37.880> so<00:06:38.090> even<00:06:38.120> the<00:06:38.600> best<00:06:38.840> of

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
not just dance yeah so even the best of

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.170 
not just dance yeah so even the best of
the<00:06:39.260> best<00:06:39.470> may<00:06:39.890> not<00:06:40.130> have<00:06:40.340> a<00:06:40.370> chance<00:06:40.640> and<00:06:40.850> also

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
the best may not have a chance and also

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.290 
the best may not have a chance and also
its<00:06:41.420> luck<00:06:41.690> is<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:42.050> one<00:06:42.290> show<00:06:42.590> that<00:06:43.280> tracks<00:06:43.790> the

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
its luck is the one show that tracks the

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.200 
its luck is the one show that tracks the
I<00:06:45.230> would<00:06:45.710> say<00:06:45.890> the<00:06:46.040> journey<00:06:46.430> of<00:06:46.580> even<00:06:47.120> a

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
I would say the journey of even a

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.480 
I would say the journey of even a
non-dancer<00:06:47.780> and<00:06:48.320> I<00:06:48.620> think<00:06:48.920> they<00:06:49.040> take<00:06:49.250> into

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
non-dancer and I think they take into

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.370 
non-dancer and I think they take into
account<00:06:49.760> for<00:06:50.030> example<00:06:50.390> drashti<00:06:50.810> was<00:06:50.960> a<00:06:50.990> TV

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
account for example drashti was a TV

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.530 
account for example drashti was a TV
artist<00:06:51.770> and<00:06:52.010> an<00:06:52.100> actress<00:06:52.520> but<00:06:52.880> she<00:06:53.060> wasn't<00:06:53.240> a

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:53.540 
artist and an actress but she wasn't a

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.260 
artist and an actress but she wasn't a
dancer<00:06:54.310> quintessentially<00:06:55.310> she<00:06:55.760> grew<00:06:56.060> from

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
dancer quintessentially she grew from

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.450 
dancer quintessentially she grew from
strength<00:06:56.600> to<00:06:56.690> strength<00:06:56.810> and<00:06:57.320> I<00:06:57.830> think<00:06:58.070> the

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
strength to strength and I think the

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.490 
strength to strength and I think the
voting<00:06:59.120> public<00:06:59.390> definitely<00:07:00.110> took<00:07:00.290> her

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
voting public definitely took her

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.470 
voting public definitely took her
journey<00:07:00.800> into<00:07:01.100> account<00:07:01.550> and<00:07:01.790> she<00:07:01.820> was<00:07:02.270> winner

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:02.480 
journey into account and she was winner

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.450 
journey into account and she was winner
and<00:07:02.780> that<00:07:02.960> same<00:07:03.530> can<00:07:03.740> be<00:07:03.770> said<00:07:03.860> about<00:07:04.070> guru

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
and that same can be said about guru

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.040 
and that same can be said about guru
meat<00:07:04.670> and<00:07:04.910> same<00:07:05.150> could<00:07:05.330> be<00:07:05.360> said<00:07:05.480> about<00:07:05.660> many

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
meat and same could be said about many

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.770 
meat and same could be said about many
other<00:07:06.140> winners<00:07:06.650> like<00:07:07.130> Chang<00:07:07.940> I<00:07:08.240> mean<00:07:08.540> even

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780 
other winners like Chang I mean even

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.630 
other winners like Chang I mean even
Chang<00:07:09.020> Chang<00:07:09.350> was<00:07:09.500> a<00:07:09.560> singer<00:07:09.950> and<00:07:10.310> he<00:07:10.490> was<00:07:10.610> a

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640 
Chang Chang was a singer and he was a

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.130 
Chang Chang was a singer and he was a
final<00:07:11.000> winner<00:07:11.180> so<00:07:11.360> I<00:07:11.420> think<00:07:11.510> the<00:07:11.690> journey<00:07:11.930> is

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140 
final winner so I think the journey is

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.080 
final winner so I think the journey is
also<00:07:12.500> very<00:07:12.620> integral<00:07:13.070> Jang<00:07:13.520> was<00:07:13.670> also<00:07:13.910> one<00:07:14.060> of

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090 
also very integral Jang was also one of

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.000 
also very integral Jang was also one of
the<00:07:14.270> ones<00:07:14.450> who<00:07:14.600> astounded<00:07:15.260> as<00:07:15.410> the<00:07:15.830> judges

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010 
the ones who astounded as the judges

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.720 
the ones who astounded as the judges
with<00:07:16.730> his<00:07:16.820> growth<00:07:17.150> because<00:07:17.960> this<00:07:18.730> competition

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
with his growth because this competition

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.720 
with his growth because this competition
is<00:07:19.850> over<00:07:19.970> three<00:07:20.240> months<00:07:20.600> and<00:07:21.130> to<00:07:22.130> you<00:07:22.700> know

progress that much in three months and
