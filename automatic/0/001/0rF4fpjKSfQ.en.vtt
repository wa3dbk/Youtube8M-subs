00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 For a few weeks I have mine 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.060
 normal analogue against this chic 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.980
 exchanged pieces and have fun while 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.420
 review of withings activity of a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.639
 smart watch at first glance 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.130
 looks like a stink normal analog 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.619
 I go against the trend 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 review no apple watch but this one 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.390
 some weeks now I have the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.369
 activity tested every day and this 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.529
 Clock is reminiscent of the design training one 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.779
 because her left over at least mine 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 friends thought it would be one though 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.920
 I actually replied to that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.500
 I'm here what much cooler sub 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.489
 a withings activity that can namely 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.710
 even more 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.809
 many think that an uno as smart 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.430
 watch is valid if she has a color display 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.680
 and you can read on their messages 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.140
 but even the source of our whole 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.750
 school tasks wikipedia says something else 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.329
 it would be a common practice 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.610
 Motor more computer function and 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.859
 connectivity and all that offers 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 Activity also a waterproof 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.149
 Stainless steel housing with scratchy her 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.189
 sapphire glass here with onboard that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.869
 sounds promising and sometimes 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.549
 the glass is indeed a lot 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.560
 I hope even in the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.659
 smartphone displays with protective films 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.700
 to get scratch but at this time 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.170
 It just was not my offense 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.939
 yes sometimes against 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 something and I do not have one 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.590
 the only scratch in the glass is different 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.420
 but the housing itself is there 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.130
 some make scratches from those of me 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 did not even know that there where 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.850
 but can emerge in the end 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.950
 a ur nothing but a 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.240
 utility and many scratches 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.060
 they are not 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.850
 It is not without reason with that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.290
 is known for quality and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.939
 one is not thrilled here but not 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.799
 not disappointed me but 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.720
 It is not really that enthusiastic 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.360
 constantly need to replace the battery 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.759
 given are eight months and falster 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.040
 juice then runs out is in the delivery yes 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.720
 still a spare battery settled the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.759
 first thing but after unpacking 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.009
 It is important to note that this clock 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.899
 strangely no buttons has the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.280
 But you do not need it without it 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.780
 the app which one then holds 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.360
 need to download to get namely 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.409
 as far as it is still very easy 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.509
 to set the clock 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.370
 one registers the clock and from the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.319
 actually everything happens 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.329
 automatically 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.340
 only the eu has to be calibrated once 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.260
 and that's pretty easy 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.700
 the enclosed tool with the tip 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.159
 just in the back of the case 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.349
 poke and the smartphone itself 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.150
 time is set rather then 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.129
 also not necessary that simple 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.469
 Enter the daily target in steps and 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.549
 You do not want to be permanent 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.319
 have bluetooth on 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.719
 it is enough to activate if you have the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.579
 app opens and will be there every time 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.889
 the data your activity automatically 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.930
 Synchronized is a small maneuver 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.859
 that sometimes for a few minutes 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.540
 can last 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.669
 especially if you have the app for a longer time 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.439
 did not open and that can one 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.719
 Sometimes annoying for a while 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.669
 in itself can be said that 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.379
 These are built quite minimalist 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.480
 is and can be operated very easily 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.439
 do not just let the steps go 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.780
 to look at yourself 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.879
 no sleep will be tracked on 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.169
 In the beginning I found that pretty scary 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.599
 but with time I find it pretty 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.489
 cool and the measured times are 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.349
 reliable and that also applies to the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.629
 run step and if you have his 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.790
 activities choice should be able to forget 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.590
 Just add the app to your activity 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.750
 access data in the iphone 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.489
 By the way, the clock can also wake you up 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.379
 At least she can try it but that 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.989
 Gentle vibrate is for one or the other 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.819
 others may be too weak so dear 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.650
 put the smartphone alarm clock and 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.810
 wont be torn out of sleep 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.759
 But when you wake up at night 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.040
 it should usually be dark 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:35.750
 is it still difficult with it well 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.000
 read the time because on the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.349
 dial does not light or so who 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.269
 By the way, do not want to do that 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.970
 leather bracelet gets at the activity 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.099
 a silicone bracelet is of high quality 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.819
 It's okay and replacement is synonymous 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.129
 dead easy 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.959
 In the quality of the leather bracelet can 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.849
 you actually do not complain 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.159
 after about one month of use 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.750
 no serious traces of use 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.340
 determine and the eu is by the way 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.219
 for male and female so so for the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.680
 the questions now safe my personal 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.329
 Conclusion looks pretty good 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.489
 The activity would be easy 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.590
 keep mine interested in mine 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.039
 quotes set fitness 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.379
 Life 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:15.049
 you get a solid overall package 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.699
 plenty of accessories a sensible app 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.079
 and in my opinion also one more 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.969
 optically very nice clock 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.620
 I especially want to be with this 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.310
 price already like to reliability 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.090
 leave 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.800
 And if I have the necessary change 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.930
 can simply be cheaper 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.449
 activity whether the same thing 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.669
 like the activity itself, so who can 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.320
 a chic analogue watch with a little extra 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.169
 features should be the us 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.460
 activities to look closely buy left 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.139
 Of course there are in the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.150
 Description I hope that I too 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.710
 liked this video and would like me 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.250
 as always about a rating very much 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.260
 looking forward 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.850
 so it was thanks to the highest to see and 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.850
 watch and see you next video
