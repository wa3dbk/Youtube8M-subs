 quiet we took it back with 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.390
 of the eye on the play and this 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.060
 We have a more 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.009
 than the special one you do not need 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.449
 presentation then it will start 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.110
 talking to himself 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.960
 logic need us I'm no fool 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.820
 I'm not seven 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.100
 I'm the 13th villain and I'm very calm. 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.910
 tranquil for first a lot 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.570
 Thank you for accepting this call and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.660
 I came here to participate in what it's like to say 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.609
 What an honor to me without 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.789
 size is a bit to a little late 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.680
 my part is because only the most 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.370
 of the world in relation to emails 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.780
 and we are here and August one thing that 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.509
 started in May 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.729
 paraná x 5 mega arena there we are together 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.299
 Wow, I think it's really cool, this 70 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.830
 works projects engineer at play is 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.630
 I hope more and more people here 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.189
 mainly in brazil mainly 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.740
 interest in content is more 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.710
 analytical technical tactical finally is 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.790
 because it greatly improves your own game 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.409
 play 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.420
 so come on, my brother already knows 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.220
 because he is here and you have already 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.750
 know why you're here I think it will give 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.520
 a look at what happened in the first 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.280
 game of the series and finished the final 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.659
 exactly was the game 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.479
 I think the most fun game of 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.990
 watch in my opinion is so it was 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.920
 It was very parejo game was very lycra the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.500
 fulltime 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.409
 You'll see this play that the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.360
 now does not appear in an opinion that 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.479
 was so caught up, huh? 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.280
 is not this was the only game that the cmb 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.259
 really played in my opinion quit 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.549
 so check out what happened on this 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.950
 throw away 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.729
 It was not and I had is what goes. 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.460
 happening 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.950
 Are you going to go there? Are they going to be accepted? 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.260
 She has team science in the cup. 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.250
 plays in a minefield of explosives until 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.660
 for 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.150
 Do not leave it for a while It takes me 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.760
 for lady only ultimate jatobá that danny 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.580
 can exacerbate is curious phase and jealousy 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.650
 It takes a lot of theta damage for now. 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.870
 we had and equalizer the miner already 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.760
 first run back will be focused 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.620
 because you know it's from michael dawson that 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.170
 It still hurts, he just lost a little of his 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.060
 life the defender so snow arrives one 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.250
 your team with the device. 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.280
 will survive yew guardian catch 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.100
 sure ajj is easy played 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.140
 takeshi catch river is to try to survive 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.060
 He hit again from far away for 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.860
 while only because I 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.900
 the revolt I had I took three 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.310
 players finished the first point 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.890
 interesting I wanted to get up 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.739
 about the play itself but more about the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.250
 composition of the cnb team, I do not think 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.020
 that they wanted to bring things that he 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 dealing very well with the organic waste 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.520
 good ass brought 10 afi the wrong car that 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.530
 nor lose in the final gives very strong and 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.870
 I just rested so they do not have 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.780
 mobility but they compensate for everything 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.610
 this is very far reaching and smb 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.010
 seeing this lack of mobility of the team 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.870
 of the cable explores this taking not two 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.330
 but five champions who have conditions 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.209
 Give it to someone from far away and it's cool 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.970
 so hilton was very 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.630
 strong that this lispector the final and 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.820
 hit the foot of who is right now and ii 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.989
 of the snb appealed to three champions who 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.180
 are missing is that the nokia robot saw 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.850
 showing that it can sometimes bring 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.010
 things deep down ulbra to deal with 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.840
 with things currently strong yes 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.549
 interesting live together responsible for 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.890
 next they have a pretty name 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.260
 joão's latest concert is very much 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.790
 only owner that depends on the enemy staying 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.829
 standing on top of him to take a shower and 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.170
 This is the moc that goes up and 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.239
 person would let you trust that you have 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.030
 absurd distance in the last and the everton 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.090
 that the exact global guy uncle said it all 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.370
 then ours this as that as the long 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.740
 distance is quite strong but in 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.990
 counterpart on the internet 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.239
 still accurate and they do not have a source 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.150
 very strong is what can be seen from 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.550
 bild of the North Tanya that he is 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.720
 out of the single item of 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.780
 defense even though he has a heart 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.550
 ice cream and is exactly thinking about the case 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.530
 to slow attack speed 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.030
 with bad is the mission of the north is kinda 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.530
 once a cam 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.270
 he is throwing himself in front to give 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.440
 to hold the galley pay it 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.330
 exclusively from him 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.010
 but a team to play nothing to solve 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.650
 none is and yes again what I wanted 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.540
 speaking afraid to send jj who chose 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.520
 a path where unconventional because 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.440
 the composition of the team by choosing to 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.890
 thirsty for green blood from the 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.290
 King 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.420
 yes in that patientia iraque that still for 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.750
 The top is very weak but it goes 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.310
 prince needs because their idea 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.020
 It's based on good feelings. 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.480
 yes and talking about how he just went 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.520
 possible because of vacations by jj 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.380
 yes because at the time the name of nilton 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.660
 neco rough and ended up losing sight 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.310
 so this was a spy who is also a 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.620
 recent thing in fact with these 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.360
 now used by the human and 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.250
 also details entered by the store would be 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.290
 So good team and it already arrives closing acertar 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.360
 on the ball in two neighbors end up 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.400
 would target the minerva but almost not 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.840
 last Sunday win paranoia o danske 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.670
 could get the minerva with the 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.040
 flashlight does not see the last night and 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.050
 sleep also affected by the exact wave 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.850
 I entered the course the promotion started 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.400
 view of the whole at that moment, people at 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.320
 sometimes forget with the powerful to the fact 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.720
 paranoia take the vision right 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.850
 it gets lost as we saw it 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.740
 guys end up getting lost for 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.270
 this fight is something else that you 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.280
 had commented with me is that for a 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.530
 television and so he can not 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.180
 have and bear the time to fight 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.520
 From this moment on, CNB 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.010
 where she always wanted her. 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.520
 strength in this same exact range of not 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.830
 there was a lot that ended up doing is cmb has 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.020
 all the merits of making a golito 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.420
 game to know how they should 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.280
 the situation and from there 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.290
 it was just fitting the two things fit 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.120
 other times he has the 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.820
 elevator condition take himself 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.770
 Baron at last and finish the match yesterday 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.810
 Here's the special 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.370
 Onion had ecological my very 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.480
 Thank you for running here. 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.740
 eye on the play 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.630
 I 'm really honored with your 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.680

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.370
 I send you something

 Like I said at the beginning, I think it's cool. 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.880
 God damn you and one more gal that 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:40.440
 produces more analytical content 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.729
 technical-tactical the going of the flash book 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.440
 I think it 's a great opportunity. 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.270
 that accompanies the improvement of the 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.220
 knowledge of the game is always stayed for 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.530
 during broadcasts during 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.669
 personal visits try to bring 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.979
 Someone more specific there to be able to 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:07:02.220
 improve the game itself from the next 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:05.099
 to the said and I think legal and expensive but content 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.320
 for surely celebrate stick to 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:09.840

 of this account that comes to take to the
