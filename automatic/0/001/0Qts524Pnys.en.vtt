00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.640 
steak doesn't get cold I'm going to put
it<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.760> warm<00:02:50.970> oven<00:02:51.150> only<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> very<00:02:52.350> very

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it in a warm oven only on a very very

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.890 
it in a warm oven only on a very very
low<00:02:52.830> heat<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.880> keep<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.239> moon<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:54.750> so

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
low heat just to keep the moon but so

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.949 
low heat just to keep the moon but so
it's<00:02:55.080> not<00:02:55.200> cooking<00:02:55.650> them<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.840> need

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
it's not cooking them so you need

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.530 
it's not cooking them so you need
further<00:02:58.380> mushrooms<00:02:59.010> occasionally<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.360> make

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
further mushrooms occasionally to make

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.140 
further mushrooms occasionally to make
sure<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:01.020> don't<00:03:01.200> burn<00:03:01.610> they<00:03:02.610> need<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.910> color

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
sure they don't burn they need to color

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.840 
sure they don't burn they need to color
easily

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
easily

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.430 
easily
so<00:03:05.850> once<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.209> mushrooms<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.870> started<00:03:07.320> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
so once the mushrooms have started to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.070 
so once the mushrooms have started to
turn<00:03:07.680> golden<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.120> front<00:03:09.390> that's<00:03:09.600> quite<00:03:10.049> a

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
turn golden and the front that's quite a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.140 
turn golden and the front that's quite a
bit<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:11.010> then<00:03:11.250> going<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.640> add<00:03:11.760> four

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
bit and then going to add four

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.900 
bit and then going to add four
tablespoons<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:13.260> masala<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:14.010> prepare<00:03:15.380> and

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
tablespoons of masala to prepare and

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.370 
tablespoons of masala to prepare and
then<00:03:17.910> I'm<00:03:18.030> going<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.299> cook<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.660> until<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
then I'm going to cook this until the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.640 
then I'm going to cook this until the
masala<00:03:19.980> almost<00:03:20.580> completely<00:03:21.000> evaporate<00:03:21.650> so

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
masala almost completely evaporate so

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.960 
masala almost completely evaporate so
it's<00:03:22.769> reducing<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.430> down<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.820> it's

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
it's reducing it down and it's

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.250 
it's reducing it down and it's
concentrating<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> flavor<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> needs<00:03:28.080> to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
concentrating the flavor so it needs to

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.229 
concentrating the flavor so it needs to
simmer<00:03:28.470> gently<00:03:28.799> for<00:03:29.100> three<00:03:29.549> or<00:03:29.670> four<00:03:29.850> minutes

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
simmer gently for three or four minutes

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.630 
simmer gently for three or four minutes
just<00:03:30.450> throwing<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.380> occasionally<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:35.430> once

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
just throwing it occasionally the once

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.150 
just throwing it occasionally the once
most<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.299> masala<00:03:36.900> has<00:03:37.080> evaporated<00:03:37.380> from<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
most the masala has evaporated from the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.320 
most the masala has evaporated from the
pan<00:03:38.489> I'm<00:03:39.000> going<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.480> add<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.959> double<00:03:40.260> cream<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
pan I'm going to add on double cream and

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.140 
pan I'm going to add on double cream and
this<00:03:42.330> is<00:03:42.540> one<00:03:42.780> small<00:03:43.019> carton<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.769> double<00:03:44.040> cream

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.729 

so<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.269> cream<00:03:48.510> needs<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.930> simmer<00:03:49.260> until<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
so the cream needs to simmer until the

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.720 
so the cream needs to simmer until the
sauce<00:03:49.829> thickens<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.670> little<00:03:50.970> bit

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.940 

and<00:03:54.849> I'm<00:03:55.569> going<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.810> season<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.410> with<00:03:56.709> some

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
and I'm going to season it with some

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.119 
and I'm going to season it with some
salt<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.520> pepper<00:03:58.170> so<00:03:59.170> firstly<00:03:59.590> some<00:03:59.890> freshly

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
salt and pepper so firstly some freshly

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.130 
salt and pepper so firstly some freshly
ground<00:04:00.519> black<00:04:00.790> pepper

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.540 

and<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.890> pinch<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.370> salt<00:04:08.770> but<00:04:09.770> I'm<00:04:09.950> taking<00:04:10.310> care

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
and a pinch of salt but I'm taking care

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.790 
and a pinch of salt but I'm taking care
not<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.790> add<00:04:11.060> too<00:04:11.360> much<00:04:11.540> salt<00:04:11.680> because<00:04:12.680> I'm

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
not to add too much salt because I'm

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.650 
not to add too much salt because I'm
going<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.069> be<00:04:13.190> adding<00:04:13.490> Stilton<00:04:13.970> cheese<00:04:14.240> and

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
going to be adding Stilton cheese and

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.650 
going to be adding Stilton cheese and
that<00:04:15.110> can<00:04:15.319> tend<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.680> be<00:04:15.830> quite<00:04:16.130> salty<00:04:16.540> so<00:04:17.540> the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
that can tend to be quite salty so the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.140 
that can tend to be quite salty so the
sauce<00:04:17.870> needs<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.620> simmer<00:04:18.859> away<00:04:19.100> until<00:04:20.000> it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
sauce needs to simmer away until it

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.950 
sauce needs to simmer away until it
reaches<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.600> coating<00:04:21.079> consistency<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.810> now

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
reaches a coating consistency so now

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.020 
reaches a coating consistency so now
it's<00:04:24.140> thickened<00:04:24.740> I'm<00:04:25.250> going<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.669> add<00:04:25.790> the

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
it's thickened I'm going to add the

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.750 
it's thickened I'm going to add the
Stilton<00:04:26.540> and<00:04:26.810> I've<00:04:27.560> got<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.740> hundred<00:04:28.040> grams<00:04:28.460> of
