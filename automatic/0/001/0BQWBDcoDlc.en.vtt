00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
do this on a regular basis probably not

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
do this on a regular basis probably not
the<00:01:12.840> best<00:01:12.869> idea<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.740> there's<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> lot

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the best idea just because there's a lot

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
the best idea just because there's a lot
of<00:01:14.100> sugar<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.520> watermelon<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.619> gonna

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
of sugar in watermelon so I'm gonna

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.140 
of sugar in watermelon so I'm gonna
throw<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> watermelon<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.030> and

throw all the watermelon in there and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.219 
throw all the watermelon in there and
hopefully<00:01:18.299> Lucas<00:01:18.780> stops<00:01:18.990> crying<00:01:19.259> okay<00:01:21.229> that's

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
hopefully Lucas stops crying okay that's

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.710 
hopefully Lucas stops crying okay that's
probably<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.740> likely<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> fit<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:23.720> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
probably all likely to fit in there and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.450
