00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 living element this season he has 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.390
 until relatively relatively 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.400
 a lot of 72 points just 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.849
 the world championship of the twelfth year you 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.469
 remember he took sixth place there but 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.299
 done rustle of course in short 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.760
 the program is almost eighty eight it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.980
 it was these see the program is not very 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.869
 interesting and if he and I performed well 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.869
 then we all enjoy 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.440
 14 double sheepskin well 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.440
 good start 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:31.710
 and wonderful 13 all jumps were 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.710
 performed well and very confidently 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.650
 or cool skating 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.890
 finally saw among other things 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.380
 the road of steps 4 levels that today we are not 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.330
 rarely put it mildly watched Oleg who 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.050
 still i have a question for you see u 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.510
 him 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.430
 stated cascade to was another triple 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.500
 flip and triple toe loop and if to him 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.500
 add pure quadruple salchow 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.720
 the amount is more than he gets 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.970
 got it now when she has very chicken 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.850
 40 plus double sheepskin and separate triple 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.340
 flip why is he cool 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.740
 black flip you stuck jump two 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.950
 turnover then to get here 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:44.350
 explain it seems to me that when michael 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.120
 landed with a quad flip you are very 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.370
 it was very hard for him 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.440
 hold this moment of rotation and 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.630
 the best way out is not to 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.220
 spoil the impression of the jump was 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.880
 add double or triple jump 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.660
 sheepskin that is this is my feeling 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.470
 viktor petrenko 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.540
 yes this is a very famous device 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.450
 athlete and all the great coach 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.860
 and torpedoes which trains well let's 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.990
 let's see an hour we will see the authors we 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.240
 see it seemed to me that he is for beauty 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.160
 the quadruple then landed his body 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.370
 keeps spinning you leg gone 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.920
 for himself and he just couldn't keep it 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.370
 landing and show very good 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.050
 bounce 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.450
 so if he added this 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.860
 certainly was good but on triple 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.620
 a little bit lacked strength axel and clip 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.320
 good i think he will be somewhere plus 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.240
 1 plus 2 because there were no no 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.830
 technical errors of tilt not touch 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.350
 nothing so it's all in the plus zone 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.600
 very interesting what components are we 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.200
 we will observe I will remind more than 40 points 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.790
 you audio for the components of Michael how are you 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.910
 consider it will be comparable more less 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.620
 given the overall level of understanding of 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.900
 the program is still error-free skating 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.180
 but still somewhere that implicitly overestimates 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.040
 surely this judge is affected and 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.780
 good performance of the program 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.090
 pure elements it is a little bit 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.560
 raises the second assessment I think that 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.460
 will be comparable maybe even on 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.190
 a couple of points 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.480
 more can be up to 41 42 points 2 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.400
 cents now but ok ok i have you for a long time 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.300
 watching these athletes and and I will say 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.550
 that there were ups and downs and there were good 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.420
 years or were bad but these 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.280
 championships hand before the tournament soon 3 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.380
 he gathered to become radon great 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.630
 excellent for growing problems by the way it is 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.730
 failed hockey players is that he 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.030
 went figure skating 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.790
 Generally enough necklace at the age of 98 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.000
 year see the amount per component 39 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.000
 amount
