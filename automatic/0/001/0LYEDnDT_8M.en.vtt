trying to go for an in-air skills we be
those<00:01:24.000> two<00:01:24.210> defenders<00:01:24.600> almost<00:01:25.140> didn't<00:01:26.040> really

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
those two defenders almost didn't really

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.469 
those two defenders almost didn't really
look<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.369> nice<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:26.939> still<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.270> managed<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
look that nice but still we managed to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.840 
look that nice but still we managed to
get<00:01:27.630> sort<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.049> shot<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.610> Syracuse<00:01:29.610> saved

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
get sort of a shot in and Syracuse saved

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
get sort of a shot in and Syracuse saved
it<00:01:30.000> yet<00:01:30.299> again<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> 84th<00:01:31.950> minutes<00:01:32.250> from<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it yet again then I 84th minutes from a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.679 
it yet again then I 84th minutes from a
free-kick<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.970> pellet<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.420> hit<00:01:33.600> the

free-kick with pellet we hit the
crossbar<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.799> they'd<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.040> key

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
crossbar I think they'd go key

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.469 
crossbar I think they'd go key
participants<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.909> save<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.299> well<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
participants you save it as well a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.300 
participants you save it as well a
really<00:01:36.930> nice<00:01:37.110> free-kick<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.950> towards<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
end of the game my opponent got himself

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.210 
end of the game my opponent got himself
a<00:01:39.840> chance<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:40.259> i<00:01:40.290> saw<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.070> pie

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
a chance there i saw it i think the pie

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.039 
a chance there i saw it i think the pie
a<00:01:41.460> nice<00:01:41.850> safe<00:01:42.030> from<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> start<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
a nice safe from from the start then I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.780 
a nice safe from from the start then I
straight<00:01:43.500> from<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.799> we'd<00:01:44.280> pretty<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.520> go

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
straight from that we'd pretty much go

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.399 
straight from that we'd pretty much go
on<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> counter-attack<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.659> Pele<00:01:45.899> we

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
on the counter-attack that with Pele we

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.840 
on the counter-attack that with Pele we
play<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.920> 20<00:01:47.100> coach<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.610> beats

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
play it on through 20 coach out beats

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.130 
play it on through 20 coach out beats
there<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.119> two<00:01:48.240> defenders<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.840> row<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
there are two defenders in a row with a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
there are two defenders in a row with a
really<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.530> nice<00:01:49.710> body<00:01:49.950> faint<00:01:50.250> we

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
really really nice body faint we

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.310 
really really nice body faint we
continue<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.210> with<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> skills<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.930> probably

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
continue on with the skills I probably

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.389 
continue on with the skills I probably
could<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.590> passed<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> over<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.250> either

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
could have passed it over to either

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.520 
could have passed it over to either
Ronaldo<00:01:53.939> or<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.600> college<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.200> try<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
Ronaldo or to a to college but I try to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.830 
Ronaldo or to a to college but I try to
get<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> final<00:01:56.070> skill<00:01:56.490> goal<00:01:56.670> completed<00:01:57.090> but

get the final skill goal completed but

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
get the final skill goal completed but
unfortunately<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.590> says<00:01:58.799> go<00:01:59.040> keep<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> got<00:01:59.520> in

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
unfortunately it says go keep it got in

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
unfortunately it says go keep it got in
our<00:01:59.850> way<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.570> 90th<00:02:00.960> minute<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
our way and then in a 90th minute on the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.020 
our way and then in a 90th minute on the
counter<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.340> my<00:02:02.430> opponent<00:02:02.790> going

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
counter there it's my opponent going

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.760 
counter there it's my opponent going
through<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> Mueller<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.750> nice<00:02:04.259> shot<00:02:04.530> across

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
through it Mueller a nice shot across

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.249 
through it Mueller a nice shot across
goal<00:02:04.860> making<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.579> three<00:02:05.909> two<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:07.170> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
goal making it three two one and that is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.930 
goal making it three two one and that is
also<00:02:07.439> how<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.680> game<00:02:07.920> ended<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> mean<00:02:08.789> when

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
also how the game ended so I mean when

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
also how the game ended so I mean when
opening<00:02:09.239> three<00:02:09.509> two<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.349> that's<00:02:10.530> why

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
opening three two one I think that's why

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.990 
opening three two one I think that's why
they<00:02:10.890> were<00:02:11.009> fairly<00:02:11.190> even<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:11.970> right

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
they were fairly even you can see right

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220 
they were fairly even you can see right
there<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.390> had<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> similar<00:02:12.840> amount<00:02:12.900> of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
there we had a similar amount of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.380 
there we had a similar amount of
session<00:02:13.530> as<00:02:13.650> well<00:02:13.800> but<00:02:14.370> anyway<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:15.150> jump

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
session as well but anyway we we jump

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.729 
session as well but anyway we we jump
and<00:02:15.569> what<00:02:15.659> will<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.989> second<00:02:16.319> game<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> the

a<00:03:26.849> little<00:03:27.209> bit<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.389> lag<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:27.870> it's<00:03:28.079> kind<00:03:28.380> of

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
a little bit of lag and so it's kind of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.650 
a little bit of lag and so it's kind of
kind<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.220> interrupted<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.000> whole<00:03:30.150> skill<00:03:30.480> run

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.750 
it in the description down below so feel
free<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:52.079> check<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.470> out<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.889> 80th<00:03:53.519> minute<00:03:53.609> I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
free to check it out in 80th minute I

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.190 
free to check it out in 80th minute I
think<00:03:53.849> I<00:03:54.060> saw<00:03:54.180> my<00:03:54.359> opponent<00:03:54.720> did<00:03:54.870> make<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.049> to

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
think I saw my opponent did make it to

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.289 
think I saw my opponent did make it to
21<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.919> that<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.340> also<00:03:56.489> had<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.760> game<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.180> wood

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
21 and that is also had a game of wood

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.360 
21 and that is also had a game of wood
and<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:58.109> you<00:03:58.590> jump<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:58.950> what<00:03:59.069> will<00:03:59.160> be<00:03:59.280> the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
and so you jump and what will be the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.069 
and so you jump and what will be the
final<00:03:59.549> game<00:03:59.879> of<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.180> episode<00:04:00.510> comp<00:04:00.780> against

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
final game of the episode comp against

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.619 
final game of the episode comp against
18<00:04:01.410> with<00:04:01.590> 65<00:04:02.250> chemistry<00:04:02.819> but<00:04:03.329> there's<00:04:03.510> some

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
18 with 65 chemistry but there's some

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.059 
18 with 65 chemistry but there's some
pretty<00:04:03.840> pretty<00:04:04.079> good<00:04:04.290> players<00:04:04.530> team<00:04:04.859> of<00:04:04.950> the

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
pretty pretty good players team of the

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.039 
pretty pretty good players team of the
year<00:04:05.099> crows<00:04:05.519> team<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.150> season<00:04:06.329> velocity<00:04:06.989> as

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
year crows team this season velocity as

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.720 
year crows team this season velocity as
well<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.470> think<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.889> guy<00:04:08.099> was<00:04:08.250> also<00:04:08.700> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
well and I think this guy was also a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.849 
well and I think this guy was also a
subscriber<00:04:09.269> since<00:04:09.810> he<00:04:10.019> messaged<00:04:10.410> me<00:04:10.530> after

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
subscriber since he messaged me after

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.710 
subscriber since he messaged me after
this<00:04:10.949> game<00:04:11.160> but<00:04:11.400> I'm<00:04:11.579> overall<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.209> was<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.599> was

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
this game but I'm overall it was it was

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.030 
this game but I'm overall it was it was
a<00:04:12.750> pretty<00:04:12.989> tough<00:04:13.079> game<00:04:13.440> even<00:04:13.829> though<00:04:13.919> he

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
a pretty tough game even though he

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.110 
a pretty tough game even though he
didn't<00:04:14.280> already<00:04:14.370> had<00:04:14.609> like<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.910> greatest

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
didn't already had like the greatest

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.210 
didn't already had like the greatest
camas<00:04:15.540> tree<00:04:15.690> for<00:04:16.320> me<00:04:16.349> anyway<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.979> doesn't

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
camas tree for me anyway it doesn't

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.920 
camas tree for me anyway it doesn't
really<00:04:17.340> seem<00:04:17.699> to<00:04:17.729> be<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.269> huge<00:04:18.660> factor

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
really seem to be like a huge factor

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.390 
really seem to be like a huge factor
this<00:04:19.199> year<00:04:19.440> I've<00:04:19.590> said<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.859> many<00:04:19.979> times<00:04:20.130> before

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
this year I've said it many times before

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.120 
this year I've said it many times before
in<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:21.120> skill<00:04:21.539> into<00:04:21.659> glory<00:04:21.900> episodes<00:04:22.349> even<00:04:23.010> when

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
in a skill into glory episodes even when

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.560 
in a skill into glory episodes even when
I<00:04:23.159> I<00:04:23.250> think<00:04:23.669> lost<00:04:23.880> against<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.240> team<00:04:24.450> were

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
I I think lost against the team were

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.629 
I I think lost against the team were
like<00:04:24.719> 70<00:04:25.080> chemistry<00:04:25.469> or<00:04:25.590> something<00:04:25.890> like<00:04:26.010> I

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
like 70 chemistry or something like I

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.429 
like 70 chemistry or something like I
think<00:04:26.909> chemistry<00:04:27.240> plays<00:04:27.629> that<00:04:27.900> big<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:28.259> part

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:28.439 
think chemistry plays that big of a part

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.610 
think chemistry plays that big of a part
in<00:04:28.680> 5-15<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:29.759> therefore<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.479> game<00:04:30.659> was<00:04:31.289> was

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
in 5-15 so therefore the game was was

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.320 
in 5-15 so therefore the game was was
pretty<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:32.099> was<00:04:32.189> pretty<00:04:32.759> intense<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.240> be

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
pretty it was pretty intense to be

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.850 
pretty it was pretty intense to be
honest<00:04:33.569> we<00:04:33.719> both<00:04:33.870> had<00:04:34.050> some<00:04:34.199> chances<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.740> can

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
honest we both had some chances you can

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.230 
honest we both had some chances you can
see<00:04:35.009> as<00:04:35.129> well<00:04:35.249> in<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.460> second<00:04:35.789> half<00:04:35.819> I<00:04:36.029> tried

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
see as well in the second half I tried

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.089 
see as well in the second half I tried
to<00:04:36.360> go<00:04:36.479> with<00:04:36.900> some<00:04:37.080> of<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.319> inner<00:04:37.650> skin<00:04:37.919> was

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
to go with some of the inner skin was

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.739 
to go with some of the inner skin was
trying<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.430> complete<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:38.819> challenge<00:04:38.999> we<00:04:39.659> were

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:39.749 
trying to complete the challenge we were

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:41.330 
trying to complete the challenge we were
very<00:04:39.779> very<00:04:40.139> close<00:04:40.259> here<00:04:40.590> what<00:04:40.740> oh<00:04:40.830> gotcha<00:04:41.099> I

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
very very close here what oh gotcha I

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.800 
very very close here what oh gotcha I
tried<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.729> beat<00:04:41.879> the<00:04:41.999> goalkeeper<00:04:42.180> cell<00:04:42.659> I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
tried to beat the goalkeeper cell I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.570 
tried to beat the goalkeeper cell I
actually<00:04:42.990> pressed<00:04:43.469> the<00:04:43.590> shoot<00:04:43.830> button<00:04:44.069> but

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
actually pressed the shoot button but

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.129 
actually pressed the shoot button but
for<00:04:44.759> some<00:04:44.909> reason<00:04:45.240> he<00:04:45.360> refused<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.960> shoot

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
for some reason he refused to shoot

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.450 
for some reason he refused to shoot
which<00:04:46.379> was<00:04:46.560> kind<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.860> annoying<00:04:47.099> because<00:04:47.340> I

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
which was kind of annoying because I

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.820 
which was kind of annoying because I
felt<00:04:47.849> if<00:04:48.029> we<00:04:48.300> if<00:04:48.599> we<00:04:48.629> got<00:04:48.930> through<00:04:49.169> we<00:04:49.590> probably

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
felt if we if we got through we probably

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.050 
felt if we if we got through we probably
probably<00:04:50.279> would<00:04:50.520> have<00:04:50.580> completed<00:04:50.939> a

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
probably would have completed a

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.760 
probably would have completed a
challenge<00:04:51.449> then<00:04:51.840> 83rd<00:04:52.289> minute<00:04:52.319> that's<00:04:52.680> all

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
challenge then 83rd minute that's all

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.260 
challenge then 83rd minute that's all
again<00:04:53.099> I<00:04:53.129> tried<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.610> go<00:04:53.729> with<00:04:53.849> the<00:04:53.939> inner

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
again I tried to go with the inner

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.089 
again I tried to go with the inner
elastica<00:04:54.810> with<00:04:54.930> Ronaldo<00:04:55.379> for<00:04:55.560> some<00:04:55.710> reason<00:04:56.009> he

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
elastica with Ronaldo for some reason he

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.980 
elastica with Ronaldo for some reason he
wasn't<00:04:56.400> able<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.639> do<00:04:56.849> it<00:04:56.999> and<00:04:57.270> when<00:04:57.539> I<00:04:57.599> we<00:04:57.840> end

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
wasn't able to do it and when I we end

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.080 
wasn't able to do it and when I we end
up<00:04:58.110> hitting<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.379> post<00:04:58.620> then<00:04:59.189> 86<00:04:59.729> minutes<00:04:59.879> my

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
up hitting the post then 86 minutes my

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.700 
up hitting the post then 86 minutes my
opponent<00:05:00.449> gets<00:05:00.539> himself<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:01.050> chance<00:05:01.319> there<00:05:01.529> so

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
opponent gets himself a chance there so

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.170 
opponent gets himself a chance there so
I<00:05:01.889> think<00:05:01.949> with<00:05:02.279> Willie<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.759> nice<00:05:02.939> safe

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
I think with Willie and a nice safe

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.550 
I think with Willie and a nice safe
there<00:05:03.419> from<00:05:03.599> a<00:05:03.719> phone<00:05:03.840> from<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.139> star<00:05:04.349> and

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
there from a phone from the star and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.499 
there from a phone from the star and
that<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.340> how<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.460> all<00:05:05.699> ended<00:05:05.969> in<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.210> 90

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
that is how it all ended in the 90

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.629 
that is how it all ended in the 90
minutes<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.169> I<00:05:07.409> decided<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.919> make<00:05:08.009> one<00:05:08.129> change

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
minutes so I decided to make one change

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.490 
minutes so I decided to make one change
I<00:05:08.849> decided<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.479> bring<00:05:09.629> on<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.840> Memphis<00:05:10.199> a<00:05:10.229> pipe

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
I decided to bring on a Memphis a pipe

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.379 
I decided to bring on a Memphis a pipe
for<00:05:10.860> Pele<00:05:11.129> since<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.490> thought<00:05:11.699> making<00:05:11.969> change

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
for Pele since I thought making change

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.360 
for Pele since I thought making change
was<00:05:12.840> kind<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.110> necessary<00:05:13.439> yeah<00:05:13.949> we<00:05:14.159> got<00:05:14.279> the

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
was kind of necessary yeah we got the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.339 
was kind of necessary yeah we got the
first<00:05:14.520> chance<00:05:14.819> in<00:05:14.939> X<00:05:15.060> at<00:05:15.180> time<00:05:15.210> 1<00:05:15.659> although<00:05:15.840> you

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
first chance in X at time 1 although you

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.899 
first chance in X at time 1 although you
can<00:05:16.469> see<00:05:16.650> right<00:05:16.680> there<00:05:16.979> he<00:05:17.009> slipped<00:05:17.400> a<00:05:17.520> solid

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
can see right there he slipped a solid

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.490 
can see right there he slipped a solid
still<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.240> good<00:05:18.449> safe<00:05:18.659> from<00:05:18.810> his<00:05:18.960> goalkeeper

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
still a good safe from his goalkeeper

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.040 
still a good safe from his goalkeeper
then<00:05:19.979> 110th<00:05:20.729> minute<00:05:21.089> the<00:05:21.210> funnest<00:05:21.569> I<00:05:21.689> wasn't

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
then 110th minute the funnest I wasn't

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.420 
then 110th minute the funnest I wasn't
really<00:05:22.139> looking<00:05:22.289> that<00:05:22.770> good<00:05:22.919> there<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.279> can

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
really looking that good there you can

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.769 
really looking that good there you can
see<00:05:23.460> on<00:05:23.819> the<00:05:23.909> counter<00:05:24.240> we<00:05:24.360> might<00:05:24.509> see<00:05:24.659> go

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 
see on the counter we might see go

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.600 
see on the counter we might see go
through<00:05:25.020> what<00:05:25.169> Ronaldo<00:05:25.439> I<00:05:25.830> just<00:05:26.339> went<00:05:26.520> with

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
through what Ronaldo I just went with

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.369 
through what Ronaldo I just went with
pace<00:05:26.789> only<00:05:27.120> since<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.449> felt<00:05:27.689> if<00:05:27.839> I<00:05:28.020> would<00:05:28.169> blow

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
pace only since I felt if I would blow

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.140 
pace only since I felt if I would blow
this<00:05:28.529> chance<00:05:28.589> i<00:05:29.069> would<00:05:29.159> probably<00:05:29.789> probably

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
this chance i would probably probably

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.089 
this chance i would probably probably
concede<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:31.050> goal<00:05:31.080> like<00:05:31.439> a<00:05:31.620> few<00:05:31.949> minutes

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
concede a goal like a few minutes

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.040 
concede a goal like a few minutes
afterwards<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:32.759> yeah<00:05:33.270> we<00:05:33.449> do<00:05:33.599> manage<00:05:33.779> to<00:05:33.839> get

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
afterwards so yeah we do manage to get

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.980 
afterwards so yeah we do manage to get
the<00:05:34.080> goal<00:05:34.289> that<00:05:34.319> Ronaldo<00:05:35.270> 130<00:05:36.270> infinite<00:05:36.810> and

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
the goal that Ronaldo 130 infinite and

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.629 
the goal that Ronaldo 130 infinite and
AB<00:05:37.139> that<00:05:37.319> has<00:05:37.439> also<00:05:37.589> had<00:05:37.830> a<00:05:37.860> game<00:05:38.129> in<00:05:38.310> it<00:05:38.430> and

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
AB that has also had a game in it and

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.829 
AB that has also had a game in it and
you<00:05:38.669> probably<00:05:39.060> could<00:05:39.270> have<00:05:39.300> seen<00:05:39.539> it<00:05:39.569> from<00:05:39.750> the

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:39.839 
you probably could have seen it from the

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.360 
you probably could have seen it from the
stats<00:05:40.110> as<00:05:40.259> well<00:05:40.409> it<00:05:40.650> was<00:05:40.979> a<00:05:41.009> really<00:05:41.219> really

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
stats as well it was a really really

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.040 
stats as well it was a really really
even<00:05:41.669> game<00:05:41.879> but<00:05:42.060> i<00:05:42.149> think<00:05:42.389> was<00:05:42.539> mainly<00:05:42.810> because

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
even game but i think was mainly because

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.260 
even game but i think was mainly because
i<00:05:43.199> was<00:05:43.529> just<00:05:43.740> trying<00:05:43.949> to<00:05:44.159> try<00:05:44.520> to<00:05:44.580> score<00:05:44.909> from
