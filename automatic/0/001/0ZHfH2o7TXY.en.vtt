00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:23.311
We live in a world where everyone wants to be successful

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.710
and as brain researcher i must say, consider that well.

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:34.600
There are people who ignore the risk and 
 there are people who are careful first.

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:37.267
The question is, what is better.

00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:40.655
For a short-term success, maybe it's better to be merciless,

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.026
then the question is how old you will get.

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.991
Of course you need failures sometimes in life.

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:48.670
Everything may not always go well.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.993
Sometimes you have to fall. Otherwise, you won't learn how to get up again.

00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:59.492
That's the hardest part. To clear your mind 
 and to push the limit hard again.

00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:04.328
The trick is to get up more times, than you get knocked down.

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:11.465
Without passion and dedication, you will surely not succeed.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:15.183
Goals are very important for me.

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:20.664
If I had no goals, I would go climbing with a different attitude.

00:01:22.143 --> 00:01:25.268
I think that's the same in almost all professions.

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:31.280
If you do, what you like to do, and 
 you do it with your whole heart,

00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:37.421
then you do it so well that you become 
 successful on a material level as well.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.440
Every human has a special gift

00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:47.880
and I think it's important to discover it.

00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:07.930
Someone who lives his talent and his passion,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.640
will always be successful.
