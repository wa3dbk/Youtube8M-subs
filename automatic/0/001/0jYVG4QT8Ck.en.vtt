00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.410
 hi hi sene jeanne they get 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.420
 find today for breakfast 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.039
 Sunday morning we meet again 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.390
 with roaring sky you understand 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.150
 why is the series coming to 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.710
 hardly go out for the moment to me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.990
 give a quota of hell I love this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.719
 series there I love it's ultra rare for 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.969
 the moment we are at 22 open booster 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:32.940
 with 5 ultra rare today we will 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:34.440
 open on the 23rd and 24th we will see if we 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.000
 will have a little luck anyway I 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.770
 cross fingers because for the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 moment this series succeeds me and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.739
 I still have not had my art crowd so 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.510
 I would like to get it 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.550
 and suddenly I propose you to move 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.520
 now at their opening I'm a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.530
 not excited because I love the sky 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.850
 roaring frankly he's got 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.230
 I've always dreamed of flying that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.640
 it's a human dream we all have a dream 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.800
 in life is much less it would be 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 to be able to fly like that in levitation good 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.200
 there I imagined a few movies like 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.720
 dragon ball z 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.100
 but yeah if a dream that I will have this 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.500
 would be the dream of being able to fly and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.790
 to be able to see everything from the outside and from 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.960
 high it would be really great 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.000
 maybe that's why I love 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 really pokemon flight all the more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.020
 the pokemon dragon we'll see 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.790
 today we have two boosters one of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.500
 the mega tune and mega soul 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.180
 cross your fingers to maybe have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.010
 a the graph or a good pick 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.540
 will see well anyway I put the 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.370
 boosters in the corner and I go to 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
 the opening of the first booster the bottom 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.340
 the video is always the rally cozza 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.420
 because it's a fund for which 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.060
 I have a really big favorite 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.229
 I adore them and for the moment, that's it 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.520
 we may be going to the opening of the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.119
 first booster go it's gone 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.700
 so what are we going to get 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.830
 today I'm a bit of an inch on 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 on the alert 1 today I feel it 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.159
 Well, I do not know why 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.360
 have one last time an ultra rare 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.700
 in the last 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.200
 in the last opening date I 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.110
 I'm sure we can still prevent 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
 go we'll see and we start with ni 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.750
 washer 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.830
 the booster for a better design I 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 will put it in the other corner rather 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.210
 and I said so we start with neither 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.210
 washer that is for me the common which 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.310
 is best done in the entire series 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.190
 drawn what are we going on next 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.540
 with a dinar holt behind draghi that 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.000
 loose his passes he had got his 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.440
 two rabhi the very good question am 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.110
 I think if I still opened 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.820
 22 booster finally the 23rd lime this I 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.380
 think that I got it on 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:25.050
 continue with chickpeas on line wales 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.310
 raptors of spades a sister sister the mega 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.690
 turbo so apparently this is what 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.760
 would mega evolve pokemon 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.930
 we have a new technique then we 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.390
 goes on with another address and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.400
 realize the rivers already I went a 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.870
 little soon apparently we have ninja sq 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.610
 good it's not a favorite this in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.709
 day said right now is behind us 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.600
 will have too much good 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.160
 Ã¼nal to the chart it was a long time 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.140
 finally I'm happy the opening of the 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.970
 little old makes a swell to the chart 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.549
 and in addition it is dhr attack 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.140
 there is no way to go really beautiful 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.519
 limit the illustration might be 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.200
 mega their attack good it's not the mega 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.930
 I'm sure and then the mx2 haridon 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.400
 rattaque but the wings are so 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.720
 long as the mega attacks them he has 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.700
 really hyper aid to the English that 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.830
 could it be that one but 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.110
 the illustration and reveals it's a dragon 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.209
 and tackle cede too too happy that 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.910
 is very very pleased with the beautiful 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.250
 this powerful devastating angry dragon 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.340
 and he fell in the breakfast of this 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.570
 morning gizzard vapor steam geyser 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.760
 what is this attack not but 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.769
 anything good in any case very very 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.670
 good booster we had a great draw is 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.410
 a very very good pick 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.730
 we will see what the booster behind is going 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.549
 to offer us may still be at the level 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.500
 graphic one can dream a little crazy but 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.630
 good I do not care in the hope done 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.880
 to live as we say and we will see what 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.130

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.470
 this pocket so let's see what's going on 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.269
 offer this 24th booster so we start 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.290
 with a mosquito eye that but good 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.000
 player tries to tell this story 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.860

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.180

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.170

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.590
 map that I do not see often 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.600

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.000
 simba the lion king la on his rock 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.070

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.030
 remained the trainer's mail did 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.160

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.370
 already by owen seagulls a rare and the 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.100

 I do not know it's not my stuff not 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.690
 more than that I stayed on the sheet 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.550
 what do you think it's for that 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.320
 a dragon and in addition there is the graph 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.850

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.840
 I feel the 10.6 ultra and must 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.200
 stay an ultra on the last twelve 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.000
