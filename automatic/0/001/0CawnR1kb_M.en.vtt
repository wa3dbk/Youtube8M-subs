00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.310
 must be cleaned eviscerated a 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.920
 you snowed all the blood well and that if 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.410
 his strange no has gone bitter 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.360
 written a neighbor arrived we will go to 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.349
 reach the roar first 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.629

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.510
 tomato puree 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:48.599
 we will fill with water at 12 degrees 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.670
 I went to do it then we will know 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.430
 we will wait who takes position e 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.000
 we will cook c for about 20 minutes 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.459
 before long the long has finished the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.409
 cooking of 25 years that I looked like 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.700
 softened that coming to clean the 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.079
 stake to stay in the fire and I'll get 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.069
 my blog 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:17.620
 then to lean on a nice step myself 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.659
 so this ios how i see it enough 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.480
 liquid aware that the outcome of 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.810
 checks that I turn on really do 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.120
 cleaning the blog or maybe continuing 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.489
 to evaporate excess water and now 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.889
 I'll go to clean the blog I'll wait for two 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.840
 minutes to cool down because yes 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.970
 sell activists or in hands and there 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.849
 let's see when it has cooled a little 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.720
 we did that already has so much ours 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.200
 group 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.079
 then I will go to practice castellardo i 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.410
 at the valleys the meat we will use to make 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:56.169
 our subjects who see one 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.720
 skin as he said you have to cricket at 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.879
 reason in the world because there is this l viii 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.919
 which delbono all this network 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.199
 all bonami that to the part of the head 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:08.500
 a part less to marry a bus than not 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:11.579
 we will be careful to raise all those 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.579
 fat more 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.889
 later with speaks our pigeon e 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.860
 It detected all also ruined him 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.139
 bits of indy as you see here on the 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.780
 group would like the Rome hurts you 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.130
 just take a little all the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.770
 small piece of gone down in the sauce 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.470
 this little reaction will have to 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.820
 practically all the 10 scattered 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.880
 minutes in a few hours our up 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.720
 bettino will be ready to season in 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.720
 ours but also today 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.860
 bring to a boil just soft not 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.060

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.280
 retired well that you find how much 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.710
 water there were left slightly a bit 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.410
 the tenant because then when the choice 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.169
 inside the dough to mix well 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.570
 the other second tablet is to be done 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.650
 of the ingredients but the salt and food of 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:18.550
 sure then go and heal a moment 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:22.180
 I 'm going to mix it on the couch 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.680
 ideals our goal is ready and 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.229
 beautiful and done 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.690
 I wish there was only there first course 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.539
 ahead I put the water to boil for the 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:37.960
 sea with maccheroncini that I will go to tip 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:42.400

 even if it arrives no 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.650
 when perfect we expect only that 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.100
 the cooking is over I recommend the 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.110
 I would recommend it to leverage at par 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.919
 minutes before because I said it left 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:08.310
 the cimino a little liquidino so will end the 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.710
 cooking inside at 5 we will jump inside 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.810

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.580
 error marks have a 10 minutes of 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.360
 cooking however said a couple more 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.990
 first try the grabbed schoolchildren who a 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:27.229
 Comic book is always convenient to be able to 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:32.570
 exhilarating both a little and just turn up badly 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:36.449
 that seems like a boil here 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:39.479
 that we're going to mix this for a moment 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:41.610
 special girl themes as you see 8 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.039
 left liquid on purpose because it has 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.000
 need to mix the pasta 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.310
 bouncer 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 right now and serves as a 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.510
 binder to our support 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.669
 here is our pasta as you can see 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.789

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:06.599
 precise molineaux grip on the eve 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:11.990
 drip to form create our own 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:15.060
 thought and now there is only one thing to do 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:20.240
 it's all they eat but before I still have to 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:24.479
 need but the hotel is because then there is the 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.120
 our dirty figure and the data work that 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.789
 they also activate another initiative 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.060
 libeccio that from a bit of tail this 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:34.700
