00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to get a goal there and got my head

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.149 
to get a goal there and got my head
around<00:01:39.750> talk<00:01:40.079> about<00:01:40.290> didn't<00:01:40.680> manage<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> be

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
around talk about didn't manage to be

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.359 
around talk about didn't manage to be
the<00:01:41.280> keeper<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.439> also<00:01:43.439> gain<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:43.920> shots<00:01:44.189> on

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the keeper and also gain more shots on

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.530 
the keeper and also gain more shots on
target<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:44.700> sushi<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.119> thought<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.479> would

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
target with sushi I thought it would

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
target with sushi I thought it would
have<00:01:45.689> scored<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.350> he<00:01:46.590> didn't<00:01:46.950> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
have scored there but he didn't and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.460 
have scored there but he didn't and
unfortunately<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:48.600> lost<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.899> game<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.259> nil

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
unfortunately we lost the game one nil

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
unfortunately we lost the game one nil
so<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.920> kind<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.189> frustrated<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> just

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so I was kind of frustrated that I just

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
so I was kind of frustrated that I just
one<00:01:51.299> well<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.740> from<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> stats

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
one well as you can see from the stats

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.280 
one well as you can see from the stats
right<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:54.149> I'd<00:01:54.329> dominated<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
right there I think I'd dominated the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.380 
right there I think I'd dominated the
game<00:01:55.439> under<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.950> deserved<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.579> bit<00:01:56.939> more<00:01:57.180> from

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
game under I deserved a bit more from

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.020 
game under I deserved a bit more from
not<00:01:57.570> than<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> loss<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.560> least<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.009> draw<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.460> em

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
not than a loss at least a draw for em

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.819 
not than a loss at least a draw for em
we<00:02:00.810> didn't<00:02:01.079> manage<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> come<00:02:01.469> out<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.649> that

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
we didn't manage to come out with that

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.289 
we didn't manage to come out with that
but<00:02:02.100> once<00:02:02.790> again<00:02:03.060> eh<00:02:03.780> ease<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.909> another<00:02:05.909> 15

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
but once again eh ease and another 15

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.350 
but once again eh ease and another 15
minutes<00:02:06.659> wasted<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.259> my<00:02:07.409> life<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.119> what<00:02:09.119> I'm

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
minutes wasted of my life and what I'm

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.969 
minutes wasted of my life and what I'm
kind<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.020> relieved<00:02:10.289> because<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.590> didn't<00:02:10.860> get

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
kind of relieved because I didn't get

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.040 
kind of relieved because I didn't get
lost<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> think<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:12.810> of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
lost and so I think that kind of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.110 
lost and so I think that kind of
sitting<00:02:13.470> out<00:02:13.560> things<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.520> didn't<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.060> a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
sitting out things out I didn't get a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.610 
sitting out things out I didn't get a
loss<00:02:15.330> for<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.870> same<00:02:16.140> way<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.320> didn't<00:02:16.560> get

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
loss for that the same way I didn't get

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.740 
loss for that the same way I didn't get
the<00:02:16.710> win<00:02:16.830> from<00:02:17.010> my<00:02:17.160> previous<00:02:17.370> game<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.030> moving

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
the win from my previous game so moving

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.920 
the win from my previous game so moving
on<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.050> next<00:02:19.200> day<00:02:19.560> after<00:02:19.800> after<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.930> two

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
on to the next day after after and two

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.900 
on to the next day after after and two
games<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.440> row<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.620> no<00:02:23.190> coins<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.790> no

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
games in a row of no coins and no

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.820 
games in a row of no coins and no
results<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.480> decided<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:25.020> get<00:02:25.170> off<00:02:25.230> if<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
results I decided to get off if for the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.340 
results I decided to get off if for the
day<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.180> next<00:02:27.390> day<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.930> started<00:02:28.170> off

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
day and and the next day we started off

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.350 
day and and the next day we started off
against<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.860> decent<00:02:29.460> team<00:02:29.640> with<00:02:29.820> Luca<00:02:30.180> feel

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
against this decent team with Luca feel

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.230 
against this decent team with Luca feel
or<00:02:30.570> frontalis<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.410> thought<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:32.220> thought<00:02:32.940> it

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
or frontalis I thought I thought it

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000 
or frontalis I thought I thought it
would<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.480> trouble<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.960> my<00:02:34.140> opponent<00:02:34.620> did

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
would be trouble and my opponent did

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
would be trouble and my opponent did
start<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.460> trouble<00:02:35.850> me<00:02:35.970> at<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> start<00:02:36.390> he<00:02:36.600> he

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
start to trouble me at the start he he

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.690 
start to trouble me at the start he he
seemed<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> fairly<00:02:37.830> solid<00:02:38.070> player<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.640> I

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
seemed like a fairly solid player so I

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.040 
seemed like a fairly solid player so I
was<00:02:38.820> kind<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.090> nervous<00:02:39.150> going<00:02:39.540> into<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.960> game

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
was kind of nervous going into this game

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.430 
was kind of nervous going into this game
and<00:02:40.730> because<00:02:41.730> he<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.480> passing<00:02:42.840> around<00:02:43.050> just

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and because he was passing around just

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.410 
and because he was passing around just
like<00:02:43.560> me<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:43.800> by<00:02:44.580> playing<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> ball<00:02:45.240> around

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
like me and by playing the ball around

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.880 
like me and by playing the ball around
nicely<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.020> getting<00:02:46.380> some<00:02:46.620> good

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
nicely and getting some good

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.490 
nicely and getting some good
opportunities<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.850> el<00:02:48.510> sharara<00:02:48.750> manages<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
opportunities but el sharara manages to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.260 
opportunities but el sharara manages to
pick<00:02:49.650> up<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.890> first<00:02:50.100> goal<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.520> our<00:02:50.670> favor<00:02:50.940> in

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
pick up the first goal in our favor in

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.260 
pick up the first goal in our favor in
the<00:02:51.390> 17th<00:02:51.900> minute<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.440> were<00:02:53.190> one<00:02:53.400> nil<00:02:53.610> up<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
the 17th minute and were one nil up and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.880 
the 17th minute and were one nil up and
I'm<00:02:54.600> always<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.080> look<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.380> capitalize

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
I'm always going to look to capitalize

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.340 
I'm always going to look to capitalize
and<00:02:56.160> improve<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.020> was<00:02:58.050> saying

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
and improve on that but as I was saying

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.350 
and improve on that but as I was saying
our<00:02:58.560> opponent<00:02:59.070> did<00:02:59.280> manage<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.910> make<00:03:00.150> space

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
our opponent did manage to make space

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.360 
our opponent did manage to make space
for<00:03:00.420> himself<00:03:00.690> quite<00:03:01.020> nicely<00:03:01.320> at<00:03:01.620> times<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.130> he

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
for himself quite nicely at times and he

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.830 
for himself quite nicely at times and he
was<00:03:02.520> fairly<00:03:02.730> unlucky<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.300> miss<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.660> with

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
was fairly unlucky to miss that with

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.470 
was fairly unlucky to miss that with
Lukaku<00:03:04.230> right<00:03:04.650> there<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.520> I'm<00:03:06.120> not<00:03:06.180> gonna

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
Lukaku right there but I'm not gonna

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.760 
Lukaku right there but I'm not gonna
complain<00:03:06.810> I'm<00:03:06.960> just<00:03:07.170> gonna<00:03:07.260> go<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.560> try<00:03:07.650> and

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
complain I'm just gonna go and try and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.630 
complain I'm just gonna go and try and
punish<00:03:08.010> him<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.370> we<00:03:08.910> do<00:03:09.120> exactly<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
from the stats I actually was surprised

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.540 
from the stats I actually was surprised
that<00:04:07.020> how<00:04:07.290> much<00:04:07.470> had<00:04:07.620> dominated<00:04:07.950> him<00:04:08.190> because

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
that how much had dominated him because

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.850 
that how much had dominated him because
my<00:04:09.060> opponent<00:04:09.510> he<00:04:09.750> did<00:04:10.110> seem<00:04:10.380> like<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> really

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
my opponent he did seem like a really

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.710 
my opponent he did seem like a really
solid<00:04:11.160> player<00:04:11.489> at<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.730> start<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.510> thought

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
solid player at the start and I thought

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.900 
solid player at the start and I thought
it<00:04:12.900> was<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.050> lot<00:04:13.530> more<00:04:13.560> even<00:04:14.100> than<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:14.700> i

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
it was a lot more even than that but i

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.360 
it was a lot more even than that but i
guess<00:04:15.480> not<00:04:15.510> as<00:04:15.989> we<00:04:16.169> start<00:04:16.440> from<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.739> stats<00:04:17.040> and

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
guess not as we start from the stats and

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.220 
guess not as we start from the stats and
we<00:04:17.580> actually<00:04:17.850> get<00:04:18.239> points<00:04:18.600> today<00:04:18.750> woohoo

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
we actually get points today woohoo

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.840 
we actually get points today woohoo
finally<00:04:19.830> no<00:04:20.190> more<00:04:20.220> eh<00:04:20.580> ease<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.289> finally<00:04:22.289> the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
finally no more eh ease and finally the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.010 
finally no more eh ease and finally the
results<00:04:23.850> were<00:04:23.970> registering<00:04:24.419> but<00:04:24.690> we<00:04:24.780> come<00:04:24.930> up

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020

because<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:49.070> threat<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.340> bony<00:04:49.670> and<00:04:50.000> drug

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
because the threat of bony and drug

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.240 
because the threat of bony and drug
world<00:04:50.480> front<00:04:50.780> kinda<00:04:51.200> did<00:04:51.380> intimidate<00:04:51.920> me<00:04:52.070> and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
world front kinda did intimidate me and

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.330 
world front kinda did intimidate me and
I<00:04:52.910> thought<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.450> those<00:04:53.810> two<00:04:54.140> would<00:04:54.380> destroy

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
I thought that those two would destroy

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.420 
I thought that those two would destroy
me<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.640> be<00:04:55.760> honest<00:04:56.060> though<00:04:56.390> I<00:04:56.660> was<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.650> was<00:04:58.160> kind

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
me to be honest though I was I was kind

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.480 
me to be honest though I was I was kind
of<00:04:58.580> nervous<00:04:58.820> but<00:04:59.680> after<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.800> after<00:05:01.130> scoring

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
of nervous but after the after scoring

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.250
