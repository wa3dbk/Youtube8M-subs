00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello good to all friends and white and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.089
 welcome once more to my channel this 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.599
 it's going to be my first opinion video 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.519
 thanks to your questions and your 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.799
 curiosities and well this is going to be the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.299
 first question what will I answer 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.920
 he says I wonder why the youtube 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.720
 to the extent that 300 go they tend to 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 switch to xbox I do not have any 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.289
 inconvenient on playstation3 28-7 and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.420
 hamÃ¡s teams squad but so 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.699
 I see in the graphics and the gameplay in 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 the same if you could treat that topic to me 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.019
 I would be that the natural greetings and follow 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.980
 so bird a fake font sanchez is his 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.420
 name is worth 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.540
 Well I'll talk about this topic 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.130
 valentine I think the main reason 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 because the authors who have 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.700
 Playstation3 is purchased on the equipment 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.130
 Now I'm going to talk about buying it or 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 change console I think it's because 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.120
 have more variety of games and have the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.400
 two main consoles around 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.050
 world we play is worth it because it's true that 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.140
 if they have the two consoles they open 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.660
 many possibilities to play with others 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.150
 Youtubers to play other games that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.200
 only an exclusive playstation 3 no 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.700
 could it be worth 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.830
 there was a time for example I remember 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.090
 with him already software three tx post was a 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.950
 authentic barbarity 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.289
 that for example , nobody knows 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.270
 repays an egg but for example when 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.399
 there is a good exclusive game of x possesses 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.229
 that on YouTube is a bomb all the 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.479
 world wants to see those videos of those 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.060
 games is worth it and I think the first thing is 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.799
 the exclusivity is worth of the people 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.259
 The equipment is purchased mainly 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.600
 then it's another story because 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.569
 for example when you can call 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.580
 duty played to playstation 3 and xbox and 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:37.460
 touch to recognize it goes a lot better he 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.690
 Internet is true that the internet 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.840
 of this payment but pussy 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.250
 I think it's convenient to pay for how much 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.650
 it costs me well and in fact I always 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.260
 I buy the cards on ebay worth 12 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.390
 months it can cost me 30 euros which are 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.540
 less than three euros per month for a 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.220
 internet that goes a lot better and is what 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.230
 what happens when you are a youtuber and 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.650
 you want to make good games for 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.480
 you usually go to what is best easier 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.490
 you go to the easiest and sylvester a 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.340
 console has better collection because not 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.080
 and besides, everyone was 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.660
 changing equipment for that reason by the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.300
 connection by the connection theme forgiveness 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.400
 beds but a very clear sentence and after 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.070
 also apart is the theme that had 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.310
 playstation3 in xbox at the moment has not 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.930
 there have been no failures of that kind 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.170
 imagine you as youtuber that only 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.380
 you have the xbox and that this is a month and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.180
 medium without xbox would be a whore gave a lot 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.040
 sung at 40 it's microsoft because it 's 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.990
 only at the moment I have the xbox 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.180
 although it's true I want the playstation3 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.480
 I had it a while but I spent the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.480
 games 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.970
 but 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.970
 what was said 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.740
 If you do poorly on the internet and youtube 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.140
 willy thank goodness he had departure 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.150
 saved there are people who at least like 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.220
 I go to the limit, we record the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.800
 things a half hour before uploading or 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.050
 the day before and if you are not going 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.470
 console because maybe that distrust 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.740
 that has favored your nikon then with those 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.080
 hacking bugs also did more than 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.660
 everything will change and also I keep saying 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.820
 the same with a better internet and also 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.920
 with the possibilities that gives you xbox 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.780
 live for example to it can be 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.600
 see channels and until recently the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.720
 hit of tve was free and it costs you very 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.940
 little if the skins I think that as far as 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.640
 to variety tx in case they also offer you 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.709
 a lot more games and what's said on 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.330
 internet is going much better but I think 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.530
 which is the main reason why the 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.540
 people are changed apart from the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.840
 exclusivity as youtube is to have it 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.380
 two consoles have an internet that goes 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.150
 to that fable is the best thing or is already you remove 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.740
 that the command maybe you do not like it 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.840
 so much 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.120
 Well I do not know if you have less friends in 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.980
 xbox being youtuber you know that the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.660
 console that best goes with the ones that best 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.330
 games you will get out of course with 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.620
 which you will enjoy more so 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.410
 So I think you have summarized it 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.110
 pretty good internet exclusivity 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.330
 on the internet, sorry, I think they are from 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.240
 the two key factors because people 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.400
 you want to lose xbox and now as 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.950
 few play playstation 3 x moles 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.540
 of cambias xbox you stay good people 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.160
 I hope you liked this one 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.320
 video the truth I tried to summarize 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.020
 in the best possible way I think that 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.370
 it has been understandable to me and you already know 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.380
 for the next issue you have to vote 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.030
 in the comments and I'm going to talk about that 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.100
 theme ok I hope you liked it 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.510
 this initiative this comment we 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.080
 we see in the next video a greeting and 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.080
 until next time
