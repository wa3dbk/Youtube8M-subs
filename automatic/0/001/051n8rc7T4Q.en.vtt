00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
toggle you know whatever the alternate

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.829

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
setup that you have right there that was

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.669 
setup that you have right there that was
a<00:00:46.899> 404<00:00:47.620> um<00:00:47.890> key<00:00:48.309> keyboard<00:00:48.609> including<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.679> side

a 404 um key keyboard including the side
number<00:00:50.920> pad<00:00:51.280> here<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:51.789> probably<00:00:52.269> two<00:00:52.539> things

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
number pad here so probably two things

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.029 
number pad here so probably two things
really<00:00:52.989> looking<00:00:53.199> at<00:00:53.289> first<00:00:53.499> it's<00:00:53.679> a<00:00:53.739> full-size

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
really looking at first it's a full-size

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.410 
really looking at first it's a full-size
keyboard<00:00:54.309> which<00:00:54.670> might<00:00:54.819> be<00:00:54.940> something<00:00:55.269> you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
keyboard which might be something you

keyboard which might be something you
know<00:00:55.510> you're<00:00:55.659> interested<00:00:55.870> in<00:00:56.370> compared<00:00:57.370> to

know you're interested in compared to
you<00:00:57.819> know<00:00:57.909> let's<00:00:58.089> say<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:58.479> know<00:00:58.809> Apple's

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
you know let's say you know Apple's

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.229

from<00:01:15.910> Apple<00:01:16.420> I've<00:01:16.810> been<00:01:16.960> preferring<00:01:17.410> these

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
from Apple I've been preferring these

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.990 
from Apple I've been preferring these
for<00:01:17.980> a<00:01:18.010> number<00:01:18.190> of<00:01:18.250> reasons<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.610> find<00:01:18.850> them<00:01:18.940> a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
for a number of reasons I find them a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.550 
for a number of reasons I find them a
little<00:01:19.090> more<00:01:19.270> accurate<00:01:19.810> with<00:01:19.930> these<00:01:20.140> because

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
little more accurate with these because

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.890 
little more accurate with these because
the<00:01:21.310> keys<00:01:21.490> are<00:01:21.520> sculpted<00:01:22.150> so<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.480> can<00:01:22.630> sort<00:01:22.840> of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
the keys are sculpted so you can sort of

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.750 
the keys are sculpted so you can sort of
you<00:01:23.290> know<00:01:23.350> put<00:01:23.590> your<00:01:23.710> key<00:01:23.950> your<00:01:24.190> finger<00:01:24.550> right

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
you know put your key your finger right

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.030 
you know put your key your finger right
into<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.750> area<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.110> get<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.230> good<00:01:26.410> feel<00:01:26.440> on

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
into the area and get a good feel on

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.130 
into the area and get a good feel on
where<00:01:27.280> each<00:01:27.430> key<00:01:27.760> is<00:01:27.880> without<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.660> really<00:01:28.990> you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
where each key is without and really you

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.570 
where each key is without and really you
know<00:01:29.200> look<00:01:29.380> down<00:01:29.560> at<00:01:29.710> your<00:01:29.860> fingers<00:01:30.190> I<00:01:30.370> guess

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
know look down at your fingers I guess

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.690 
know look down at your fingers I guess
and<00:01:30.820> then<00:01:31.360> also<00:01:32.340> you're<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.370> having

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
and then also you're just having

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.130 
and then also you're just having
separate<00:01:34.000> keys<00:01:34.240> seem<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.750> give<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.960> little

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
separate keys seem to give a little

actually<00:02:43.720> two<00:02:43.870> plugs<00:02:44.170> which<00:02:44.439> is<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> little

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
actually two plugs which is a little

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.289 
actually two plugs which is a little
unusual<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.760> know<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:45.879> haven't<00:02:46.030> seen<00:02:46.180> this

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
unusual I you know I haven't seen this

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.750 
unusual I you know I haven't seen this
anywhere<00:02:46.569> else<00:02:46.629> went<00:02:46.959> with<00:02:47.079> das<00:02:47.290> keyboard<00:02:47.760> you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
anywhere else went with das keyboard you

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.309 
anywhere else went with das keyboard you
have<00:02:48.879> two<00:02:49.090> USB<00:02:49.269> plugs<00:02:49.690> once<00:02:49.930> for<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.140> keyboard

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
have two USB plugs once for the keyboard

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.960 
have two USB plugs once for the keyboard
so<00:02:50.650> if<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:50.769> just<00:02:50.920> plug<00:02:51.099> one<00:02:51.159> in<00:02:51.640> it'll

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so if you just plug one in it'll

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.849 
so if you just plug one in it'll
function<00:02:52.150> as<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.450> standard<00:02:52.840> keyboard<00:02:53.079> but<00:02:53.739> the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
function as a standard keyboard but the

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.319 
function as a standard keyboard but the
USB<00:02:54.220> hub<00:02:54.250> will<00:02:54.579> not<00:02:54.790> work<00:02:54.970> you'll<00:02:55.180> need<00:02:55.209> to

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
USB hub will not work you'll need to

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.599 
USB hub will not work you'll need to
plug<00:02:55.540> in<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.780> second<00:02:56.170> i<00:02:56.290> plug<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:57.010> order<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.489> get

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
plug in a second i plug in order to get

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.069 
plug in a second i plug in order to get
that<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.909> work<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.450> will<00:02:58.629> take<00:02:58.780> up<00:02:58.900> two

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
that to work so this will take up two

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.319 
that to work so this will take up two
plugs<00:02:59.349> it'll<00:02:59.829> give<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.040> -<00:03:00.190> hum<00:03:00.459> -<00:03:00.760> hub<00:03:01.060> plugs

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
plugs it'll give you - hum - hub plugs

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.899 
plugs it'll give you - hum - hub plugs

like I said each one of these is an
actual<00:03:28.470> mechanical<00:03:29.470> key<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.910> when<00:03:31.480> you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
actual mechanical key and you when you

actual mechanical key and you when you
press<00:03:31.750> them<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:31.989> does<00:03:32.109> two<00:03:32.290> things<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.769> gives<00:03:32.919> a

sound and then also you get a little

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.289 
sound and then also you get a little
tactile<00:03:35.829> feel<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:36.639> it's<00:03:36.879> kind<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.150> little

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
tactile feel to it it's kind of a little

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.759 
tactile feel to it it's kind of a little
bit<00:03:37.449> of<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.629> you<00:03:37.870> start<00:03:38.109> pushing<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.410> down<00:03:38.530> and

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
bit of a you start pushing it down and

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.830 
bit of a you start pushing it down and
partway<00:03:38.949> down<00:03:39.069> you<00:03:39.340> get<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.489> click<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.660> get

partway down you get a click so you get

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.449 
partway down you get a click so you get
a<00:03:40.870> good<00:03:41.109> idea<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:42.040> made<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.310> connection

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
a good idea that you made the connection

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.580 
a good idea that you made the connection
now<00:03:43.359> for<00:03:43.569> me<00:03:43.690> personally<00:03:43.720> when<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.260> use<00:03:44.440> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
now for me personally when I use the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.680 
now for me personally when I use the
rubber<00:03:44.769> dome<00:03:45.099> ones<00:03:45.370> not<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:45.940> much<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.359> chiclet

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
rubber dome ones not so much the chiclet

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.330 
rubber dome ones not so much the chiclet
keyboards<00:03:47.109> because<00:03:47.319> these<00:03:47.680> don't<00:03:48.040> actually

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
keyboards because these don't actually

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.740 
keyboards because these don't actually
really<00:03:48.609> give<00:03:48.879> all<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.150> much<00:03:49.359> at<00:03:49.480> all<00:03:49.569> but

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
really give all that much at all but

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.839 
really give all that much at all but
some<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.109> other<00:03:50.290> ones<00:03:50.699> they're<00:03:51.699> a<00:03:51.730> little

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
some of the other ones they're a little

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.119 
some of the other ones they're a little
more<00:03:51.970> mushy<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.690> my<00:03:53.079> fingers<00:03:53.410> get<00:03:53.560> tired<00:03:53.829> it's

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
more mushy I my fingers get tired it's

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.250 
more mushy I my fingers get tired it's
just<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.459> way<00:03:54.849> it<00:03:55.000> goes<00:03:55.180> because<00:03:55.419> I<00:03:55.750> feel<00:03:56.230> like

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
just the way it goes because I feel like

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.509 
just the way it goes because I feel like
I<00:03:56.379> have<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.530> push<00:03:56.739> harder<00:03:57.129> than<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.340> necessarily

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
I have to push harder than I necessarily

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.729 
I have to push harder than I necessarily
have<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.120> because<00:03:58.389> I<00:03:58.419> have<00:03:58.599> no<00:03:58.780> feedback<00:03:59.079> the

have to because I have no feedback the

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.229 
have to because I have no feedback the
keys<00:03:59.949> not<00:04:00.159> really<00:04:00.370> bottoming<00:04:00.760> out<00:04:00.879> I'm<00:04:01.120> not

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
keys not really bottoming out I'm not

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.580 
keys not really bottoming out I'm not
getting<00:04:01.510> any<00:04:01.629> sound<00:04:01.870> I'm<00:04:02.079> not<00:04:02.199> getting<00:04:02.470> any

getting any sound I'm not getting any

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.409 
getting any sound I'm not getting any
idea<00:04:02.919> that<00:04:03.069> I'm<00:04:03.159> actually<00:04:03.310> hitting<00:04:03.970> that<00:04:04.180> key

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
idea that I'm actually hitting that key

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.970 
idea that I'm actually hitting that key
and<00:04:04.629> after<00:04:05.109> a<00:04:05.260> while<00:04:05.379> those<00:04:05.590> world<00:04:05.829> rubber

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
and after a while those world rubber

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.379 
and after a while those world rubber
dome<00:04:06.250> things<00:04:06.489> seem<00:04:06.669> to<00:04:06.699> wear<00:04:06.970> out<00:04:07.180> where<00:04:07.299> you

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
dome things seem to wear out where you

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.819 
dome things seem to wear out where you
actually<00:04:07.540> have<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.840> press<00:04:08.379> them<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.590> little<00:04:08.739> bit

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
actually have to press them a little bit

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.800 
actually have to press them a little bit
harder<00:04:09.129> just<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.370> get<00:04:09.519> them<00:04:09.639> to<00:04:09.760> respond<00:04:10.239> but

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
harder just to get them to respond but

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.059 
harder just to get them to respond but
the<00:04:10.900> mechanical<00:04:11.379> keyboard<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:11.769> have<00:04:11.799> two

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
the mechanical keyboard you have two

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.460 
the mechanical keyboard you have two
levels<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.609> feedback<00:04:13.299> that<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.840> touch<00:04:14.079> the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
levels of feedback that the touch the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.869 
levels of feedback that the touch the
tactile<00:04:14.829> feel<00:04:15.129> when<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.519> get<00:04:15.639> that<00:04:15.760> little

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
tactile feel when you get that little

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.149 
tactile feel when you get that little
click<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.389> then<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.840> actual<00:04:17.229> sound<00:04:17.590> of<00:04:17.769> the

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
click and then the actual sound of the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.310 
click and then the actual sound of the
of<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.639> click<00:04:18.880> now<00:04:19.150> let<00:04:19.239> me<00:04:19.329> put<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:19.959> up<00:04:20.169> here

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
of the click now let me put that up here

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.159 
general appearance doesn't light up and
make<00:06:09.490> goofy<00:06:10.029> green<00:06:10.300> lights<00:06:10.629> if<00:06:10.839> that's<00:06:11.020> what

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
make goofy green lights if that's what

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.899 
make goofy green lights if that's what
you're<00:06:11.289> looking<00:06:11.560> for<00:06:11.800> in<00:06:12.250> price<00:06:12.550> point<00:06:12.789> of

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
you're looking for in price point of

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.129 
you're looking for in price point of
course<00:06:13.120> so<00:06:13.330> first<00:06:13.779> thing<00:06:13.930> I<00:06:14.020> would<00:06:14.080> recommend

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
course so first thing I would recommend

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.219 
course so first thing I would recommend
just<00:06:14.770> looking<00:06:15.039> at<00:06:15.190> that<00:06:15.339> at<00:06:16.060> the<00:06:16.120> key<00:06:16.449> switch

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
just looking at that at the key switch

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.659 
just looking at that at the key switch
and<00:06:17.440> decide<00:06:17.710> if<00:06:17.860> that's<00:06:18.009> one<00:06:18.219> that<00:06:18.339> you<00:06:18.460> like

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
and decide if that's one that you like

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.249 
and decide if that's one that you like
it's<00:06:18.849> very<00:06:19.000> much<00:06:19.180> a<00:06:19.210> personal<00:06:19.629> preference<00:06:19.930> out

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:20.259 
it's very much a personal preference out

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.439 
it's very much a personal preference out
there<00:06:20.469> and<00:06:20.710> me<00:06:21.190> for<00:06:21.610> this<00:06:21.699> has<00:06:21.879> a<00:06:21.909> real<00:06:22.210> light

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
there and me for this has a real light

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.050 
there and me for this has a real light
real<00:06:22.810> light<00:06:23.289> click<00:06:24.009> to<00:06:24.219> it<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.550> generally<00:06:25.029> I

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
real light click to it and generally I

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.999 
real light click to it and generally I
do<00:06:25.509> I'd<00:06:25.750> type<00:06:25.960> faster<00:06:26.409> on<00:06:26.560> it<00:06:26.710> it<00:06:26.830> gives<00:06:26.919> you

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
do I'd type faster on it it gives you

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.159 
do I'd type faster on it it gives you
the<00:06:27.069> appearance<00:06:27.520> of<00:06:27.610> typing<00:06:27.909> faster<00:06:28.389> but<00:06:29.020> you

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
the appearance of typing faster but you

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.510 
the appearance of typing faster but you
actually<00:06:29.349> do<00:06:29.589> type<00:06:29.830> faster<00:06:30.219> and<00:06:30.310> I<00:06:30.339> think

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
actually do type faster and I think

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.980 
actually do type faster and I think
there's<00:06:30.669> actually<00:06:30.789> the<00:06:31.060> world<00:06:31.270> record<00:06:31.659> is<00:06:31.810> on

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
there's actually the world record is on

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.839 
there's actually the world record is on
this<00:06:32.229> so<00:06:32.889> there's<00:06:33.219> definitely<00:06:33.310> a<00:06:33.550> speed

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
this so there's definitely a speed

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.790 
this so there's definitely a speed
advantage<00:06:33.880> with<00:06:34.509> that<00:06:34.539> but<00:06:35.080> me<00:06:35.229> personally<00:06:35.469> I

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
advantage with that but me personally I

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.450 
advantage with that but me personally I
prefer<00:06:36.069> a<00:06:36.550> little<00:06:36.909> bit

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
prefer a little bit

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.790 
prefer a little bit
I'm<00:06:38.000> hard<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.330> click<00:06:38.630> on<00:06:38.780> it<00:06:38.930> and<00:06:38.960> we've<00:06:39.590> used

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
I'm hard to click on it and we've used

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.809 
I'm hard to click on it and we've used
some<00:06:39.919> of<00:06:39.949> these<00:06:40.039> other<00:06:40.220> keyboards<00:06:40.580> give<00:06:40.729> you

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:40.819 
some of these other keyboards give you

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:42.790 
some of these other keyboards give you
an<00:06:40.880> idea<00:06:41.030> just<00:06:41.780> because<00:06:41.990> I<00:06:42.050> still<00:06:42.289> tend<00:06:42.710> to

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
an idea just because I still tend to

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.529 
an idea just because I still tend to
incidentally<00:06:43.610> hit<00:06:43.850> some<00:06:44.090> of<00:06:44.120> these<00:06:44.240> sometimes

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
incidentally hit some of these sometimes

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:45.730 
incidentally hit some of these sometimes
and<00:06:44.930> I<00:06:44.960> feel<00:06:44.990> like<00:06:45.229> it<00:06:45.319> was<00:06:45.410> a<00:06:45.470> little<00:06:45.650> bit

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
and I feel like it was a little bit

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.070 
and I feel like it was a little bit
stiffer<00:06:46.550> click<00:06:46.819> that<00:06:47.000> may<00:06:47.180> not<00:06:47.330> be<00:06:47.389> I'm<00:06:47.780> doing

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
stiffer click that may not be I'm doing

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.020 
stiffer click that may not be I'm doing
that<00:06:48.169> necessarily<00:06:48.830> but<00:06:49.340> it's<00:06:49.639> still<00:06:49.849> better

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
that necessarily but it's still better

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.879 
that necessarily but it's still better
than<00:06:50.150> the<00:06:50.300> the<00:06:50.840> old<00:06:51.080> chiclet<00:06:51.410> style<00:06:51.440> keyboard

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
than the the old chiclet style keyboard

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.409 
than the the old chiclet style keyboard
so<00:06:52.190> it's<00:06:52.310> definitely<00:06:52.669> you<00:06:52.849> know<00:06:52.940> an<00:06:53.000> upgrade

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
so it's definitely you know an upgrade

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:54.610 
so it's definitely you know an upgrade
but<00:06:53.599> that<00:06:53.840> light<00:06:54.080> touch

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
but that light touch

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.279 
but that light touch
sometimes<00:06:55.220> trips<00:06:55.669> me<00:06:55.880> up<00:06:55.970> a<00:06:56.000> little<00:06:56.210> bit<00:06:56.539> but

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
sometimes trips me up a little bit but

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:58.990 
sometimes trips me up a little bit but
overall<00:06:57.560> nice<00:06:58.039> mechanical<00:06:58.639> keyboard

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000
