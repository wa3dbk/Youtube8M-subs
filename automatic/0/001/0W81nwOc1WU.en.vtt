00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.610
 migaud hello my desert so 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.009
 external portrait photographer 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.750
 portrait of this portrait is what you 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.460
 can we give advice will we 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.869
 explain what is a good photo 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:31.339
 portrait a good portrait 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.680
 it's a portrait asked even when 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.440
 we improvise even when it's pictures 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.900
 be soaring 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.370
 it's there is an intention and when I 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.120
 say it's the agreement on a fact 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.550
 which counts me so I think for 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.110
 good professional profiles for 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.690
 profits for the networks to get 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.380
 to present a good portrait is a 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.900
 portrait that exudes kindness 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.900
 because because why someone 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.060
 would go on your listing by seeing a 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.770
 photo is because he would have found 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.140
 a certain interest of the genres in the 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.580
 photo and a caring photo 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:17.570
 he is someone who is open-minded 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:19.490
 and after the card confirms so the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.880
 all the statistics only shows us that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.570
 the cards with with dad photos are 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.420
 much more consulted and and have 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.190
 a lot of impact 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.040
 rather than those who have no 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.090
 so to do your portrait without getting 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.720
 take seriously 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.060
 so I prefer you to prepare 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.409
 you have to start by looking for the place 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.740
 in which you will do your 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:53.490
 your photo avoid the spaces too 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.619
 loaded it must be the subject of your 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 photo this is your you are your 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.520
 face so avoid doing them in the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.710
 cooking in saloum with a bunch of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.320
 photos behind finally pictures of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.200
 works of art even if it's beautiful 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.209
 that's not the goal to find a wall 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.720
 white any time by a square the better 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.250
 and if we have a meter ten of walls 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.600
 whites in everything as you can the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.269
 to see that is largely enough to make a 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:28.230
 portrait after the second stage prepare 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:32.690
 yourself an already dressed up you a little 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.579
 little better than bed if you are 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.060
 if you are looking for a job in the 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.310
 bank 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.890
 take care to put a little shirt 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.829
 for girls to put a euro over 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.829
 to heal ironing the best product 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.160
 wearing a hairdresser or for real 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.180
 not just with the hands and can 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.790
 just to put aside 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.610
 thousand emma you for boys we 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.239
 lead a small powder to avoid 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.300
 shine is needed for casks 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.250
 makeup 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.770
 when you go out it's not worth it 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.050
 do a very evening makeup 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.580
 loaded but you have to be makeup it 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.800
 must ensure the safe must 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.960
 your delay is 5 and it must 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.130
 the student will be slightly more pink and 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.650
 than usual 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.140
 the picture does not allow you to have 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.800
 advice for laying for the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.010
 posture on our all of course the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.150
 wheels to ask it's better to be two 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.490
 whoever will press the button and 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.810
 one that will be photographed the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.520
 retarders it's always very 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.100
 complex so avoid doing this all 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.680
 only avoid also portrait eggs 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.610
 front right or in the mirror and its 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.360
 professional ranks so proposed this is 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.370
 still quite simple the most problem 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.900
 when we ask its designers to do with 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.280
 his hands are what we do like that 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.960
 that we do them like that in 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.830
 boards in the hands of the blow we get 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.800
 feel I said to the afp reborn took against 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.540
 a chair story of his steps for 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.150
 another thing is especially to occupy 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.190
 your hands so you press against 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.680
 the chair and you are normal you are 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.070
 face the camera the lens at the camera 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.950
 Photo 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.290
 what you want and you look at yourself 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.090
 look quietly and you try 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.890
 to think that you are in maintenance 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:25.330
 so when we are born between them holds there is 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.220
 the nonverbal language which for that 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.630
 a lot compared to the perception 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.050
 will make world 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.720
 that is, you have to stand straight 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.449
 and slightly forward it gives a 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.220
 side of benign result for the 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.830
 little trick is that it takes 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.160
 slightly advanced the face for 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.690
 just emphasize this very broad 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.669
 it's a trick other day it's 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.240
 you can turn slightly 3 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:59.360
 If it gives a picture of old hymn you 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.240
 me more dynamic of the photo is 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.370
 the same one bows slightly towards his 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.340
 interlocutor as if you want 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.900
 bet and girls like that slightly 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:16.400
 forward face for boys 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.260
 it's always good to be face when we 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.530
 is in front of the camera we seem more 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.240
 wide for aggression that's good and 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.729
 so do not hesitate to put yourself in 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.300
 phase glued arms why lenclud 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.270
 look good group and especially especially 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.889
 especially you are boy girl than 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.760
 you are three quarters or front 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:41.720
 do not back down when you go back 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.639
 already we give an impression of hindsight 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.160
 will not want to go to you if you 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.270
 back away is also it's a double 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.630
 chin that is beautiful 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.889
 So you will not see back picture 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.330
 your router speakers maybe he 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.630
 would like to go back doubling rate but 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.849
 not before 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.150
 so you have to be in the picture 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.480
 slightly message their mom 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.210
 slightly your time thanks for these 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.750
 advice soon 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.750
 see you soon
