00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
was another low level like him I I don't

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.969 
was another low level like him I I don't
know<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.479> he's<00:01:12.600> new<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.960> game<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.710> but

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.850 
know if he's new to the game or what but
they<00:01:14.549> kept<00:01:14.820> hiding<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> dark<00:01:16.200> corners<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
they kept hiding in the dark corners and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
they kept hiding in the dark corners and
I<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> problem<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
I have a problem with that because the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.969 
I have a problem with that because the
HD<00:01:19.140> PVR<00:01:19.170> only<00:01:20.009> outputs<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.670> 720p<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
HD PVR only outputs on 720p so the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
HD PVR only outputs on 720p so the
picture<00:01:23.189> quality<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> game<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.659> like

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
picture quality on now the game is like

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.679 
picture quality on now the game is like
much<00:01:25.500> worse<00:01:25.830> than<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.030> know<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> regular

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
much worse than it you know the regular

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.420 
much worse than it you know the regular
1080<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:28.860> most<00:01:28.979> people<00:01:29.369> are

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
1080 that I think most people are

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.940 
1080 that I think most people are
playing<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.479> high-definition

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
gameplay I possibly can and sometimes

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.660 
gameplay I possibly can and sometimes
it's<00:02:07.409> tough<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.520> that

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
it's tough because like I don't get that

it's tough because like I don't get that
much<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.629> rush<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:09.989> there

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
much in here I just rush out there

much in here I just rush out there
because<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.709> want<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> die<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> start<00:02:11.640> my

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
because I want to die to start my

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.180 
because I want to die to start my
killstreaks<00:02:11.970> over<00:02:12.599> i'm<00:02:12.720> running<00:02:13.050> for<00:02:13.080> 8<00:02:13.500> 11

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.130 
killstreaks over i'm running for 8 11
it's<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.850> good<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.240> die<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.050> then

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it's a good time to die there and then

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.540

during<00:02:46.830> its<00:02:47.100> time<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.640> had<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> nice<00:02:48.000> run<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.420> I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
during its time it had a nice run and I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.780 
during its time it had a nice run and I
really<00:02:48.990> liked<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.350> game<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.860> after<00:02:50.550> black

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
really liked the game but after black

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.310 
really liked the game but after black
ops<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:51.480> kind<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.690> see<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> lot<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
ops you just kind of see a lot of the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.200 
ops you just kind of see a lot of the
issues<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.340> thing<00:02:53.580> i<00:02:53.700> will<00:02:53.730> say<00:02:53.940> i

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
issues of it but one thing i will say i

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.850 
issues of it but one thing i will say i
mean<00:02:54.480> modern<00:02:54.810> warfare<00:02:54.990> two<00:02:55.410> still

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
mean modern warfare two still

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.880 
mean modern warfare two still
graphically<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.880> better<00:02:57.630> than<00:02:57.960> black<00:02:58.260> ops<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
graphically is better than black ops and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.760 
graphically is better than black ops and
also<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.610> feels<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.300> crisp<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.650> know

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
also it just feels like crisp you know

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.530 
also it just feels like crisp you know
black<00:03:02.040> ops<00:03:02.280> feels<00:03:02.610> good<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.240> there's<00:03:03.480> just

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
black ops feels good but there's just

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.990 
black ops feels good but there's just
something<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:04.470> slightly<00:03:04.980> off<00:03:05.430> about<00:03:05.790> it

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
something that's slightly off about it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
something that's slightly off about it
you<00:03:06.090> know<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.870> mean<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.410> love<00:03:07.620> black<00:03:07.890> ops<00:03:08.190> all

you know so I mean I love black ops all
in<00:03:08.550> all<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.940> think<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.480> better<00:03:09.690> call<00:03:10.140> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
in all I think it's a better call of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.380 
in all I think it's a better call of
duty<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> number<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.850> different<00:03:11.970> reasons

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
duty for a number of different reasons

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.580 
duty for a number of different reasons
but<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:13.140> mean<00:03:14.630> modern<00:03:15.630> warfare<00:03:15.810> 2<00:03:16.140> there's<00:03:16.380> just

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
but I mean modern warfare 2 there's just

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.580 
but I mean modern warfare 2 there's just
too<00:03:16.740> many<00:03:16.890> broken<00:03:17.370> parts<00:03:18.090> about<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.200> mean

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
too many broken parts about it so I mean

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.560 
too many broken parts about it so I mean
hopefully<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.100> mean<00:03:20.310> now<00:03:20.790> there<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.330> one

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
hopefully I mean now there is that one

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.220 
hopefully I mean now there is that one
