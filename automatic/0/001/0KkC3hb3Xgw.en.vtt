00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.890
 [Music] 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.829
 we are going to need white glue 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.269
 a thread 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.320
 a balloon some ties the chocolates 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.690
 let's go to the first thing we will do is 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.280
 loosen the wolf you can use one 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.739
 teeny like this is a little bit more 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.260
 big but you do not want to use it very 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.180
 we have to put inside the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.699
 chocolates this is the part maybe more 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.100
 hard 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.960
 You can go inflating the balloon to make 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.510
 help chocolates go 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.550
 going down and entering 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.700
 there we already have all of us who are going to 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.700
 put 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.060
 let's leave it this size more or 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.890
 least we do not want it to be very big 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.470
 we make a little nudite 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.880
 and we will try to 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.490
 [Music] 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.890
 train it in this way so that it 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.080
 have the shape of eggs 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.270
 [Music] 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.070
 Now we will work with the book 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.830
 this part you're going to mess a little 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.530
 hands we have the tail diluted in a 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.860
 little water we will go dipping the thread 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.180
 and we are going to go around the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.940
 balloon 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.100
 from top to bottom to the sides 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:04.280
 Look everywhere you must 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.800
 some holes left of course 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.229
 but not so big as to be 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.830
 can escape the suckers there 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.050
 [Music] 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.990
 more or less here we already have everything 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.550
 covered 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.160
 [Music] 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:27.840
 let's now let it dry all the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.460
 night so that it hardens now look 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200
 the balloon has been deflated towards 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.160
 chicago a little bit we 're going to click 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.440
 to burst it all 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.190
 and now it's very easy because I already 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.190
 we can do 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.200
 you have to take it with the needle and you can 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.260
 take 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.580
 [Music] 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.280
 and we have the little egg 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.920

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.840
