00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
use a dotting tool this move that

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.510 
use a dotting tool this move that
then<00:01:21.890> take<00:01:22.190> some<00:01:22.460> more<00:01:22.909> white<00:01:23.210> clay<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.520> well

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
sure one end is pointed and then indent

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240 
sure one end is pointed and then indent
lines<00:01:48.660> on<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.620> going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.980> be<00:01:50.070> for

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
lines on this and it's going to be for

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
lines on this and it's going to be for
the<00:01:50.310> fox's<00:01:50.760> tail<00:01:50.900> put<00:01:51.900> this<00:01:52.050> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.710> of
