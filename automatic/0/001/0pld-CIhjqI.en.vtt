00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.099
 ok let's go and explain how the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.190
 trap cage 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:18.900
 here we have a cage made from a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.769
 blatant and wood storage was 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.849
 it is suitably lined with a net 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.140
 in plastic where they were made 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.140
 3 bulkheads 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:42.920
 then this is the first bulkhead that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 It needs to feed 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.800
 then there is a central one that now only 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.800
 rising that separates the two areas 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:04.830
 and then there's the entrance bulkhead here 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:12.330
 we have a little genius to whom a is connected 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 cable when opa euro hens 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.490
 went into this part pass let 's say the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.090
 first bulkhead the second ward a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.300
 central that they go to eat 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.920
 Now 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.660
 pulling this rope the indignant part 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.890
 away and the entrance bulkhead closes i 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:40.850
 chickens hens what is the rest not 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.800
 then it will be appropriate to move them inside 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.979
 all on one side close the bulkhead 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.830
 central is practically that remains the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:56.570
 area where they eat and sleep 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:59.570
 at the fattening this money will remain the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:07.030
 real say in a cage 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:13.010
 trap a pretty solution 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:18.820
 simple it took both a little time 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.820
 but not so overly 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 next to me we will check if 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.560
 in short, it works in principle 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.560
 there should not be any problem 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.829
 because I was finding everyone
