all<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.279> pieces<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:21.150> has<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.390> television

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
all the pieces it has the television

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
all the pieces it has the television
right<00:00:22.890> from<00:00:23.070> whatever<00:00:23.220> cable<00:00:23.730> operator<00:00:24.150> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
right from whatever cable operator and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.779 
right from whatever cable operator and
network<00:00:24.660> operator<00:00:25.140> wants<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.920> build<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.279> but

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
network operator wants to build it but

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.169 
network operator wants to build it but
then<00:00:26.910> i<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.240> get<00:00:27.390> at<00:00:27.510> movies<00:00:27.900> &amp;<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.650> music

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
then i can get at movies &amp; get it music

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.110 
then i can get at movies &amp; get it music
pictures<00:00:30.769> if<00:00:31.769> i<00:00:31.859> go<00:00:32.009> down<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.430> i<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.850> i<00:00:33.000> can

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
pictures if i go down if i go in i can

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.180 
pictures if i go down if i go in i can
look<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.329> pictures<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:34.649> i<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.739> then<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
look at pictures so what i have then is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.150 
look at pictures so what i have then is
a<00:00:35.309> platform<00:00:35.969> where<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> our<00:00:37.079> partners<00:00:37.440> can

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
a platform where one of our partners can

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.850 
a platform where one of our partners can
build<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.550> set-top<00:00:38.940> box<00:00:39.210> where<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.050> customize<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
build a set-top box where I customize it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.650 
build a set-top box where I customize it
for<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> operator<00:00:41.550> take<00:00:41.969> advantage<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.600> some

for the operator take advantage of some

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.000 
for the operator take advantage of some
of<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> software<00:00:43.230> capabilities<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.980> are

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
of the software capabilities that are

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.250 
of the software capabilities that are
inherent<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> platform<00:00:45.050> optimize<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.230> for
