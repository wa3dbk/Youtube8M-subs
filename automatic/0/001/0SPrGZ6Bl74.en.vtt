00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
figures they are great for putting the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.400 
figures they are great for putting the
different<00:00:28.830> poses<00:00:29.449> if<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.109> want<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.289> have

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
different poses if you just want to have

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.930 
different poses if you just want to have
as<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> collective<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.130> set<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.369> somewhere<00:00:32.579> as

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
as a collective just set it somewhere as

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.560 
as a collective just set it somewhere as
a<00:00:33.000> kid<00:00:33.649> or<00:00:34.649> someone<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> little<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.880> older<00:00:36.000> it's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
a kid or someone a little bit older it's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.590 
a kid or someone a little bit older it's
great<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> figures<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.739> bendable

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
great to have the figures be bendable

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
great to have the figures be bendable
just<00:00:39.600> because<00:00:39.980> some<00:00:40.980> figures<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.879> not

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
just because some figures are really not

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.569 
just because some figures are really not
in<00:00:42.329> different<00:00:42.750> toy<00:00:42.870> lines<00:00:43.110> also<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:43.950> you're<00:00:44.460> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
in different toy lines also if you're in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
in different toy lines also if you're in
stop-motion<00:00:44.930> great<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.289> for

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
stop-motion great to have for

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
stop-motion great to have for
stop-motion<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.610> pose<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
stop-motion because they can pose and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.200 
stop-motion because they can pose and
the<00:00:48.840> head<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.230> turn<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:51.000> so

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the head can turn and they can do so

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.790 
the head can turn and they can do so
much<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.390> than<00:00:51.629> most<00:00:51.930> other<00:00:52.140> action<00:00:52.500> figures

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
much more than most other action figures

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.660 
much more than most other action figures

left hand is just open so he can't

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
left hand is just open so he can't
actually<00:01:07.890> grab<00:01:08.310> onto<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> assault

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

battle<00:01:12.330> rifle<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:12.600> shotgun<00:01:14.270> as<00:01:15.270> far<00:01:15.540> as

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
battle rifle or shotgun as far as

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
battle rifle or shotgun as far as
putting<00:01:15.810> other<00:01:16.049> weapons<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.619> his<00:01:16.680> hands<00:01:17.100> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
putting other weapons in his hands I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
putting other weapons in his hands I
would<00:01:17.490> only<00:01:17.670> suggest<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.479> battle<00:01:18.780> rifle<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
would only suggest the battle rifle and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.410 
would only suggest the battle rifle and
shotgun<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.830> assault<00:01:20.549> rifle<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:21.210> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
shotgun and the assault rifle that's it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020 
shotgun and the assault rifle that's it
no<00:01:21.570> other<00:01:21.600> guns<00:01:22.100> maybe<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> plasma<00:01:23.670> pistol

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
no other guns maybe the plasma pistol

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
no other guns maybe the plasma pistol
now<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> don't<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> pistol<00:01:25.290> yet<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.740> SMG

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
now I don't have a pistol yet or an SMG

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.640 
now I don't have a pistol yet or an SMG
so<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> can't<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.820> test<00:01:27.299> those<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.500> far

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
so I can't really test those but as far

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
so I can't really test those but as far
as<00:01:28.710> anything<00:01:28.950> else<00:01:29.100> goes<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> way<00:01:29.700> his<00:01:29.909> hand

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
as anything else goes the way his hand

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
as anything else goes the way his hand
is<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.689> figure<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.200> wouldn't<00:01:31.470> suggest

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
is with this figure I wouldn't suggest

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.080 
is with this figure I wouldn't suggest
putting<00:01:32.040> anything<00:01:32.280> else<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.880> could

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
putting anything else because you could

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.140 
putting anything else because you could
possibly<00:01:33.299> break<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.840> gun<00:01:34.369> as<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.430> note<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:36.000> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
possibly break the gun as a note if this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.960 
possibly break the gun as a note if this
is<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.390> first<00:01:36.630> figure<00:01:37.369> from<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> mcfarland

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
is your first figure from the mcfarland

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.969 
is your first figure from the mcfarland
toy<00:01:39.150> line<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.689> guns<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.320> break<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:40.920> are
