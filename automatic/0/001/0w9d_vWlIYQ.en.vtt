00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439
 there are very good everyone 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.960
 as you see 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.230
 about 30 frames 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.460
 here's something and what 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.829
 but box 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.599
 Well, I guess I'm not the only one 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.180
 who has this problem because he was 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.910
 looking around the world is the same 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.880
 so 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.850
 today I bring you the solution that is so 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.070
 simple like this 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.120
 good we have players and mistreatment of 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.120
 put to the fullest 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.940
 and you can think it's all in ultra 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.739
 maybe the graphics card already 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.329
 It's getting out of date, so it's worth 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.399
 I thought at first I was scared enough 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.480
 the truth because I have the graph or 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.579
 same time but not the problem is a 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.399
 small bus that has the game that 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.920
 solve entering options here 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.769
 screen 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.390
 in screen mode mode in window mode 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.110
 we have to change the screen mode 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.000
 complete by borderless mode we give 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.290
 that are great already 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.750
 in its correct position about 46 47 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.670
 it's good and good to say that this about 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.190
 everything happened also when it is 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.830
 vertical synchronization activated if 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.870
 is if we deactivate the 5 initiation 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.140
 vertical what happened to us apart from 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.660
 have a terrible tad that the frames 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.660
 they climbed quite a lot at 60 70 80 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.710
 out there but still I kept hitting 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.200
 jerks and this was for this little 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.869
 I look for you, I say that that also 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.820
 solve with what I just explained 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.399
 even having the synchronization 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.000
 vertical deactivated so good is 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.000
 simply 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.690
 no type of the any type d 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.450
 rare thing as it was simple 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.730
 I 've gone crazy with this and that's why 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.540
 I wanted to share it for what 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.810
 I can see how it has worked its 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.810
 treatment 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.720
 to me from this I have already gone 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.930
 perfectly to any kind of pull and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.930
 a greeting
