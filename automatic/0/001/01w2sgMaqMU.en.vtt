00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
that look like street fighter in my

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.010 
that look like street fighter in my
opinion<00:01:52.700> um<00:01:53.289> they<00:01:54.289> were<00:01:54.319> fast<00:01:54.880> but<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.869> know

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
opinion um they were fast but you know

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.600 
opinion um they were fast but you know
did<00:01:57.350> he<00:01:57.440> look<00:01:57.590> faster<00:01:58.190> than<00:01:58.340> he's<00:01:58.460> looked

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
did he look faster than he's looked

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.550 
did he look faster than he's looked
before<00:01:58.880> they<00:01:59.450> look<00:01:59.630> more<00:01:59.780> powerful<00:02:00.200> I'm<00:02:00.380> not

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
before they look more powerful I'm not

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.969 
before they look more powerful I'm not
sure<00:02:00.830> about<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.159> I<00:02:01.220> think<00:02:01.550> Pat<00:02:01.729> gals<00:02:02.000> ready

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
sure about that I think Pat gals ready

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.590 
sure about that I think Pat gals ready
but<00:02:03.979> I'm<00:02:04.130> giving<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.670> ang<00:02:04.819> based<00:02:05.119> upon<00:02:05.420> what<00:02:05.569> I

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
but I'm giving the ang based upon what I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.660 
but I'm giving the ang based upon what I
saw<00:02:07.209> to<00:02:08.209> Marquez<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:08.929> think<00:02:09.319> Marquez<00:02:09.769> done<00:02:10.100> you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670

saw to Marquez I think Marquez done you
know<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:10.850> think<00:02:11.000> Marquez<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.750> coming<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.230> more

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
know I think Marquez is coming in more

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
personal opinion I you know I was really

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.740 
personal opinion I you know I was really
impressed<00:02:16.489> with<00:02:16.970> both<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.420> them<00:02:17.660> at<00:02:17.720> the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
impressed with both of them at the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.600 
impressed with both of them at the
weigh-in<00:02:17.989> but<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.350> just<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.650> feel<00:02:18.980> like<00:02:19.040> Marquez

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
weigh-in but I just I feel like Marquez

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.160 
weigh-in but I just I feel like Marquez
is<00:02:19.880> dialed<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.130> ready<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.370> go<00:02:22.549> so<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.810> mean<00:02:24.049> you

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
is dialed and ready to go so I mean you

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.690 
is dialed and ready to go so I mean you
know<00:02:24.290> they<00:02:24.410> showed<00:02:24.650> other<00:02:24.829> stuff<00:02:25.160> with<00:02:25.549> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
know they showed other stuff with the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.090 
know they showed other stuff with the
flipping<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.360> airplane<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.989> flying<00:02:27.470> on<00:02:27.799> top

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
flipping of the airplane a flying on top

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.640 
flipping of the airplane a flying on top
of<00:02:28.190> stuff<00:02:28.370> whatever<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.850> mean<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.209> think<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
of stuff whatever I mean I think that

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.729 
of stuff whatever I mean I think that
it's<00:02:30.799> it's<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:32.420> online<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:33.290> all<00:02:33.560> of

it's it's it's all online it's all of
mine<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.070> think<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.519> think<00:02:34.730> Marquez<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.810> ready

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
mine I think I think Marquez is so ready

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.319 
mine I think I think Marquez is so ready
and<00:02:36.380> has<00:02:36.980> done<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.670> know<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.180> this

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
and has done it and just know that this

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.270 
and has done it and just know that this
is<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:38.959> his<00:02:39.230> chance<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.799> is<00:02:39.859> this<00:02:40.160> is

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
is it this is his chance this is this is

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.810 
is it this is his chance this is this is
the<00:02:40.400> final<00:02:41.260> final<00:02:42.260> attempt<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.549> personal

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
the final final attempt in my personal

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.229 
the final final attempt in my personal
opinion<00:02:44.030> perhaps<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:45.320> be<00:02:45.500> back<00:02:45.799> out<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.310> on

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
opinion perhaps to be back out and on

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.569 
opinion perhaps to be back out and on
both<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.510> them<00:02:47.840> on<00:02:48.019> its<00:02:48.440> collision<00:02:48.829> course<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
both of them on its collision course and

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.940 
both of them on its collision course and
I<00:02:49.970> just<00:02:50.180> feel<00:02:50.390> like<00:02:50.420> Marquez<00:02:50.959> wants<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.380> more<00:02:51.620> I

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
I just feel like Marquez wants it more I

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.009 
I just feel like Marquez wants it more I
feel<00:02:52.459> like<00:02:52.609> Marquez<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.209> done<00:02:53.390> more<00:02:53.570> training

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
feel like Marquez is done more training

feel like Marquez is done more training
I<00:02:54.170> feel<00:02:54.530> like<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.739> 24-7<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:56.000> know<00:02:56.120> Marquez
