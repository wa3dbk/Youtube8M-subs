00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410 
have different opinions when to start
the<00:00:37.170> taping<00:00:37.590> method<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:39.030> okay<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the taping method I think it's okay to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.389 
the taping method I think it's okay to
start<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> taping<00:00:40.350> method<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
start the taping method if you have a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
start the taping method if you have a
two<00:00:41.700> millimeter<00:00:42.180> gap<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
two millimeter gap like I use with the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.279 
two millimeter gap like I use with the
taping<00:00:44.280> method<00:00:44.370> between<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.120> two<00:00:45.360> gauge<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
taping method between the two gauge and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.170 
taping method between the two gauge and
zero<00:00:46.590> gauge<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.610> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> hard

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
zero gauge because it was kind of hard

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.720 
zero gauge because it was kind of hard
to<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> taper<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.649> stretch<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.520> stuff

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and like anything smaller than that you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.400 
and like anything smaller than that you
can<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> taper<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:55.020> easy<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
can just use a taper it's really easy to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.709
