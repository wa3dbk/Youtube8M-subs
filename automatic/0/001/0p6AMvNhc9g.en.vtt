00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
they have to be able to support the end

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.329 
they have to be able to support the end
to<00:00:13.539> sustain<00:00:13.839> the<00:00:13.990> air<00:00:14.139> until<00:00:14.740> you<00:00:14.889> decide<00:00:15.309> that

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
to sustain the air until you decide that

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.430 
to sustain the air until you decide that
the<00:00:15.579> note<00:00:15.759> is<00:00:15.969> stopping<00:00:16.209> and<00:00:16.510> not<00:00:16.780> it's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
the note is stopping and not it's

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.930 
the note is stopping and not it's
happening<00:00:17.860> it's<00:00:18.010> not<00:00:18.040> happening<00:00:18.130> to<00:00:18.730> you<00:00:18.820> it's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
happening it's not happening to you it's

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.920 
happening it's not happening to you it's
you<00:00:19.120> making<00:00:19.450> it<00:00:19.570> happen

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
you making it happen

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.870 
you making it happen
remember<00:00:20.830> you're<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.100> one<00:00:21.220> playing<00:00:21.430> you're

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
remember you're the one playing you're

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.600 
remember you're the one playing you're
not<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.120> one<00:00:22.270> listening<00:00:22.860> so<00:00:23.860> here<00:00:24.070> you<00:00:24.400> have

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
not the one listening so here you have

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.460 
not the one listening so here you have
to<00:00:24.790> support<00:00:25.390> that<00:00:25.480> air<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:25.990> you<00:00:26.080> have<00:00:26.110> really

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
to support that air and you have really

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.730 
to support that air and you have really
to<00:00:26.620> drive<00:00:26.830> that<00:00:27.190> air<00:00:27.780> until<00:00:28.780> the<00:00:28.870> end<00:00:28.990> I<00:00:29.140> think

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
to drive that air until the end I think

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.940 
to drive that air until the end I think
basically<00:00:30.430> your<00:00:31.230> position<00:00:32.230> here<00:00:32.439> everything

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
basically your position here everything

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.970 
basically your position here everything
seems<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.370> be<00:00:33.520> relaxed<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:34.630> stable<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.290> no<00:00:35.440> no

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
seems to be relaxed and stable and no no

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.300 
seems to be relaxed and stable and no no
problem<00:00:36.400> you<00:00:36.490> just<00:00:36.520> pick<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:36.850> flu<00:00:37.090> tournament

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.630 

and<00:00:42.310> how<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.610> etc<00:00:42.910> no<00:00:43.510> problem<00:00:43.870> but<00:00:44.640> because

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
and how it etc no problem but because

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.410 
and how it etc no problem but because
you<00:00:45.940> turn<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:47.050> head<00:00:47.200> joint<00:00:47.350> inside<00:00:47.800> so<00:00:48.070> much

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you turn the head joint inside so much

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.600 
you turn the head joint inside so much
it's<00:00:49.420> very<00:00:49.570> it's<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.170> very<00:00:50.380> big<00:00:50.860> limitation<00:00:51.280> for

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
it's very it's a very big limitation for

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:09.380 
it's very it's a very big limitation for
you<00:00:51.700> and<00:00:51.910> then<00:00:52.210> it's<00:00:52.450> everything<00:00:52.780> so<00:00:56.850> yeah

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.300 

there<00:01:10.390> if<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.810> want<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.110> play<00:01:11.350> piano<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.219> have

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
there if you want to play piano you have

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.020 
there if you want to play piano you have
to<00:01:12.399> play<00:01:12.520> I<00:01:13.259> think<00:01:14.259> it<00:01:14.829> because<00:01:15.700> it's<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:15.969> much

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
to play I think it because it's so much

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.620 
to play I think it because it's so much
turned<00:01:16.390> inside<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:16.960> have<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
turned inside that you have to and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.469 
turned inside that you have to and
that's<00:01:19.810> not<00:01:20.049> a<00:01:20.079> good<00:01:20.289> position<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.770> sustain

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that's not a good position to sustain

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.370 
that's not a good position to sustain
and<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.570> support<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.079> airstream

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
and to support the airstream

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.639 
and to support the airstream
particularly<00:01:23.799> in<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.920> piano<00:01:24.189> you<00:01:25.030> couldn't

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
particularly in the piano you couldn't

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.740 
particularly in the piano you couldn't
run<00:01:26.649> out<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:26.890> air<00:01:27.579> very<00:01:27.970> quickly<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.539> this<00:01:28.600> is

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
run out of air very quickly and this is

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.059 
run out of air very quickly and this is
why<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.929> sound<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.289> stopping<00:01:29.500> very<00:01:29.829> quickly

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
why the sound is stopping very quickly

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:36.210 
why the sound is stopping very quickly
so<00:01:30.460> let<00:01:30.850> me<00:01:30.939> just<00:01:34.140> okay<00:01:35.140> I'll<00:01:35.289> go<00:01:35.500> half<00:01:35.860> ways<00:01:36.100> I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
so let me just okay I'll go half ways I

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.399 
so let me just okay I'll go half ways I
think<00:01:36.310> it's<00:01:36.610> best<00:01:36.819> to<00:01:36.939> start<00:01:37.270> will<00:01:37.539> always

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
think it's best to start will always

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.130 
think it's best to start will always
with<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.649> position<00:01:39.310> where<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> mouth<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.840> hole

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
with a position where the mouth the hole

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.449 
with a position where the mouth the hole
in<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.319> mouthpiece<00:01:41.709> and<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.950> holes<00:01:42.159> in<00:01:42.369> the

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
in the mouthpiece and the holes in the

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.279 
in the mouthpiece and the holes in the
keys<00:01:42.670> are<00:01:43.149> in<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> same<00:01:43.539> on<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.840> same<00:01:44.020> line

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
keys are in the same on the same line

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.870 
keys are in the same on the same line
because<00:01:44.890> that's<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.159> centered<00:01:45.459> position<00:01:45.580> you

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
because that's a centered position you

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.789 
because that's a centered position you
can<00:01:46.030> go<00:01:46.299> further<00:01:46.899> left<00:01:47.229> or<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.500> can<00:01:47.679> go

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
can go further left or you can go

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.190 
can go further left or you can go
further<00:01:47.979> inside<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:48.700> for<00:01:49.539> every<00:01:49.750> one<00:01:49.929> of<00:01:49.959> this

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
further inside and for every one of this

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.230 
further inside and for every one of this
it's<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.679> position<00:01:50.950> from<00:01:51.459> where<00:01:51.729> you<00:01:51.819> can<00:01:51.970> start

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
it's a position from where you can start

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.370 
it's a position from where you can start
adjusting<00:01:52.810> wrong

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
adjusting wrong

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.589 
adjusting wrong
now<00:01:53.530> I'm<00:01:53.709> bring<00:01:53.950> its<00:01:54.099> half<00:01:54.340> ways<00:01:54.610> back<00:01:55.209> there

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
now I'm bring its half ways back there

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.520 
now I'm bring its half ways back there
yeah<00:01:56.110> it's<00:01:57.069> not<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.490> little<00:01:58.179> it's<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.539> lot<00:01:58.720> for

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
yeah it's not a little it's a lot for

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.359 
yeah it's not a little it's a lot for
you<00:01:59.619> it's<00:01:59.740> going<00:01:59.860> to<00:01:59.920> be<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.039> shock<00:02:05.189> for<00:02:06.189> me<00:02:06.250> it

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
you it's going to be a shock for me it

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:15.020 
you it's going to be a shock for me it
makes<00:02:06.520> my<00:02:06.700> life<00:02:06.819> much<00:02:07.000> easier<00:02:07.149> already

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.110 

you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.180
