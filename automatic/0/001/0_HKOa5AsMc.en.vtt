what you're currently doing now I'm not
saying<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> should<00:02:05.340> switch<00:02:05.640> all<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
saying that you should switch all the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.070 
saying that you should switch all the
time<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> very<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:08.250> know

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
time because this is a very you know

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.510 
time because this is a very you know
sensible<00:02:10.080> subject<00:02:10.739> really<00:02:10.979> because<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
sensible subject really because if you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.550 
sensible subject really because if you
if<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.060> use<00:02:12.239> one

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
if you use one

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.199 
if you use one
weapon<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.040> lot<00:02:13.280> you're<00:02:13.550> gonna<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:13.790> really

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
weapon a lot you're gonna get really

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.390 
weapon a lot you're gonna get really
good<00:02:14.510> with<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.080> if<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.500> used<00:02:15.830> one<00:02:16.069> sniper

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
good with it so if you used one sniper

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.100 
good with it so if you used one sniper
rifle<00:02:16.819> since<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.330> started<00:02:17.540> playing<00:02:17.810> battle

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
rifle since you started playing battle

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.280 
rifle since you started playing battle
rifle<00:02:18.380> f<00:02:18.560> battle<00:02:19.550> rifle<00:02:19.849> Jesus<00:02:20.599> since<00:02:21.200> you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
rifle f battle rifle Jesus since you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.780 
rifle f battle rifle Jesus since you
started<00:02:21.530> playing<00:02:21.830> battlefield<00:02:22.400> then<00:02:22.670> you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
started playing battlefield then you

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.280 
started playing battlefield then you
shouldn't<00:02:23.150> really<00:02:23.330> switch<00:02:23.750> because<00:02:23.989> that's

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
shouldn't really switch because that's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.750 
shouldn't really switch because that's
two<00:02:24.410> weapon<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.890> absolute<00:02:25.310> best<00:02:25.550> with

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
two weapon you the absolute best with

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.170 
two weapon you the absolute best with
right<00:02:26.380> well<00:02:27.430> because<00:02:28.430> every<00:02:28.670> weapon<00:02:28.819> here<00:02:29.030> has

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
right well because every weapon here has

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.910 
right well because every weapon here has
different<00:02:29.540> bullets<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.110> bullet<00:02:30.260> speeds<00:02:30.680> it

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
different bullets and bullet speeds it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.800 
different bullets and bullet speeds it
handles<00:02:31.459> differently<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.540> know<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
handles differently and you know the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.449 
handles differently and you know the
rich<00:02:32.989> chainring<00:02:33.470> time<00:02:33.739> alone<00:02:34.099> can<00:02:34.340> be

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
rich chainring time alone can be

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.040 
rich chainring time alone can be
something<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:34.849> if<00:02:35.120> you're<00:02:35.300> used<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.720> fast

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
something that if you're used to a fast

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.509 
something that if you're used to a fast
read<00:02:36.260> chambering<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.890> suddenly<00:02:37.130> pick<00:02:37.430> up

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
read chambering and you suddenly pick up

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.240 
read chambering and you suddenly pick up
a<00:02:37.580> weapon<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.090> m<00:02:38.300> 98<00:02:38.660> be<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.040> might

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
a weapon like the m 98 be and you might

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.580 
a weapon like the m 98 be and you might
go<00:02:40.670> around<00:02:40.940> corners<00:02:41.239> faster<00:02:41.630> than<00:02:42.080> you're

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
go around corners faster than you're

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.080 
go around corners faster than you're
actually<00:02:42.739> able<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.160> reach<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.580> mer<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.940> then

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
actually able to reach a mer and then

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.059 
actually able to reach a mer and then
get<00:02:44.300> shot<00:02:44.600> because<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.170> you're<00:02:45.560> not<00:02:45.680> ready<00:02:45.920> to

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
get shot because you you're not ready to

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.680 
get shot because you you're not ready to
fire<00:02:46.310> yet<00:02:46.549> because<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:46.940> shall<00:02:47.180> use<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
fire yet because you shall use to the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.050 
fire yet because you shall use to the
reframing<00:02:48.080> being<00:02:48.440> faster<00:02:48.799> so<00:02:48.980> if<00:02:49.519> you<00:02:49.730> if<00:02:49.940> you

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
reframing being faster so if you if you

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.820 
reframing being faster so if you if you
keep<00:02:50.239> switching<00:02:50.450> weapons<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.080> lot<00:02:51.290> you're

keep switching weapons a lot you're

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.770 
keep switching weapons a lot you're
gonna<00:02:51.950> struggle<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.880> imagine<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.510> bullet

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
gonna struggle just imagine the bullet

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.819 
here not always went to hip a headshot
and<00:03:19.250> when<00:03:19.820> i'm<00:03:19.910> using<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.329> su-9<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.799> sort<00:03:21.799> of

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
and when i'm using the su-9 a sort of

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.650 
and when i'm using the su-9 a sort of
like<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> similar<00:03:22.370> thing<00:03:22.579> but<00:03:23.150> when<00:03:23.269> i'm<00:03:23.359> using

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
like a similar thing but when i'm using

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.840 
like a similar thing but when i'm using
the<00:03:23.750> sv<00:03:24.019> 98<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.620> range<00:03:24.859> is<00:03:25.070> used<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.489> usually

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
the sv 98 the range is used it usually

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.000 
the sv 98 the range is used it usually
so<00:03:26.030> close<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:26.329> you<00:03:26.810> know<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.500> don't<00:03:27.709> have<00:03:27.829> to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
so close that you know you don't have to

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.849 
so close that you know you don't have to
compensate<00:03:28.400> for<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.790> lot<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:28.970> bullet<00:03:29.209> drop<00:03:29.859> so

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
compensate for a lot of bullet drop so

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.770 
compensate for a lot of bullet drop so
