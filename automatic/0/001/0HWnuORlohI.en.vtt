00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
storks natural expansion stork looks

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.410 
storks natural expansion stork looks
like<00:00:59.520> he's<00:00:59.670> thinking<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.149> setting<00:01:00.390> up

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
like he's thinking about setting up

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.380 
like he's thinking about setting up
another<00:01:00.570> base<00:01:00.870> back<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.440> oh<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.980> probe

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
another base back there but oh the probe

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.620 
another base back there but oh the probe
running<00:01:03.390> away<00:01:03.629> into<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.199> oh<00:01:04.619> man<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.489> was

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
running away into that oh man that was

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
running away into that oh man that was
that<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:06.990> fail<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.409> probe

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that was a little bit fail that probe

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.840 
that was a little bit fail that probe
just<00:01:07.890> running<00:01:08.100> straight<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.580> vulture

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
just running straight into that vulture

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670 
just running straight into that vulture
I<00:01:09.210> guess<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:09.840> worried<00:01:10.110> about<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> vulture

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
I guess he was worried about the vulture

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.719 
I guess he was worried about the vulture
coming<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> other<00:01:11.280> side<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
coming in from the other side and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.230 
coming in from the other side and
attacking<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.360> killing<00:01:12.390> off<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> probe<00:01:13.189> I

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
attacking and killing off that probe I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
attacking and killing off that probe I
think<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.750> there's<00:01:15.900> another<00:01:16.080> side<00:01:16.350> know

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
think I think there's another side know

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.920 
think I think there's another side know
maybe<00:01:16.710> there's<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.040> another<00:01:17.280> side<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> that

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
maybe there's not another side to that

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.480 
maybe there's not another side to that
ramp<00:01:18.930> there<00:01:19.140> anyway<00:01:19.740> tourists<00:01:20.130> now<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.310> place

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
ramp there anyway tourists now in place

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.499 
ramp there anyway tourists now in place
so<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.729> gonna<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:20.909> able<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.150> keep<00:01:21.270> things

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
so it's gonna be able to keep things

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.910 
so it's gonna be able to keep things
away<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.780> looks<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.080> flash<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.860> to
