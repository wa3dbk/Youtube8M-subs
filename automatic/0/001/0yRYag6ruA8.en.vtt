stitches to work in the round on double
pointed<00:00:07.770> needles<00:00:08.160> I've<00:00:09.059> cast<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:09.540> all<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:09.839 
pointed needles I've cast on all the

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.359 
pointed needles I've cast on all the
stitches<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.349> require<00:00:10.940> onto<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.059> one<00:00:12.299> needle

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369 
stitches I require onto this one needle

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.039 
stitches I require onto this one needle
I'm<00:00:14.369> going<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.789> slip<00:00:15.119> them<00:00:15.299> by<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.539> Express

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I'm going to slip them by the Express

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.919 
I'm going to slip them by the Express
method<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.949> compressing<00:00:17.939> the<00:00:18.060> stitches<00:00:18.509> I'm

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:18.929 
method of compressing the stitches I'm

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.769 
method of compressing the stitches I'm
letting<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:19.679> leap<00:00:20.000> from<00:00:21.000> one<00:00:21.060> needle<00:00:21.599> to<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
letting them leap from one needle to the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.779 
letting them leap from one needle to the
other<00:00:22.019> the<00:00:22.859> tapers<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.550> slightly

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
other the tapers are just slightly

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.620 
other the tapers are just slightly
overlapped<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> tips<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:27.089> stitches

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
overlapped at the tips and the stitches

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.929 
overlapped at the tips and the stitches
will<00:00:27.779> slip<00:00:28.320> across<00:00:28.619> quite<00:00:28.890> happily<00:00:29.279> without

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
will slip across quite happily without

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
will slip across quite happily without
having<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.359> put<00:00:30.509> any<00:00:30.689> force<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.199> distortion<00:00:31.800> on

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
having to put any force or distortion on

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.430 
having to put any force or distortion on
them<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> aim<00:00:33.720> for<00:00:33.750> about<00:00:34.050> half

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
them so I'm going to aim for about half

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
them so I'm going to aim for about half
on<00:00:34.740> each<00:00:35.010> needle<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.240> I've<00:00:36.330> got<00:00:36.540> 12<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.230> 12<00:00:38.660> now

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
on each needle so I've got 12 and 12 now

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.290 
on each needle so I've got 12 and 12 now
I'm<00:00:39.810> going<00:00:39.990> to<00:00:40.050> fold<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.650> around<00:00:41.240> now<00:00:42.240> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
I'm going to fold this around now the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.840 
I'm going to fold this around now the
direction<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.870> folding<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.410> important<00:00:44.010> we

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
direction of folding is important we

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
direction of folding is important we
want<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.210> last<00:00:45.450> stitch<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.500> cast<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
want the last stitch you cast on and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.640 
want the last stitch you cast on and
where<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.880> working<00:00:48.240> yarn<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.750> attached<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
where the working yarn is attached to

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.850 
where the working yarn is attached to
fold<00:00:50.610> round<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.540> back<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.290> we<00:00:52.410> make<00:00:52.560> a<00:00:52.590> sort

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
fold round to the back so we make a sort

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.730 
fold round to the back so we make a sort
of<00:00:52.950> book<00:00:53.190> hinge<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.470> quite

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
of book hinge and you can see quite

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.790 
of book hinge and you can see quite
clearly<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.030> cast<00:00:57.990> on<00:00:58.200> edge<00:00:58.440> doesn't

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
clearly that the cast on edge doesn't

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
clearly that the cast on edge doesn't
twist<00:00:59.130> around<00:00:59.580> which<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> advantage<00:01:01.110> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
twist around which is the advantage of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.210 
twist around which is the advantage of
this<00:01:01.380> method<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.670> fold<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> needles<00:01:05.100> are

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this method so we fold it so needles are

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.780 
this method so we fold it so needles are
parallel<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:05.820> another<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> stitches

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
parallel to one another so the stitches

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.410 
parallel to one another so the stitches
of<00:01:09.090> both<00:01:09.270> needles<00:01:09.750> somewhere<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> middle

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
of both needles somewhere in the middle

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.820 
of both needles somewhere in the middle
and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.570> keep<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.900> sliding<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> front

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and then keep on sliding the front

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.280 
and then keep on sliding the front
needle<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> first<00:01:15.240> stitch<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.810> cast<00:01:16.050> on

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
needle with the first stitch you cast on

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.120 
needle with the first stitch you cast on
so<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> open<00:01:17.430> edge<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> book

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so this is at the open edge the book

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.510 
so this is at the open edge the book
hinges<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> left<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:23.070> working<00:01:23.490> yarn

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
hinges to the left and the working yarn

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.500 
hinges to the left and the working yarn
is<00:01:23.940> leading<00:01:24.360> from<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:24.840> needle<00:01:26.360> now<00:01:27.360> at

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
is leading from the back needle now at

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.280 
is leading from the back needle now at
first<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.990> don't<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.380> much<00:01:28.590> room<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.580> spare

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
first we don't have much room to spare

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.750 
first we don't have much room to spare
try<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.409> keep<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> needles<00:01:32.070> close<00:01:32.370> together

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
try and keep the needles close together

of the needle begin your first round of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
of the needle begin your first round of
knitting<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:44.670> could<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> rib<00:01:47.570> straight

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

knitting and it could be a rib straight
knit<00:01:48.840> whatever<00:01:49.620> you<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:51.330> soon

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
as you've worked two or three stitches

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
as you've worked two or three stitches
then<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.200> actually<00:01:55.650> have<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.860> triangle<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
then you actually have a triangle of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.500

stitches<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:58.790> continue<00:01:59.790> working<00:01:59.970> in<00:02:00.299> this

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
stitches and continue working in this

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.780 
stitches and continue working in this
manner<00:02:00.780> until<00:02:01.740> you've<00:02:01.890> got<00:02:02.100> about<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> first

manner until you've got about the first

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.029 
manner until you've got about the first
quarter<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> first<00:02:04.860> needle<00:02:06.860> there's<00:02:07.860> my

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
quarter on the first needle there's my

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.769 
quarter on the first needle there's my
first<00:02:08.220> six<00:02:08.549> stitches<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.360> needle

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:09.779 
first six stitches on this needle

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.989 
first six stitches on this needle
I<00:02:09.899> now<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.499> quite<00:02:10.739> an<00:02:10.889> acceptable<00:02:11.430> triangle

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:11.999 
I now have quite an acceptable triangle

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.479 
I now have quite an acceptable triangle
and<00:02:12.389> now<00:02:13.379> I'm<00:02:13.529> just<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:13.889> to<00:02:13.950> rib<00:02:14.159> across

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
and now I'm just going to rib across

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:14.930 
and now I'm just going to rib across
this

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
this
