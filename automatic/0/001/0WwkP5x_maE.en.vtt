no no you need to you know sort of so
your<00:00:35.969> seed<00:00:36.180> head<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:37.710> want

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
your seed head right but you really want

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 
your seed head right but you really want
to<00:00:37.980> take<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.160> off<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> planters

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
to take that off so it's the planters

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.000 
to take that off so it's the planters
and<00:00:39.600> putting<00:00:39.840> its<00:00:39.960> energy<00:00:40.350> into<00:00:40.500> producing

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and putting its energy into producing

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
and putting its energy into producing
seeds<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.550> letting<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> energy<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.480> back

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
seeds it's letting the energy go back

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.250 
seeds it's letting the energy go back
into<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.110> bulbs<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.360> can't<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.930> until

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
into the bulbs so you can't know until

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.500 
into the bulbs so you can't know until
the<00:00:46.500> leaves<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.980> died<00:00:47.190> back<00:00:47.430> now<00:00:48.149> these<00:00:48.300> are

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the leaves have died back now these are

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.209 
the leaves have died back now these are
getting<00:00:48.719> there<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.530> another<00:00:49.770> couple<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.160> weeks

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
getting there so another couple of weeks

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.470 
getting there so another couple of weeks
and<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.500> notice<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:54.030> end<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.329> May

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and you can notice the end of May

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
and you can notice the end of May
beginning<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.989> June<00:00:55.050> usually<00:00:55.770> these<00:00:56.010> are

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
beginning of June usually these are

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.090 
beginning of June usually these are
dying<00:00:56.399> back<00:00:56.610> quite<00:00:56.879> quickly<00:00:57.859> has<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> go

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
dying back quite quickly has to go

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.080 
dying back quite quickly has to go
around<00:00:59.340> them<00:00:59.520> till<00:00:59.730> then

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
around them till then

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.060 
around them till then
because<00:01:00.510> steel<00:01:00.840> Eve's<00:01:01.079> dying<00:01:01.559> back<00:01:01.800> are

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
because steel Eve's dying back are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
because steel Eve's dying back are
putting<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> energy<00:01:02.670> back<00:01:03.120> into<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.449> bulbs

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
putting the energy back into the bulbs

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.350 
putting the energy back into the bulbs
for<00:01:03.960> next<00:01:04.260> year<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:05.460> happens<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.150> mow

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
for next year so what happens if you mow

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.969 
for next year so what happens if you mow
straight<00:01:07.080> away<00:01:07.290> after<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.680> finished

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
straight away after it finished

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
straight away after it finished

flowering yeah your daughters are going
to<00:01:10.200> die<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.729> won't<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.119> your<00:01:12.330> year

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
to die out and you won't get your year

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.310 
to die out and you won't get your year
after<00:01:13.470> year<00:01:13.680> after<00:01:13.920> year<00:01:14.400> after<00:01:14.549> year<00:01:15.320> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
there's a huge amount of nutrition and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
there's a huge amount of nutrition and
that<00:01:18.270> goes<00:01:18.479> back<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:19.020> yes<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.950> leaves

that goes back in yes it is the leaves
here<00:01:20.430> dying<00:01:20.700> back<00:01:20.939> would<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.540> energy<00:01:22.049> back

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
here dying back would be energy back

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440 
here dying back would be energy back
into<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.560> bulb<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.070> ice<00:01:23.280> next<00:01:23.759> year<00:01:24.090> okay

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
into the bulb for ice next year okay

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.140 
into the bulb for ice next year okay
that<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> great<00:01:25.830> tip<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.460> an<00:01:26.580> awful<00:01:27.030> lot

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.160 
year after year it may get to stage
where<00:01:47.850> they<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:48.360> crowded<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.020> might

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
where they get very crowded so you might

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
where they get very crowded so you might
have<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> lift<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.860> trump<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> divide<00:01:50.610> them<00:01:50.850> or

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
have to lift a trump and divide them or

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.999 
have to lift a trump and divide them or
something<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:52.049> years<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> suppose

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
something but not for years so I suppose

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.649 
something but not for years so I suppose
that<00:01:53.040> brings<00:01:53.460> new<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> question<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.509> I'm

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that brings new to the question and I'm

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
that brings new to the question and I'm
sure<00:01:54.689> lots<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.229> people<00:01:55.290> will<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.829> thinking<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
sure lots of people will be thinking and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.789 
sure lots of people will be thinking and
if<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.659> bug<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.290> year<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
if you have one bug this year do you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.649 
if you have one bug this year do you
have<00:01:59.009> couple<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.430> folks<00:01:59.670> next<00:02:00.119> year<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
have couple of folks next year it's

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.240 
have couple of folks next year it's
probably<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> take<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> bit<00:02:01.649> longer<00:02:01.680> than

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
probably going to take a bit longer than

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.370 
probably going to take a bit longer than
that<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.119> multiply<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.200> it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that for it to really multiply but it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
that for it to really multiply but it
just<00:02:04.619> melts<00:02:04.920> followed<00:02:05.729> by<00:02:05.909> yeah<00:02:06.090> because

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
just melts followed by yeah because

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.250 
just melts followed by yeah because
sometimes<00:02:06.600> when<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.810> buy<00:02:06.990> boards<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.530> know

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
sometimes when you buy boards you know

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.240 
sometimes when you buy boards you know
yeah<00:02:09.260> yeah<00:02:10.280> getting<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:11.000> life<00:02:11.620> further<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.010> for

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
yeah yeah getting to life further so for

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.860 
yeah yeah getting to life further so for
a<00:02:13.310> little<00:02:13.550> area<00:02:13.850> like<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.450> could<00:02:14.600> just

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
a little area like this it could just

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.320 
a little area like this it could just
develop<00:02:15.380> over<00:02:15.740> time<00:02:15.770> over<00:02:16.280> time<00:02:16.430> it'll<00:02:16.910> get<00:02:17.150> so

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
develop over time over time it'll get so

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.160 
develop over time over time it'll get so
much<00:02:17.630> they<00:02:17.810> don't<00:02:17.960> catch<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.800> yeah<00:02:20.170> okay

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
much they don't catch you yeah okay

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.270 
much they don't catch you yeah okay
great<00:02:21.470> okay<00:02:21.860> well<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.460> know<00:02:22.580> what<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.940> do<00:02:23.090> now
