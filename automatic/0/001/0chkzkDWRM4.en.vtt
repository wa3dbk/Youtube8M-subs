00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.120 
kind of assumptions until season two
because<00:05:58.780> while<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.110> was<00:05:59.230> suspected<00:05:59.590> that<00:05:59.740> stan

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
because while it was suspected that stan

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.820 
because while it was suspected that stan
had<00:06:00.370> something<00:06:00.730> to<00:06:00.880> do<00:06:01.090> with<00:06:01.270> this<00:06:01.560> we<00:06:02.560> still

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
had something to do with this we still

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.670 
had something to do with this we still
don't<00:06:03.040> know<00:06:03.130> what<00:06:03.810> although<00:06:04.810> this<00:06:05.020> does<00:06:05.350> seem

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
don't know what although this does seem

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.860 
don't know what although this does seem
to<00:06:05.740> be<00:06:05.830> confirmation<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:07.150> Stan<00:06:07.390> did<00:06:07.570> not

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
to be confirmation that Stan did not

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.950 
to be confirmation that Stan did not
write<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.380> books<00:06:08.620> he<00:06:09.390> but<00:06:10.390> considering<00:06:10.870> he

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
write the books he but considering he

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.840 
write the books he but considering he
knew<00:06:11.080> exactly<00:06:11.200> what<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.710> do<00:06:11.980> with<00:06:12.160> them<00:06:12.370> he

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
knew exactly what to do with them he

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.770 
knew exactly what to do with them he
obviously<00:06:13.030> knows<00:06:13.510> a<00:06:13.570> lot<00:06:13.780> about<00:06:13.840> them<00:06:15.780> so

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
obviously knows a lot about them so

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.740 
obviously knows a lot about them so
here's<00:06:17.260> hoping<00:06:17.500> to<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.310> next<00:06:18.700> season<00:06:19.120> and
