 pieces of zucchini to integrate 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.369
 lots of vegetables to this recipe and 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.589
 especially that they do not look 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.239
 delicious with achiote so let's go 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.489
 to go putting our elements in the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.680
 blender I'm going to place here the game of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.690
 half an orange if they want more acid 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.729
 can place the place of the orange on 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.440
 juice of a lemon we will place a 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.450
 garlic clove 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.460
 about a tablespoon of achiote if 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.370
 you like more loaded the achiote forward 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.730
 ht placed over a pinch of salt 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.440
 and we are going to liquefy very well make sure that 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.760
 your garlic really gets desperate because 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.130
 you do that they love to jump on the 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.410
 blender and not break down and look through 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.060
 here my fish fillets this what 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.530
 you can leave marinated in achiote if 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.660
 you have time if you prepare this from 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.550
 early I will prepare it like this but if 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.280
 you leave it marinating to grab more flavor 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.520
 let's put a little salt to 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.880
 our little fish on both sides 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.560
 there it's ready and now I'm going to put it here 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.479
 on aluminum foil paper 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.399
 aluminum is an excellent ally of 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.990
 diets because it allows us to prepare 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.780
 our steamed food 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.640
 they are delicious and we do not use anything 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.290
 of fat in danger that sticks 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.259
 nothing ok 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.479
 there it looks well baÃ±adito and now I'm going 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.069
 to add the other ingredients we are going to 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.050
 putting carrot 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.510
 some zucchini 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.510
 hijole do not know cheer you up 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.190
 vegetables because they are delicious 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.740
 onion fascinates me the onion and my 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.900
 husband shocks her like onion there 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.000
 this ungrateful our vegetables and now 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.000
 if we are closing this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.170
 I'm going to teach you how to close the paper 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.620
 aluminum so that it looks good 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.630
 sealed and that the recipe respects you well 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.090
 the flavors will cook faster and with 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.130
 the steamer is delicious so 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.080
 we are putting everything right here now 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.740
 we are placing we are going together the two 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.080
 shores 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.960
 and these two shores look we're going to 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.760
 unite through a fold 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.890
 you look like that there's no way you can 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.500
 escape the steam and now the sides 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.370
 same double we double double and 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.370
 we doubled again 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.940
 and now yes guys and girls we go to 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.130
 steam 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.990
 if you do not have to put at home there is no 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.510
 excuse to not make this recipe look 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.700
 look for a deep dish that says it's 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.710
 resistant to heat that is used on 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.100
 microwave or in the oven and you can 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.260
 place backwards 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.410
 in this way to sustain your 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.480
 fish and stay on the steamer another 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.790
 option look at this they sell them in the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.010
 supermarket and makes you from any pot 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.840
 a steamer so there's no excuse 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.420
 to not make our recipe I'm going to leave 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.720
 here the plate and I will place my fish 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.720
 above 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.460
 look after 20 minutes your fish 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.110
 is ready to steam shock and everything that 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.030
 we have to do is open it you can 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.750
 serve well in aluminum foil or what 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.850
