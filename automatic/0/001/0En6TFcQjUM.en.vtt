without the JD link system we more than

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.230 
without the JD link system we more than
likely<00:01:14.710> what<00:01:15.040> it's<00:01:15.190> in<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> tag<00:01:15.640> nation<00:01:16.090> out

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
likely what it's in a tag nation out

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.270 
likely what it's in a tag nation out
there<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.630> do<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.900> Diagnostics<00:01:17.620> on<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.920> unit

so with the JD link system there's a lot

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.760 
so with the JD link system there's a lot
of<00:01:21.280> times<00:01:21.520> that<00:01:21.970> we<00:01:22.360> can<00:01:22.600> prevent<00:01:23.080> have

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
of times that we can prevent have

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.710 
of times that we can prevent have
happened<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.340> make<00:01:24.520> two<00:01:24.760> trips<00:01:24.790> we're<00:01:25.450> going
