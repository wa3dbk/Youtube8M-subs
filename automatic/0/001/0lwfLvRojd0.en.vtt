00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello to all this is steven and you know 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.030
 under ios on iphone ipod touch and ipad 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.679
 if you want to secure your 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.570
 device you have the opportunity to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.320
 set a four-digit code on 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.420
 the lock screen 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 but the disadvantage of this code is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 that he remains permanently 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.430
 apple does not offer renewal 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.810
 this password automatically with a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.220
 any features of this type 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.240
 so that's why the thing that I 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.130
 present to you today is going to be 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.410
 interesting you activate it here it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.730
 is called times not this code and it goes 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.050
 allow you to change your word from 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.000
 pass every minute 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 so it's pretty original and you go 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.590
 understand why there is 9:55 little 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.879
 hollow that very well and watch 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 now if I try to enter a word 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.450
 somehow it does not work 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.510
 the old password does not work either 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.309
 not against if I enter 9:55 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.289
 it works I can unlock my 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.649
 iphone so that's how it works 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.780
 tweak 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.820
 then you can choose that code 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.109
 configured by default works but that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.149
 does not have much interest it even removes 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.250
 the interest of the tweak and for even more 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.809
 of security you can reverse the code 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.129
 so here I guarantee you that if 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.450
 someone is trying to guess the code of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.740
 your iphone i think it can be 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 break your head sometime before 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.570
 to find the code will now 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.810
 reverse is 9:55 so I'll 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.640
 have to type the reverse 5 5 9 0 and my 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.140
 iphone unlocks so I find that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.950
 really great to have like that a 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.780
 password that change 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.500
 automatically every minute while 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.299
 throughout the day 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.470
 if someone sees you type your word 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.180
 pass and they try to 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.380
 reproduce a little bit later he does not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.579
 can not access your iphone 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.650
 since the password will be changed to 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.210
 along with their you know 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 the trick is just looking 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.659
 the time it is you know what word of 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.759
 pass you have to enter there then 9h56 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.590
 I enter again the opposite of this 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.420
 password and my iphone stands 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.890
 unlocks so that's how all that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.630
 works it's pretty bluffing 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.210
 this tweak if it interests you there 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 is called times passcode like this it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.119
 is available for free on cydia 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.920
 under the source bigboss 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.630
 so if you use a code of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.860
 security on your iphone and you want 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.899
 a little trick the enemy into 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.340
 using a more complicated combination 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.700
 well I would definitely suggest this 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.409
 tweak 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.479
 so here tell me what you have 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.770
 thought in the comments and I I 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.119
 tell you 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.020
 very soon for a next video 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.020
