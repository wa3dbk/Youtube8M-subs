hello<00:00:01.890> so<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.480> remote<00:00:04.080> focus<00:00:04.650> unit

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
hello so this is the remote focus unit

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.179 
hello so this is the remote focus unit
for<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.670> DSLR<00:00:06.420> camera<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.799> nearly

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
for the DSLR camera that is nearly

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.440 
for the DSLR camera that is nearly
completed<00:00:09.110> here<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.260> have<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.969> servo<00:00:11.969> with

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
completed here we have the servo with

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.529 
completed here we have the servo with
the<00:00:13.040> standard<00:00:15.049> remote<00:00:16.049> focus<00:00:16.529> gear<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.130> there

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
the standard remote focus gear on there

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.840 
the standard remote focus gear on there
and<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.960> has<00:00:19.170> been<00:00:19.320> modified<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:20.340> an<00:00:20.670> eighth

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
and this has been modified for an eighth

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.070 
and this has been modified for an eighth
inch<00:00:20.880> stereo<00:00:21.570> jack<00:00:22.130> as<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.850> need

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
inch stereo jack as you can see we need

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.620 
inch stereo jack as you can see we need
three<00:00:25.080> wires<00:00:25.320> into<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.099> servo<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:27.119> stereo

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
three wires into the servo and a stereo

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.830 
three wires into the servo and a stereo
three<00:00:28.199> wires<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.310> very<00:00:29.490> common<00:00:29.840> plug

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
three wires and it's a very common plug

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.780 
three wires and it's a very common plug
that's<00:00:31.080> why<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.320> went<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:32.700> can

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that's why we went with that you can

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.850 
that's why we went with that you can
pick<00:00:33.000> up<00:00:33.149> cables<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> extend<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
pick up cables if you want to extend it

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.810 
pick up cables if you want to extend it
anywhere<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.120> that's<00:00:36.360> why<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.690> went<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
anywhere so that's why we went with that

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.930 
anywhere so that's why we went with that
so<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.230> control<00:00:40.230> box<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so this is the control box here this is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.350 
so this is the control box here this is
an<00:00:42.770> atmega328<00:00:43.770> with<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.430> arduino<00:00:45.120> bootloader

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
an atmega328 with the arduino bootloader

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.440 
an atmega328 with the arduino bootloader
on<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.320> easy<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.160> program<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> arduino

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
on it so easy to program in the arduino

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.889 
on it so easy to program in the arduino
little<00:00:49.320> language<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.600> works<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.840> pretty

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
little language so it works out pretty

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
little language so it works out pretty
select<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.500> over<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
select this over here is just the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
select this over here is just the
voltage<00:00:54.000> regulator<00:00:54.420> set<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.649> some

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
voltage regulator set up with some

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.139 
voltage regulator set up with some
filtering<00:00:56.160> capacitors<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:59.149> 16

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
filtering capacitors and the 16

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.750 
filtering capacitors and the 16
megahertz<00:01:00.390> crystal<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.140> clock<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:02.489> then

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
megahertz crystal for the clock and then

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.100 
megahertz crystal for the clock and then
the<00:01:03.710> joystick<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.949> control<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.909> remote<00:01:06.600> focus

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the joystick to control the remote focus

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280 
the joystick to control the remote focus
and<00:01:07.460> here<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.030> eighth<00:01:09.510> inch<00:01:09.780> stereo

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and here we have the eighth inch stereo

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.190 
and here we have the eighth inch stereo
output<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> servo<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:12.659> basic

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
output to the servo so it's very basic

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.740 
output to the servo so it's very basic
setup<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> bottom<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
setup you can see the bottom of the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.399 
setup you can see the bottom of the
board<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.909> liking<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.960> perf

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
board here really not liking the perf

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.550 
board here really not liking the perf
board<00:01:20.000> I've<00:01:21.000> been<00:01:21.270> doing<00:01:21.570> PCBs<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.110> I'm

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
board I've been doing PCBs and I'm

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.789 
board I've been doing PCBs and I'm
probably<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.159> gonna<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.460> perfboard<00:01:23.700> again<00:01:24.799> so

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
probably not gonna do perfboard again so

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.649 
probably not gonna do perfboard again so
I<00:01:25.830> guess<00:01:26.070> once<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.580> PCB<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> don't<00:01:27.570> go

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
I guess once you go to PCB you don't go

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.609 
I guess once you go to PCB you don't go
back<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.280> that's<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
back but so that's that and this is the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.450 
back but so that's that and this is the
top<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.560> joystick<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.040> obviously

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
top here so the joystick is obviously

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.399 
top here so the joystick is obviously
going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.820> through<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.229> power

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
going to go through here and the power

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.510 
going to go through here and the power
switch<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:40.070> battery<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.430> gonna

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
switch up here and battery is just gonna

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.260 
switch up here and battery is just gonna
have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> hang<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:43.070> everything

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
have to hang out of the back everything

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.590 
have to hang out of the back everything
I'm<00:01:45.270> gonna<00:01:45.390> snap<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.079> quick<00:01:46.290> here

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
I'm gonna snap this in quick here

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.020 
I'm gonna snap this in quick here
everything<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.610> everything<00:01:50.610> inside<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
everything that everything inside of

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.179 
everything that everything inside of
this<00:01:51.210> project<00:01:51.659> box<00:01:51.840> needs<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.040> there

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this project box needs to be in there

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.819 
this project box needs to be in there
and<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.490> can't<00:01:53.759> fit<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> battery<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.079> I'm

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
and we can't fit the battery and so I'm

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
and we can't fit the battery and so I'm
just<00:01:56.070> gonna<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.369> hang<00:01:56.579> off<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> back<00:01:56.939> but

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
just gonna have to hang off the back but

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.789 
just gonna have to hang off the back but
it's<00:01:57.600> not<00:01:57.780> too<00:01:57.960> bad<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.380> once<00:01:58.619> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's not too bad because once you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.010 
it's not too bad because once you
actually<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.969> unit<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.570> hand<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
actually get the unit in your hand it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
actually get the unit in your hand it
you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.560> fits<00:02:01.710> pretty<00:02:01.950> good<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.579> so

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
you know it fits pretty good so so

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.630 
you know it fits pretty good so so
that's<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.780> can't<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> top<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.430> right

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that's that can't get the top on right

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.199 
that's that can't get the top on right
now<00:02:06.110> don't<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.560> spacers<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.550> get

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
now don't have the right spacers to get

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.050 
now don't have the right spacers to get
the<00:02:09.330> joystick<00:02:09.810> adjusted<00:02:10.319> properly<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the joystick adjusted properly to the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.760 
the joystick adjusted properly to the
right<00:02:12.239> height<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> through<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> hole

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
right height to get it through the hole

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
right height to get it through the hole
so<00:02:14.420> hopefully<00:02:15.420> make<00:02:15.660> trip<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.050> hardware

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
so hopefully make trip to the hardware

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.620 
so hopefully make trip to the hardware
store<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.590> take<00:02:16.770> care<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.210> got<00:02:18.570> a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
store and take care of that so I got a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.850 
store and take care of that so I got a
plugged<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.020> now<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.250> before<00:02:20.850> we<00:02:21.030> turn<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.390> on

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
plugged in now so before we turn it on

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.350 
plugged in now so before we turn it on
we're<00:02:22.860> gonna<00:02:22.950> plug<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.610> eighth<00:02:24.150> inch

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
we're gonna plug in the eighth inch

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.220 
we're gonna plug in the eighth inch
stereo<00:02:24.630> jack

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
stereo jack

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.960 
stereo jack
and<00:02:25.500> now<00:02:25.740> our<00:02:25.920> servo<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.370> hooked<00:02:26.550> up<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
and now our servo is hooked up and the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.110 
and now our servo is hooked up and the
power<00:02:30.180> switch<00:02:30.360> here<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:30.840> we'll<00:02:31.110> turn<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.440> on

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
power switch here so we'll turn it on

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.240 
power switch here so we'll turn it on
and<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.410> led<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.800> not<00:02:34.980> hooked<00:02:35.100> up

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
and it's on the led is not hooked up

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.510 
and it's on the led is not hooked up
right<00:02:35.460> now<00:02:36.320> anyway<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.380> we<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.950> control<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:40.520> up

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
right now anyway so we can control it up

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.920 
right now anyway so we can control it up
and<00:02:41.970> down<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.980> fine<00:02:44.000> focus<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> DSLR

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
and down is the fine focus for the DSLR

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.750 
and down is the fine focus for the DSLR
camera<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.500> then<00:02:47.190> side<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.550> side<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
camera and then side to side is the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.230 
camera and then side to side is the
control<00:02:51.690> your<00:02:51.810> own<00:02:51.900> speed<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.910> faster<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.210> you

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
control your own speed and faster so you

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.690 
control your own speed and faster so you
can<00:02:54.480> go<00:02:54.600> slow<00:02:54.960> as<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.140> want<00:02:55.170> or<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:56.160> fast<00:02:56.490> as

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
can go slow as you want or as fast as

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.620 
can go slow as you want or as fast as
you<00:02:56.760> want<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.890> for<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.190> DSLR<00:02:59.640> camera
