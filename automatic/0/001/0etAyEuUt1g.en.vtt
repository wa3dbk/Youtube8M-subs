probably the best team currently on

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.919 
probably the best team currently on
ultimate<00:00:07.919> team<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.250> can<00:00:08.400> get<00:00:08.580> for<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> hundred

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
ultimate team you can get for a hundred

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.450 
ultimate team you can get for a hundred
chemistry<00:00:10.500> there<00:00:10.679> obviously<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.099> lot<00:00:11.309> better

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
chemistry there obviously a lot better

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.700 
chemistry there obviously a lot better
squad<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.090> make<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.450> believe<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.410> believe

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
squad you can make I believe I believe

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.770 
squad you can make I believe I believe
there's<00:00:14.040> an<00:00:14.099> 89<00:00:14.670> rated<00:00:15.089> squad<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.630> make

there's an 89 rated squad you can make

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.769 
there's an 89 rated squad you can make
however<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.740> will<00:00:16.920> be<00:00:17.070> getting<00:00:17.279> 98<00:00:18.150> chemistry

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
however you will be getting 98 chemistry

left-handed<00:05:17.229> but<00:05:18.009> some<00:05:18.219> reason<00:05:18.490> i<00:05:18.580> did<00:05:18.789> go<00:05:18.939> for

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
left-handed but some reason i did go for

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.600

absolute beast I do play him in a

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.219 
absolute beast I do play him in a
striking<00:05:58.029> position<00:05:58.240> sometimes<00:05:58.719> instead<00:05:59.169> of

striking position sometimes instead of

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.679 
striking position sometimes instead of
Falcao<00:05:59.649> because<00:05:59.919> Falcao<00:06:00.879> can<00:06:01.210> be<00:06:01.360> kind<00:06:01.569> of

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:01.689 
Falcao because Falcao can be kind of

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.200
