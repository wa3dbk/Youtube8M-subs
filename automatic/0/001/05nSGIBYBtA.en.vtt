 right corner then lower left corner but 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.660
 it will be inconvenient here 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:34.780
 and lower right corner here so let's 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:39.040
 set right like this for now 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.990
 worth it further coordinates that is 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.320
 show coordinates on the map here you are 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.890
 where under the card you can see x 509 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.930

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:44.769
 that is, the window style and here 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:50.110

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:55.239

 chunky type update or not 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.470
 when it appears if you want to 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:32.070
 they were not updated although I donâ€™t know why 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:35.560
 it's that gray was wherever else 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:40.120
 here look now i set a though 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.500
 no, they are still updated well in general 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.950
 one of these doesn't follow i don't know what it is 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:53.830
 advanced here the maximum is shorter how many 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:56.560
 fps maximum card for something else 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.320
 I'm sorry I'm just not sick 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.229
 translated and minimap 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.090
 here information is shorter information 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:11.410
 minimap map 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:13.090
 version 1.0 and who made it on thinking you 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.470
 almost all told right now 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:23.400
 evening I will tell about the zoom on the plus sign you 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:26.560
 Click it increases who needs everything 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.960
 maximum zoom you can see write 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.910
 just all maximum zoom 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:36.020
 let's give it away so let's give it away 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.180
 well away that's all too 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:44.870
 minimum because this box is not 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.240
 updated but do not know why in general 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.000
 card works fine only when you 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:58.009
 the first time I run let's say on 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:01.659
 some map you have it updated well 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:06.680
 this one to date for some reason is not updated 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:08.330
 isn't it so important i think he 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:15.259
 pretty small so let's 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:19.970
 from here we leave so well damn enough water so 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:30.469
 jump here you can roll the map simple 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:35.240
 clicking on it well and that's all i'm 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:38.060
 I wanted to say here you can range 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:42.069
 drawings increase decrease this 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.069
 I forgot to tell you 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:51.050
 324 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:53.960
 and and the zoom is the same you see she 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.279
 I get a zoom zoom as possible 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.110
 on the buttons and here 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:01.930
 regulate that is less there and more 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:08.139
 only for some reason I do not see 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:16.370
 okay she may have to wait now 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:19.880
 so we take a zoom we put flour on May 30 and yes 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:23.870
 and here it comes closer everything is clear with 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:27.620
 that's it okay all gene production 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:30.680
 told there is only one column not 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:33.289
 translated sorry sorry I think you don't 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.240
 you will put dizlik for it all 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:39.319
 show was driving subscribe to 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.889
 channel and so on I think this mod is very 

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:44.110
 good 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:46.780
 never forget where your home is 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.419
 The main thing is to write down the coordinates I hope 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:54.219
 further point additions 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:57.009
 what could have put an idea 

00:07:54.219 --> 00:08:02.159
 your home or where you want to return 

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:02.159
 diamonds if that is okay as long as all 

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.539
