you're<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> learn<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> lot<00:00:26.939> faster<00:00:27.630> if

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
you're going to learn a lot faster if

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.220 
you're going to learn a lot faster if
you<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.019> fun<00:00:28.710> side<00:00:28.920> shuts<00:00:29.310> down<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.779> hard

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you have fun side shuts down and hard

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.959 
you have fun side shuts down and hard
flips<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> unless<00:00:38.730> it's

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
flips so that you can do to unless it's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.040 
flips so that you can do to unless it's
start<00:00:39.180> practicing<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.430> kickflips<00:00:42.050> catching

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
start practicing like kickflips catching

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.650 
start practicing like kickflips catching
them<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.290> at<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.559> angle<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.510> like<00:00:45.510> you're

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
them like at an angle I like you're

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.029 
them like at an angle I like you're
going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> go<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.140> broadside<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
going to go to a broadside so if you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.549 
going to go to a broadside so if you
have<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> box<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:48.390> mail<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.230> even<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
have a box or mail or you can even do it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
have a box or mail or you can even do it
on<00:00:49.620> flat<00:00:49.860> ground<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:53.329> kickflipping<00:00:54.329> like

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
on flat ground just kickflipping like

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.590 
on flat ground just kickflipping like
that<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> same<00:00:57.780> thing<00:00:58.129> except

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
that and then do the same thing except

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.740 
that and then do the same thing except
stoutly<00:01:00.600> voting<00:01:00.899> resting<00:01:01.289> lay<00:01:01.379> around<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
stoutly voting resting lay around and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.020 
stoutly voting resting lay around and
eventually<00:01:03.750> you'll<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.439> able<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:05.030> catch

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
eventually you'll just be able to catch

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.890 
eventually you'll just be able to catch
it<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> way<00:01:06.479> over<00:01:06.689> there<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.280> also<00:01:08.900> the

know how to describe it like an anti
hard<00:01:37.979> flip<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.720> pop<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.320> let<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
hard flip you kind of pop it and let the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.149

bird come like that and just going to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
bird come like that and just going to
look<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.090> uneven<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.720> kind<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170

look so it's uneven it's kind of it I
don't<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> kickflip<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:54.090> am

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
don't think of it as a kickflip and I am

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.469 
don't think of it as a kickflip and I am
I'm<00:01:54.390> doing<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.140> pop<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:56.189> that

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
I'm doing it I just pop it up like that

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.760 
I'm doing it I just pop it up like that
and<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.810> catch<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.500> don't<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.560> how<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and then catch up so I don't know how to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350 
and then catch up so I don't know how to
scrub<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.369> that's<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.880> something<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.639 
scrub it that's just something I do it
but<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> best<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.899> error<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.560> was

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
but the best of error is like I was

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.660 
but the best of error is like I was
saying<00:02:04.829> earlier<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.310> kickflip<00:02:05.729> oh<00:02:06.170> Jesus

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.150 

just<00:02:12.670> kick<00:02:12.850> flip<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.240> 90<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.620> then<00:02:14.770> just<00:02:14.920> start

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
just kick flip to 90 and then just start

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.410 
just kick flip to 90 and then just start
going<00:02:15.580> more<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:15.940> more<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:18.970> can<00:02:19.180> get<00:02:19.300> it
