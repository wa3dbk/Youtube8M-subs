00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.910
 there is a girl in this video I want you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.200
 show how to revitalize an eyeliner 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.559
 dry 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.920
 then I had this liner here 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.320
 shiseido paid 21 22 euros with his 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.259
 let's see if it's a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.939
 casey that unfortunately after 6 7 months 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.839
 from the opening it is completely me 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.910
 dried the brush is completely 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.869
 open then this too is not in short 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.870
 more usable 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.570
 and oh well and to avoid wasting throw the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.600
 product left has decided to note 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 try to revitalize the steps 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.530
 they are very very simple I will do to you 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.770
 see just the steps as they are 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 these yellow liners fixed this 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.899
 morning just wanted to make the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.399
 video to see a bit if it worked 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.769
 otherwise I would not even have it 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.850
 made the video and then we start immediately 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:02.070
 then you will need fair water distilled 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 pretend that I had paid it here 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.640
 here there is still a little bit but there 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.500
 I only show the girls passages 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.780
 then I was making it 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.330
 then glycerin liquid this in here 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.310
 in this case it can be found by Marco Screw 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.960
 however very easily in the pharmacy the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.520
 cost however episode 2 euro 53 euro 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.740
 then they put here ok then you need 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 of a syringe 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.450
 I think we say a little about the best weapon 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.580
 to make sure the doses are correct 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.220
 since having the numbers here is 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.470
 impossible to miss a trainer 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.130
 this contains silicones here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.200
 particular and the sector then where is one 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.970
 riina chips and a teaspoon per 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.810
 mix it all is a brush oh well 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.600
 to test that your i 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.530
 your gel eyeliner in the end be it 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.450
 returned as new to remove the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.489
 produced from the jacket and mix it 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.929
 a little I will use a spatula but it should be 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.840
 well in short, anything 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.120
 anything that does a little bit on 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.799
 which one can do a bit of strength to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.959
 I would like to take off the edges 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:23.489
 maybe your dry gel liner 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.080
 so I'll show you a little 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.810
 proceeding girls 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.590
 then as first thing I tell you immediately 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.650
 serving two doses of distilled water 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.290
 for a mourinho dose or a dose of 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.560
 kitchen and two of distilled water then 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.870
 two doses of water are taken 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.290
 distilled sorry ok see 2 and one 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.660
 dose of glycerin then consider that 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:57.030
 I am and the water is removing it 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.230
 so we'll get to the numbers 13 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.930
 done that you can put everything in the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.470
 riina goodies then take yours 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.569
 primer empty it on the spoon this 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.250
 guys is based on how much of 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.450
 eyeliner remained there of course 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.060
 obviously if annoyed ok then I will 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.639
 I had more or less half of China packages 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.150
 so I'll use half a teaspoon of 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:27.900
 primer also put this in the kick e 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.269
 rina circumvented mix everything and I have 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.879
 left a moment there to open the 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.919
 your e line in this case is not dry 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:39.359
 but in yours it will certainly be dry 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:43.250
 move it a little from the sides and edges 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:47.840
 note of the china packaging e 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.879
 always using the syringe 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.370
 pick it up and go to vote 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.400
 in your eyeliner ok 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.310
 did that mix for a while with the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.310
 stir small spatula stir up to 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.370
 when eyeliner according to you if a moment 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.799
 let go then you need god 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.400
 with or at least a microwave where 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.930
 put the liners for about 10 20 30 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.000
 seconds at most because we do n't have 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.669
 still need to do it 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.919
 boil here to make it fry 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.340
 having done this , iran and he was even more 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.300
 soft the iridescent a compound 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.810
 the game is done let a moment wait 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.750
 rest to cool for those five 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.050
 ten minutes and try it out 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.699
 real consistency so I try the 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.970
 consistency with you even if already 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:44.090
 I give it proven I must say that it has improved 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.550
 so much to show us here on mine 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.400

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:55.760

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:58.820
 very very soft writing here 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.190
