guitar but wait yeah
is<00:00:51.729> quite<00:00:52.059> amazing<00:00:52.539> how<00:00:52.809> rapidly<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.710> can

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
is quite amazing how rapidly you can

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:01.559 
is quite amazing how rapidly you can
form<00:00:54.729> a<00:00:56.370> form<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.489> curve<00:00:59.909> we'll<00:01:00.909> just<00:01:01.089> take<00:01:01.479> this

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
form a form a curve we'll just take this

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.710 
form a form a curve we'll just take this
back<00:01:01.749> a<00:01:01.809> bit<00:01:02.019> more<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.420> come<00:01:04.420> around<00:01:04.510> the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
back a bit more and come around the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.420 
back a bit more and come around the
other<00:01:04.750> way<00:01:04.890> okay<00:01:07.830> I've<00:01:08.830> got<00:01:09.040> it's<00:01:09.160> about<00:01:09.310> the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
other way okay I've got it's about the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.930 
other way okay I've got it's about the
right<00:01:09.610> heat<00:01:09.880> now<00:01:10.120> for<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.200> stuff<00:01:11.940> we're

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
right heat now for this stuff we're

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.240 
right heat now for this stuff we're
providing<00:01:13.210> you're<00:01:13.510> careful<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.830> waste<00:01:15.040> is

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
providing you're careful the waste is

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.820 
providing you're careful the waste is
always<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.520> dangerous<00:01:16.000> bit<00:01:16.270> video<00:01:17.170> house<00:01:17.440> helps

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
always a dangerous bit video house helps

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.760 
always a dangerous bit video house helps
to<00:01:18.010> support<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.540> usually<00:01:20.170> even<00:01:20.290> bend<00:01:20.620> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
to support but usually even bend the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.370 
to support but usually even bend the
rest<00:01:20.980> with<00:01:21.310> dry<00:01:21.640> probably<00:01:22.540> still<00:01:22.990> hot

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
rest with dry probably still hot

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:34.260 
rest with dry probably still hot

[Music]

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.110 
[Music]
these<00:01:35.270> all<00:01:35.480> trim<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:36.020> size<00:01:36.050> now<00:01:36.650> ever<00:01:37.120> it's

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
these all trim to size now ever it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.840 
these all trim to size now ever it's
both<00:01:38.330> sides<00:01:38.630> you're<00:01:38.810> holding<00:01:39.110> me<00:01:39.230> yeah<00:01:39.440> yeah

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.990 

that's<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:44.000> little<00:01:44.120> bit<00:01:44.480> cleaner<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.110> I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
that's a little bit cleaner but I

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.400 
that's a little bit cleaner but I
thought<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.210> tape<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.690> them<00:01:47.870> so<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.140> they

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
thought the tape on them so that they

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.070 
thought the tape on them so that they
would<00:01:48.590> keep<00:01:49.400> together<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.910> maybe<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.330> mold<00:01:50.840> and

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
would keep together in maybe a mold and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.380 
would keep together in maybe a mold and
be<00:01:51.230> perfectly<00:01:51.620> aligned<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:52.940> think<00:01:53.240> is

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
be perfectly aligned so I think is

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.550 
be perfectly aligned so I think is
something<00:01:53.570> that's<00:01:53.810> three<00:01:54.140> point<00:01:54.380> five

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
something that's three point five

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.710 
something that's three point five
million<00:01:54.830> home<00:01:55.400> from<00:01:55.700> yeah<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.970> little<00:01:59.630> bit

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
million home from yeah and a little bit

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.880 
million home from yeah and a little bit
lower<00:02:00.080> there<00:02:00.440> but<00:02:00.680> then<00:02:00.830> matter<00:02:01.070> too<00:02:01.340> much

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
lower there but then matter too much

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.759 
lower there but then matter too much
much<00:02:03.890> cleaners<00:02:04.370> up<00:02:04.520> again

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.229 

cut<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.430> down<00:02:11.579> quite<00:02:11.909> hard<00:02:12.900> here

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
cut it down quite hard here

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.940 
cut it down quite hard here
let's<00:02:15.239> basic<00:02:15.629> thing<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.049> they<00:02:16.469> get<00:02:16.620> all<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
let's basic thing so they get all the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.990 
let's basic thing so they get all the
way<00:02:17.069> now

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
way now

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.220 
way now
shake<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.049> guitar<00:02:19.349> no<00:02:19.890> chance

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.860 

so<00:02:22.800> how<00:02:23.190> do<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:23.910> weather<00:02:24.209> well

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
so how do you get that here weather well

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.509 
so how do you get that here weather well

they just lay there the bits of wood

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.880 
they just lay there the bits of wood
family<00:02:26.879> layers<00:02:27.269> are<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.540> there<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:27.930> but<00:02:28.170> this
