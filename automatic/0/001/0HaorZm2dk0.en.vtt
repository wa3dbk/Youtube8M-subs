00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.240 
for 11 days san Antonio's a rhythm team
and<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.630> thought<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.870> think<00:01:22.230> that<00:01:22.440> uh<00:01:22.620> that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and I just thought I think that uh that

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.780 
and I just thought I think that uh that
being<00:01:23.760> said<00:01:24.680> I'm<00:01:25.680> gonna<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.250> favor<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
being said I'm gonna have to favor the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.120 
being said I'm gonna have to favor the
heat<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.180> game<00:01:27.210> 1<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.950> kind

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
heat in game 1 and I think it's a kind

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.400 
heat in game 1 and I think it's a kind
of<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.310> cheap<00:01:29.550> price<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.330> said<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
of a cheap price as you said on the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.800 
of a cheap price as you said on the
series<00:01:31.830> but<00:01:32.100> looking<00:01:32.940> at<00:01:33.090> looking<00:01:33.450> at<00:01:33.690> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
series but looking at looking at the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.800 
series but looking at looking at the
series<00:01:34.260> itself<00:01:34.700> okay<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> Spurs<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.480> good<00:01:36.690> as

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
series itself okay the Spurs as good as

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.230 
series itself okay the Spurs as good as
they<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:36.990> they're<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.280> physical<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
they are they're not as physical as the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.300 
they are they're not as physical as the
Pacers<00:01:39.930> they're<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.440> going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> rebound<00:01:41.100> as

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
Pacers they're not going to rebound as

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.730

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
well as the Pacers do but also not going
to<00:01:43.830> turn<00:01:43.980> it<00:01:44.190> over<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.580> much<00:01:44.760> as<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.120> Pacers

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to turn it over as much as the Pacers

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
to turn it over as much as the Pacers
still<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.920> shoot<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.340> better<00:01:47.550> than

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
still and they shoot it better than

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
still and they shoot it better than
Indiana<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.830> looking<00:01:50.190> at<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.370 
Indiana so I think you're looking at I
you<00:01:51.120> know<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.420> they<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> better<00:01:52.080> bitch

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you know as they have a better bitch

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
you know as they have a better bitch
offensively<00:01:53.310> did<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:53.850> Pacers<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.570> think

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.480

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
so we really know what a coincidence too

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.440 
so we really know what a coincidence too
I<00:02:31.340> mean<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.670> know<00:02:31.820> they<00:02:32.000> were<00:02:32.060> trying<00:02:32.300> to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.360 
I mean you know they were trying to
stick<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.810> right<00:02:32.920> absolutely<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.010> think<00:02:34.250> that's

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
stick it right absolutely I think that's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.130 
stick it right absolutely I think that's
a<00:02:34.490> nice<00:02:34.700> underlying<00:02:35.240> story<00:02:35.600> here<00:02:35.930> you've<00:02:36.110> got

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410

would intend to 80 when all the stars
plate<00:03:00.740> so<00:03:01.070> um<00:03:01.700> let<00:03:02.060> me<00:03:02.090> ask<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.450> about<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
plate so um let me ask you about the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.630 
plate so um let me ask you about the
matchups<00:03:03.200> here<00:03:03.350> because<00:03:03.740> they<00:03:04.250> had<00:03:04.370> trouble

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
matchups here because they had trouble

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.330 
matchups here because they had trouble
with<00:03:04.940> 72<00:03:05.360> Roy<00:03:05.660> Hibbert<00:03:06.080> he<00:03:06.590> came<00:03:06.830> into<00:03:07.010> his<00:03:07.160> own

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
with 72 Roy Hibbert he came into his own

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.250 
with 72 Roy Hibbert he came into his own
looked<00:03:07.670> like<00:03:07.820> an<00:03:07.970> NBA<00:03:08.090> first<00:03:08.600> team<00:03:08.720> all-star

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
looked like an NBA first team all-star

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.670 
looked like an NBA first team all-star
but<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.580> series<00:03:11.000> here<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.840> seems<00:03:12.140> like<00:03:12.320> Chris

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
but this series here it seems like Chris

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.650 
but this series here it seems like Chris
Bosh<00:03:12.890> might<00:03:13.190> have<00:03:13.430> an<00:03:13.580> easier<00:03:13.880> time<00:03:13.910> against

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
Bosh might have an easier time against

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.210 
Bosh might have an easier time against
the<00:03:14.780> Spurs<00:03:15.050> method<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.620> against<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.950> Spurs

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the Spurs method and against the Spurs

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.310 
the Spurs method and against the Spurs
defense<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.820> just<00:03:17.000> seems<00:03:17.239> like<00:03:17.360> they're<00:03:18.110> not

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
defense it just seems like they're not

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.860 
defense it just seems like they're not
as<00:03:18.530> physical<00:03:19.070> Dwyane<00:03:19.880> Wade<00:03:20.120> might<00:03:20.420> have<00:03:20.630> a

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
as physical Dwyane Wade might have a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.540 
as physical Dwyane Wade might have a
better<00:03:21.350> time<00:03:21.650> being<00:03:21.860> able<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.070> go<00:03:22.160> up<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.430> down

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
better time being able to go up and down

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.250 
better time being able to go up and down
the<00:03:22.760> floor<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.180> not<00:03:23.330> being<00:03:23.480> checked<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.019> much

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
the floor and not being checked so much

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.740 
the floor and not being checked so much
it<00:03:24.800> seems<00:03:25.040> like<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> better<00:03:25.489> matchup<00:03:25.880> overall

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
it seems like a better matchup overall

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.530 
it seems like a better matchup overall
for<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:28.160> Miami<00:03:28.519> Heat<00:03:28.790> compared<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.269> what<00:03:29.360> we

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
for the Miami Heat compared to what we

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.390 
for the Miami Heat compared to what we
saw<00:03:29.780> against<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.110> Pacers<00:03:30.530> Edwards<00:03:31.040> forgot

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
saw against the Pacers Edwards forgot

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.910 
saw against the Pacers Edwards forgot
that<00:03:31.550> I<00:03:31.580> agree<00:03:32.030> with<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.360> there<00:03:32.540> are<00:03:33.500> more<00:03:33.739> up

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
that I agree with you there are more up

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.740 
that I agree with you there are more up
and<00:03:34.070> down<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.459> floor<00:03:34.610> team<00:03:34.940> or<00:03:35.150> more<00:03:35.330> finesse

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
and down the floor team or more finesse

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.199 
and down the floor team or more finesse
team<00:03:36.019> than<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.350> Pacers<00:03:36.890> orbitals<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.700> think

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
team than the Pacers orbitals I think

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.870 
team than the Pacers orbitals I think
that<00:03:38.390> favors<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.080> heat<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.739> game<00:03:39.800> 7<00:03:40.550> against

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
that favors the heat in game 7 against

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.000 
that favors the heat in game 7 against
Indiana<00:03:41.300> you<00:03:41.480> did<00:03:41.690> see<00:03:41.959> weight<00:03:42.230> step<00:03:42.590> up<00:03:42.830> if

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
Indiana you did see weight step up if

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.250 
Indiana you did see weight step up if
you<00:03:43.130> did<00:03:43.340> see<00:03:43.580> Boston<00:03:44.090> right<00:03:44.300> now<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.750> play

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
you did see Boston right now and play

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.500 
you did see Boston right now and play
better<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.670> know<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:46.790> think<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.269> an<00:03:47.390> up

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
better and I you know I think it's an up

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.740 
better and I you know I think it's an up
and<00:03:47.660> down<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.989> floor<00:03:48.220> series<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.519> as<00:03:50.120> series

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
and down the floor series and as series

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.410 
and down the floor series and as series
traditionally<00:03:51.530> go<00:03:51.739> Mike<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.459> defense

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
traditionally go Mike the defense

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.560 
traditionally go Mike the defense
tightens<00:03:53.959> up<00:03:54.140> as<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.920> series<00:03:55.220> move<00:03:55.670> on<00:03:56.000> so

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
tightens up as the series move on so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.960 
tightens up as the series move on so
usually<00:03:56.989> earlier<00:03:57.650> indecision<00:03:58.250> more<00:03:58.640> likely

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
usually earlier indecision more likely

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.300 
usually earlier indecision more likely
to<00:03:59.120> see<00:03:59.300> it<00:03:59.420> over<00:03:59.780> and<00:03:59.959> that's<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.100> way<00:04:01.190> I'm

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
to see it over and that's the way I'm

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.850 
to see it over and that's the way I'm
leaning

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
leaning

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.920 
leaning
one<00:04:02.190> also<00:04:02.550> i<00:04:02.580> think<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.120> heater<00:04:03.450> gotta<00:04:03.720> win

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
one also i think the heater gotta win

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.650 
one also i think the heater gotta win
day<00:04:04.140> one<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.740> I'm<00:04:05.730> gonna<00:04:05.910> have<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.180> play<00:04:06.450> on<00:04:06.630> the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
day one and I'm gonna have a play on the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.440 
day one and I'm gonna have a play on the
total<00:04:07.140> over<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.650> 189<00:04:08.100> also<00:04:08.730> how<00:04:09.210> about<00:04:09.420> a

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
total over the 189 also how about a

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.780 
total over the 189 also how about a
sweet<00:04:09.900> can<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.440> take<00:04:10.800> four<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.280> one<00:04:11.490> here<00:04:11.700> at

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
sweet can you take four to one here at

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.190 
sweet can you take four to one here at
the<00:04:11.880> south<00:04:12.060> point<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.570> they<00:04:12.720> heat<00:04:12.930> winning

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
the south point that they heat winning

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.020 
the south point that they heat winning
four<00:04:13.530> games<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:15.560> think<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.799> like<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.640> heat<00:04:17.820> to

I<00:04:38.040> don't<00:04:38.130> know<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.490> we're<00:04:38.610> looking<00:04:38.700> at<00:04:38.970> a
