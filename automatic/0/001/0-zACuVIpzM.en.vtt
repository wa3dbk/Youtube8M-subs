turns out she's actually wearing a suit
I<00:00:35.579> guess<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.030> guess<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.510> considered<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.140> suit

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
I guess I guess it's considered a suit

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.810 
I guess I guess it's considered a suit
because<00:00:37.380> she<00:00:37.590> tries<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.980> shoot<00:00:38.190> something<00:00:38.489> at

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820

because she tries to shoot something at
the<00:00:38.969> rear<00:00:39.090> uka<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:40.040> guess<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.070> happens<00:00:41.489> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the rear uka and guess what happens it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.619 
the rear uka and guess what happens it
blows<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:41.969> inside<00:00:42.420> her<00:00:42.540> suit<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.399> that's<00:00:44.629> kind
