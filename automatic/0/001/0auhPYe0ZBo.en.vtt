 Hello! 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.040

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.629
 I will leave in the description of the video. 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.539
 From thick cardboard you need to cut a triangle. 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:43.480
 Me height 16 cm and width 12 cm 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.880
 Now we need yarn I have acrylic he is 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.530
 cheap. 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.010
 We start wrapping the layout of the Christmas tree with yarn, periodically 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.809
 glue the base with glue from the gun. 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:02:54.820
 I wrapped the sketch twice, for a more dense filling. 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.700
 Now we will decorate the Christmas tree with a zigzag braid 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:29.090
 about 1 m We attach a loop. 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.850
 Decorate the top with stars, I made them out of hats 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:57.220
 for beads. 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.570
 On the front side of the Christmas tree glue beads, diameter 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:14.380
 beads 6 mm In the middle of the star will paste 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:26.430
 yellow semi beads. 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.460
