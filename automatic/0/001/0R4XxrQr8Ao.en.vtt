00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.160 
those of you who've never tried a clay
mask<00:00:55.579> before<00:00:55.969> I<00:00:56.180> highly<00:00:56.660> recommend<00:00:56.809> you

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
mask before I highly recommend you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.990 
mask before I highly recommend you
included<00:00:57.710> into<00:00:57.890> your<00:00:58.039> skin<00:00:58.250> care<00:00:58.489> routine<00:00:58.579> I

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
included into your skin care routine I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.880 
included into your skin care routine I
have<00:00:59.300> dry<00:00:59.570> skin<00:00:59.840> but<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.079> still<00:01:00.379> use<00:01:00.559> a<00:01:00.590> clay

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
have dry skin but I still use a clay

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.529 
have dry skin but I still use a clay
mask<00:01:01.070> just<00:01:01.370> because<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:01.760> find<00:01:02.090> that<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.359> really

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
mask just because I find that it really

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.900 
mask just because I find that it really
tightens<00:01:02.989> my<00:01:03.079> skin<00:01:03.590> and<00:01:03.800> shrinks<00:01:04.430> my<00:01:04.580> pores

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
tightens my skin and shrinks my pores

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.600 
tightens my skin and shrinks my pores
because<00:01:05.780> oftentimes<00:01:06.320> clay<00:01:06.950> masks<00:01:07.220> are<00:01:07.430> better

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
because oftentimes clay masks are better

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.460 
because oftentimes clay masks are better
for<00:01:07.820> people<00:01:07.970> with<00:01:08.240> oily<00:01:08.420> skin<00:01:08.540> because<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:09.320> can

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
for people with oily skin because it can

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.890 
for people with oily skin because it can
absorb<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.979> excess<00:01:10.310> oil<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.939> it<00:01:11.659> will<00:01:11.750> also

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
absorb the excess oil and it will also

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.719 
absorb the excess oil and it will also
draw<00:01:12.260> impurities<00:01:12.830> from<00:01:12.979> your<00:01:13.189> pores<00:01:13.490> and

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
draw impurities from your pores and

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.820 
draw impurities from your pores and
after<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.299> wash<00:01:14.540> this<00:01:14.720> off<00:01:14.930> my<00:01:15.170> skin<00:01:15.439> just<00:01:15.590> feels

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
after I wash this off my skin just feels

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.679 
after I wash this off my skin just feels
really<00:01:16.159> tight<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.580> tingly<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.540> other

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
really tight and tingly and the other

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.240 
really tight and tingly and the other

watch<00:03:12.850> my<00:03:13.030> videos<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.450> know<00:03:13.570> that<00:03:13.720> I'm<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> big

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
watch my videos you know that I'm a big

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.750 
watch my videos you know that I'm a big
fan<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.320> these<00:03:14.560> because<00:03:14.950> they're<00:03:15.190> inexpensive

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
fan of these because they're inexpensive

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.660 
fan of these because they're inexpensive
and<00:03:16.320> they're<00:03:17.320> really<00:03:17.500> pigmented<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.340> only

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
and they're really pigmented the only

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.340 
and they're really pigmented the only
downfall<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.360> they're<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> bit<00:03:20.049> powdery

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
downfall is that they're a bit powdery

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.740 
downfall is that they're a bit powdery

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
use it all the time but sometimes when

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.479

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
starts to become kind of bread because

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.350 
starts to become kind of bread because
there's<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.130> bit<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.430> red<00:03:36.640> undertone<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.209> it
