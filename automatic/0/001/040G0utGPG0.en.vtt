00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
mail or something you know that it's

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.120 
mail or something you know that it's
really<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.329> package<00:00:47.329> well<00:00:47.600> as<00:00:47.870> for<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:48.950> pad

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
really a package well as for the pad

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.550 
really a package well as for the pad
itself<00:00:49.340> this<00:00:49.880> is<00:00:50.030> what<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.300> looks<00:00:50.540> like<00:00:50.780> the

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
itself this is what it looks like the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.200 
itself this is what it looks like the
only<00:00:51.739> downside<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.220> would<00:00:52.430> say<00:00:52.640> is<00:00:52.880> that<00:00:53.090> the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
only downside I would say is that the

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.420 
only downside I would say is that the
cover<00:00:53.540> is<00:00:53.840> cardboard<00:00:54.380> which<00:00:54.860> is<00:00:55.070> kind<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.340> a

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
cover is cardboard which is kind of a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.650 
cover is cardboard which is kind of a
bummer<00:00:55.610> because<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:56.149> makes<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:56.480> look<00:00:56.630> a

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
bummer because it just makes it look a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.960 
bummer because it just makes it look a
little<00:00:56.809> bit<00:00:57.050> cheapy<00:00:57.470> but<00:00:58.340> other<00:00:58.610> than<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.850> I

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
little bit cheapy but other than that I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.490 
little bit cheapy but other than that I
think<00:00:59.270> that's<00:00:59.420> my<00:00:59.540> only<00:00:59.750> dislike<00:01:00.290> of<00:01:00.470> the

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
think that's my only dislike of the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.530 
think that's my only dislike of the
palette<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.130> let<00:01:01.730> me<00:01:01.820> open<00:01:01.969> it<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.300> show<00:01:02.480> you
