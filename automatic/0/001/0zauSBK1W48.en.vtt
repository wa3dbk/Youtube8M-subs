vibrator<00:02:45.340> blades<00:02:45.760> these<00:02:46.030> are<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.330> for

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
vibrator blades these are just for

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480 
vibrator blades these are just for
chatter<00:02:46.690> baits<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.200> was<00:02:47.950> gonna<00:02:48.040> try<00:02:48.250> some<00:02:48.430> of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
chatter baits I was gonna try some of

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.980 
chatter baits I was gonna try some of
these<00:02:48.550> blades<00:02:48.760> out<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.390> know<00:02:49.450> they're<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
these blades out I know they're the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.390 
these blades out I know they're the
different<00:02:50.290> blades<00:02:50.500> create<00:02:50.740> different<00:02:51.100> action

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
different blades create different action

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.820 
different blades create different action
in<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.580> water<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:53.320> ones<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.650> come

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
in the water and the ones that come

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.620 
in the water and the ones that come
stock<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.370> like<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> new<00:02:54.850> text<00:02:55.270> are<00:02:55.390> kind<00:02:55.570> of

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
stock on like the new text are kind of

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.030 
stock on like the new text are kind of
like<00:02:55.720> thicker<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.320> put<00:02:56.620> off<00:02:56.740> heavier

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
like thicker and put off heavier

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.260 
like thicker and put off heavier
vibration<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.610> think<00:02:57.790> these<00:02:57.910> ones<00:02:58.090> are<00:02:58.240> a

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
vibration I think these ones are a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.550 
vibration I think these ones are a
little<00:02:58.360> thinner<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.200> being<00:02:59.380> less

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
little thinner so it being less

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.830 
little thinner so it being less
vibration<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.520> that's<00:03:00.910> gonna<00:03:01.060> intermix<00:03:01.690> them

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
vibration and that's gonna intermix them

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.150 
vibration and that's gonna intermix them
in<00:03:02.050> case<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.350> needed<00:03:02.530> something<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:02.890> that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
in case I needed something like that

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.460 
in case I needed something like that
down<00:03:03.370> then<00:03:04.030> when<00:03:04.210> I'm<00:03:04.300> in<00:03:04.390> Louisiana<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.110> just
