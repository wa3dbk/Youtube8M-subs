was<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.670> this<00:00:59.670> camera<00:01:00.000> has<00:01:00.030> dual<00:01:00.510> CF<00:01:01.020> card

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
was that this camera has dual CF card

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
was that this camera has dual CF card
slots<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.699> great<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
slots which is really great because you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.350 
slots which is really great because you
can<00:01:03.690> set<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.320> once<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.360> CF

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
can set it up so once one of your CF

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
can set it up so once one of your CF
cards<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> full<00:01:07.110> it'll<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.770> bounce<00:01:07.950> right

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
cards is full it'll just bounce right

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.649 
cards is full it'll just bounce right

outlaws vs. the Richmond wrecking bells

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.950 
outlaws vs. the Richmond wrecking bells
I<00:01:25.110> put<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> iso<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> 1600<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.750> pretty

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
I put the iso up to 1600 it was pretty

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.770 
I put the iso up to 1600 it was pretty
low<00:01:28.140> light<00:01:28.350> inside<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> arena<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.509> set<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
low light inside the arena and set it to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.950 
low light inside the arena and set it to
auto<00:01:31.439> exposure<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:33.060> aperture<00:01:33.390> priority<00:01:33.540> mode

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
auto exposure in aperture priority mode

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630 
auto exposure in aperture priority mode
which<00:01:34.229> means<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.590> shutter<00:01:34.829> speed<00:01:35.130> adjusted

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
which means the shutter speed adjusted

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.539 
which means the shutter speed adjusted
as<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.240> was<00:01:36.390> shooting<00:01:36.540> around<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> track<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
as I was shooting around the track and

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
as I was shooting around the track and
tried<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> test<00:01:39.060> out<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> tracking<00:01:39.900> focus<00:01:40.259> as

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
tried to test out the tracking focus as

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.170 
tried to test out the tracking focus as
the<00:01:40.680> girls<00:01:40.920> went<00:01:41.130> around<00:01:41.280> yeah<00:01:41.880> traffic

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the girls went around yeah traffic

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.910 
the girls went around yeah traffic
basically<00:01:42.720> auto<00:01:42.840> tracking<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.619> track

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
basically auto tracking would like track

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
basically auto tracking would like track
something<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.700> glacier<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
something as it's like glacier so I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170 
something as it's like glacier so I
should<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.930> been<00:01:46.049> able<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.700> maintain<00:01:47.700> focus

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
should have been able to maintain focus

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.609 
should have been able to maintain focus
on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> girls<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.079> went<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
on the girls as they went around the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.679 
on the girls as they went around the
track<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.549> should<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:50.970> held<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> focus

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
track and it should have held the focus

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.569 
track and it should have held the focus
as<00:01:51.899> we're<00:01:52.320> coming<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.860> leuthold<00:01:53.340> girl

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
most of us up the exposures were always

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.559 
most of us up the exposures were always
dead<00:02:04.859> on<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:05.280> fendt<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.789> matrix<00:02:06.179> metering<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
dead on I fendt the matrix metering and

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.449 
dead on I fendt the matrix metering and
this<00:02:06.719> camera<00:02:06.929> was<00:02:07.140> perfect<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.740> feel<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.280> way

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
this camera was perfect I feel that way

this camera was perfect I feel that way
major<00:02:08.700> commuter<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> auto

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
major commuter you it it's the auto

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.660 
major commuter you it it's the auto
metering<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.739> basically<00:02:11.069> takes<00:02:11.750> 1000<00:02:12.750> pixel

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
metering it basically takes 1000 pixel

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.030 
metering it basically takes 1000 pixel
segments<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.819> rounds<00:02:15.810> out<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.170> exposure<00:02:16.830> for

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
segments and rounds out the exposure for

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.740 
segments and rounds out the exposure for
you<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.459> auto<00:02:17.610> exposure<00:02:17.910> okay<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.540> it's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
you it's auto exposure okay so it's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.420 
you it's auto exposure okay so it's
basically<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.140> fancy<00:02:19.530> wasting<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:19.950> its<00:02:20.250> auto

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
basically just fancy wasting on its auto

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.400 
basically just fancy wasting on its auto
exposure<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.910> okay<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.420> gave<00:02:21.599> this<00:02:21.750> say<00:02:21.989> best

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
exposure you okay we gave this say best

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.800 
exposure you okay we gave this say best
out<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.560> test<00:02:22.769> rating<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.340> fall<00:02:23.489> fest<00:02:23.760> 2008<00:02:24.299> we

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
out of test rating and fall fest 2008 we

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.710 
out of test rating and fall fest 2008 we
got<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> 9<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.410> 10<00:02:25.880> would<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.000> agree<00:02:27.510> with

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
got a 9 out of 10 would you agree with

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.559 
got a 9 out of 10 would you agree with
that<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:28.319> right<00:02:28.739> now<00:02:28.769> or<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.670> think<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
that for right now or I think that the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.300 
that for right now or I think that the
camera<00:02:30.959> would<00:02:31.349> definitely<00:02:31.799> rate<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.160> high

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
camera would definitely rate that high

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.400 
camera would definitely rate that high
so<00:02:32.910> it's<00:02:33.269> five<00:02:33.480> thousand<00:02:33.780> dollars<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.319> a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
so it's five thousand dollars for just a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.990 
so it's five thousand dollars for just a
body<00:02:34.560> right<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.069> about<00:02:35.250> ok<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.579> this<00:02:35.700> lens

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
body right just about ok and this lens

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.479 
body right just about ok and this lens
