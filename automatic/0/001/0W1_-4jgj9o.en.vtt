00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
now let's take a look at building a

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.580 
now let's take a look at building a
slideshow<00:00:14.549> using<00:00:14.759> photographs<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.750> iMovie

let's<00:00:27.840> start<00:00:28.080> off<00:00:28.199> by<00:00:28.230> creating<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.980> new<00:00:29.670> movie

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
let's start off by creating a new movie

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.459 
let's start off by creating a new movie
project<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.759> then<00:00:32.759> we'll<00:00:32.940> simply<00:00:33.570> set<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
project and then we'll simply set it to

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.700 
project and then we'll simply set it to
no<00:00:34.710> theme<00:00:37.309> we'll<00:00:38.309> name<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.559> then<00:00:40.559> we'll

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
no theme we'll name it and then we'll

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.959 
no theme we'll name it and then we'll
look<00:00:40.829> at<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> iPhoto<00:00:41.430> library<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.940> can

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
look at the iPhoto library and you can

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
look at the iPhoto library and you can
see<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.690> drag<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.290> drop<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> go

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
see I can drag and drop I'm going to go

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.709 
see I can drag and drop I'm going to go
into<00:00:44.340> advanced<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.059> look<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.270> my<00:00:45.360> albums

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
into advanced I can look at my albums

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.760 
into advanced I can look at my albums
things<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.590> drag

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
things like that but I'm going to drag

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.779 
things like that but I'm going to drag
and<00:00:46.920> drop<00:00:46.980> photos<00:00:48.020> here<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> put<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.340> few<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and drop photos here and put a few of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.189 
and drop photos here and put a few of
them<00:00:50.910> right<00:00:51.870> after<00:00:52.230> each<00:00:52.350> other<00:00:53.719> let's<00:00:54.719> shrink

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
them right after each other let's shrink

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
them right after each other let's shrink
down<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.559> magnification<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.699> could

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
down the magnification here so I could

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.060 
down the magnification here so I could
see<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.390> more<00:00:57.510> easily<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
see them a little more easily and you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.099 
see them a little more easily and you
can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.520> away<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.940> by<00:01:00.329> default<00:01:00.840> have

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
can see right away they by default have

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
can see right away they by default have
this<00:01:01.230> kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> Ken<00:01:01.739> Burns<00:01:01.770> effect<00:01:02.579> where<00:01:03.030> they

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
this kind of Ken Burns effect where they

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.730 
this kind of Ken Burns effect where they
they<00:01:03.570> zoom<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.750> we

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
they zoom in and out like that and we

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.690 
they zoom in and out like that and we
can<00:01:07.950> adjust<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.700> pretty<00:01:08.970> easily<00:01:09.380> by<00:01:10.700> simply

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
can adjust that pretty easily by simply

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.499 
can adjust that pretty easily by simply
selecting<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.400> photo<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.420> go

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
selecting the photo there and we can go

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.510 
selecting the photo there and we can go
to<00:01:15.570> adjust<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.439> under<00:01:16.860> adjust<00:01:17.189> we've<00:01:17.369> got

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to adjust and under adjust we've got

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.330 
to adjust and under adjust we've got
cropping<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> set<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> Ken<00:01:20.040> Burns

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
cropping you can see it set to Ken Burns

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
cropping you can see it set to Ken Burns
and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.180> your<00:01:21.330> start<00:01:21.750> area<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.619> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and you have your start area and you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.039 
and you have your start area and you
have<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.189> end<00:01:23.369> area<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.689> could<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.900> lots

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
have your end area so we could do lots

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710 
have your end area so we could do lots
of<00:01:25.200> different<00:01:25.500> things<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:27.150> animate

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
of different things with this to animate

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.569 
of different things with this to animate
the<00:01:27.869> photo<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:29.340> pretty

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the photo and it's pretty

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.700 
the photo and it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:29.939> how<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> works<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.350> now<00:01:31.560> if

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
self-explanatory how it works and now if

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.810 
self-explanatory how it works and now if
we<00:01:31.799> move<00:01:32.790> through<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.509> could<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.930> let's

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
we move through here we could see let's

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.780 
we move through here we could see let's
accept<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.060> by<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> name<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.700> button<00:01:38.700> again

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
accept this by the name the button again

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
accept this by the name the button again
up<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.869> could<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.259> how<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
up there and then we could see how it

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.889 
up there and then we could see how it
goes<00:01:41.100> from<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.000> other<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.810> we

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
goes from one to the other but if we

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.510 
goes from one to the other but if we
don't<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:43.860> what<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.280> want

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
don't want that that's not what we want

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.420 
don't want that that's not what we want
we<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.000> fit<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.659> crop<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.530> crop<00:01:47.220> well

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
we can use fit or crop and crop well

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.160 
we can use fit or crop and crop well
then<00:01:47.640> fill<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> entire<00:01:48.240> frame<00:01:48.630> here<00:01:48.899> Rawls

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
then fill the entire frame here Rawls

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.770 
then fill the entire frame here Rawls
fit<00:01:49.829> will<00:01:50.100> actually<00:01:50.490> fit<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> entire<00:01:51.479> photo

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
fit will actually fit the entire photo

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.510 
fit will actually fit the entire photo
in<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.530> gonna<00:01:52.649> leave<00:01:52.829> black<00:01:53.009> bars<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
in but it's gonna leave black bars and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
in but it's gonna leave black bars and
left<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.720> photo<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
left and right because the photo is a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
left and right because the photo is a
four<00:01:55.439> by<00:01:55.590> three<00:01:55.619> photo<00:01:56.130> where<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:57.090> doing<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
four by three photo where I'm doing a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.899 
four by three photo where I'm doing a
sixteen<00:01:57.930> by<00:01:58.079> nine<00:01:58.110> video<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.340> cropping<00:01:59.759> does

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
sixteen by nine video so cropping does

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.719 
sixteen by nine video so cropping does
this<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:01.229> adjust<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:02.280> part<00:02:02.610> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
this and I can then adjust what part of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.479 
this and I can then adjust what part of
the<00:02:03.450> photo<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.899> want<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:05.100> include<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.909> there<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
the photo I want to include in there and

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.369 
the photo I want to include in there and
now<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.670> see<00:02:08.849> now<00:02:09.000> along<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.780> duration

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
now you can see now along the duration

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.260 
now you can see now along the duration
of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> photo<00:02:10.860> if<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.280> scrub<00:02:11.610> back<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.060> forth

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
of the photo if I scrub back and forth

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.880 
of the photo if I scrub back and forth
you<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:12.780> there's<00:02:13.050> no<00:02:13.200> movement

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you see there's no movement

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.650 
you see there's no movement
using<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> Ken<00:02:14.520> Burns<00:02:14.790> effect<00:02:15.030> there<00:02:15.480> at<00:02:15.600> all

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
using the Ken Burns effect there at all

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.240 
using the Ken Burns effect there at all
now<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:16.560> videos<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.130> add

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
now just like with videos I can add

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.150 
now just like with videos I can add
transitions<00:02:17.600> between<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:19.140> photos<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.800> can<00:02:19.950> use

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
transitions between the photos I can use

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
transitions between the photos I can use
the<00:02:20.280> same<00:02:20.460> transitions<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.660> are<00:02:21.720> used<00:02:21.960> in

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
the same transitions that are used in

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.840 
the same transitions that are used in
the<00:02:22.200> video<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.430> drag<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.820> drop

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
the video so I can just drag and drop

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.510 
the video so I can just drag and drop
those<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.600> there<00:02:27.380> now<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.650> see<00:02:28.950> as<00:02:29.460> you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
those in there now you can see as you

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.370 
those in there now you can see as you
scrub<00:02:29.880> across<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.840> transitions<00:02:33.200> like<00:02:34.200> that

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
scrub across it it transitions like that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.310 
scrub across it it transitions like that
and<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:35.250> go<00:02:35.370> apply<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> same<00:02:36.480> effects<00:02:37.110> as

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
and you go apply the same effects as

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.560 
and you go apply the same effects as
well<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> could<00:02:38.340> click<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.270> video<00:02:39.390> here

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
well so I could click on this video here

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.250 
well so I could click on this video here
and<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.080> could<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.580> color<00:02:41.580> effects<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.990> these

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
and I could do color effects like these

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
and I could do color effects like these
and<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.580> video<00:02:44.880> effects<00:02:45.209> as<00:02:45.420> well<00:02:46.280> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
and I can do video effects as well and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.670 
and I can do video effects as well and
you<00:02:47.760> could<00:02:47.850> preview<00:02:48.450> there<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.500> right

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
you could preview there on the right

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.729 
you could preview there on the right
what<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.010> looks<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.050> get<00:02:52.110> decide<00:02:52.500> to

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
what it looks like and I get decide to

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.050 
what it looks like and I get decide to
to<00:02:53.340> stick<00:02:53.580> one<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.680> by<00:02:56.130> using<00:02:56.280> an<00:02:56.520> animated

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
to stick one in so by using an animated

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.870 
to stick one in so by using an animated
effect<00:02:57.420> like<00:02:57.720> say<00:02:57.959> aged<00:02:58.230> film<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.400> actually

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
effect like say aged film I can actually

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.300 
effect like say aged film I can actually
even<00:03:00.030> make<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.420> look<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:01.440> its<00:03:01.650> video<00:03:01.950> because

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
even make it look like its video because

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.940 
even make it look like its video because
there's<00:03:02.459> something<00:03:02.640> moving<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:04.020> there<00:03:04.470> now

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
there's something moving on there now

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.740 
there's something moving on there now
you're<00:03:05.100> not<00:03:05.190> restricted<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:06.030> grabbing

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
you're not restricted to just grabbing

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.750 
you're not restricted to just grabbing
things<00:03:06.930> from<00:03:07.170> your<00:03:07.320> iPhoto<00:03:07.770> library<00:03:07.860> from

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
things from your iPhoto library from

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.160 
things from your iPhoto library from
there<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:09.330> can<00:03:09.720> actually<00:03:09.870> go<00:03:10.140> from

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
there like that you can actually go from

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.199 
there like that you can actually go from
the<00:03:10.380> finder<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.250> here's<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.580> Finder<00:03:11.970> window<00:03:12.180> and

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
the finder so here's a Finder window and

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.300 
the finder so here's a Finder window and
I've<00:03:12.360> got<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> bunch<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.810> pictures<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:14.100> could

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
I've got a bunch of pictures and I could

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.340 
I've got a bunch of pictures and I could
actually<00:03:14.700> drag<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.000> drop<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.360> picture<00:03:15.780> into

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
actually drag and drop a picture into

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.699 
actually drag and drop a picture into
the<00:03:17.540> timeline<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.620> not

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
the timeline just like that so it's not

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.620 
the timeline just like that so it's not
even<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.070> my<00:03:20.130> iPhoto<00:03:20.580> library<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.480> works

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
even in my iPhoto library and that works

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.509 
even in my iPhoto library and that works
just<00:03:21.720> fine<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.890> don't<00:03:23.040> even<00:03:23.160> need<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.370> use

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
just fine so you don't even need to use

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.340 
just fine so you don't even need to use
iPhoto<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.840> drag<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.200> drop<00:03:25.230> a

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
iPhoto for this you can drag and drop a

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.170 
iPhoto for this you can drag and drop a
whole<00:03:25.680> folder<00:03:26.250> full<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.670> pictures<00:03:26.850> into

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
whole folder full of pictures into

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.470 
whole folder full of pictures into
iMovie<00:03:27.450> it'll<00:03:27.870> throw<00:03:28.110> them<00:03:28.350> all<00:03:28.560> together<00:03:28.920> and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
iMovie it'll throw them all together and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.360 
iMovie it'll throw them all together and
create<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.690> slideshow<00:03:31.140> for<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.769> addition

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
create a slideshow for you in addition

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.310 
create a slideshow for you in addition
of<00:03:32.459> course<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.790> could<00:03:32.910> also<00:03:33.120> use<00:03:33.390> titles<00:03:33.810> you

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
of course you could also use titles you

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.770 
of course you could also use titles you
could<00:03:34.530> put<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.950> title<00:03:35.280> over<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> photo<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.750> I

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
could put the title over the photo so I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.780 
could put the title over the photo so I
could<00:03:40.080> assign<00:03:40.380> some<00:03:40.620> text<00:03:40.980> there<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.489> just

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
could assign some text there and just

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.539 
could assign some text there and just
select<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:44.930> change<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.170> text<00:03:46.380> or<00:03:47.250> easily

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
select it and change the text or easily

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.900 
select it and change the text or easily
I<00:03:47.820> could<00:03:48.150> also<00:03:48.420> add<00:03:48.900> text<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.920> say<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
I could also add text to say the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.500 
I could also add text to say the
beginning<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.709> video<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:54.090> let's<00:03:54.330> find

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
beginning of the video so let's find

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.000 
beginning of the video so let's find
something<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.900> works<00:03:55.500> for<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:57.769> let's<00:03:58.769> say

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
something that works for that let's say

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.370 
something that works for that let's say
let's<00:03:59.250> use<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:02.580> standard<00:04:03.060> here<00:04:03.390> I<00:04:03.540> can<00:04:04.260> put

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
let's use the standard here I can put

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.530 
let's use the standard here I can put
that<00:04:04.530> before<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:05.310> video<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.090> get<00:04:06.269> see<00:04:06.390> how<00:04:06.450> it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
that before the video and get see how it

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.220 
that before the video and get see how it
drops<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.799> now<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.450> can<00:04:09.450> have<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.840> as<00:04:09.989> its

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
drops in so now I can have that as its

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.390 
drops in so now I can have that as its
own<00:04:10.350> thing<00:04:10.380> if<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:10.950> want<00:04:11.070> to<00:04:11.130> change<00:04:11.250> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
own thing if I want to change the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.699 
own thing if I want to change the
duration<00:04:11.670> of<00:04:11.940> any<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.239> these<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.660> can<00:04:13.200> select

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
duration of any of these I can select

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.460 
duration of any of these I can select
them<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.660> under<00:04:15.660> adjustments<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.229> can<00:04:16.320> go<00:04:16.410> to

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
them and under adjustments I can go to

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.680 
them and under adjustments I can go to
info<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.160> there<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.880> duration<00:04:18.570> right

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
info and there I have duration right

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.150 
info and there I have duration right
there<00:04:18.870> on<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.109> right<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.739> can<00:04:19.979> make<00:04:20.130> it

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
there on the right so I can make it

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.830 
there on the right so I can make it
twice<00:04:20.579> as<00:04:20.760> long<00:04:20.880> just<00:04:21.060> like<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.510> but<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.720> could

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
twice as long just like that but I could

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.490 
twice as long just like that but I could
also<00:04:21.989> drag<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.130> edges<00:04:23.690> here<00:04:24.690> if<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.229> don't<00:04:25.289> need

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
also drag the edges here if I don't need

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.320 
also drag the edges here if I don't need
