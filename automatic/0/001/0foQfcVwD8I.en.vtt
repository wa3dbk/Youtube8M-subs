Alslam alykom and peace be upon you my dear viewers

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.760
welcome to a new episode from "Mohamed Altayar "

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.140
Dear viewrs

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.860
i Published a post ......on my page on facebook

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.440
talking about that i will choose 4 main topics , polled by you

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.740
the first choice was "explaining exploit-db.com"

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.600
and how to search for vulnerabilities through the website

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.020
so this will be the topic now

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.940
so , exploit-db is a famous website that include all vulnrblties types

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.020
remote , web , local exploits , all of them are included inside

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.040
pentesters and ethical hackers is in need for vulnarblties

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.040
so they all search for it on the internet,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.760
exploit-db Website offer it all , so its a databse

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.760
inside it all the exploits

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.520
each new discovered vulnerabilities it will get published and the database will be updated

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520
and will be in the main page and the database

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.920
so we can access the website through google

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.100
and then get the vulnerability then expliot it using the code

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.780
so we will see in this video how to browse exploit-db

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.140
and search for a exploits

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140
and the sections , types of vulnerabilities

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.280
so, we have the first section, if we browse the website as we see

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600
We will see "Remote exploits"

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.780
the remote exploits, this exploits when get exploited 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.520
it will establish a remote connection between the exploiter and the target

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.100
either through the Lan , internet , or different other networks

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.420
or diffrent type of systems for , Smartphones, routers and normal the PC's

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.320
so,,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.240
the remote exploits consist of OS commands normally before though we will listening on a port 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.220
to establish between our open port and the exploited service on the target port a remote connection

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.860
so therefore we have here 2 types of connection also, "bind shell" and "reverse shell" difference is in the connection
