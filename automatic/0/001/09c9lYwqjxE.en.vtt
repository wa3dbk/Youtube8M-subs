00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
with this one that was pretty much the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.430 
with this one that was pretty much the
gist<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.570> chapter<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.020> feel<00:02:43.290> as<00:02:43.410> though

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
gist of the chapter I feel as though

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.950 
gist of the chapter I feel as though
like<00:02:43.740> heroes<00:02:44.400> shouldn't<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:44.820> dangled<00:02:45.330> that

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
like heroes shouldn't have dangled that

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.470 
like heroes shouldn't have dangled that
ray<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.380> hope<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.800> us<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:48.240> was<00:02:48.360> gonna

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
ray of hope on us that was gonna

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.970 
ray of hope on us that was gonna
get<00:02:48.690> really<00:02:48.900> dark<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.260> he<00:02:49.350> wasn't<00:02:49.650> planning<00:02:49.920> on

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
get really dark if he wasn't planning on

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.140 
get really dark if he wasn't planning on
falling<00:02:50.190> through<00:02:50.460> all<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.670> way<00:02:50.760> with<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:50.940> I'm

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
falling through all the way with it I'm

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.420 
falling through all the way with it I'm
just<00:02:51.420> saying<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.780> feels<00:02:51.930> as<00:02:52.140> though<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.500> you

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
just saying it feels as though like you

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.340 
just saying it feels as though like you
can<00:02:53.580> predict<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.660> just<00:02:54.690> you're<00:02:55.200> there

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
can predict it but you just you're there

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.780 
can predict it but you just you're there
hoping<00:02:55.710> like<00:02:55.830> yeah<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.160> maybe<00:02:56.400> he's<00:02:56.610> really

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
hoping like yeah and maybe he's really

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.220 
hoping like yeah and maybe he's really
gonna<00:02:57.060> come<00:02:57.330> through<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:57.990> and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
gonna come through with this one and

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.220 
gonna come through with this one and
then<00:02:58.410> oh<00:02:59.420> that's<00:03:00.420> pretty<00:03:00.570> much<00:03:00.780> how<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.960> felt

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
then oh that's pretty much how I felt

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.530 
then oh that's pretty much how I felt
with<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:01.440> chapter<00:03:02.180> hopefully<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.270> get<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
with this chapter hopefully we get to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.030 
with this chapter hopefully we get to
like<00:03:03.990> get<00:03:04.140> past<00:03:04.380> this<00:03:04.530> already<00:03:04.650> because<00:03:04.860> it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
like get past this already because it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.860 
like get past this already because it
feels<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.280> we've<00:03:05.430> been<00:03:05.460> fighting<00:03:05.870> 4000

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
feels like we've been fighting 4000

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.330 
feels like we've been fighting 4000
years<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.410> we're<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.740> getting<00:03:08.100> anywhere

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
years and we're not getting anywhere

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.280 
years and we're not getting anywhere
really<00:03:08.760> as<00:03:08.940> far<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.240> like<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.780> know<00:03:09.840> let's

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
really as far as like you know let's

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.960 
really as far as like you know let's
finish<00:03:10.500> off<00:03:10.740> with<00:03:10.860> dragon<00:03:11.310> next<00:03:11.550> chapter<00:03:11.910> at

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
finish off with dragon next chapter at

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.430 
finish off with dragon next chapter at
least<00:03:12.120> at<00:03:12.270> least<00:03:12.420> let's<00:03:12.570> get<00:03:12.720> one<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.320> them

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
least at least let's get one of them

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.310 
least at least let's get one of them
down<00:03:13.710> or<00:03:14.250> have<00:03:14.520> another<00:03:14.880> one<00:03:15.090> switch<00:03:15.420> sides<00:03:16.050> or

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
down or have another one switch sides or

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.570 
down or have another one switch sides or
something<00:03:16.620> something<00:03:16.860> along<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> lines<00:03:17.490> of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
something something along the lines of

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.770 
something something along the lines of
that<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.180> get<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.330> little<00:03:18.570> bit<00:03:18.660> more

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
that so you get a little bit more

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.420 
that so you get a little bit more
progression<00:03:19.170> because<00:03:19.500> pretty<00:03:19.950> much<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.280> past

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
progression because pretty much the past

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.240 
progression because pretty much the past
two<00:03:20.670> chapters<00:03:21.770> everything<00:03:22.770> amounted<00:03:23.220> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
two chapters everything amounted to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.880 
two chapters everything amounted to
Altair<00:03:24.120> being<00:03:24.360> fried<00:03:24.630> out<00:03:24.780> there<00:03:25.020> graving<00:03:25.740> and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
Altair being fried out there graving and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.620 
Altair being fried out there graving and
died<00:03:25.980> nobody<00:03:26.430> died<00:03:26.580> there<00:03:26.790> wasn't<00:03:26.940> really<00:03:27.060> any

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
died nobody died there wasn't really any

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.510 
died nobody died there wasn't really any
progression<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.590> more<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.040> these<00:03:29.250> past

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
progression it was more so these past

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.210 
progression it was more so these past
few<00:03:29.700> chapters<00:03:30.530> progression<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.680> old<00:03:31.890> tier

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
few chapters progression and old tier

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.610 
few chapters progression and old tier
and<00:03:32.460> character<00:03:33.150> development<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.600> tier<00:03:34.230> she

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
and character development for tier she

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.620 
and character development for tier she
pretty<00:03:34.830> much<00:03:34.980> realized<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.490> know<00:03:35.610> no<00:03:36.030> even

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
pretty much realized you know no even

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.090 
pretty much realized you know no even
though<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.750> did<00:03:36.990> all<00:03:37.140> these<00:03:37.290> terrible<00:03:37.620> things<00:03:37.800> I

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
though I did all these terrible things I

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.280 
though I did all these terrible things I
can<00:03:38.310> finally<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:39.150> know<00:03:39.210> I<00:03:39.270> can<00:03:39.480> be<00:03:39.660> good<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.990> can

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
can finally you know I can be good I can

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.810 
can finally you know I can be good I can
be<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.410> good<00:03:40.620> person<00:03:40.800> so<00:03:41.190> character

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
be a good person so character

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.340 
be a good person so character
development<00:03:42.120> for<00:03:42.240> tier<00:03:42.600> I'll<00:03:42.870> give<00:03:43.050> out

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
development for tier I'll give out

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.660 
development for tier I'll give out
definitely<00:03:43.620> give<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.190> was<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
definitely give it that that was the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.280 
definitely give it that that was the
main<00:03:44.940> thing<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.570> these<00:03:45.660> past<00:03:45.900> few<00:03:46.080> chapters

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
main thing that these past few chapters

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.440 
main thing that these past few chapters
was<00:03:46.860> building<00:03:47.250> up<00:03:47.310> towards<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.760> was<00:03:47.880> changing

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
was building up towards it was changing

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.590 
was building up towards it was changing
old<00:03:48.600> tier<00:03:48.900> but<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:50.130> she's<00:03:50.580> dead<00:03:50.820> then<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.420> was

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
old tier but if she's dead then it was

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.880 
old tier but if she's dead then it was
pretty<00:03:51.690> much<00:03:51.870> character<00:03:52.170> development<00:03:52.620> for<00:03:52.740> a

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
pretty much character development for a

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.380 
pretty much character development for a
character<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.310> about<00:03:53.490> to<00:03:53.640> die<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.030> therefore

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
character that about to die so therefore

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.730 
character that about to die so therefore
wasted<00:03:54.750> character<00:03:55.080> development<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.470> begin

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
wasted character development to begin

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.830 
wasted character development to begin
with<00:03:55.890> or<00:03:56.160> giving<00:03:56.460> her<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.760> nice<00:03:57.120> bookmark<00:03:57.690> to

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
with or giving her a nice bookmark to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.720 
with or giving her a nice bookmark to
her<00:03:57.960> life<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.260> know<00:03:58.290> nice<00:03:58.530> or<00:03:58.830> closure<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.670> to

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
her life you know nice or closure so to

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.550 
her life you know nice or closure so to
speak<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.060> her<00:04:00.150> life<00:04:00.330> so<00:04:00.540> either<00:04:01.230> Wars

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
speak to her life so either Wars

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.310 
speak to her life so either Wars

that like you know there's a real big
threat<00:04:08.310> here<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.670> now's<00:04:08.790> not<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> time<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.390> be

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
threat here and now's not the time to be

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.390 
threat here and now's not the time to be
you<00:04:09.870> know<00:04:09.960> sparing<00:04:10.350> life<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.860> we'll<00:04:11.220> see<00:04:11.370> how

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
you know sparing life but we'll see how

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.840 
you know sparing life but we'll see how
it<00:04:11.640> goes

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
it goes

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.500 
it goes
overall<00:04:12.420> chapter<00:04:12.870> might<00:04:13.200> give<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.530> mmm<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:15.030> two

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
overall chapter might give it mmm to two

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.210 
overall chapter might give it mmm to two
and<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.660> half<00:04:15.870> out<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.109> five<00:04:16.170> I<00:04:16.410> mean<00:04:16.710> I'll<00:04:17.070> give

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
and a half out of five I mean I'll give

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.110 
and a half out of five I mean I'll give
it<00:04:17.310> two<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.520> half<00:04:17.640> out<00:04:17.730> of<00:04:17.790> five<00:04:17.850> just

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
it two and a half out of five just

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.430 
it two and a half out of five just
because<00:04:18.359> we<00:04:18.450> got<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.690> bone<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.080> will<00:04:19.200> tear

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
I'm glad that I didn't go back all the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.450 
I'm glad that I didn't go back all the
way<00:05:01.110> before<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.590> game<00:05:01.740> opened<00:05:02.130> up<00:05:02.220> because

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
way before the game opened up because

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.600 
way before the game opened up because
that<00:05:02.610> would<00:05:02.730> have<00:05:02.790> been<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:02.940> real<00:05:03.240> big<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:04.610> guess

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
that would have been a real big I guess

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.310 
that would have been a real big I guess
a<00:05:05.640> real<00:05:06.060> big<00:05:06.240> easy<00:05:06.540> way<00:05:06.750> out<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:07.110> whole

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
a real big easy way out of this whole

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.780 
a real big easy way out of this whole
thing<00:05:07.350> like<00:05:07.620> it's<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.040> use<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.430> he<00:05:08.550> could

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
thing like it's just use that he could

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.370 
thing like it's just use that he could
reverse<00:05:09.030> everything<00:05:09.510> so<00:05:09.930> I<00:05:09.960> don't<00:05:10.320> know

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
reverse everything so I don't know

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.480 
reverse everything so I don't know
what's<00:05:10.530> going<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.710> happen<00:05:11.040> as<00:05:11.130> far<00:05:11.250> as<00:05:11.310> that

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
what's going to happen as far as that

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.890 
what's going to happen as far as that
goes

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
goes

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.570 
goes
hopefully<00:05:12.900> we<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.980> next<00:05:14.220> couple<00:05:14.430> chapters

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
hopefully we the next couple chapters

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.040 
hopefully we the next couple chapters
get<00:05:14.880> some<00:05:15.030> progression<00:05:15.390> one<00:05:15.510> like<00:05:15.630> slaying

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050

some<00:05:16.260> of<00:05:16.350> these<00:05:16.410> dragons<00:05:16.950> or<00:05:17.070> whether<00:05:17.610> we<00:05:17.820> open

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
some of these dragons or whether we open

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.580 
some of these dragons or whether we open
up<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.360> gates<00:05:18.570> again<00:05:18.870> somebody's<00:05:19.260> gonna<00:05:19.380> use

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
up the gates again somebody's gonna use

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.740 
up the gates again somebody's gonna use
all<00:05:19.770> their<00:05:19.890> magic<00:05:20.310> because<00:05:20.550> like<00:05:20.730> if<00:05:20.940> act

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
all their magic because like if act

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
something and opens up the gate you know

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.750 
something and opens up the gate you know
because<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:25.350> needs<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.710> certain<00:05:26.370> amount<00:05:26.520> of

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
because it needs a certain amount of

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.720 
because it needs a certain amount of
power<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.870> perform<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.010> open<00:05:29.220> up<00:05:29.310> again<00:05:29.430> and

if some certain amount of mages give it

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.770 
if some certain amount of mages give it
the<00:05:32.310> power<00:05:32.520> then<00:05:32.790> it'll<00:05:33.030> open<00:05:33.150> so<00:05:33.510> of<00:05:33.600> like

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
the power then it'll open so of like

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.360

let's<00:05:34.140> just<00:05:34.200> say<00:05:34.380> everyone<00:05:34.650> in<00:05:34.920> fairy<00:05:35.160> tale

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
let's just say everyone in fairy tale

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.400 
let's just say everyone in fairy tale
all<00:05:35.640> the<00:05:35.790> wizards<00:05:36.210> they're<00:05:36.540> in<00:05:36.720> fee<00:05:36.930> or<00:05:37.080> come

all the wizards they're in fee or come

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.230 
all the wizards they're in fee or come
and<00:05:37.560> blast<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.400> give<00:05:38.550> it<00:05:38.640> energy<00:05:38.790> to<00:05:39.060> try<00:05:39.180> to

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
and blast it to give it energy to try to

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.940 
and blast it to give it energy to try to
give<00:05:39.420> hope<00:05:39.600> to<00:05:39.630> like<00:05:39.960> yo<00:05:40.200> let's<00:05:40.410> reverse<00:05:40.680> time

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
give hope to like yo let's reverse time

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.040 
give hope to like yo let's reverse time
then<00:05:41.610> maybe<00:05:41.820> it'll<00:05:42.090> be<00:05:42.210> opened<00:05:42.510> up<00:05:42.600> again<00:05:42.750> and

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
then maybe it'll be opened up again and

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.110 
then maybe it'll be opened up again and
that<00:05:43.530> would<00:05:43.710> lead<00:05:43.830> to<00:05:43.860> art<00:05:44.490> that<00:05:44.640> I<00:05:44.670> was<00:05:44.850> hoping

that would lead to art that I was hoping
to<00:05:45.210> see<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.540> that's<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.780> time<00:05:45.960> travel<00:05:46.320> art<00:05:46.410> but

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
to see and that's a time travel art but

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.050 
to see and that's a time travel art but
we'll<00:05:47.070> have<00:05:47.400> to<00:05:47.520> see<00:05:47.670> what<00:05:47.760> do<00:05:47.850> you<00:05:47.910> guys<00:05:48.000> think

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.110 
that like like you know gray being
revived<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.410> again<00:05:52.950> while<00:05:53.310> I<00:05:53.580> like<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:53.970> gray

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
revived and again while I like the gray

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.820 
revived and again while I like the gray
character<00:05:54.540> and<00:05:54.720> it's<00:05:54.810> like<00:05:54.900> yo<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.290> didn't<00:05:55.680> want

to see him die

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.770 
to see him die

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.600 
I thought it was better off that way
