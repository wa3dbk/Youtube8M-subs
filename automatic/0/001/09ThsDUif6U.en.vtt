is<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.850> Mac<00:04:51.000> 174<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.770> one<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:52.980> can<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:53.400> think

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
is the Mac 174 this one I can I think

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.130 
is the Mac 174 this one I can I think
you<00:04:53.700> can<00:04:53.820> only<00:04:53.940> get<00:04:54.150> this<00:04:54.300> at<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.600> pro<00:04:54.780> stores

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
you can only get this at the pro stores

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.100 
you can only get this at the pro stores
and<00:04:55.970> it's<00:04:56.970> great<00:04:57.240> because<00:04:57.420> it's<00:04:57.690> an<00:04:57.780> angled

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
and it's great because it's an angled

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.280 
and it's great because it's an angled
brush<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:59.280> was<00:04:59.490> pretty<00:04:59.820> pricey<00:05:00.090> though<00:05:00.450> so

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
brush it was pretty pricey though so

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.590 
brush it was pretty pricey though so
this<00:05:01.710> is<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.240> 174<00:05:03.240> angled<00:05:04.080> brush<00:05:05.330> next<00:05:06.330> one<00:05:06.480> is

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
this is the 174 angled brush next one is

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.630 
this is the 174 angled brush next one is
the<00:05:06.720> Mac<00:05:06.900> 189<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.710> believe<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:08.190> came<00:05:08.400> out<00:05:08.490> with

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
the Mac 189 I believe this came out with

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.810 
the Mac 189 I believe this came out with
a<00:05:08.670> sonic<00:05:09.030> chic<00:05:09.270> collection<00:05:09.540> with<00:05:10.020> all<00:05:10.050> those

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
a sonic chic collection with all those

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.790 
a sonic chic collection with all those
mineralized<00:05:11.820> skinfinish<00:05:12.120> --is<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:13.410> kind<00:05:13.740> of

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
mineralized skinfinish --is this kind of

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.770 
mineralized skinfinish --is this kind of
reminds<00:05:14.190> me<00:05:14.220> of<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.760> cross<00:05:15.000> between<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.570> one

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
reminds me of a cross between the one

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.230 
reminds me of a cross between the one
ninety<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.530> one<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.670> powder<00:05:17.910> brushes

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
ninety and one of the powder brushes

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.270 
ninety and one of the powder brushes
because<00:05:18.510> it's<00:05:18.660> really<00:05:19.110> soft<00:05:19.440> but<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.800> is<00:05:19.950> firm

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
because it's really soft but it is firm

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.900 
because it's really soft but it is firm
but<00:05:20.660> soft<00:05:23.000> okay<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:26.040> next<00:05:26.250> one<00:05:26.430> is<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.730> Mac

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910
