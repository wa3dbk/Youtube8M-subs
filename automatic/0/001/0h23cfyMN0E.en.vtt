curve<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.879> recommend<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:55.050> try<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> curb

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
curve I recommend like try it on a curb

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.299 
curve I recommend like try it on a curb
first<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.270> once<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> curb<00:00:58.500> then

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
first and then once you do the curb then

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
first and then once you do the curb then
you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.670> take<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.149> higher<00:01:00.329> obstacles<00:01:01.079> but

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you can take it to higher obstacles but

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
you can take it to higher obstacles but
first<00:01:02.250> try<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> pair<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> always

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
first try it out on a pair but I always

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:13.520 
first try it out on a pair but I always
recommend<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> curve<00:01:05.519> first<00:01:12.530> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
recommend to do it on a curve first you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.010 
recommend to do it on a curve first you
want<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.000> an<00:01:15.180> angle<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> angle

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
want to go at an angle this is the angle

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
want to go at an angle this is the angle
you<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.580> kind<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.939> angle

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you want to go at this kind of angle

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.420 
you want to go at this kind of angle
like<00:01:18.420> straight<00:01:18.750> forward<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.439> angle<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.220> you

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
like straight forward but angle and you

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.649 
like straight forward but angle and you
wanna<00:01:20.610> nollie<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.900> keep<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.979> sideways

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
wanna nollie out and keep it sideways

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.510 
wanna nollie out and keep it sideways
once<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.840> lock<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.380> that's<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.280> can

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
once you lock it that's when you can

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.390 
once you lock it that's when you can
kind<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.930> prepared<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.799> slide

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
kind of like get prepared to slide

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
kind of like get prepared to slide
because<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.540> don't<00:01:30.689> you're<00:01:30.930> gonna<00:01:31.049> fall

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because if you don't you're gonna fall

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.490 
because if you don't you're gonna fall
forward<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.390> miss<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.869> ledge<00:01:34.079> be

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
forward and if you miss the ledge be

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.950 
forward and if you miss the ledge be
careful<00:01:34.979> too<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.000> over<00:01:36.450> rotate

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
careful too because you can over rotate

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
careful too because you can over rotate
and<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.189> part<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.939> talking

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and that's the part that I was talking

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
and that's the part that I was talking
about<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> dangerous<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:41.189> want

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
about that's kind of dangerous you want

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
about that's kind of dangerous you want
to<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.520> careful<00:01:41.759> about<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to be careful about that because you

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.499 
to be careful about that because you
know<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.340> hurt<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.880> but

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
know you can really get hurt on this but

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.440 
know you can really get hurt on this but
it's<00:01:46.049> also<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.579> stepping<00:01:47.579> stone<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:47.850> another

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it's also a stepping stone for another

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's also a stepping stone for another
trick<00:01:48.780> which<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> nollie<00:01:49.619> blunt<00:01:50.070> slide

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
trick which is a nollie blunt slide

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.600 
trick which is a nollie blunt slide
maybe<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:52.229> know<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.649> explained<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.369> one

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
maybe you know I explained that one

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
maybe you know I explained that one
another<00:01:53.939> time<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.750> no<00:01:55.430> no<00:01:56.430> no<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:57.329> one's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
another time but no no no that one's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.340 
another time but no no no that one's
pretty<00:01:58.140> crazy<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.430> one's<00:01:59.670> dangerous<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
pretty crazy that one's dangerous so you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
pretty crazy that one's dangerous so you
know<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:01.979> nollie<00:02:02.189> nose<00:02:02.490> slides<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
know get your nollie nose slides on and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.020 
know get your nollie nose slides on and
go<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:03.960> at<00:02:04.200> an<00:02:04.350> angle<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.430> kind<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
go at it at an angle and just kind of

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.869 
go at it at an angle and just kind of
you<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.719> go<00:02:07.079> sideways<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.649> hit<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.399> into<00:02:08.640> an

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
you know go sideways and hit it into an

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.210 
you know go sideways and hit it into an
old<00:02:09.090> slide<00:02:09.349> getting<00:02:10.349> Ollie's<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> nose

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
old slide getting Ollie's and nose

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.010 
old slide getting Ollie's and nose
slides<00:02:11.489> first<00:02:11.819> before<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.239> try<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.450> trick

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
slides first before you try this trick

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.200 
slides first before you try this trick
that's<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:13.980> recommend<00:02:19.730> go<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.850> there<00:02:21.060> and
