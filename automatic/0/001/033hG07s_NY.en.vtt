00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.210 
I don't want to do that because I got a
bead<00:02:13.599> in<00:02:13.630> it'll<00:02:13.870> make<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.020> big<00:02:14.230> hole<00:02:14.380> so

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
bead in it'll make a big hole so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.740 
bead in it'll make a big hole so
basically<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.970> advantage<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.480> putting<00:02:16.569> the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
basically the advantage of putting the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.319 
basically the advantage of putting the
beads<00:02:16.930> on<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.410> all<00:02:18.400> when<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> fish<00:02:18.819> comes<00:02:19.060> up<00:02:19.209> in

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
beads on is all when a fish comes up in

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.319 
beads on is all when a fish comes up in
NAB's<00:02:19.689> it<00:02:19.959> or<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> gets<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:21.040> when<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.000> tries<00:02:22.209> to

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
NAB's it or it gets it when it tries to

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.670 
NAB's it or it gets it when it tries to
pull<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.659> it<00:02:22.840> won't<00:02:22.959> come<00:02:23.079> off<00:02:23.349> because<00:02:23.500> you
