the<00:00:07.680> whole<00:00:07.799> premise<00:00:08.069> with<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.670> XR<00:00:09.000> 650<00:00:09.540> L<00:00:09.690> was

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
the whole premise with the XR 650 L was

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
the whole premise with the XR 650 L was
to<00:00:10.530> see<00:00:10.740> what<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.309> could<00:00:11.460> really<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.059> a

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
to see what we could really do on a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.870 
to see what we could really do on a
budget<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:13.200> 650<00:00:13.860> l<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.219> had<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> chance<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.730> get

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
budget with 650 l we had a chance to get

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.000 
budget with 650 l we had a chance to get
into<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.179> bike<00:00:15.420> that's<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.809> fairly<00:00:16.199> low<00:00:16.470> entry

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
into a bike that's a fairly low entry

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
into a bike that's a fairly low entry
price<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.910> put<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.270> mods<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.900> see<00:00:19.050> if<00:00:19.080> we

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
price we put some mods on to see if we

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650 
price we put some mods on to see if we
really<00:00:19.590> could<00:00:19.920> create<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.400> budget<00:00:21.000> adventure

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
really could create a budget adventure

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.620 
really could create a budget adventure
bike<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> we'll<00:00:23.789> regard<00:00:24.119> bike<00:00:24.300> there<00:00:24.510> were<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
bike so we'll regard bike there were a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.029 
bike so we'll regard bike there were a
couple<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.990> things<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.650> needed<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
couple of things that we needed to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.189 
couple of things that we needed to
address<00:00:26.580> first<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.330> right<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:27.660> here<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:27.990> front

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
address first one right up here in front

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.380 
address first one right up here in front
was<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> suspension<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.460> bike<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.939> sprung

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
was the suspension this bike is sprung

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.959 
was the suspension this bike is sprung
and<00:00:30.779> valved<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.890> soft<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.369> front<00:00:32.640> end<00:00:32.790> had

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
and valved really soft the front end had

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.090 
and valved really soft the front end had
a<00:00:33.000> lot<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> dive<00:00:33.719> under<00:00:34.050> braking<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.920> took

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
a lot of dive under braking so we took

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.310 
a lot of dive under braking so we took
that<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.550> precision<00:00:35.880> concepts<00:00:36.540> let<00:00:37.110> Bob

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that up to precision concepts let Bob

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
that up to precision concepts let Bob
Bell<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.860> his<00:00:38.100> thing<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.420> other<00:00:39.540> thing<00:00:39.629> I

noise up here in the carb you can't
really<00:02:03.899> see<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.560> put<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.009> FMF<00:02:05.610> jetting

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060

improve<00:02:09.320> performance<00:02:10.160> because<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.490> stock

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
improve performance because the stock

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.390 
improve performance because the stock
jetting<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:11.900> lean<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.040> bike<00:02:13.220> is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
jetting is so lean that the bike is

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
Dunlop's are pretty pathetic so we tried

which<00:03:07.550> I<00:03:07.820> do<00:03:07.970> not<00:03:08.210> like<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.810> think<00:03:09.050> all<00:03:09.500> in<00:03:09.860> all<00:03:10.010> I

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
which I do not like I think all in all I

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.590 
which I do not like I think all in all I
would<00:03:10.310> have<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.730> say<00:03:10.910> probably<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.390> best

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
would have to say probably the best

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.180 
would have to say probably the best
all-around<00:03:11.870> tire<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.380> can<00:03:12.620> think<00:03:12.770> of<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:13.100> this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
all-around tire I can think of for this

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.030 
all-around tire I can think of for this
bike<00:03:13.459> would<00:03:13.670> be<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.970> Dunlop<00:03:14.300> 606<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.740> gets

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
bike would be the Dunlop 606 it gets

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.100 
bike would be the Dunlop 606 it gets
good<00:03:16.340> wear<00:03:16.610> pretty<00:03:17.030> decent<00:03:17.480> performance<00:03:17.959> on

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
good wear pretty decent performance on

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.020 
good wear pretty decent performance on
the<00:03:18.200> street<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.770> still<00:03:19.130> usable<00:03:19.640> in<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.760> dirt

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
the street and still usable in the dirt

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.210 
the street and still usable in the dirt
so<00:03:20.360> there's<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.410> quick<00:03:21.620> look<00:03:21.830> at<00:03:21.950> some<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.160> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
so there's a quick look at some of the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.100 
so there's a quick look at some of the
performance<00:03:22.700> modifications<00:03:23.420> we've<00:03:23.600> made<00:03:23.840> to

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
performance modifications we've made to
