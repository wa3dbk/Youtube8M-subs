okay<00:00:00.149> hi<00:00:00.269> guys<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.510> thought<00:00:00.870> I'd<00:00:00.989> just<00:00:01.110> do<00:00:01.290> a

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
okay hi guys I thought I'd just do a

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.700 
okay hi guys I thought I'd just do a
quick<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.770> showing<00:00:02.840> you<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.990> new<00:00:04.140> Garmin

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
quick video showing you the new Garmin

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.110 
quick video showing you the new Garmin
speed<00:00:05.009> sensors<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.640> have<00:00:05.790> just<00:00:05.970> been

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
speed sensors that have just been

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.950 
speed sensors that have just been
released<00:00:06.200> now<00:00:07.200> here<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> old<00:00:07.859> ones

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
released now here it is the old ones

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.910 
released now here it is the old ones
this<00:00:09.960> would<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.410> on<00:00:10.530> your<00:00:10.740> back<00:00:10.950> chain<00:00:11.460> stay

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
this would be on your back chain stay

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.099 
this would be on your back chain stay
right<00:00:13.920> here<00:00:14.190> that's<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.269> here<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.690> for

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
right here that's but here it is for

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.800 
right here that's but here it is for
measuring<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.190> cadence<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.000> that's<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
measuring the cadence and that's the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
measuring the cadence and that's the
speed<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.609> would<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.830> we

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
speed so you would have that on your we

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.710 
speed so you would have that on your we
have<00:00:22.920> chains<00:00:23.130> day<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.420> would<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
have chains day then you would have a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.740 
have chains day then you would have a
magnet<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.470> your<00:00:25.529> spokes<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.580> wheel<00:00:26.849> then

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
magnet on your spokes on your wheel then

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.750 
magnet on your spokes on your wheel then
you<00:00:27.960> even<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.140> another<00:00:28.740> magnet<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.340> your

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you even have another magnet on your

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.479 
you even have another magnet on your
crank<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:31.289> even<00:00:31.769> though<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.949> doesn't<00:00:32.189> add<00:00:32.279> too

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
crank so even though it doesn't add too

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.220 
crank so even though it doesn't add too
much<00:00:32.700> weight<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.180> still<00:00:33.390> added<00:00:33.690> bulk<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
much weight it's still added bulk and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.910 
much weight it's still added bulk and
hold<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.070> your<00:00:35.130> beak<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.590> be<00:00:37.590> back<00:00:37.739> way<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
hold it to your beak and be back way I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.330 
hold it to your beak and be back way I
suppose<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> new<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:40.160> here's<00:00:41.160> what

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
suppose and then the new one here's what

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.420 
suppose and then the new one here's what
the<00:00:41.430> new<00:00:41.460> box<00:00:41.790> looks<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:43.070> in<00:00:44.070> fancy

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the new box looks like this in fancy

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.549 
the new box looks like this in fancy
like<00:00:44.610> grabbing<00:00:45.030> overs<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.840> usually<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
like grabbing overs it's usually the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.959 
like grabbing overs it's usually the
same<00:00:46.590> packaging<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.760> for

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
same packaging that they have for

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.369 
same packaging that they have for
everything<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> same<00:00:48.840> box<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
everything this is the same box as the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.160 
everything this is the same box as the
heartrate<00:00:49.710> molar<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.690> here's<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> new

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
heartrate molar and so here's the new

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.160 
heartrate molar and so here's the new
sensors<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.980> here<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.180> straps<00:00:54.719> for

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
sensors right here these are straps for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.900 
sensors right here these are straps for
your<00:00:55.410> crank

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
your crank

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.130 
your crank
so<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> pick<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.390> white<00:00:57.539> officer<00:00:57.930> suits

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
so you pick what white officer suits

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
so you pick what white officer suits
your<00:00:58.289> crank<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.800> here's<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> sensor<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
your crank and here's the sensor that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.080 
your crank and here's the sensor that
goes<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> actual<00:01:01.260> crank<00:01:01.500> itself<00:01:02.039> -<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> get

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
goes on the actual crank itself - I get

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.230 
goes on the actual crank itself - I get
some<00:01:03.270> good<00:01:03.420> light<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.250> all<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.880> -

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
some good light so there that's all as -

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.960 
some good light so there that's all as -
it<00:01:08.270> bear<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.390> mind<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.900> IV<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.350> heavier<00:01:10.970> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it bear in mind as IV but heavier and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.249 
it bear in mind as IV but heavier and
bigger<00:01:12.630> than<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.409> original<00:01:14.960> but<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
bigger than the original but this is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.690 
bigger than the original but this is
only<00:01:16.380> our<00:01:16.530> magnet<00:01:16.890> remember<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.610> an

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
only our magnet remember that's just an

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.649 
only our magnet remember that's just an
exhale<00:01:17.939> Adama<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.080> stuff<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.310> yep<00:01:20.970> then

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
exhale Adama and and stuff so yep then

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.140 
exhale Adama and and stuff so yep then
the<00:01:21.960> other<00:01:22.140> piece<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:25.040> vests<00:01:26.040> move<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.850> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the other piece as this vests move on to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.020 
the other piece as this vests move on to
your<00:01:28.369> hub<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:31.590> measures<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.280> light<00:01:32.700> with

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
your hub and it measures the light with

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
your hub and it measures the light with
and<00:01:33.329> exhale<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.900> other<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:34.500> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and exhale it all my other as well so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
and exhale it all my other as well so
that's<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:37.110> last

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that's all there is to it just last

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
that's all there is to it just last
piece<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.130> piece<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.610> there's<00:01:38.790> no<00:01:38.939> need

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
piece and that piece so there's no need

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.999 
piece and that piece so there's no need
for<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.720> real<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.079> piece<00:01:40.350> anymore<00:01:40.710> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
for that real a piece anymore and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.460 
for that real a piece anymore and
there's<00:01:41.549> no<00:01:41.759> need<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.000> magnets<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:43.170> I've

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
there's no need for magnets because I've

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
there's no need for magnets because I've
get<00:01:43.649> bladed<00:01:43.979> spokes<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> magnet<00:01:45.270> just

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
get bladed spokes and the magnet just

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.929 
get bladed spokes and the magnet just
kept<00:01:45.860> like<00:01:46.860> hiding<00:01:47.189> off<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.640> all<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
kept like hiding off and that's all the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.990 
kept like hiding off and that's all the
time<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.600> was<00:01:48.720> very<00:01:48.869> fun<00:01:49.290> acting<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.000> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
time and it was very fun acting it and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.160 
time and it was very fun acting it and
so<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:52.100> all<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.280> does<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:54.930> back

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
so this all it does is go on your back

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.490 
so this all it does is go on your back
hub<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> you're<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.750> gonna<00:01:57.930> know<00:01:58.110> what's<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
hub so you're not gonna know what's it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.999 
hub so you're not gonna know what's it
so<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.340> goes<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.350> not<00:02:01.350> installed<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> yet

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
so it goes in here not installed it yet

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.700 
so it goes in here not installed it yet
but<00:02:02.399> I'll<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.299> sort<00:02:03.630> understand<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.350> I
