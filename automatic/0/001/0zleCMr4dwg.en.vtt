00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.370
 and air navigation to it is the entity responsible for 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.370
 other air navigation services in Spain 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.529
 Spanish air traffic control is controlled from four road control centers 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.050
 three terminal area centers 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.019
 and airport control towers 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.899
 according to the division criteria of the civil aviation organization 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.800
 international 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.079
 Spanish airspace is distributed in two regions 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.409
 the legion of euros 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.140
 where the peninsula and Balearic area is included 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.630
 and the region well 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.650
 which includes the Canary Islands 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.930
 the control service is carried out from the centers of madrid barcelona sevilla 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.500
 and the Canary Islands 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.350
 In addition to the terminal area of ​​palma de mallorca valencia and santiago 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.770
 through the automated air traffic control system 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 called 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 at the beginning of the 80s the Spanish control centers 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.420
 they were equipped with different control systems 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.130
 so each center was autonomous and used different functionalities 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.180
 The challenge was to create a single system for all control centers in 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.810
 Spanish air traffic has been creating an airspace was unique and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.750
 continuous 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.060
 This new system should have a life cycle of more than 20 years and 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.600
 both to be able to evolve in the future with the incorporation of new 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.430
 technologies 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 in the introduction of new functionalities 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 from 1984 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.330
 the requirements were defined and the sacta system was designed that the 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.250
 crop development concept 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.630
 that allows you to introduce operational improvements 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.390
 functional and technological 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.170
 Gradually and progressively 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 thus guaranteeing the protection of the investments made 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.720
 The sacta system has evolved continuously with the incorporation of 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.070
 new sections 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.070
 so far we can distinguish three passes 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.890
 the first of them takes one I completed a stage of installation in the main 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.409
 control centers 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.739
 It entered in 1990 with the installation of the first system in palma de mallorca 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.350
 and was completed in 1994 with its installation in the four centers of 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.029
 route control 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.810
 The phase taken out is mainly distinguished by 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.299
 the installation of the system in the terminal area control centers 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.129
 loyal remaining 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.529
 and the control towers 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.929
 In addition to the interoperability achieved between all the dependencies of 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.929
 air traffic control 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:38.850
 from its beginning 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.360
 The sacta system was conceived with an open distributed architecture for 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.729
 avoid dependence on proprietary systems 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.409
 However, the technology of the mid-80s forced to work with 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.479
 proprietary architecture that equally urgently needs to develop a standard of 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.590
 copaco communications 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.609
 there are no valid open standards for this application 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.049
 in 1999 and taking advantage of the actions on computers to avoid 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 effect 2000 the phase was started up to 3 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.459
 that's when jaguars and system software were changed to a 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.989
 architect a united diet and an open standard and communications 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.700
 thus allowing the evolution of the system than the new standards 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.700
 Europeans in the next decade 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.369
 the evolution of the sector has been carried out considering both the requirements of 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.539
 user through the configuration control committee formed by 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.009
 controllers and technicians 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.259
 such as technological renewal and those derived from the needs of 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.259
 harmonization in europe 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.149
 this evolution has allowed the progressive implementation and not 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.199
 traumatic of new functionalities 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.929
 without technical risks 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:49.339
 since each modification is based on the situation is functional and technical 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:52.159
 previous 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.659
 when talking about the evolution of the sector we can not forget the subsystem more 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.750
 critical and visible of a control system 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.669
 How is the link between the controller and the machine 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.669
 the control position 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:08.179
 this path has evolved greatly since the beginning of shakhtar 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:11.629
 going from a monochrome digital presentation on calligraphic screens 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.239
 round on the sacta 1 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.239
 up to the current positions pop-ups presented 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.880
 equipped with high-performance color graphics systems 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.880
 that work in the environment the circuit 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.509
 in their development they followed the recommendation is possible of eurocontrol 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.499
 Sor economy and functionality has been improved 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:38.969
 having also achieved one we have friend of the opposition for control 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.969
 of route and approximation 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.889
 with the same architecture has been developed also has sitting 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.219
 for tower control 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.569
 the control unit called 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.399
 was installed in 1998 in the new airport tower of Madrid-Barajas 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.740
 and integrates the surface radar of the airport making the fusion of data 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.699
 with the approach radar 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:04.539
 equally 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.099
 presents the aeronautical and meteorological information the state of the aids 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.089
 of approximation as well as the availability of the positions of 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.089
 parking of aircraft on platform and doors of a bar 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.389
 all the changes and improvements introduced in the shakhtar 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.389
 they are tested before in the experimentation and development center 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.599
 once this experimentation center has verified the 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.120
 correct functioning of the new versions are implemented in all 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:32.119
 control centers 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.530
 as part of the shakhtar are also in the control centers the 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.110
 called dina simulators 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.999
 they are control positions to which in addition to the actual traffic 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.999
 you can add similar traffic 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.059
 in addition to being used to evaluate new scenarios and procedures 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.009
 operational airspace of your responsibility 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.580
 are used for the partial authorization of 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.039
 those destined for that center 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.610
 as well as for its adaptation both the new functionalities that are going 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.550
 incorporating 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.550
 as the aforementioned operational modifications 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.380
 in the same way for the basic training of the controllers 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.240
 a traffic control simulation center has been created in madrid 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.319
 unique aerial in the world 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.530
 with 360-degree control tower simulators 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.530
 with a visual system that allows you to reproduce with total fidelity 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:24.089
 these operating conditions in the control towers 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:29.279
 and route and approach radar simulators based on the system 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.090
 sacta 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.090
 with a capacity for 250 years 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.830
 finally in regard to the single space 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.599
 Spain can bring the osaka experience 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:41.539
 a system of 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:44.990
 I am able to evolve and adapt to the emerging requirements related to the 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.159
 afp 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.400
 based on one of which are 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.800
 new components part of the sns 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.539
 and advanced automation tools
