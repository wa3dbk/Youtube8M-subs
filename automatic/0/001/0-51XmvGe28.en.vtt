 darken and the satisfaction of your compile 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.930
 the dean and dean of the nine faculties 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.330
 gave themselves an oratory 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.850
 punctuated by truculent exchanges 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.650
 the challenge demonstrate that they are the most 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.650
 valiant graduates 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.330
 when I talk about our graduates I have a 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.020
 not likely to get carried away 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.920
 for example, I tell myself if we 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.690

 in Montreal the rector although 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.130
 I recognize value and quality 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.700
 of all the graduates of the others 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.220
 faculties 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.870
 it seems to me essential to remind you 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.180
 that they would have a hard time 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.160
 to live in modernity without the contribution 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.090
 considerable number of graduates of the faculty 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.340
 genius 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.880

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.440

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.350
 he does not just study 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.350
 the story they do it 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.150
 in addition to graduates the university has 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.540

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.620

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.900
 2013 ranks intensity and emotion have 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.879
 filled the floor and the bleachers it's 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.250
 in this atmosphere both festive and 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.510
 solemn that the graduates were 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.510
