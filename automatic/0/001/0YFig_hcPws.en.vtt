00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 now here we come to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.890
 montceau still a change of 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.050
 difficulties nor your difficulty so there 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.549
 you're already playing with all 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.789
 touch different with all the rights 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.460
 on black keys 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.519
 it's only dedicated it's called rain 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.529
 and the composer is my part I 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.410
 meant just two months offers this 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.199
 composer there is I do not know if 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.279
 you realize that it's the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.770
 educational pieces 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.629
 they received me pedagogical it's the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 pieces in which we prefer 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.350
 learning something 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.680
 essential to pay them to understand 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.110
 a technique for example to 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.390
 particular difficulties or in gesture and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.430
 the whole piece is made around that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 and that's why 99% of the songs 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.579
 pedagogical they are me I think that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.670
 it's very difficult to respect 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.299
 the rules and technical goals is to 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 both to make that music be 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.840
 interesting and on time there are two 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.880
 absolutely extraordinary composers 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.180
 for ecological pieces 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.830
 this is the case by case says that I said that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.250
 it was in France is actually it was a 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 hamlet he had come to russia but his 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.729
 father was German organist who marries 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.189
 a French by correspondence so 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.810
 with his mom arrived in Russia for 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.909
 got married to have kids and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.920
 to educate them and she was French 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.060
 so it's a pity they ignore you 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.369
 the existence of this great gentleman who 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.470
 was organist in the French church 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 in Moscow who was organ teacher at the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.270
 superior designer and who composed 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.630
 a lot of pieces of logic 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.780
 in order to take things in 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.610
 second week apart so here it is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.840
 my students know me very well 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.549
 two names because older 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.500
 look for the emotion of these two 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.390
 composers and that's always the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.319
 total happiness because it's always 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 very pretty very fresh very original 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.310
 and very very effective for berries 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.940
 more left than I advise you 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.370
 really hold these two names 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.450
 so here's seed and is called the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.690
 rain to the raindrops we go the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:58.959
 do with ours pikine is so the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:03:02.680
 composer this is the case by pure 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.780
 wonder and from an educational point of view 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.940
 you will learn how to play on 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.170
 tournaments because all we stay 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.500
 more than the simple ones that the keys 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.870
 white 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.880
 it's always harder it's going to get you 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.319
 play the fifth on the sidelines 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.730
 black right now it'll prepare you 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.760
 the 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.340
 to romantic works in which you 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.230
 are obliged to play the 5- poster 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.330
 black keys 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:04:11.010
 so I will show very slowly to 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:04:12.750
 dissect gestures or and even at 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.269
 level of this seat of the notation 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.979
 l must do and they show you for 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:22.530
 the first time his double yesterday's bland 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.440
 forget know what it's double yesterday 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.740
 said yes from 10 s actually it's 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:34.190
 if it's fabu says yes it's the note 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.190
