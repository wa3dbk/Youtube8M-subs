00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
can either use 7-zip or you can use

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.469 
can either use 7-zip or you can use
WinRAR<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.430> doesn't<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.729> matter<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.390> you

WinRAR it doesn't really matter all you
need<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.930> extract<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.409> this

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
need to do is extract this this

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
need to do is extract this this
someplace<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.490> you'll<00:01:48.240> remember<00:01:48.509> where

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
someplace that you'll remember where

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
someplace that you'll remember where
it's<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.680> need<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.070> run<00:01:50.280> this

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it's at and then you need to run this

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.719 
it's at and then you need to run this
program<00:01:50.850> ok<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.729> extracted

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
program ok so here is the extracted

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.010 
program ok so here is the extracted
files<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> couple<00:01:54.689> there's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
files now there is a couple there's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.149 
files now there is a couple there's
another<00:01:55.170> program<00:01:55.439> you're<00:01:55.770> gonna<00:01:55.890> need

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
another program you're gonna need

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
another program you're gonna need
because<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:57.210> actually<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> extract<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
because we actually have to extract a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.260 
because we actually have to extract a
certain<00:01:58.740> file<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.610> Tomb<00:01:59.790> Raider<00:01:59.820> disk

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
certain file out of the Tomb Raider disk

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.359 
certain file out of the Tomb Raider disk
patch<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.110> using<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> patcher<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.219> was

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
patch it using the patcher that was

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.030 
patch it using the patcher that was
provided<00:02:02.759> by<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.880> sukazi<00:02:03.270> raider<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.899> then<00:02:04.500> we

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
provided by a sukazi raider and then we

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.399 
provided by a sukazi raider and then we
have<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> put<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> file<00:02:06.450> back<00:02:06.479> into<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.170> disc

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
have to put the file back into the disc

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.410 
have to put the file back into the disc
so<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.759> little<00:02:08.879> bit<00:02:09.090> involved

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so it's kind of a little bit involved

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.839 
so it's kind of a little bit involved
but<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.319> doesn't<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.340> hard<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
but it doesn't it's not that hard and

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.520 
but it doesn't it's not that hard and
