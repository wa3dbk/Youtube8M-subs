00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 At that time , that is the head of the dig 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.899
 what are you looking for when we have here 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.210
 archaeological investigations 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.730
 carried out as part of the rehabilitation of the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 bergfrieds on behalf of the museum association 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.470
 world war of the world he is concerned 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
 the layers of the usage time of the dome 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.859
 to explore more 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.730
 and how comes next to ours 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.420
 four-week investigation finds from the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.699
 middle age 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.030
 we're talking about one in time 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.500
 period in 14 15 century we 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 So could find findings from this time 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.230
 uncover floor structures fireplaces 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.719
 and so on 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.120
 the main focus of our work in the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.579
 next four weeks back again 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 Your friends are more sensational 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 Wise how could we determine 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.390
 that it is among the medieval ones 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.309
 even older findings and 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.140
 strata are very timely 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 go back to the past 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.520
 until the Bronze Age so into the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.450
 second third millennium before christ 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.720
 we have from this time too 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.369
 discoveries 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.299
 that means stone artifact of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.680
 stone tools ceramic tools like 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.380
 Significantly, this base would have to be for 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.330
 Vorarlberg the site is very very 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.869
 important for the vorarlberg room 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.340
 also fall like diverse and environment 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.009
 especially because we are next to the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.170
 medieval building also older 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.299
 can have noticed and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 that we hope that we will too 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.579
 can finish exploring in the next 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.799
 year since it's out of this area 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.750
 There is little source of information about the Bronze Age 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.680
 go back and how that clearly 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.930
 could prove 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.070
 and that is for 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.630
 the research and for the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.030
 historiography in this room 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:54.480
 extremely important probably one 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.580
 bolt or larger iron bullet 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.940
 music that has to be restored first 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.510
 looks better then what we too 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:07.830
 have very much material is whole 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.360
 important to us if we believe in 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.370
 munich for us most important for the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.730
 Dating the layers have one 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:22.070
 very nice piece as so-called packs 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.070
 he has ground level and lives and the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.420
 People who come from Constance there 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.440
 has been coined by bishop tung and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.330
 to have around 1300 for prehistoric finds 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.110
 I have two beautiful pieces now 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.920
 daily are so-called sinex fragments 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.580
 So that's a stone too easy 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.450
 edit is and germany 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.080
 most interesting maybe this piece 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.100
 the system 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.430
 the tip of an arrowhead 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.790
 the so clearly prehistoric 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.340
 time seems to belong to the Bronze Age and 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.560
 a second piece that is in cash 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.960
 this is not arrowhead but 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.570
 probably China or force such 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.400
 stone artifacts you have just in time 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.130
 All decided already use 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.350
 or zuzumuten edit of such a 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.000
 normal possible things in the household 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.910
 Also used for cutting meat 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.910
 to have today and further
