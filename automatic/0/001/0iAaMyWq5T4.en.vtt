slowly towards the comet to this first
demonstration<00:04:35.270> we<00:04:36.270> have<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.510> easiest

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
complicated than that from previous

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.360 
complicated than that from previous
observations<00:05:02.669> we<00:05:02.910> know<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.360> comets<00:05:03.720> rotate

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
observations we know that comets rotate

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.180 
observations we know that comets rotate
so<00:05:05.370> now<00:05:06.240> we're<00:05:06.479> going<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.870> try<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.590> dock<00:05:07.770> fuel<00:05:08.100> a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
so now we're going to try to dock fuel a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.150 
so now we're going to try to dock fuel a
onto<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.610> comet<00:05:08.940> again<00:05:09.270> this<00:05:10.260> time<00:05:10.500> our<00:05:10.680> comet

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
onto the comet again this time our comet

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:38.090 
onto the comet again this time our comet
is<00:05:11.280> going<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.610> be<00:05:11.729> rotating

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.520 

now<00:05:39.100> let's<00:05:39.970> add<00:05:40.150> even<00:05:40.330> more<00:05:40.420> complexity<00:05:41.290> for

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
now let's add even more complexity for

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.950 
now let's add even more complexity for
the<00:05:41.620> last<00:05:41.800> demonstration<00:05:42.430> as<00:05:42.750> Rosetta<00:05:43.750> will

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
the last demonstration as Rosetta will

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.080 
the last demonstration as Rosetta will
be<00:05:44.080> moving<00:05:44.320> around<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.860> comet<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.670> means<00:05:45.910> that

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
be moving around the comet it means that

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.270 
be moving around the comet it means that
the<00:05:46.180> nucleus<00:05:46.720> of<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:47.080> comet<00:05:47.230> will<00:05:47.830> also<00:05:48.130> be

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
the nucleus of the comet will also be

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.720 
the nucleus of the comet will also be
moving<00:05:48.490> or<00:05:49.350> translating<00:05:50.350> relative<00:05:51.160> to<00:05:51.610> the

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
moving or translating relative to the

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.570 
moving or translating relative to the
spacecraft<00:05:52.440> therefore<00:05:53.440> this<00:05:53.860> time<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.250> comet

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
spacecraft therefore this time the comet

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:21.090 
spacecraft therefore this time the comet
is<00:05:54.700> rotating<00:05:55.390> and<00:05:55.510> translating

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.550 

these<00:06:21.730> were<00:06:21.910> tough<00:06:22.060> experiments<00:06:22.720> when

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
these were tough experiments when

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.590 
these were tough experiments when
landing<00:06:24.010> on<00:06:24.130> the<00:06:24.220> nucleus<00:06:24.640> of<00:06:24.850> a<00:06:24.970> real<00:06:25.150> comet

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
landing on the nucleus of a real comet

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.870 
landing on the nucleus of a real comet
there<00:06:26.320> are<00:06:26.440> many<00:06:26.770> challenges<00:06:27.310> that<00:06:27.490> need<00:06:27.790> to

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
there are many challenges that need to

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.550 
there are many challenges that need to
be<00:06:27.910> addressed<00:06:28.210> due<00:06:29.020> to<00:06:29.200> the<00:06:29.290> low

be addressed due to the low

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.830 
be addressed due to the low
gravitational<00:06:30.400> pull<00:06:30.610> and<00:06:30.850> the<00:06:31.300> threat<00:06:31.660> of

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
towards the inner solar system you'll

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.750 
towards the inner solar system you'll
make<00:06:52.450> a<00:06:52.630> tale<00:06:52.840> observations<00:06:53.650> as<00:06:53.860> the<00:06:54.340> icy

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
make a tale observations as the icy

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.090 
make a tale observations as the icy

Sun<00:06:58.620> ok<00:06:59.620> so<00:06:59.680> today<00:07:00.190> we<00:07:00.430> saw<00:07:00.730> how<00:07:01.390> difficult<00:07:02.170> it

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
Sun ok so today we saw how difficult it

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.420 
Sun ok so today we saw how difficult it
actually<00:07:02.620> is<00:07:03.130> to<00:07:03.610> have<00:07:03.970> a<00:07:04.480> lander<00:07:05.410> dock<00:07:05.950> to<00:07:06.400> a

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
actually is to have a lander dock to a

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.990 
actually is to have a lander dock to a
comment<00:07:06.790> and<00:07:07.320> I<00:07:08.320> had<00:07:09.010> a<00:07:09.040> pretty<00:07:09.460> low<00:07:09.610> success

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
comment and I had a pretty low success

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.240 
comment and I had a pretty low success
rate<00:07:10.210> here<00:07:10.600> I'm<00:07:10.750> pretty<00:07:11.290> sure<00:07:11.470> of<00:07:11.500> Rosetta<00:07:11.950> can

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
rate here I'm pretty sure of Rosetta can

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.490 
rate here I'm pretty sure of Rosetta can
do<00:07:12.430> much<00:07:12.640> better<00:07:12.670> than<00:07:12.940> I<00:07:13.150> and<00:07:13.420> it's<00:07:14.320> going<00:07:14.440> to

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500 
do much better than I and it's going to

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.940 
do much better than I and it's going to
be<00:07:14.590> a<00:07:14.620> suspense<00:07:15.190> time<00:07:16.350> challenge<00:07:17.350> ahead<00:07:17.470> I'm

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
be a suspense time challenge ahead I'm

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.010 
be a suspense time challenge ahead I'm
looking<00:07:18.310> forward<00:07:18.610> to<00:07:18.700> that<00:07:18.880> landing<00:07:19.300> and<00:07:19.480> I
