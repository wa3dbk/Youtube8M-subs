00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 this is the philips hr21 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.930
 70 and of course it is a blender and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.809
 once I am there you can very 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.040
 prepare fresh and nutritious smoothies as 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.110
 we look we see that he is a beautiful 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 black high gloss finish 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.210
 plastic has especially in the foot and bee 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.230
 the lid and the one can own that is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.869
 full of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.670
 Also sight glass solid glass and is therefore 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.199
 he is also somewhat heavy if you of course 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.269
 stuck to it compared to a can 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 that of able dust is there as we 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.300
 look further , we see that too 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.990
 has another size indication on it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.520
 glass 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.440
 so that is also very handy and he the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 capacity of 2 liters 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.450
 the lid that is this way 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.100
 easy to remove and finish 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.260
 so you get all your ingredients 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.120
 tidy you can put the lid in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 then indeed this way it 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 in places and what is very useful is that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 He also has a sealed bob so that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.289
 you can take it off and then you can 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.480
 possibly during a blender and still 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.340
 because add ingredients through this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.160
 hole so everything comes right away 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.750
 up and then place the men 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 is of course possible on the engine block 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.909
 in this way clicked well and you can 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.799
 now start the means of this 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.600
 button you can of course turn on 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.640
 so you can have a sun between mini and maxi 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 determine the speed of turning 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 but also has the blades 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 Chris is a very convenient feature allowing 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.869
 your ice cubes can also be just fine 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.900
 actually pulverize into white snow 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.500
 and additionally awkward wrist function for 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.240
 target 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.710
 sore that you had to do thing is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.119
 content you fill in make use of it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.579
 because when you let go he just shoots 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.770
 back again and 0 is of course aytta and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.360
 if you prepare smoothie of course 5 and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 then you can take the jug off and through the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.720
 he must be honest 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.159
 but then it often comes 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.509
 biggest job and that is cleaning 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.860
 come from the blender but you 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.180
 Philip also thought of it because like me already 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.790
 said you can of course take the lid 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.920
 but you can also delete the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.610
 remove blades and turn on them 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.939
 the way out and then you can 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.920
 put everything in the dishwasher 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.820
 it 's also all about it 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.710
 Dishwasher safe so that it just 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090
 really completely clean to form your 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.070
