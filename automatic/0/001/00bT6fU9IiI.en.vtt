00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.360
 these little pancakes are being pretty 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.910
 rich in proteins since they contain 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.500
 pretty egg and ham 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.440
 anb the ingredients that I will be 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.780
 using is up I mushrooms I think they have 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.110
 another name I do not remember a chile 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.860
 serrano spinach ham obviously the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.200
 eggs and salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.960
 these molds quoted if the slips for 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.430
 make the cupcakes obviously my 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.430
 knife and chopping board 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.649
 Now I'm going to chop all the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.720
 ingredients is your decision if the 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.350
 you want to make bigger ones smaller 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.119
 you decide it 's your pleasure I left them 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.190
 as medium means are not so 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.190
 little ones but they are not so big 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.540
 the ham like if I stay a little 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.260
 more tiny I nothing else happens three 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260
 slices 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 with these ingredients and I adjust for 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.610
 make about 8 pancakes 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.710
 plus 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.560
 to give you an idea more or less 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.950
 and clarifying that you clear and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.950
 calls 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.500
 Now I'm going to chop everything very well too 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.649
 the mushrooms these are like more 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.220
 difficult to sting because they are like two 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.220
 separated 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.819
 I also piquÃ© the spinach 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.819
 and I'm going to stir everything 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.310
 like a good mexican I had to 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.500
 add a chile serrano I'll 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.970
 learn my oven and I'm going to preheat 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.450
 for 5 minutes at 430 degrees fahrenheit and 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.610
 Now I'm going to stir everything 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.710
 As I say, you can take the yolk 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.990
 or leave it if I leave it 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.990
 now if you beat it it's very very well 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.530
 and now if I put the pieces of paper to my 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.900
 these disposable ramekins 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.010
 I put more pieces of paper left over 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.600
 it is clear and almost started as around 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.510
 two spoons more or less for bread that 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.360
 He quoted but I tell them they can fill it 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.459
 to leave it he hears I need because they are not going 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.650
 to throw the egg goes sponge -during 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.400
 when it's cooking, it's in the oven 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.650
 but it's not going away it's not going to throw away 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.040
 sponge and then return to a size 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.700
 smaller as of how like the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.280
 we leave there since it is almost at 15 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.739
 minutes to cook is when I'm going to 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.930
 put and more or less that I'm going to leave 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.629
 within 15 minutes 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.569
 these hills are very practical because 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.060
 do not spend as much light are smaller and 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.269
 you do not have to warm up to undertake all 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.719
 the stove is like I tell you there 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.340
 they are exposing and ready I put them a 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.280
 little that that only for 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.819
 decorate and they are delicious 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.819
 I recommend
