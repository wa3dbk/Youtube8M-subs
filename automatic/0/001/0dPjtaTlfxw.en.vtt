00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
hi boys I'd like to talk to you about

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.419 
hi boys I'd like to talk to you about
hatchling<00:00:06.660> needed<00:00:06.990> dragon<00:00:07.319> takes<00:00:07.500> first<00:00:08.189> step

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
hatchling needed dragon takes first step

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.310 
hatchling needed dragon takes first step
is<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> environment<00:00:09.330> premium<00:00:09.660> dragons<00:00:10.139> and

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
is the environment premium dragons and

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.410 
is the environment premium dragons and
the<00:00:10.800> environment<00:00:11.070> should<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.610> no<00:00:11.940> smaller

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the environment should be no smaller

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.990 
the environment should be no smaller
than<00:00:12.540> 2<00:00:13.110> foot<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.740> don't<00:00:14.280> believe<00:00:14.400> any<00:00:14.759> bigger

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
than 2 foot I don't believe any bigger

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.599 
than 2 foot I don't believe any bigger
than<00:00:15.120> 3<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.809> sauce<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.830> right

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
than 3 for the sauce this one here right

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.400 
than 3 for the sauce this one here right
for<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> big<00:00:18.210> dragon<00:00:18.600> babies<00:00:18.750> as<00:00:19.109> they<00:00:19.289> get

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
for the big dragon babies as they get

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.290 
for the big dragon babies as they get
bigger<00:00:19.590> they<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:19.949> need<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> bigger<00:00:20.670> take<00:00:20.910> even

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
bigger they do need a bigger take even

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.439 
bigger they do need a bigger take even
up<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.660> 2<00:00:21.869> meters<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.800> minimum<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.490> 1.2<00:00:24.060> meters

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
up to 2 meters or minimum is 1.2 meters

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.410 
up to 2 meters or minimum is 1.2 meters
long<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> heel<00:00:26.699> assistance<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
long so is the heel assistance to the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900 
long so is the heel assistance to the
babies<00:00:27.720> most<00:00:28.650> important<00:00:29.160> part<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
babies most important part is to have a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.359 
babies most important part is to have a
thermostat<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.650> which<00:00:32.009> turns

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
thermostat like the one here which turns

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
thermostat like the one here which turns
on<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.820> off<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.149> heating<00:00:33.480> system<00:00:33.630> eating

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
on and off the heating system eating

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
on and off the heating system eating
like<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:35.100> keep<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.579> maintain<00:00:35.910> temperature

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
like to keep the maintain temperature

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.540 
like to keep the maintain temperature
and<00:00:36.570> perhaps<00:00:36.780> means<00:00:37.260> i<00:00:37.500> believe<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> keep<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and perhaps means i believe to keep it

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.330 
and perhaps means i believe to keep it
no<00:00:39.030> less<00:00:39.450> than<00:00:39.480> 35<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.559> though<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:40.950> than<00:00:40.980> 40

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
no less than 35 and though more than 40

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.549 
no less than 35 and though more than 40
degrees<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> hot<00:00:42.600> side<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
degrees for them on the hot side and the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
degrees for them on the hot side and the
cold<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.980> i<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.579> go<00:00:44.700> down<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.910> 25<00:00:45.420> degrees

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
cold so i can go down to 25 degrees

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.529 
cold so i can go down to 25 degrees
those<00:00:46.530> step<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> importance<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.270> UV

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
those step is the importance of the UV

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.279 
those step is the importance of the UV
light<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.559> i<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.250> 10-percent<00:00:51.030> 2<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.989> 18

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
light here i have a 10-percent 2 for 18

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.799 
light here i have a 10-percent 2 for 18
watt<00:00:52.739> UV<00:00:53.160> light<00:00:53.399> which<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.690> see

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
watt UV light which is as you can see

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
watt UV light which is as you can see
close<00:00:55.590> enough<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> dragus<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
close enough for the dragus get the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.910 
close enough for the dragus get the
benefit<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> light<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.530> very

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
benefit of the light and that is very

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.229 
benefit of the light and that is very
important<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> process<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
important for them to process the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.029 
important for them to process the
calcium<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> growth<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.590> their<00:01:01.739> skin

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
calcium and for the growth in their skin

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
calcium and for the growth in their skin
and<00:01:02.100> their<00:01:02.280> bones<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.730> everything<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and their bones and everything all the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.060 
and their bones and everything all the
step<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.439> substrate<00:01:04.979> hence<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.840> material

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
step is the substrate hence the material

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.430 
step is the substrate hence the material
environment<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.570> important<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.200> very
