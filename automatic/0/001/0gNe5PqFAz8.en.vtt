00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
have to go on that's when I am a two-way

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.490 
have to go on that's when I am a two-way
player<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.350> first<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.920> defense<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:15.500> love

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
player the first in my defense I love

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
player the first in my defense I love
that<00:01:16.650> side<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.280> much<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.640> play<00:01:17.850> offense

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.480 
that side just as much as I play offense
I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:19.470> defensively<00:01:19.740> obviously<00:01:20.250> he's<00:01:20.369> one

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
I think defensively obviously he's one

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.740 
I think defensively obviously he's one
of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> toughest<00:01:20.880> matchups<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.630> our

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
league and it's a bill to get to the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.999 
league and it's a bill to get to the
free-throw<00:01:23.460> line<00:01:24.140> but<00:01:25.140> I'll<00:01:25.380> taking<00:01:25.710> matchup

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
