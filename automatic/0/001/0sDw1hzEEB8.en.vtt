00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.279

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.310

 and the leaning tower of pisa is now in the picture yes that is just leaking according to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.469
 I care a strong building that by itself has cities together we have 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.520

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.180

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.890

 okay so including of course living overnight place need a shame already booked 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.350
 but I can tell 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.209
 that the best one in 8 night place clansman it was selma 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.840
 on my mouth and we had that beautiful view of a city called 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.880
 persia persia pnt p rc that earth yes that was just the best little town 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.099
 with all others 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.700
 Stedin around one and that was a correction to a fun sit on that work with 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.359
 pocket over the view 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.079
 he was a very nice game but also and yes that was actually about persia 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.349
 from annexes to another city called brouckaert mulcaires the one 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.519
 is a city that is still unknown with or just complete under a bus with 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.129
 all political but the makers of difficult words no idea but good 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.950
 with such all the teams that know the city and the one is the city throughout 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.549
 Italy so still 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.119
 just completely surround the city 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.189
 after two days in front of kingma after mans florence she is making a de 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.549
 ovd I think the second largest city of yuri rates and real that's just 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.989
 super cool it was a very big city and then badstuber beautiful buildings were like 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.659
 yes i go i can't name names because i know a lady couldn't do much with them 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.909
 difficult names 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.609
 but no yes it was super beautiful was a very nice building exponent 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.810
 one of the nicest buildings that component have seen in my life and there 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:19.439
 was really not normal that I had buildings to eat well so I do not know 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.109
 more 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.629
 in March, the super beautiful from your seeing and also a picture as a choice or you 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.010
 can be seen here and there 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.460
 and that was simply nicely covered in it all but different green star in it 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.430
 bed I know a lot what it all walsh 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.950
 but at least that was the coolest cathedral in the wallet 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.359
 have seen life 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.949
 Estonia where that all other large buildings and had overnight in it 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.549
 a large hotel and quite normal but still a cheaper one 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.199
 price 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.469
 and yes that was from a super cool now it is now just the year I think 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.189
 clarinet you see that I was the hand in 6 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.560
 and that I die so if you go on the road also see that I was dead 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:57.759
 gone because i'm dressing myself very stupid 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.229
 so after a day in florence went back to beer drinking like us ours 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.169
 final destination because then of course we just had to take the plane again 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.620
 take it back home 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.519
 We still have a night at the pizza chain in a super nice pzpn 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.280
 I could not normally not take a picture of unfortunately but it was really normal 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.520
 super nice days and very tasty pizza chain a few days after the 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.330
 she stays with steel for the night in tirza with very good vision had she had there 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.819
 I'm just just because it 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.990
 that's just nice to say or something but I had more vi and well 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.630
 very last day so actually horn today that I also record it 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.500
 why the room doctor just had rich reason because we had of course 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.460
 Housing weeks out of the neighborhood 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.509
 and yet there were also some doping cases coming after one 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.980
 demonstration against it was quite what I mean 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.740
 they all said italian things where discount spoke of a stoma 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.710
 broker does not matter 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.370
 but that was pretty obvious 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.590
 and then of course you go to the airport and had our plane 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.400
 taken back home and 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.020
 where i have a country and all of them that recently will express weapon and bp too difficult 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.820
 but that is a small town in Belgium close by 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.270
 Brussels according to me and days 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.030
 from there naturally went back to the birch and that was pretty yes you 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.430
 will be longer in the car and then in the plane 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.430
 but the both didn't matter and then I'm sitting here getting home with 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.389
 fries gave month that I don't know 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.229
 but not on 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.639
 he was auctioning the city in a trip through italy so i didn't have too much 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.259
 tell and the video that room she gets through the disease 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.490
 will have to try and tell and look forward to what i am talking about 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.509
 have discovered 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.449
 watching bass seamlessly na gent sowing is not boring with its news from 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.219
 the pope is all where a new screen do the full and full of reading but 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:40.300
 then it was whether or not to do it and then it was that I just renkum that I just 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.029
 yes it was not really nearly listening because I am not very good at this 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.949
 yes i am good and i can just put it in my head and i want 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:48.629
 meet 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.849
 but I think that is not my strongest side and so years can be one 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.110
 don't do much about it 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.370
 so yes that is unfortunately not so nice but I can but it is just one 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.339
 mention a little 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.849
 what i got there is that you read it first 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.550
 yes the why beginnings had turned out because it involves knowing there 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.740
 I was nothing but his that was most remarkable but that was the 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.659
 eldest 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.300
 all probably oosterpolder in the world has won its own money 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.759
 I know a lot and so I dug up and then was a family 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.039
 That they are from 7200 BC to just about my husband 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.039
 their naked wife is kind of weird to you 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:33.519
 but that was like that and I just thought it was interesting, but yes, that is normal 

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:36.720
 for me I mean I am so said the young disagree and negative because 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.879
 but that was just pretty happy 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:43.399
 I also had to look at all the other great news items but people are my time 

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.700
 on a weekly basis I never stop it 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.660
 A tip sauve will make you a bit liked if you like this stuff more than 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.390
 later neatly behind the committee members and then you come me 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.480
 maybe in the next video in picture i don't know that this time i like 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.790
 the good is getting used to I have to remember with proteins but good with 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.730
 they thank you for looking it you that you never liked them and that 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.250
 I'll see here next time with new video later
