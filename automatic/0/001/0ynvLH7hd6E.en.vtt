to like take these chains off move the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.850 
to like take these chains off move the
keys<00:01:46.520> take<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> off<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.259> what's<00:01:49.530> apart

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
keys take it off and that's what's apart

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.249 
keys take it off and that's what's apart
just<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> get<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> stupid<00:01:50.790> book<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.869> you
