cool<00:01:53.909> patterns<00:01:54.329> which<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.079> I've<00:01:55.170> done<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
cool patterns which is what I've done to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.450 
cool patterns which is what I've done to
add<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.719> extra<00:01:57.930> interest<00:01:58.799> I'm<00:01:59.130> using

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
add a little extra interest I'm using

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.490 
add a little extra interest I'm using
some<00:01:59.850> golden<00:02:00.659> medium<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:02.790> stencil<00:02:03.540> now<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
some golden medium and a stencil now the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.240 
some golden medium and a stencil now the
medium<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.280> I'm<00:02:05.460> using<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.329> light

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
medium that I'm using is the light

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.100 
medium that I'm using is the light
molding<00:02:08.250> paste<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.270> scraping<00:02:09.959> this

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
molding paste and I'm just scraping this

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.660 
molding paste and I'm just scraping this
through<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.349> stencil<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.069> scraping<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
through the stencil and then scraping a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
through the stencil and then scraping a
little<00:02:11.879> bit<00:02:11.970> off<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.450> looks<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.720> bit<00:02:12.810> scruffy

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
little bit off so it looks a bit scruffy

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.920 
little bit off so it looks a bit scruffy
I'm<00:02:14.280> also<00:02:14.640> adding<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.209> little<00:02:15.360> bit<00:02:15.480> around<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
I'm also adding a little bit around the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.740 
I'm also adding a little bit around the
edges<00:02:16.159> just<00:02:17.159> just<00:02:17.909> sort<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.120> help<00:02:18.330> frame<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
edges just just sort of help frame the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.860 
edges just just sort of help frame the
page<00:02:21.739> for<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.799> little<00:02:22.920> extra<00:02:23.159> bling<00:02:23.730> I'm<00:02:24.090> adding

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
page for a little extra bling I'm adding

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.110 
page for a little extra bling I'm adding
some<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.530> platinum<00:02:26.069> crackled<00:02:26.670> texture

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
some of the platinum crackled texture

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.449 
some of the platinum crackled texture
paste<00:02:27.379> just<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> lower<00:02:28.860> half<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
paste just to the lower half of the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.030 
paste just to the lower half of the
journal<00:02:29.849> page<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.329> again<00:02:30.720> i'm<00:02:30.959> applying<00:02:31.680> this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
journal page and again i'm applying this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.930 
journal page and again i'm applying this
so<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.430> looks<00:02:32.579> a<00:02:32.700> bit<00:02:32.819> scruffy<00:02:34.549> now<00:02:35.549> that<00:02:35.790> all

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
so it looks a bit scruffy now that all

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.479 
so it looks a bit scruffy now that all
of<00:02:35.970> my<00:02:36.239> base<00:02:36.450> layers<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:37.079> dry<00:02:37.409> I've<00:02:37.980> got<00:02:38.310> some

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
of my base layers are dry I've got some

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.240 
of my base layers are dry I've got some
really<00:02:38.849> interesting<00:02:39.510> textures<00:02:40.409> to<00:02:40.590> work<00:02:40.799> over

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
really interesting textures to work over

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.690 
really interesting textures to work over
when<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.819> add<00:02:42.090> color<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.200> journal<00:02:43.470> page<00:02:43.700> now

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
when I add color to the journal page now

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.349 
when I add color to the journal page now
it's<00:02:44.879> time<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.329> some<00:02:45.480> starbursts<00:02:47.359> I'm

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
it's time for some starbursts I'm

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.869 
it's time for some starbursts I'm
starting<00:02:48.900> off<00:02:48.989> my<00:02:49.170> page<00:02:49.440> by<00:02:49.769> adding<00:02:49.980> down<00:02:50.670> at

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
starting off my page by adding down at

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.699 
starting off my page by adding down at
the<00:02:51.030> rabbit<00:02:51.359> hole<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.109> this<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.410> pretty

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the rabbit hole and this is a pretty

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.789 
the rabbit hole and this is a pretty
soft<00:02:53.099> brown<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.819> starburst<00:02:54.359> series<00:02:54.930> so

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
soft brown in the starburst series so

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.890 
soft brown in the starburst series so
give<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.400> good<00:02:56.519> shake<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.569> spritz

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
give it a good shake and just spritz

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.080 
give it a good shake and just spritz
this<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.349> random<00:02:59.159> leap<00:02:59.340> over<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.640> background

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
this on random leap over the background

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.979 
this on random leap over the background
then<00:03:01.079> using<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.680> heat<00:03:01.890> gun<00:03:02.099> dry<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.030> off<00:03:03.180> you

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
then using a heat gun dry it off you

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.630 
then using a heat gun dry it off you
want<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.500> use<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.799> heat<00:03:04.950> gun<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.549> get

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
want to use the heat gun so that you get

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.059 
want to use the heat gun so that you get
little<00:03:05.790> splatters<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.569> splodges<00:03:07.200> if<00:03:07.890> you

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
little splatters and splodges if you

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.399 
little splatters and splodges if you
leave<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.430> air<00:03:08.700> dry<00:03:08.940> it'll<00:03:09.750> sort<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.019> spread

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
leave it to air dry it'll sort of spread

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.690 
leave it to air dry it'll sort of spread
out<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.560> little<00:03:10.709> bit<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.129> won't<00:03:11.280> get<00:03:11.430> those

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
out a little bit and you won't get those

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.140 
out a little bit and you won't get those
individual<00:03:12.269> spots<00:03:13.549> you<00:03:14.549> can<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:14.909> that<00:03:15.060> this

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
individual spots you can see that this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.800 
individual spots you can see that this
has<00:03:15.390> created<00:03:15.599> a<00:03:16.019> very<00:03:16.290> light<00:03:16.769> pale<00:03:17.810> background

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
has created a very light pale background

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.349 
has created a very light pale background
so<00:03:19.530> what<00:03:19.739> I'm<00:03:19.859> going<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.190> add<00:03:20.340> over<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.700> top<00:03:20.910> is

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
so what I'm going to add over the top is

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.839 
so what I'm going to add over the top is
gag<00:03:21.690> me<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:22.079> spoon<00:03:22.200> grey<00:03:22.799> now<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.639> is

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
gag me with a spoon grey now this is

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.819 
gag me with a spoon grey now this is
another<00:03:24.269> pale<00:03:24.660> color<00:03:25.019> but<00:03:25.530> it'll<00:03:25.709> give<00:03:25.799> a

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
another pale color but it'll give a

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.479 
another pale color but it'll give a
really<00:03:26.130> beautiful<00:03:26.280> base<00:03:26.700> for<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.060> background

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
really beautiful base for the background

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.550 
really beautiful base for the background
again<00:03:29.489> dry<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.419> heat<00:03:30.629> gun<00:03:30.660> I'm<00:03:31.019> going<00:03:31.500> to

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
again dry with the heat gun I'm going to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.170 
again dry with the heat gun I'm going to
dry<00:03:31.709> with<00:03:31.889> a<00:03:31.919> heat<00:03:32.099> gun<00:03:32.129> between<00:03:32.489> each<00:03:32.790> color

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
dry with a heat gun between each color

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.599 
dry with a heat gun between each color
so<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.569> get<00:03:33.810> separate<00:03:34.440> colors<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.950> no<00:03:35.370> color

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
so I get separate colors and no color

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.229 
so I get separate colors and no color
blending<00:03:36.859> now<00:03:37.859> for<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.280> hint<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.639> delphinium

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
blending now for a hint of delphinium

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.020 
blending now for a hint of delphinium
turquoise<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.680> much<00:03:40.919> stronger<00:03:41.519> color

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
turquoise this is a much stronger color

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.360 
turquoise this is a much stronger color
I'm<00:03:42.359> going<00:03:42.419> to<00:03:43.319> spray<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.859> in<00:03:44.099> sort<00:03:44.250> of

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
I'm going to spray this in sort of

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.300 
I'm going to spray this in sort of
splotches<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.900> sinks<00:03:46.379> into<00:03:46.620> some<00:03:47.069> of<00:03:47.160> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
splotches so it sinks into some of the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.220 
splotches so it sinks into some of the
texture<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:48.329> will<00:03:48.480> help<00:03:48.599> highlight<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
texture this will help highlight the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
texture this will help highlight the
text<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.680> later<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.400> give<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:50.819> page<00:03:51.060> a

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
text you later and give the page a
