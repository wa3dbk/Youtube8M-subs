00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.969 
the time is what goes it through the
assembly<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:02.899> you'll<00:02:03.469> have<00:02:03.619> all<00:02:03.829> these

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
assembly so you'll have all these

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.789 
assembly so you'll have all these
different<00:02:04.219> style<00:02:04.700> triumphs<00:02:05.329> in<00:02:05.899> a<00:02:06.049> line<00:02:06.259> these

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
different style triumphs in a line these

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.169 
different style triumphs in a line these
where<00:02:07.099> the<00:02:07.219> bikes<00:02:07.399> come<00:02:07.670> straight<00:02:07.939> off<00:02:07.969> the

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
where the bikes come straight off the

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.119 
where the bikes come straight off the
end<00:02:08.299> of<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.479> line<00:02:08.660> where<00:02:09.170> we're<00:02:09.289> putting<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
end of the line where we're putting the

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.480 
end of the line where we're putting the
final<00:02:10.340> body<00:02:10.640> work<00:02:10.849> on<00:02:11.120> checking<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.569> bike<00:02:11.750> so

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.780 

have<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> look<00:02:16.700> at<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:17.120> rolling<00:02:17.450> right

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.940 

he<00:02:21.480> gets<00:02:21.659> it<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.079> constant<00:02:22.560> speed<00:02:22.620> then

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
he gets it up to a constant speed then

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.470 
he gets it up to a constant speed then
he'll<00:02:23.099> check<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> front<00:02:23.640> brake<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> same

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
he'll check the front brake of the same

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.620 
he'll check the front brake of the same
with<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:24.750> back<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.140> then<00:02:25.230> we'll<00:02:25.349> go<00:02:25.469> together
