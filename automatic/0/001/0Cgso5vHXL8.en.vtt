we<00:01:46.600> were<00:01:46.750> recommended<00:01:47.410> that<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.800> black<00:01:48.220> watch

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
we were recommended that the black watch

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.940 
we were recommended that the black watch
was<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> good<00:01:48.880> vessel<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.540> more<00:01:50.170> intimate<00:01:50.500> vessel

was a good vessel a more intimate vessel

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.200 
was a good vessel a more intimate vessel
and<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.130> went<00:01:51.250> into<00:01:51.370> more<00:01:51.580> interesting<00:01:51.940> places

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
and it went into more interesting places

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.600 
and it went into more interesting places
that<00:01:53.050> was<00:01:53.170> basically<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.680> reason<00:01:53.920> after

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
that was basically the reason after

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.180 
that was basically the reason after
Dalton<00:01:55.030> stick<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.450> smaller<00:01:55.810> ships<00:01:56.230> so<00:01:57.160> that

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
Dalton stick to smaller ships so that

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:36.130 
Dalton stick to smaller ships so that
means<00:01:57.760> we<00:01:58.000> can<00:01:58.210> get<00:01:58.420> into<00:01:58.570> some<00:01:59.700> smaller<00:02:00.700> port
