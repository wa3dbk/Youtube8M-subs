 Hello everyone today in our review 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.859
 such here 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.420
 combined digital and analog 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:25.199
 watch with marking 511 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:30.420
 they are made of stainless steel color 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:35.460
 titanium coatings applied to all 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:44.550
 metal parts this is on the strap lock 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:46.590
 on the case and on the side buttons screws in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 original metallic light in that 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.480
 the number and the crown immediately say 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 crown controls separately 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.879
 only arrows touch here 21 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.760
 mechanism separately mechanism digital 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.559
 wanted an analog clock mechanism so here 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.229
 the crown controls only 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 analog clock he thought it was clear how 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.150
 they look on the arm 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:19.229
 For the sake of convenience, give us time to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.670
 them up the rubber strap is not silicone 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.000
 this is matte black rubber 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 about 26 full strap length 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 centimeters there is a perforation for 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 ventilation 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.060
 also on the back of the strap for 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.890
 ventilation applied here such 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:44.460
 channels to enlarge 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.549
 abduction by others that one hand does not 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.750
 worn under the watch strap on 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 the back cover is labeled 511 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.320
 tactical series signed appointment 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.790
 button cover is mounted on four screws 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 the diameter of the dial is about 4 soldered 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.860
 centimeters thickness of the dial 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:12.550
 is about 1.7 centimeters width 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.240
 strap in the widest part 2 4060 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:20.500
 water meter impermeability is indicated as 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:24.090
 30 meters data hours according to the statements 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.470
 Chinese manufacturer can not only 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.220
 used when washing hands 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.990
 but they can swim but it is not 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.550
 o by the environment only swimming by 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.880
 surface quality watch performance 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.340
 good enough for their price here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.620
 the glass here is not polycarbonate exactly 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.770
 sapphire glass or not sapphire say 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.770
 it is difficult to be checked brine it does not want to 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.450
 the watch has a furious bezel not 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.700
 decorative it has a rotation that is 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.000
 business is quite functional on 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.860
 clock hands to second to hour 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 for a minute just like these points 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.390
 strips denoting a clock has 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.760
 application of the phosphor composition and about 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.650
 recharging and when recharging from light 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.140
 glows brightly enough in the dark well 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.010
 Iâ€™ll put in the moment like this 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:30.550
 looks like this 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.950
 requirements in the light is extremely poorly noticeable 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.870
 but in a dark room or in a dark time 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.810
 days for the chapter 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.300
 very noticeably highlighted all 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.150
 arrows clock is quite heavy due to 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.330
 the case is completely metal 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.570
 made of stainless steel and weighs 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.760
 about 120 grams that is, it is not an alloy 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.590
 aluminum cheap lead is stainless 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.860
 steel 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.160
 I want it and a replica of the available 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.100
 the function is clear that this is an arrow for 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.580
 analogue time display 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.010
 as for the digital clock this is a major 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.570
 indication of the day of the week here we have 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:18.299
 so today is the specified time hour minutes 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.299
 seconds also we have displayed 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.669
 By the way , the clock is nice 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.620
 greenish light but camera 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.319
 strongly in this backlight for some reason 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.879
 perceives as blue and now 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.879
 for some reason you see how in the blue light 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.719
 display on digital display 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:51.699
 inverse and that is it is a black background and 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:56.590
 white numbers and letters as we have above and 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:59.860
 time is displayed under this bar 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:06.669
 There is a 12 or 24 hour display mode 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:11.740
 time the presence of an alarm clock the presence and 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:15.400
 hourly alarm also here under this 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:20.080
 an arrow is shown with just him 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:28.870
 covers month and current 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:31.029
 number in the settings you can enter the code then 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.629
 there is a clock pledged program with full 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:38.800
 calendar of available features 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:42.789
 respectively alarm clock timer timer 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.849
 can display multiple positions then 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.879
 there are several 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:51.750
 the positions of time that is how you see 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:54.940
 enough value can be fixed 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.020
 also very hours there is a second time 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.659
 double time which can be set 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.839
 also available besides stopwatch and timer 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.029
 countdown that is possible 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:09.039
 set countdown timer 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:11.830
 which is when now we are stopped 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.560
 It was for two minutes, that is, we run it 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.909
 we want to go back 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.680
 completion will sound accordingly 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:23.289
 buzzer sound 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.800
 timer you can stop it 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:31.449
 return set value ie it is 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.300
 value is remembered and come out again 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.690
 on the indication of the days of the week that is on 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.100
 current 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.980
 the watch is quite functional 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.490
 interesting enough and simple 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.350
 without unnecessary frills to customize for 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:51.600
 order to tune these 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:56.280
 hours you need to hold and hold the bottom 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.620
 right button to beep us 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.940
 beep sounded now day 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.700
 weeks after that we blinked seconds 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.280
 switching the left bottom button you can 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:13.020
 change to change that is translate 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:15.870
 to change the hours of minutes to seconds now 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.830
 we can change the year now inserted 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.250
 2015 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:25.530
 changes occur by pressing 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:32.810
 the top right button also changes and 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:36.470
 month and current date after clicking 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.940
 right bottom button we memorize 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:42.750
 changes and go into display mode 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.520
 tass watch mode all 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.710
 simple enough but not everywhere 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.710
 described therefore I hope this video 

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.860
 it will be interesting and useful for you
