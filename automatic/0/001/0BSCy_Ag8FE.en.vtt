00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello how about friends I'm lupita 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.280
 welcome to my channel the recipes 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.780
 lupita today we are going to prepare 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.260
 a rich fresh milk water 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.470
 the milk is this fruit is of origin 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.369
 Chinese 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:26.189
 here in Mexico is grown in sinaloa in 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.189
 veracruz and in the Huasteca potosina 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:36.510
 is this nap looks like 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.510
 I do not know how very exotic 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.260
 it is very sweet it has a consistency 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.860
 well it is not like that of the grape 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.870
 here I already have a clean 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.820
 and they are credited as well 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.450
 aphrodisiac properties or something like that but 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.550
 well that who knows if it's true 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.850
 if it has a slightly high cost 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.729
 because it is only consumed in the months of 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.690
 may June and July already there then no longer 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.540
 we find it again 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.600
 let's prepare a rich water with this 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.660
 fruit we are going to clean we are going to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.440
 remove the seed you have here 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.760
 has a seed 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.300
 we are going to withdraw it we will need 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.550
 vanilla sugar and logically the water 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.550
 I'm going to clean all my fruits 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.510
 to take them to the blender with all 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.080
 the ingredients and make the water already 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.430
 clean my lychees now I'm going to put 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.430
 here in the glass of the blender 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.250
 remember to remove the seeds I will 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.800
 to put the vanilla 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.030
 and I'm going to put sugar the sugar is at your 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.040
 taste 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.049
 the fruit is very sweet then they 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.299
 I recommend that you first liquefy it with 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.069
 little sugar and after they have 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.380
 ready try it and if you let go 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.679
 sugar you add more you can add 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.679
 Water 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.760
 and I'm going to take it to liquefy 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.209
 here we have our rich lychee water 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.430
