00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:03.604
 Thank you for turning around at Cross Allegiance. 

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:09.610
 I have a very simple message for you - that is, God loves you, and He wants a relationship with you. 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.381
 I would like to highlight (briefly) some pieces of the Word that show us God's love for us, 

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.752
 as well as its application in our lives. 

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:25.326
 Genesis 3. Adam and Eve disobeyed God - they sinned and therefore sin is on all mankind. 

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:30.331
 In our shame we tried to cover ourselves with fig leaves - not a very good solution! 

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:34.001
 So for us, God made the first animal sacrifice. 

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.170
 It was just a "shadow of good things still to come," as Hebrews put it, 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.976
 that this animal sacrifice, which had to be done over and over again, only temporarily covered our sins, 

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:49.016
 would be the shadow of Jesus, Who was the final and final payment for our sins. 

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:55.656
 God is always reconciling. 2 Corinthians 5 speaks a lot about this. 

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:59.326
 In Christ, God is reconciling the world, not to accuse us of the sins we are guilty of, 

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:05.499
 and we can be reconciled by faith in the atonement of Jesus. 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.769
 The whole message of reconciliation is based on love 

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:13.941
 John 3:16. You've probably seen it at a football game, on a poster or at boxing. 

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:18.279
 John 3:16 says - "For God so loved the world ... 

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:23.417
 ... For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, 

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.120
 but can have eternal life. 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.858
 Another aspect of God's love is that He did not leave Jesus in the grave. 

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:37.564
 Jesus was victorious over the grave. 1 Corinthians 15 Jesus calls the "firstfruits" of those who will be resurrected. 

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:42.336
 The revival was also a symbol, not only that He had the victory over sin and death, but also 

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:46.940
 that one day we will rise to meet Him when we place our faith in Jesus. 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.248
 The chapter goes on to say, "For as in Adam, all will die, so in Christ, all will be made alive." 

00:01:54.248 --> 00:02:02.089
 God is patient with us. 2 Peter 3: 9 says that "God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." 

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:05.492
 And maybe you watch the video and you realize you haven't devoted your life to Jesus yet. 

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.995
 I'll advise you - definitely do it! 

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:14.201
 God's love is there and He is waiting for you to come to Him, because He loves you. 

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:24.278
 1 John 4:10 says, "Here is love, not that we love God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as a sacrifice for our sins." 

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:29.884
 And the great word, "atoning sacrifice," just means, "a sacrifice that silences evil that we deserve, 

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:37.157
 and bring us to grace '- to the blessings or undeserved kindness that God is so generous with. 

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:44.164
 Paul goes on with the message of reconciliation in 2 Corinthians 6 and he says, "the time is acceptable; now is the day of redemption! ' 

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:51.805
 God has so many blessings for us. Does it make sense to wait or to neglect such a fantastic salvation? 

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:57.811
 We must follow Jesus and enjoy life (not just the one who lies ahead), living a life that makes Him happy, 

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:02.383
 Doing and wanting through the Holy Spirit. 

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:10.757
 We must turn away from our rebellion against God. We must turn to Jesus and follow Him. 

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:13.760
 Lastly, I want to leave you with an invitation. 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.932
 If you are not in reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ, be reconciled! 

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:24.572
 Put your faith in Jesus, trust in Him, follow Him and love Him. 

00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:29.977
 And in an answer of prayer, it's not how eloquent you are - it's not how you address God semantically - 

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:35.716
 Faith in Jesus is the important part - in believing that God raised Him from the dead, 

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:40.520
 and the acknowledgment (statement) with your mouth that Jesus is the Lord - He is the master of all! 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.560
 If you have a desire to follow Jesus, pray and ask God to forgive you of your sins, 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.168
 acknowledge that Jesus is the Lord! Believe in Him, put your faith in Him and His Sacrifice for your sins! 

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:57.838
 He died and He rose again for you, because He loves you! 

00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:01.275
 And again, if you want to pray together, this is not your exact choice of words, 

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:04.945
 but whether you really mean it from your heart, pray with me: 

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:09.649
 Father, in the name of Jesus, I come to You, 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.420
 with the request Lord: Please forgive me of my sins! 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.022
 Help Me Follow You! 

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:23.396
 I acknowledge that Jesus is the Lord, He is the Son of God and He is the Savior of the world. 

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:29.236
 I accept His Sacrifice and His revival for my life. 

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:34.642
 I thank You God for the gift of grace that You have given us - 

00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:38.512
 that YOU showed your love in the provision of Jesus, 

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:42.749
 and that You may reconcile us to Yourself through Him. 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:51.458
 So God, I dedicate my life to You. Help me to follow You faithfully and obediently all the days of my life. 

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:56.664
 I pray all this in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

00:04:56.664 --> 00:05:01.335
 If you did the prayer and meant it out of your heart, then Amen! That's good news! 

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:05.906
 English rejoices when you devote your life to the Lord! 

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:09.777
 So if you made the decision to follow Jesus, or if you have a prayer request, 

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:14.748
 Have a message for us. We would love to help you grow in your walk with Jesus and encourage you. 

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:19.386
 You can visit our website at http://www.crossallegiance.org or send us a message here on YouTube, 

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:23.089
 but regardless of, God loves you and seeks a relationship with you! 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:28.562
 May it develop, may it be blessed in Jesus' name and may you go in peace. Have a fantastic week!
