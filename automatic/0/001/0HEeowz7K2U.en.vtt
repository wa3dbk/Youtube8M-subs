00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.000
 we will speak the first but in the second 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.160
 river the truth is that there was a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.550
 spectacular generation players 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.410
 that were just showing up with a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.070
 player with a lot of experience as he came 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.260
 I have been in Europe for almost 10 years 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.730
 the astrada who already had a tour 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.080
 in 1ª hernán díaz see fun 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.760
 river is a month and because always but 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.160
 all that campus you if I start you 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.490
 say that I played and I tell you the team 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.650
 chivu that good from the monkey burgos 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.070
 even the one who played saw or played to see 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.840
 I played, look what happened for us 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.420
 he played crossed the six months he went and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.850
 he was 15 years playing in europe that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.470
 I'm going to show you there's a move that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.210
 wake up your famous chilean in front of 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.550
 poland not while we are watching the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.790
 goals of enzo that move of that chilena 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.370
 it was a friendly match but something 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.840
 is blessed by something that Chilean here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.210
 we're going to see it 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.650
 this play of or does not stop being a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.720
 Friendly match is fine was against 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.420
 a selection but what will have happened that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.020
 this was magically incorporated 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.060
 to the imaginary to the east reservoir of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 Argentine soccer or the Chilean 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.040
 Enzo I want to tell you something immortalizes you 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.510
 this a lot of times but this is a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 of your tickets to the pantheon of the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.890
 herberos to disappear from this world and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.830
 in 200 years to follow a 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.650
 Chilean Enzo what a barbarian how 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.229
 immortalized this there is for media things 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.940
 fundamentals one is one is a play 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.119
 that does not stop being spectacular between 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.310
 miami between the air the synchronism but 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.770
 apart from that I think it was 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.259
 as a finale to the time that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.200
 lived that team and that I lived that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.230
 year and between national and championship and 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.590
 It was 34 then 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:00.060
 it was like you saw when you say the cherry of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.800
 gador 23 of the cake I think that was that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.830
 and it was in the retina of the whole world and 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.780
 my single became much more important 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.760
 of what it was really because it did not leave 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.230
 being a summer tournament and hence the 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.240
 spectacularity of the game because 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.130
 we lost 42 missing 10 minutes if 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.620
 we won 54 with that goal but 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.880
 yes I think those two things were very 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.880
 important bags
