00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 hello to all today a new 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.210
 video which is a tutorial today and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.160
 who will explain to you simply 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.160
 thanks to a manipulation to realize 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.010
 quickly you will be able to play with 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.609
 your friends and only to friends in fashion 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.630
 online without being bothered by the rest 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.820
 players from around the world 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.000
 so in fact it's as if you were 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 in a private match with all your friends 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.940
 except that everything is accounted for 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.920
 statistics as if you were in 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 line and on top of that you're not 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.930
 bothered by the rest of the players of the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.600
 whole world 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.590
 so that's pretty cool because that's it 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.020
 improve your performance 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.399
 as you want between pals and 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.230
 to make the boost mode possibly in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.460
 anyway here is in any case it's like 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.730
 if you were in private but everything is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.719
 counted so it's interesting 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.340
 so I will explain the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.480
 manipulation and steps it's very 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.100
 simple you can a little bit 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.600
 already understand in mind start to in 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.189
 mind how does it work 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.330
 how does it go and then of course 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.729
 immediately after you will see the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.810
 validate the video in real time for you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.119
 can see what it gives 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.260
 so first step in the video that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.479
 you will see is that I am with 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.979
 my buddy auger his and so he goes fast 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.840
 in his group so far nothing 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.610
 especially when I'm in the group 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.270
 of default management it is in the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 group leaders 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.220
 so what will do is who will me 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.150
 appoint a group leader and when I'm 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.070
 appointed group leader 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.329
 this is where you have to do the realization 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.490
 next that is to say that I'm going to 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.560
 put on his nick 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.090
 i'm going to press x on my ps3 controller 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 it's going to my menu I'll go 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 nicknamed chef 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.560
 i'm going to do x again and i'm going 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.540
 have a confirmation 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.119
 yes or no so I'm going to put my 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.530
 slider on wii and from there I 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.970
 will not validate right away and he'll 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.220
 I have to do the manipulation 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.140
 next that is x left arrow xxx 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.810
 in other words once x once arrow 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.329
 left and 3 xx individually but 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.369
 all this realize quickly if that 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.310
 walk and that the combination is successful 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.140
 it will launch online the first mode of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.239
 online game that has otherwise said in the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.460
 video you'll see it's ugly pitt and at 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.980
 from there 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.990
 I can invite friends my friends that 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.240
 I invite can invite their friends 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.130
 since it's really between pals and 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.720
 from there the match will start here 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.910
 you will see in the video we are six to 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.740
 total 3 against 3 and so the match can 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.390
 start when it does not succeed 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.460
 manipulation is very simple is that 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.980
 already you do not see that online mode 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.810
 start you go see your menu with 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.210
 top left look party that is 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.100
 grayed out and so that's like that eh 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.150
 well you know that actually that 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.550
 fails and you have to redo the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.180
 manipulation and manipulation she 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.970
 helped to redo 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.910
 when you are group leader so 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.070
 as the manipulation fails your buddy 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.510
 in fact you turn group leader and 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.850
 then you do the manipulation 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.320
 until the first game mode in 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.030
 line launches and as I told you 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.310
 if by 10 by default it's ugly pitt 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 little note when you get the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.910
 helping to do the manipulation 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.310
 and that it works with three times x 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.220
 I believe that after roger hers when 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.410
 we do x once left arrow and x 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.060
 once where x 2 x 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.700
 we can have the possibility 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.470
 possibly to choose the type of 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.540
 match that we want but good at the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.130
 rigor it is not very important 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.560
 the goal being to play online 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.570
 if you want for all to be 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.400
 counted and that eventually you 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.580
 can you redo your other mode 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.690
 Boost smoothly and So here 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.470
 any case now i'm going to show you 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.210
 in video how is it really 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.800
 so no here so here in the video 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.420
 so you see in his life will pass 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.040
 group leader i'm in his group 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.570
 he passed me group leader and my 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.730
 default cursor left indicator this is 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.990
 sure search part so by default in 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.780
 do you go see that when it works 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.730
 it launches the online game mode by 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.390
 defect that is ugly pitt have that we get 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.310
 fuck royally 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.940
 little note if you do x a 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.690
 times x 2 x the end of the manipulation 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.280
 Well, you can choose 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.780
 possibly your type of match so 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.430
 the part of the times we will do those already 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.320
 who launch themselves by default so I 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.070
 put on group leader on wii there 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.300
 I 'm doing x left arrow 3 xx and so 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.760
 actually it can work you see 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.410
 look for gray part and so is there one 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.910
 see well that there are no words slept 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.710
 who is wondering who are dying as chief of 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.350
 group I redo the manipulation I'm 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.510
 put on wii and the game does x head of 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.400
 left arrows 3 xx it's still 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.320
 failed and I do this again until 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.990
 that the manipulation is successful that 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.550
 I'm online here so I'm going 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.550
 start again he does not pass group leader 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.170
 Here I am, I am putting myself on him named chef 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.600
 I put myself on wii x pleisch left 3 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:43.160
 xx and now see no one was on 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.050
 me speed by default so that's it 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.330
 now I can actually invite 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.360
 my friends so there is the first friend here 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.750
 jolly the usi auger yields again well 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.510
 sure el malek and then georgia hers who 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.730
 will invite mayenne 53 so a hymn a 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.950
 friend to him since your friends can 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.300
 invite their own friends so auger 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.890
 this is the case he invited a friend 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.870
 to him I invited four in total 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.580
 in d6 so we go we can 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.710
 do a three against three and you 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.630
 go see so all the name of 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.290
 annie just I who invited 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.150
 will appear 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.920
 and so now we have more than 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.970
 actually wait for that 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.850
 walk so here they are 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.190
 and as you can see there is 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.250
 that my friends who are there they no longer have 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.930
 that mayenne offer 53 and there is no 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.360
 the other players from around the world 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.190
 is really quiet between us as 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.840
 if we were in a private match but we 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.450
 play online only with our friends 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.860
 So here is ideal for boosting or 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.510
 to improve our performance or 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.280
 any case play for fun but at the same 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.710
 time it's accounted for our 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.710
 statistics so both play well and 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.050
 So here we are after we will launch 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.730
 what are we going to expect you will see that 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.920
 the match lens like that you'll see 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.490
 the video in full 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.710
 this is the last player we are 6 so 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.840
 it's gone to make a match on 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.730
 the map of the three here by default and 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.830
 so we are 3 against 3 as you can 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.180
 see it we are not bothered by the 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.970
 remaining players from around the world 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.100
 So that's great so there after 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.900
 now the party was starting in no 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.190
 long time 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.810
 so the map of the three is then loaded 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.310
 good I could have cut that sequence there 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.620
 but hey it's okay so I'm going to 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.630
 editing is done it's okay and 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.250
 small handles little info when you 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.020
 do to their opponent manipulation x 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.880
 left beach 3 xx you can do 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.320
 I believe once x or 2 xx for 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.940
 to be able to choose the mode 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.950
 of play you want and not 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.660
 inevitably fly fast early if 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.550
 you want to train and 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.080
 check that it works well done three 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.090
 x times it launches an online game mode 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.700
 default and after when you master 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.170
 handling at the bunk and after 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.660
 we're going from there you can adjust 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.370
 in times once x or 2 xx for 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.480
 actually choose possibly the 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.920
 type of game match you 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.180
 wish as you wish if you 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.940
 do not want to end up in spitz mode 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.390
 I take a class so here are all the 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.800
 friends to connect here we are good 3 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.050
 against 3 always the same and now 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.060
 to these parties have played little online 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.550
 normally without problems everything is going to be 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.650
 counted and so that's it rather 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.860
 precisely a manipulation and a glitch 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.450
 super nice so that's after 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.870
 personally boxing with me I'm 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.040
 not a big and I dance players since 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.350
 a long time since I'm doing that 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.640
 glitch and judge all very little and so 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.760
 it will be seen right away because I 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.740
 take a fight right now 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.180
 from the start but after I get to me 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.010
 defend a little bit before cutting the 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.390
 video but in any case that's me what 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.190
 I wanted to show you her breasts 

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.500
 to say that gold have taken pleasure in 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.520
 play a little bit just a little 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.450
 between us for the delirium for 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.580
 decompress a little 

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.440
 finally we enjoyed playing between 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.600
 friends like that and fuck some this 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.980
 either on the face and therefore see alone 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.720
 advantage of playing online everything is 

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.250
 counted with all your friends but 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.760
 without being bothered by other players 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.760
 see you soon
