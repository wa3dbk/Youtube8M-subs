00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
all right let's do this right so to make

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.430 
all right let's do this right so to make
an<00:00:11.400> Emmy<00:00:11.550> system<00:00:12.059> first<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:13.080> get<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.230> Emmy

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
an Emmy system first you get the Emmy

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.099 
an Emmy system first you get the Emmy
controller<00:00:13.950> place<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.820> wherever<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.509> like

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
controller place it wherever you like

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.010 
controller place it wherever you like
it<00:00:16.529> doesn't<00:00:16.980> breathe<00:00:17.279> right<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.390> then<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.900> get

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
it doesn't breathe right so then you get

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.900 
it doesn't breathe right so then you get
an<00:00:19.170> Emmy<00:00:19.289> Drive<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.859> place<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.220> connect

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
an Emmy Drive and you place it connect

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.700 
an Emmy Drive and you place it connect
into<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.750> use<00:00:21.900> cables<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.439> connect

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
into it you can use cables to connect

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.349 
into it you can use cables to connect
them<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> purpose<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.150> just

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
them but just for the purpose I'm just

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.000 
them but just for the purpose I'm just
uh<00:00:24.390> well<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> put<00:00:25.830> them<00:00:25.920> next

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
uh well I'm just going to put them next

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.230 
uh well I'm just going to put them next
to<00:00:26.160> each<00:00:26.250> other<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.060> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
to each other because you can do that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.349 
to each other because you can do that
also<00:00:27.599> then<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.289> power<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.460> an<00:00:29.910> energy

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
also then to power it you get an energy

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.999 
also then to power it you get an energy
cell<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.840> then<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> cells<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.859> need

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
cell and then if you cells what you need

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.229 
cell and then if you cells what you need
all<00:00:32.250> right<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:32.640> once<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.940> put<00:00:32.969> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
all right and then once you put that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.479 
all right and then once you put that
next<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.140> Emmy<00:00:35.010> controller<00:00:35.399> should

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
next to it the Emmy controller should

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.000 
next to it the Emmy controller should
light<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> wire<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> put

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
light up and you get a wire then you put

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
light up and you get a wire then you put
the<00:00:38.100> army<00:00:38.309> terminal<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.879> Io<00:00:39.270> actually<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the army terminal on Io actually for the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
the army terminal on Io actually for the
block<00:00:40.020> look<00:00:40.230> better<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.530> number<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.579> this

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
block look better on number one but this

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.549 
block look better on number one but this
is<00:00:41.730> applied<00:00:42.090> energistics<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.350> new

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
is applied energistics to and it's new

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.440 
is applied energistics to and it's new
right<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.670> next<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:45.059> you're<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> want

right so next what you're going to want

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.369 
right so next what you're going to want
to<00:00:45.510> get<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:47.280> kme<00:00:47.730> storage<00:00:48.379> like

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to get is an one kme storage like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
your stuff inside that's pretty much how

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.890 
your stuff inside that's pretty much how
it<00:01:05.369> goes<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.790> take<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> 1k<00:01:06.360> storage<00:01:06.689> cell

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
it goes if you take the 1k storage cell

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.330 
it goes if you take the 1k storage cell
out<00:01:07.460> all<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.700> stuff<00:01:08.850> stored<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.570> mass<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.340> if

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
out all your stuff stored in mass so if

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820 
out all your stuff stored in mass so if
you<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.640> back<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.210> after<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.840> write

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
you go back into it after you write

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.760 
you go back into it after you write
won't<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.159> able<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> access<00:01:14.549> she<00:01:14.820> stops<00:01:15.119> so

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
won't be able to access she stops so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.080 
won't be able to access she stops so
that's<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:17.040> much<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:17.880> have

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that's pretty much as that you can have

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.260 
that's pretty much as that you can have
64<00:01:18.990> types<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.860> different<00:01:20.400> blocks<00:01:20.640> inside<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
64 types of different blocks inside of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
64 types of different blocks inside of
1024<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.409> them<00:01:22.590> blocks<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.930> yeah<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> one

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
1024 of them blocks so yeah with the one

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
1024 of them blocks so yeah with the one
care<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.729> smallest<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.840> doing

but if you're going on like crave you
can<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> 64<00:01:33.540> K<00:01:33.900> storage<00:01:34.890> cell<00:01:35.100> which<00:01:35.670> are

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
can get a 64 K storage cell which are

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.640 
can get a 64 K storage cell which are
much<00:01:36.030> better<00:01:36.270> much<00:01:36.930> much<00:01:37.140> better

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
much better much much better
