on<00:01:50.460> them

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:07.710 

cold<00:01:56.479> water

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.120 

okay<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:08.780> now<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.110> feel<00:02:09.410> if<00:02:09.530> we<00:02:09.560> let<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.890> eggs

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
okay so now I feel if we let the eggs

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.550 
okay so now I feel if we let the eggs
cool<00:02:10.520> down<00:02:10.790> for<00:02:11.090> about<00:02:11.150> 10<00:02:11.600> minutes<00:02:11.780> or<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.230> I

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
cool down for about 10 minutes or so I I

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.790 
cool down for about 10 minutes or so I I
rinsed<00:02:13.190> them<00:02:13.460> once<00:02:14.060> again<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.990> go<00:02:15.140> ahead<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
rinsed them once again to go ahead and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.740 
rinsed them once again to go ahead and
get<00:02:16.130> them<00:02:16.490> even<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:17.150> little<00:02:17.360> cooler<00:02:17.600> because

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
get them even a little cooler because

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.450 
get them even a little cooler because
they<00:02:17.930> were<00:02:18.050> still<00:02:18.260> warm<00:02:18.560> let's<00:02:19.130> go<00:02:19.250> ahead<00:02:19.310> and

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
they were still warm let's go ahead and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.360 
they were still warm let's go ahead and
take<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> eggshells<00:02:20.300> off<00:02:20.510> now<00:02:21.250> yeah<00:02:22.250> it's

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
take the eggshells off now yeah it's

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.400 
take the eggshells off now yeah it's
pretty<00:02:22.550> much<00:02:22.760> simple<00:02:23.000> as<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.810> would<00:02:24.320> imagine

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
pretty much simple as you would imagine

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.690 
pretty much simple as you would imagine
just<00:02:25.220> go<00:02:25.370> ahead<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.670> break<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.270> egg<00:02:27.550> take<00:02:28.550> the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
just go ahead and break the egg take the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.240 
just go ahead and break the egg take the
shells<00:02:28.970> off<00:02:35.140> see<00:02:36.140> now<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.350> eggs<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.740> lot<00:02:36.890> cooler

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
shells off see now the eggs a lot cooler

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.030 
shells off see now the eggs a lot cooler
too<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.850> easier<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:39.070> deal<00:02:40.070> with<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.710> do

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
too and easier to deal with so if you do

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.520 
too and easier to deal with so if you do
it<00:02:43.190> right<00:02:44.350> they<00:02:45.350> pretty<00:02:45.680> much<00:02:45.890> comes<00:02:46.220> off<00:02:47.530> one

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
it right they pretty much comes off one

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.990 
it right they pretty much comes off one
big<00:02:48.920> piece<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:51.770> excel<00:02:52.250> comes<00:02:52.550> off<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.940> should

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
big piece the excel comes off I should

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.670 
big piece the excel comes off I should
say<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:56.450> go<00:02:56.690> ahead<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:56.930> rinse<00:02:57.080> off<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.500> rest

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
say just go ahead and rinse off the rest

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.940 
say just go ahead and rinse off the rest
of<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.780> there's<00:02:59.780> one<00:02:59.840> egg<00:03:00.200> let<00:03:00.560> me<00:03:00.650> go<00:03:00.770> ahead

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
of it there's one egg let me go ahead

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.130 
of it there's one egg let me go ahead
and<00:03:01.040> get<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.250> other<00:03:01.400> ones<00:03:01.670> done<00:03:02.110> all<00:03:03.110> right

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
and get the other ones done all right

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.660 
and get the other ones done all right
let's<00:03:03.410> go<00:03:03.530> ahead<00:03:03.710> and<00:03:03.860> take<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.160> eggs<00:03:04.370> out<00:03:04.610> of

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
let's go ahead and take the eggs out of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.970 
let's go ahead and take the eggs out of
the<00:03:04.850> bowl<00:03:05.060> here<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:05.870> what<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.110> have<00:03:06.230> here

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
the bowl here and then what I have here

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.870 
the bowl here and then what I have here
is<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.870> egg<00:03:08.870> slicer<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:09.950> can<00:03:10.100> get<00:03:10.280> these<00:03:10.489> at

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
is a egg slicer and you can get these at

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.420 
is a egg slicer and you can get these at
I<00:03:10.910> mean<00:03:11.209> live<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.540> Lily<00:03:11.930> at<00:03:11.989> your<00:03:12.170> local<00:03:12.470> store

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
I mean live it Lily at your local store

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.449 
I mean live it Lily at your local store
and<00:03:13.880> this<00:03:14.630> really<00:03:15.760> does<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:17.090> great<00:03:17.840> job<00:03:18.459> on

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
and this really does a great job on

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.270 
and this really does a great job on
slicing<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.390> egg<00:03:20.480> see<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:21.020> just<00:03:21.230> really<00:03:22.070> it

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
slicing the egg see it's just really it

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.550 
slicing the egg see it's just really it
just<00:03:22.520> takes<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.050> whole<00:03:24.170> bunch<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.380> little

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
just takes it so a whole bunch of little

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.220 
just takes it so a whole bunch of little
thin<00:03:24.860> wires<00:03:25.130> you<00:03:25.970> take<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.330> egg<00:03:26.450> out<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.989> put

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
thin wires you take the egg out you put

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.010 
thin wires you take the egg out you put
it<00:03:27.320> back<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.650> other<00:03:27.709> way<00:03:27.860> loose<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.810> just

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
it back the other way loose and it just

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.199 
it back the other way loose and it just
locks<00:03:30.590> them<00:03:30.770> in<00:03:30.890> now<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.489> can<00:03:31.760> see<00:03:31.910> what<00:03:32.090> we

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
locks them in now you can see what we

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.990 
locks them in now you can see what we
did<00:03:32.450> when<00:03:33.200> we<00:03:33.410> cook<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:33.739> egg<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.730> way<00:03:34.850> we

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
did when we cook that egg in the way we

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.930 
did when we cook that egg in the way we
did<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.209> with<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.510> 15<00:03:36.020> minutes<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:37.220> egg<00:03:37.459> yolk

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
did it with the 15 minutes the egg yolk

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.390 
did it with the 15 minutes the egg yolk
is<00:03:38.120> all<00:03:38.330> nice<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.989> beautiful<00:03:39.410> yellow<00:03:39.709> now<00:03:40.130> if

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
is all nice and beautiful yellow now if

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.880 
is all nice and beautiful yellow now if
you<00:03:40.550> cook<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.820> too<00:03:41.000> long<00:03:41.530> what<00:03:42.530> ends<00:03:42.830> up

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
you cook it too long what ends up

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.910 
you cook it too long what ends up
happening<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:44.360> starts<00:03:44.690> turning<00:03:44.930> green<00:03:45.440> on

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
happening is it starts turning green on

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.790 
happening is it starts turning green on
the<00:03:46.160> inside<00:03:46.190> because<00:03:46.940> that's<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.560> that's<00:03:48.560> all
