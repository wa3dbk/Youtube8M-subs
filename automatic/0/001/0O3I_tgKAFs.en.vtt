00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 and I would also like to know what 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.890
 it seemed the movie of 'the 4 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.410
 fantastic 'because the movie of' the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.660
 4 fantastic 'has just come to light 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.960
 obviously the reboot that technically is 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.670
 the 30th and we have our opinion 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.880
 personal but what we also have are 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.350
 the 6 key data of the fantastic 4 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 in 6 of 6 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.340
 so check what it is that you have to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.340
 know yes or yes of this movie 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.150
 if you see this movie second reboot of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.010
 the fantastic four I leave a lot 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.630
 whatever you want a franchise that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 could continue and that in turn generate 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.739
 a lot of noise people are interested in 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 these four superheroes at the same time 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.450
 despite the critics will see this edition 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.400
 in this case we are going to review the 6 data 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.379
 most important and relevant that you have 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.200
 to know yes or yes at the time of putting you 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:04.960
 in context with this movie 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:06.940
 [Music] 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.560
 one of the most relevant data is that 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.840
 this new movie is incorporated 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.520
 within the universe of x-men but by 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.310
 what happens this basically for two 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.960
 reasons the first because they were interested 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.820
 to follow a more serious line like the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 Mutant movies unlike 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.940
 of the 'fantastic four' 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.590
 launched a decade ago and in 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.170
 second place because it is completely 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.360
 Trendy thirty maps and collaborations of 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.680
 This example style has to be just what 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.990
 that is preparing dizzy for the 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.790
 next years the idea is in a couple of 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.330
 years make a movie of 'the 4 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.590
 fantastic 'and x-men together or was it because 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.600
 after the reception of the public 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.750
 will have to see if they still continue with 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.730
 these plans 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.100
 [Music] 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.410
 marvel has long hated this movie 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.120
 and even long before seeing it and this is 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.040
 easily verifiable in a number of 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.740
 bread and be released early this 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.390
 year exactly 12 one of the pages 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.100
 we have several boxes where you see 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.500
 a Hollywood actors talking about the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.150
 movie of such a trans and with heart 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.130
 final mysteriously appeared the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.380
 trans name with each director of 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.520
 this reboot but much more mysterious is 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.010
 see that these three actors are 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.570
 totally equal to three of the four 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.940
 that are part of the new four 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.130
 fantastic ones I only need or maybe 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.750
 they issued it for being black because in a 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.520
 couple of pictures later they die in 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.830
 half of an explosion so 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.490
 definitely between fox and marvel there 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.490
 lots of love 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.209
 at the time of premiere a few days ago 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.250
 back the main actors still not 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.900
 they had seen the movie 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.700
 be true maybe it's an excuse for not 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.260
 give a personal opinion of it 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.640
 but what is true is that a 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.200
 difference from what is usually done 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.879
 new features for critics 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.920
 similar to what happened with dragon ball 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.110
 evolution surely with the purpose 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.450
 that at least for the premiere something of 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.220
 people see it without knowing it is a mess 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.049
 of epic proportions but it seems that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.770
 It did not work because very few people bought 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.780
 tickets for now 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.790
 the human torch in this movie is 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.040
 lend to make many pseudo jokes 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.810
 racists since it catches fire as 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.180
 always but not a pretty white 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.820
 with violence but a black like that is 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.530
 johnny storm that african american and how 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.390
 Many will know my girlfriend is black and with 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.160
 all love and respect there are a few 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.870
 of these jokes but I do not want to take care of myself 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.060
 of susceptible people who do not know what 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.620
 what is humor and because of this the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.390
 purists comiqueros put the cry in 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.190
 the sky but the director of this movie 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.050
 little did it matter how little it mattered to 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.260
 turn make an entertaining fight in 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.260
 finish 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.520
 actually this is the second reboot and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.440
 not the first the first movie 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.780
 thrown on these characters the title 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.410
 of the fantastic because he was to throw in the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.570
 year 1994 or something like that technically never 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.890
 it was released although there are copies giving 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.780
 turns on the black market and in the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.890
 networks there were some press releases 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.200
 while it was production and even 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.540
 youtube in elementary a number of the 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.010
 comics without with an extensive note of the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.810
 same but already in those times I 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.700
 I was surprised that I had not known more 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.020
 respect as I would like to make a point 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.700
 and apart since it is a movie that 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.230
 never officially came out but I had the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.630
 opportunity to see between my eight and 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.940
 nine years rented in vhs by me 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.950
 grandfather how did this happen I do not have the most 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.140
 minimal idea since years later I 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.760
 I learned from Stalin's own words 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.720
 that this movie was made only 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.550
 to retain the rights 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.530
 cinematic of the characters already 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.269
 that if I spent some time without doing 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.310
 no project these returned to the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.260
 hands of their original owners so 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.660
 is not less than two million dollars 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.790
 a roger corman capo del cine sees and this one 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.680
 let's say he did what he could 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.350
 totally fart but it's worth it 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.840
 see her equally 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.280
 georges tronc or as pronounced the 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.050
 name of this gentleman washes his hands 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.060
 totally and completely the director of 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.010
 this movie just the same light cell 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.050
 and the criticism started to rain when 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.180
 a very fules tweet and where basically 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.550
 says that a year ago he had a vision 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.380
 fantastic of this same thing and that there 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.350
 received wonderful reviews but that 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.540
 we will probably never see it and that 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.840
 is the reality, that is, says this is the 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.310
 reality point have george the reality 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.560
 It is very broad and depends on 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.270
 countless factors ensure that foxx 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.430
 destroyed your movie and if not 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.010
 had gotten a hand would be acclaimed by 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.870
 criticism is glued and childish 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.300
 the movie that went to the movies likewise 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.580
 he did it and if it were not like that he should 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.990
 have had the minimum self respect 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.280
 as to step aside and not 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.770
 charge a check for something that 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.020
 shame but good to the time I erase 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.810
 tweet and nothing has happened here 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.350
 summarizing being the third incarnation 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.030
 cinematographic of these four 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.250
 characters and wanting to redeem themselves from the 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.560
 humorous earlier version so 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.750
 leave me compared to those exactly 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.330
 the opposite of what they looked for a penalty 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.590
 or maybe I just wanted to achieve a little 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.030
 more with the franchise as it comes 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.340
 doing pulling reboot of almost 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.220
 anything 15 minutes after that 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.380
 the previous version saw the light the 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.320
 true from my personal opinion very 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.320
 sad everything that hollywood does in short 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.790
 i 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.360
 [Music] 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.360
 for me 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.530
 i 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.280
 today it serves 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.840
 yes
