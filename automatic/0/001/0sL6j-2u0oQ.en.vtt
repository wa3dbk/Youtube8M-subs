00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.080 
think the differences are on them I
think<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.320> very<00:01:22.409> similar<00:01:22.950> table<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.700> think

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
think it's very similar table I think

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.320 
think it's very similar table I think
you<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.330> you'll<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.810> very<00:01:25.259> very<00:01:25.799> little

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
you have you'll have very very little

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.130 
you have you'll have very very little
adjustments<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> make<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:27.750> game

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.920

start<00:01:43.880> all<00:01:43.970> over<00:01:44.000> i<00:01:44.240> think<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.570> table<00:01:44.930> is<00:01:45.350> very

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
start all over i think the table is very

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.700 
start all over i think the table is very
close<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.400> two<00:01:47.210> tornado<00:01:47.660> but<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.170> has<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> lot<00:01:48.530> of

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
close to two tornado but it has a lot of

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.590 
close to two tornado but it has a lot of
better<00:01:49.220> features<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.910> it's<00:01:50.090> easier<00:01:50.420> to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
better features to it it's easier to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.180 
better features to it it's easier to
bank<00:01:51.369> it's<00:01:53.590> maybe<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.680> little<00:01:54.770> bit<00:01:54.920> easier<00:01:55.159> to

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
bank it's maybe a little bit easier to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.530 
bank it's maybe a little bit easier to
thin<00:01:55.490> it's<00:01:55.759> going<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:55.970> keep<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.210> lot<00:01:56.360> less

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
thin it's going to keep a lot less

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.010 
thin it's going to keep a lot less
you'll<00:01:56.930> keep<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.200> lot<00:01:57.380> more<00:01:57.860> slop<00:01:58.220> out<00:01:58.690> do<00:01:59.690> not

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
you'll keep a lot more slop out do not

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.990 
you'll keep a lot more slop out do not
