00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 The complain is in the party of pereira dell 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.879
 that started in San Francisco went through 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.629
 new york and is now new home in 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.069
 Sao Paulo 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.349
 So we 'll check out this party. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:24.480
 official launch of the 1st dell brazil 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:27.689
 Let's see, we came to Brazil. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 to be able to bring it has a more 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.420
 strong not only for the Brazilian market 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.950
 but has a more Brazilian 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530
 Brazil to take to the market 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 and if these first ten 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 months have been months to clean the house 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.110
 bring the first group of customers 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.730
 set up a team a group of people who 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.489
 works together with francisco nova 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.079
 york designs here in designs there and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.610
 until now the experiment well 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.610
 interesting review 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.460
 I already think there is something that is part of 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.900
 same point of departure so much that 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.030
 They are francisco when the victory gave 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.369
 SÃ£o Paulo account that this thing of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.190
 to leave very independent of discipline 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.979
 do not have off do not have the 11 digital time 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.729
 so, when we come in a micro 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.799
 digital 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.140
 So we talk digital and very well. 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.549
 but at the same time the agency is not 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.679
 is a digital agency but said that 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.929
 effectively get out in the various 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.000
 disciplines without necessarily needing 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.789
 hold on any of them the more 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.429
 diverse is the group of people most 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.819
 different will look at insider perspectives on 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.039
 same objects the same situations as 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.860
 same events 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.569
 So when we set up an agency, 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.610
 francisco, for example, I immediately 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.159
 I brought people from all over the world and there are people. 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.979
 more than 10 countries there because I know 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.179
 that the language alone already does what you 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.250
 think different 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.629
 their experiences as a child 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.330
 adolescent in another country in another 

00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:00.580
 city change the way you see 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.259
 the world and talk about the world when you 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.020
 begins to piece together different offices 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.270
 who already have this adversity will 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.250
 increasing while depending on your 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.230
 creativity too then this is a 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.690
 very strategic movement indeed 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.840
 How does Brazil have a footprint? 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.580
 because very strong so this story 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.920
 movement for us is not just me 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.099
 it is no longer a time to come to 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.910
 Brazil to explore the market 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.280
 Brazilian as many pains and 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.980
 multinationals are meant to be a 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.480
 movement to come to Brazil for 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.730
 to work with Brazilian clients 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.120
 bring the world to Brazilian customers 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.940
 and bring Brazilian thinking part 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.840
 of the world bet on working with 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.069
 sieve 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.140
 when she was still there in Sao 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.350
 francisco 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.230
 are very very cool creative 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.110
 and this house here is kind of a 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.610
 portrait of the way they are very 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.560
 open 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:10.020
 there is a roof garden that is the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:12.959
 O unexpected period it brings an issue 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.400
 new to the Brazilian market that I 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.310
 I think it's going to be a good exchange for the fight. 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.840
 good there because there are a lot of people who think 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.430
 that there was a little more than just the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.320
 dell has to say 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.380
 I think it's wonderful because actually the 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.239
 back from Brazil, Brazil is a guy who 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.760
 already made history here was in the states 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.980
 United has won in the United States and now 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.050
 we have the privilege pj's back 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.640
 here with an agency that has three before 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.430
 in cannes this year that is bursting 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.580
 the United States in the world and here 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.580
 in Brazil 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.740
 I leave
