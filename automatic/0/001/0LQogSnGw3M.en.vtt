00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.300 

I'm<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:30.689> sure<00:00:30.960> how<00:00:31.169> well<00:00:31.499> that<00:00:33.920> comes<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.130> on

the<00:00:35.610> video<00:00:36.060> camera<00:00:36.330> here<00:00:36.720> but<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.710> screen<00:00:38.040> is

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600
