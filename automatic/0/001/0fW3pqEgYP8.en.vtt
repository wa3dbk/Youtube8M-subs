00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.449
 face warships updated to version 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.840
 031 zbt participants received a long-awaited 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.509
 answer 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.230
 American aircraft carrier and Japanese 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.939
 battleship each branch received 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.590
 missing ships but is it worth starting 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.050
 new branch of development 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.420
 this question always excites players with 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.790
 seeing additional combat units 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.830
 for this let's compare 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.040
 american and ships of the line with 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:47.370
 Japanese aircraft carriers are comparable to another 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.370
 once and yes hello everyone with you and in makeup 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.280
 Well, let's proceed to the comparison in the game 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.190
 5 criteria are presented to determine 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 ship characteristics is vitality 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.100
 anti-aircraft artillery 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.710
 maneuverability and disguise let's 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.320
 we will evaluate each ship by these conventions 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.640
 separately pleasant superiority of each 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.680
 nations will charge a victory point and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.940
 so vitality is one of the main 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.369
 ship performance 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.630
 third to seventh level inclusive 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.090
 leading the Japanese 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.369
 and it starts a lot 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.190
 level eight survivability factors 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.479
 the same but still the number of units 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.090
 Japanese strength 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.770
 slightly higher here clearly and 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 leadership country of the rising sun 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.830
 the second criterion is artillery fire 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.410
 to the top ships of level 9 and level 10 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.470
 the leader of Japan is here and the main turn 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.649
 caliber and armor-piercing damage all 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.740
 as they say on the spot as for 9 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.049
 10 levels, then there are controversial 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.380
 coefficients take the lead on 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.860
 one point america but if you go deep into 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.170
 numbers 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.899
 then the maximum damage as a landmine such 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.090
 armor-piercing shells more in Japan but 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.000
 turn rate gk better order 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.920
 Americans put an equal sign and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.920
 charged every nation on one point 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.480
 the thief and then the American designers 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.849
 tried to glory 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.500
 Apparently they were strongly strained by the Japanese 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.500
 aircraft 22 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.040
 but with agility in the overall picture in 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.400
 Americans are not very clearly leadership 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.860
 only at level 9 can you give 3 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.530
 points Japanese but for a start we compare 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.790
 tens of maneuverability coefficient 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.450
 Yamato 33 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.580
 what is lower by one unit what montana 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.040
 let's see the numbers montana has 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.440
 maximum speed of 28 knots 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.140
 one knot higher than Japanese 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.290
 fellow but here's a full turn radius 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.040
 is 910 meters and transfer time 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.410
 steering twenty four and three seconds a y and 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.410
 mate and the same parameters are 800 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.110
 meters and 25 seconds from here we conclude 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.450
 that despite the larger reversal circle 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.000
 montana is more active in turns 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.100
 and from the face rudders thereby leadership 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.100
 leaves for us 32 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.910
 masking though our dreadnoughts don't 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.910
 hide especially on the territory but 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.650
 masking factor they have here 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.450
 obviously and leadership for america 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.450
 as a total of 42 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.220
 sums up conclusions Americans 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.640
 bet on the ship 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.650
 air defense and camouflage them 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.750
 armament and significantly inferior and 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.330
 flat fellow living part 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.790
 and maneuverability at the level you decide 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.610
 what style of play do you choose what 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.860
 As for me, I focused on 10 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.860
 levels and speaking only when 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.430
 top courts here only Japan 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.200
 at least at this stage 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.510
 on this leave me all 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.960
 comments see you on the seas all 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.960
 bye Bye
