below and this week's lesson we'll be

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.200 
below and this week's lesson we'll be
taking<00:00:31.620> a<00:00:31.680> look<00:00:31.830> at<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:32.340> exercise<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.090> I've

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
taking a look at an exercise that I've

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.700 
taking a look at an exercise that I've
developed<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.960> help<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.230> become<00:00:34.379> more

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
developed to help you become more

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.259 
developed to help you become more
familiar<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.429> diminished<00:00:35.789> scale<00:00:35.999> I

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
familiar with the diminished scale I

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.930 
familiar with the diminished scale I
think<00:00:37.199> in<00:00:37.530> time<00:00:37.769> this<00:00:38.070> exercise<00:00:38.609> will

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
think in time this exercise will

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.569 
think in time this exercise will
hopefully<00:00:39.329> inspire<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.289> to<00:00:40.530> create<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
hopefully inspire you to create and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
hopefully inspire you to create and
write<00:00:41.789> your<00:00:41.940> own<00:00:42.120> interesting<00:00:42.749> diminished

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
write your own interesting diminished

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.340 
write your own interesting diminished
scale<00:00:43.620> melodies<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.899> let's<00:00:45.899> take<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.109> look<00:00:46.320> now

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
scale melodies so let's take a look now

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.380 
scale melodies so let's take a look now
at<00:00:46.530> how<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:47.190> been<00:00:47.339> practicing<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.999> pattern

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
at how I've been practicing this pattern

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.090 
at how I've been practicing this pattern
so<00:00:49.230> let's<00:00:49.379> look<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.649> first<00:00:49.859> pattern

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so let's look at the first pattern

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
so let's look at the first pattern
listed<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.609> the<00:00:50.730> page<00:00:50.940> which<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.539> based<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
listed on the page which is based on the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.590 
listed on the page which is based on the
C<00:00:52.319> half<00:00:52.649> full<00:00:52.949> diminished<00:00:53.370> scale<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
C half full diminished scale so to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360 
C half full diminished scale so to
create<00:00:54.809> our<00:00:55.079> C<00:00:55.319> half<00:00:55.559> whole<00:00:55.800> diminished<00:00:56.159> scale

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
create our C half whole diminished scale

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.619 
create our C half whole diminished scale
what<00:00:56.550> we're<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.819> do<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.089> simply<00:00:57.390> start

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
what we're going to do is simply start

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.939 
what we're going to do is simply start
on<00:00:57.719> our<00:00:57.809> starting<00:00:58.170> note<00:00:58.319> which<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.679> this<00:00:58.739> case

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
on our starting note which in this case

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.729 
on our starting note which in this case
is<00:00:59.159> C<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.390> alternate<00:01:00.870> half<00:01:01.139> steps<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.530> whole

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
is C and alternate half steps and whole

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.559 
is C and alternate half steps and whole
steps<00:01:01.769> until<00:01:02.339> we<00:01:02.460> reach<00:01:02.639> an<00:01:02.850> octave<00:01:03.179> above<00:01:03.300> our

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
steps until we reach an octave above our

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:15.830 
steps until we reach an octave above our
starting<00:01:03.899> note<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.119> symmetrical<00:01:15.719> nature

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
starting note so the symmetrical nature

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
starting note so the symmetrical nature
of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> scale<00:01:16.530> tells<00:01:16.829> us<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.399> can<00:01:17.549> get

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
of the scale tells us that we can get

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.539 
of the scale tells us that we can get
exactly<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.240> same<00:01:18.479> scale<00:01:18.840> by<00:01:19.350> ascending<00:01:20.280> or

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
exactly the same scale by ascending or

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
exactly the same scale by ascending or
descending<00:01:20.579> in<00:01:21.090> minor<00:01:21.299> thirds<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.990> choosing

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
descending in minor thirds and choosing

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.410 
descending in minor thirds and choosing
that<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> root<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.700> instead<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.149> starting

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that as the root so instead of starting

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.929 
that as the root so instead of starting
with<00:01:24.479> our<00:01:24.689> root<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.049> C<00:01:26.039> we<00:01:26.280> could<00:01:26.430> start<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.759> E

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
with our root on C we could start on E

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
with our root on C we could start on E
flat<00:01:26.969> or<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.990> minor<00:01:28.200> third<00:01:28.469> and<00:01:28.649> get<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
flat or up a minor third and get the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.249 
flat or up a minor third and get the
same<00:01:29.009> exact<00:01:29.340> scale

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.690 

using<00:01:33.259> that<00:01:33.409> same<00:01:33.619> pattern<00:01:34.100> we<00:01:34.310> do<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.520> same

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
using that same pattern we do the same

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.170 
using that same pattern we do the same
thing<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.000> g-flat<00:01:35.330> meet<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.689> same<00:01:35.869> scale

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 

and<00:01:39.900> finally<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.710> could<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.010> same<00:01:41.040> thing

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and finally we could do the same thing

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.020 
and finally we could do the same thing
on<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.710> what<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:46.920> tells<00:01:47.160> us<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.880> you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
on a so what that tells us is that you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.280 
on a so what that tells us is that you
could<00:01:48.150> take<00:01:48.300> any<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.660> these<00:01:48.750> patterns<00:01:49.050> that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
could take any of these patterns that

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
could take any of these patterns that
I've<00:01:49.410> written<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.010> transpose<00:01:50.820> them<00:01:50.850> up

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I've written out and transpose them up

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.970 
I've written out and transpose them up
or<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.660> in<00:01:51.840> minor<00:01:52.020> thirds<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.650> get<00:01:52.830> exactly

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
or down in minor thirds and get exactly

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.240 
or down in minor thirds and get exactly
the<00:01:53.490> same<00:01:53.520> notes<00:01:54.650> now<00:01:55.650> I've<00:01:55.800> only<00:01:56.040> written

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the same notes now I've only written

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.220 
the same notes now I've only written
these<00:01:56.430> patterns<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:56.940> in<00:01:57.150> three<00:01:57.600> keys<00:01:57.870> so

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
these patterns out in three keys so

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.510 
these patterns out in three keys so
you're<00:01:58.470> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.650> need<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> utilize<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you're going to need to utilize this

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.250 
you're going to need to utilize this
concept<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.150> transposition<00:02:00.510> if<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.020> want<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
concept of transposition if you want to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.460 
concept of transposition if you want to
play<00:02:01.410> this<00:02:01.560> pattern<00:02:01.770> through<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:02.190> 12<00:02:02.490> keys<00:02:03.470> so

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
play this pattern through all 12 keys so

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.110 
play this pattern through all 12 keys so
here's<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.800> first<00:02:04.950> pattern<00:02:05.370> based<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.910> C

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
here's the first pattern based on the C

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.240 
here's the first pattern based on the C
half<00:02:06.360> whole<00:02:06.600> diminished<00:02:06.990> scale<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.410> 80<00:02:08.040> beats

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
half whole diminished scale at 80 beats

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:27.970 
half whole diminished scale at 80 beats
per<00:02:08.369> minute

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:53.470 

you

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.730 

here's<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.630> same<00:02:54.840> pattern<00:02:55.260> at<00:02:55.440> twice<00:02:55.710> the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
here's the same pattern at twice the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:39.000 
here's the same pattern at twice the
tempo

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.069
