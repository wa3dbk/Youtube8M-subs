 real society and sevilla 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.380
 on the other hand he was entertained 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.810
 in the west area of ​​the amagá river 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.010
 since this way it would only be possible without doubt the ere 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.190
 the Slovak quietness is high another program that expected to collect 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.270
 In between 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.490
 when we try 3 every eight days to be done with us 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.800
 and ride a bicycle 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.000
 today for example 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.160
 Then Carlos de las Justas explained to everyone that this fact 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.760
 hn time is not like that 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.110
 as he and his friends 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.160
 because as Carlos for example 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.320
 by the way that the beginners who speaks with those bicycle tells you 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.060
 like many of the faithful 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.450
 where can I and done or not so secret that it's good 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.460
 cousin of messi we went back to this municipality of the metropolitan area cris 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.210
 Caldas 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.210
 the low then here we have to day 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.230
 we love right 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.280
 for the valeria 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.800
 in its nice place 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.530
 they are a trochita ascended a path is paot the digit 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.700
 gave fires of three decades a certain point with him we can rule out nothing of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.610
 hit us 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.970
 there are things to start is that here I am starting 2 3 times the hyena atlas 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.210
 team anywhere before we had actually broken yakarta trails 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.680
 We have already run affection for the cops 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 asked baa to the old stations of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.820
 how are we social beings 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.289
 we think with bush plans the other massive and that is for beginners 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.150
 pack it simple relaxed the tightrope is mockus soban neighbors us 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.249
 theaters up here 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:17.749
 we started again rag with two hands 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.749
 welcome everyone 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.309
 basically this way before where we are as you already said that is an area 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.029
 where people are busy on bicycles 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:02.509
 It is very easy and simple 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:04.019
 but before continuing 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 I think to tell you the wedding thing that the public bikes for example the 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.099
 another one I have it in clear 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.079
 so 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.309
 god loreto for example with Mauricio Solís the director of the area 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:16.279
 metropolitan 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.199
 he told us something very bacano 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.309
 they wanted it in public functions the culture that models vain 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:26.099
 league 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.399
 after starting 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.729
 small to reach the big coast our readers 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.229
 we are going to start with some origins and destinations that are very marked was 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.039
 what the subway contribution 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.520
 the idea is that people believe 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.129
 well of that station 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.599
 there is an origin, amount and destination 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.509
 who does not have a clear position of the moment 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:48.409
 together we can the foals to make an intervention with public bicycles 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.109
 in the project 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.239
 especially in places where we already have soccer 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.349
 for example the ctm 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.799
 close to the stadium 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.490
 national category there are sectors that today the opposite end 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.929
 hard that we have from the target audience 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.670
 and that we know we can start and that's where we're going to deliver 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.410
 as well as others who are already then you will pass what you pass your hand by 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.150
 example and it is managed to renew and take it as much a comment on this 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.659
 summit to expose them to it as green corridors of bikeways 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.999
 the tie put the city the one of the public bicycles 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.999
 in the way that people were for that reason facing these comments 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:26.899
 to take the bicycle to be directed by all the total figure to detective agmer has been 

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.249
 could cry 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.849
 clearly there is a directive that is important in many big of the 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.530
 competition in which the g20 the subway does not serve him 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.350
 so having that connection those efforts to help serve but I think 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.689
 what is the culture itself 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.309
 as well as uses next year 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.680
 there cultural part that is to the cyclists 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.720
 art and culture to pedestrians that is a bad use of the bike paths 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.190
 also the coupon greets people who are in vehicle or dpa 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.520
 the light the people canada deprived him of the turret of pumping 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520
 but that can not be from one day to the next you can not miss it 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.129
 but everything looks like an attack full of speed 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.880
 and that is that we are ready for the others after delivering it little by little 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.020
 and that's why what the conditions are 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.499
 was in the group stretch of how to survive 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:16.809
 not only other matters 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.809
 people who are out riding bicycles at night 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.710
 know them the bicycle 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.050
 and I think that's part 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.050
 preferential that must rethink 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.449
 what we know then so that a project 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.669
 'my grief' project like this that many times in the world is great 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.460
 here the blue team 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.840
 photo as a municipal method we have a commitment to start the project 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.930
 dehar the initial strength 0 these moments easier with citizens of the 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.830
 clientele that sends this type of services 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.220
 but independent of the administrator must independent of the mayor of tremp 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.680
 the governor of the director of the metropolitan area 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.330
 what are these positions 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.379
 if the pfp in a key clamor the company organized 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.840
 if people know and also use these services obviously teeth 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.319
 ruler will give you 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.319
 the quality of the government program and that's going to be very important 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:36.580
 when one 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.779
 is coming for the first time 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:40.939
 and basically what you have to do is that there 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:42.889
 sarandón travel 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.020
 of medina caldas certain road 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.139
 I hope you skip a warm-up because it says of relaxed spaces 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.639
 ihobe chico is a bit of rhythm because it is already another type of terrain 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:58.219
 straka by two roads where those pantanito 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.830
 and the island 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.039
 according to the data that was for those 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:04.830
 it's totally different 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.259
 but when we see you see them 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.169
 under one of us 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:11.889
 and above Basque seeing what it is 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.539
 more strength and technique because it has already started to stop road scam 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:18.550
 they do not know followed 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.999
 I keep doing that 

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:24.110
 twice a week then 3 0 to 1 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.240
 and in calixto 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.240
 to begin has been submerged to add eight other different 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.219
 bears photos 

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.869
 stronger than I can say anything 

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:37.439
 the famous 

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:40.139
 to well moon percent 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:41.400
 next to see me for example
