00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.830
 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.650
 I bring you a little more rumors 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.230
 about iphone 6 and now they do not arrive 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.590
 the rumors that tell us that since 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.800
 Apple seems to be quite safe 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.150
 that the iPhone 6 will be a success in 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.360
 sales and that's why they have ordered 68 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.300
 millions of units before it 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.910
 produce the launch in the month of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.520
 September or at least that's what 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.060
 reflect the latest published reports 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.210
 by some Chinese media but good at 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.160
 which makes sure that Apple expects a 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.330
 great demand for your new smartphone 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.550
 they also emphasize that it would not be 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:56.380
 only from a virtual demand or 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.329
 fancy but this demand is 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.820
 completely real by the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.280
 users and I have to be honest there I 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.350
 I include I already want to buy 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.479
 have in my hands the iPhone 6 but 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.979
 good if the rumors that we could 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.979
 see hear 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.290
 Well, if they are true, we would be 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.670
 talking about we'll see two models of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.150
 iphone 6 the 4.7 inch and the 5.5 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.640
 inches with the latter would enter the 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.150
 so-called fab let's market 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.700
 combination of tablet and phone but 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.790
 they would be doing it to compete 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.370
 directly with its most powerful rival in 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.060
 this tablet market that would be the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.360
 galaxy know 3 but good the publication 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.820
 Taiwanese businessweek informs you that 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.720
 initial shipments of iphone 6 from 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.810
 apple would be between 60 and 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.640
 the 80 million units 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.490
 Specifically, they estimate that the first batch 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.130
 of the iPhone 6 will be a little over 68 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.700
 millions of units twice as many 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.240
 devices lost in 2012 for the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.880
 launch of the iphone 5 although the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.180
 calculations published in this report do not 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.790
 he 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.439
 alludes to that if it were just 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.379
 of the 4.7-inch model or also 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:29.180
 will include the 5.5-inch model the 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.670
 iPhone 6 would become the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.340
 device with the largest roll in 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.560
 the history of the cupertino company 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.389
 the product the mass production of 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.599
 iphone 6 can be seen at the end of this 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:46.909
 month or at the beginning of the month of August and 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.840
 we are in the end we are finishing the month 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.340
 if they are not met in a few days 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.680
 we would be talking about that in the month of 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.349
 August at the beginning of August already 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.560
 would be the company foxconn to everything that 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.959
 It's starting to make the iPhone 6 and 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.239
 good the last rumors that appeared in 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.010
 the network point to apple could 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.200
 order the start of production in 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.260
 mass of iphone 6 late or oa 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.299
 beginning of july august at 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.760
 look like I have both a bus and 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.470
 presidents of foxconn and pegatron 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.760
 respectively they will have received a 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.700
 notice from the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.390
 with the production plan to follow for 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.540
 the new iPhone 6 smartphone and good for 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.069
 last from the page so under the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.920
 first name 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.950
 before game a well-known page 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.519
 in the gamer world of usa 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.370
 good note that tim cook has given 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.060
 understand on numerous occasions that the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.900
 company prepares new and incredible 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.000
 this year's products its say in the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.120
 page that in the last interview that 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.290
 did in the USA it could be seen that when 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.389
 he alluded to these new and 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.169
 amazing products that says tim 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:13.680
 Cook stretched out his hands as if he had 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:17.310
 a larger iphone made signs or 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.160
 I tried to draw in the air a 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.669
 television a large picture a screen 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.000
 and finally when they told him what 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.580
 I thought about sports 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.340
 he just grabbed his watch and said that 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.460
 it was the future that we were all 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.830

 I have not seen any video 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.620
 personally about that 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.080
 but well, it does not hurt to ask 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.090
 a little bit of illusion and try to dream 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.730
