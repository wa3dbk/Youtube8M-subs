00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.230
 hello I am patricia I am 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.910
 cardboard animator and today 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.679
 I will present the realization 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
 a hexagonal pencil pot 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.639
 to make this pencil pot we 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.810
 will need thick gray cardboard 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:25.710
 2.5 of a few cards net of cards 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.279
 bull 250 from a compass 6 to the blackest of the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.460
 Kraft roll of vinyl glue 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.050
 de lacolle angela a faux paper and a 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.030
 dressing paper 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.879
 the body weight of the pencil comprises 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 a hexagonal base and a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.170
 tape of cartons we're going to six 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.300
 and at half height to be able to realize the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.360
 turn of the pot so we have a terminal of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.160
 gray cardboard 10 cm high by 30 cm 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.770
 long that we're compartmentalized 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.329
 every 5 cm for the weight basis 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.109
 let's create we're going to make a hexagon 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.410
 radius 5 cm and for the base of the pot 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.730
 pencils a hexagon of radius 6 cm for 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.710
 to realize the hexagon 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.930
 so I used a compass I traced 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.920
 a circle 5 cm in radius and on the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.150
 perimeter of the circle I made six 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.060
 benchmarks all over the perimeter that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:29.180
 corresponds to the size of the radius ccir 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 father I joined them with a ruler 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.740
 to get a hexagon 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.470
 so here is a hexagon of radius 5 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.880
 traced and here is the same 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.479
 already cut 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.000
 I cut the band 30 by 10 cm and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.000
 every 500th I carried out a 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.810
 mid- cut incision with the cutter 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.149
 like this I repeated the operation 5 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.939
 time and I get a shape that folds 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.500
 we are going to close this tape using 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.899
 of a band of kraft that is attached to 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.659
 inside I'm going to stick but from 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.380
 surface with the vinyl glue and I 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:14.209
 I will be able to close my 30 cm band 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:20.120
 then we will drop a net of 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:23.599
 angela glue on the fields of 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.270
 the hexagon of 5 cm and this hexagon I 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:35.840
 m going to the very bottom of the box 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:38.090
 from our earlier ads so here I have 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.980
 mounted my pencil pot I'll be able to 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.830
 press this assembly using strips 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.930
 of kraft I will start by sticking 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.620
 a krav terminal on the periphery of my 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.620
 mounting 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.890
 this is it and this kraft game the flap on the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.890
 below 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.920
 I will continue strengthening each 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.730
 art is using a kraft bomb from 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.730
 10 cm 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.200
 here is the editing of the pencil pot is 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.819
 completed we will now be able to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.290
 proceed with his dressing we will 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.330
 start from the outside 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.670
 I prepared a little band of three 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.380
 centimeters wide of imitation which is going 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.770
 dress up the top field of my pot to 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.770
 pencils 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.810
 I cut at the level of each stop 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:16.989
 to pay back inside I 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.989
 cut the small tab of the boot 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.229
 and I proceed by working on one side 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.229
 on two 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.190
 here I am going to end with the three 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.240
 last side by removing a small 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.240
 tongue of books 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.270
 this is the upper field of my weight 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.730
 pencil and dressed we will 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.630
 now to tickets the outer face to 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.630
 using a bull card
