00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.760
 [Music] 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.540
 my foundation and eyebrows 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.730
 I have already done and start 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.170
 directly with the clamp base this stretcher 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 I'm on the whole song and on 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.220
 distribute it evenly with one 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.439
 I now wear one eyeshadow brush 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.980
 white eye shadow used on this 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.140
 the matte white now come on the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 movable lid in the eye inner and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.670
 even under the eyebrows here dazzle 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.649
 I always turn off the shade slightly 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.110
 as for the eyelid but if I am now 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.149
 Use this cool brown tone for it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.530
 I'm a blender I puzzle first 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.300
 The color is easy in the eyelet fold 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.140
 apply and then neatly afterwards 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.140
 fade 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.750
 [Music] 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.710
 with the eyeshadow brush and the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.199
 orange from the ultra net v1 range of 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.890
 sleep I bring some color in now 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.930
 play 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.089
 this pact and now comes into the eyes 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.369
 inner and for the outer third of the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.930
 eye through the white before 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.640
 applied has the color 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.960
 much stronger with a blending 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.280
 I now leave the transitions 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.900
 continue to be 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.510
 [Music] 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.520
 the black eyeliner is now in the 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.110
 outer third of the eye on to the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.760
 movable lid is not too much space and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.440
 to steal color as well 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.630
 I let the eyeliner out to the outside 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.630
 Expose your enemy to eyebrows 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.689
 [Music] 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.159

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.060

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.340

 lips I have a nice orange tone 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.520
 selected over that I then still 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.350

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.729
 I only wear with a contours brush 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.350
 Once again, the orange we targeted 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.870

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.000
 on the cheeks on that I do 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.970
 naturally only very slightly by not after 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.470
 to look like a clown and then allowed 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.530
 Of course, the false eyelashes are not 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.070
 are missing completely around the whole look 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.840

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.660
 I just have this for this 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.970
 crossed eyelashes halved and take 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.300
 These then only for the outer part of the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.300
 eyes 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.080

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.810

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.430

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.720

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.450

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.440
