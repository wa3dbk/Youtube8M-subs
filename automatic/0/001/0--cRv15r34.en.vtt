00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:08.080
 Hello today, March 24, 2014 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.430
 we are on the track 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.210
 Ekaterinburg-Tyumen went to school 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.590
 Here we decided to stop to wash the car 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.690
 means the company rush betray 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.120
 international eco sheen is to be 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.320
 it was better to do my washing machine 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.890
 for without water here we have a car here 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.710
 in such a dirty way and we will start 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.970
 quietly whisk look at the top 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.739
 we have up to 3 not just spraying the whole 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.520
 eco sheen car and need to give 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.989
 stand 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:52.550
 the solution is a warm time of day 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.520
 it's 20 seconds cold to minus 20 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.770
 degrees you can use this kashin 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.410
 cold season can 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 40 seconds to soak it all 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.810
 It took that is necessary to become dirt 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.810
 so soft everything is sprayed 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.520
 need to give time to collapses 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.520
 both enveloping wolf coffee happened 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:29.520
 and then we'll all be soft rag it 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.520
 all washed away so now you show 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.710
 a little bit the world of Tikun 2025 stood by us 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.990
 even more probably start with a rag 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.439
 everything happened for a minute 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.899
 quality sprinkled 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.789
 a place that we are starting now 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.789
 with a cloth just wipe it all 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.140
 the dirt becomes soft soft as fat 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.420
 that is, it dissolves dissolves on 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.150
 clans start smearing a few 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.180
 what has been heard more now here 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.690
 she just filmed us on a rag 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690
 remains 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.550
 rags bud just throw away we all 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.800
 comfortably here is a little rags it 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.470
 lose weight so you can throw it away 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.250
 don't take wash anything just made up 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.250
 our wisdom 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.790
 no effort we just apply 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:58.410
 wipe nothing three nothing nothing 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.410
 smooth as butter, I would even call 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.520
 take a cleaner you see the operation 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.110
 we add nothing more 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.110
 sprinkle just wipe 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.239
 practically already the word atoms can be 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:55.060
 compare the door which is not processed 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:58.959
 what is now this dry scarecrow car wash 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:10.659
 at any time the other main thing was 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:15.879
 rag rub four minutes 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:20.769
 us a quarter of the car already clean did not read 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:24.849
 Of course less than 90 is equal to yourself you are watching 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:33.759
 how long does it go pretty 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:37.750
 it's just that the effect comes after 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.910
 the fact that now in force we are here for how 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.280
 say sanded it would be like 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.760
 was hot waxed machine then 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:52.110
 have the machine be protected protected from 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.110
 to tar 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.810
 if he gets he won't 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.990
 stay it will just wash off when 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.350
 next wash and everything is also now 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.320
 there will be a spring of the fallen and the buds will fly and 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.330
 it's usually yellow on the cars 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.790
 spots especially such as we have white 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.380
 car these spots are immediately visible and if 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.110
 the car will be processed like this 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.600
 means as soon as the tires that these five he 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.590
 just will not they will leave together 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.740
 so that the memory during the next washing machine 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.250
 there's so here now 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.670
 goes blind who's such a rub or 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.940
 the process is to be clean smooth 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.940
 surface 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:18.260
 also porridge can be processed inside 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.460
 plastic glass machines rubbed both 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.980
 sides of the mirror 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.220
 in the same way it can be done at home 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:29.330
 at home you do not rub the glass in the window wash 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:32.900
 and during the summer will not stick to 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.410
 him the dust doll will be window clean always 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:40.060
 dusting the house 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.060
 furniture and also 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.220
 serve 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.630
 they will also have less dust 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.630
 and on our furniture 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:08.160
 now we have 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.160
 the last grinding passed 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:17.930
 layer and now the car looks like this 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:22.490
 it became like a wing after 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:28.160
 remarkably gorgeous but kind of expensive 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.160
