 hello how about youtube friends josh 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.959
 smith and as always 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:06.640
 another new special video good as the 

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:08.830
 theme should be 10 tips you can take 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.180
 with your bearded dragon to what I 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.490
 I mean, this is going to be 10 tips 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.350
 correct of the verbs grow and be 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.570
 healthy completely as they should be 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.740
 so that they have a perfect change 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.720
 that last all the years of life that 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.760
 They must last their tips are very basic 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.830
 and I recommend it follow the video well and 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.570
 you know that anything down here 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.310
 I leave my facebook before anything else 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.070
 like to be aware when 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.869
 upload videos tip number one I think 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.940
 that is the couple never having to 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.859
 a male and another male in the minute radio 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.239
 since they get to fight they can not 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.239
 get to kill but yes to give oneself 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.530
 they bring us cases one of a few bites like this 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.050
 that you have to be very careful with that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.350
 always have the male and female couple 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.120
 male and female so they do not get to see 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.549
 conflicts in any case if they reach 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.249
 fight do not worry is normal but 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.690
 yes try to have the couple 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.280
 I think another more important tip 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.379
 it can be him 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.780
 not to manipulate the bearded dragons 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.460
 a lot to what I mean with this that if 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.259
 you carry in your work school what 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.880
 that is not to remove it more than if it is why 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.790
 you want to see you want to see if you're healthy 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.040
 but yes yes yes yes you can try to leave it 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.840
 there and not express it do not take it out a lot 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.700
 to stir the few moments that the arcs 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.470
 they are only to get it out in the sun and 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.170
 when it's something that floors me 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.880
 but I want to take us yes yes yes no 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.190
 they manipulate much better so they do not get stressed 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.659
 in me and if they avoid problems 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.759
 if you can manipulate them but you have to 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.070
 be very careful with that since the 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.200
 stress can get you to leave 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.450
 to eat that they stop eating vegetables 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.280
 crickets that stop drinking water that 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.070
 pass the hiding place you have to have 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.170
 be very careful with that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.810
 the tip number I think it's been 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.870
 never leave your bearded dragon 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.830
 supervision since they can reach 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.630
 escaping to me has happened to me several times 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.180
 that escapes me because I am very 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 confident for example today I slept with my 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.990
 bearded dragons as well as how it sounds 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.970
 I slept with them 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.220
 the Indians my hands on my chest I 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.590
 he is already asleep when he woke up in 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.150
 Mass awoke above the soul does not pass 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.520
 nothing but they can not do that has to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.900
 have supervision to forces 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.280
 and any wherever 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.410
 leave them in bed if they reach 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.000
 jump and they are problems only always 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.880
 have supervision in that seventh number 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.170
 3 the tip number 4 and I think it would come 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.970
 being the vegetables and the fruits for me 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.440
 it is not a food that many like 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.510
 the dragons more than when they are very 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.420
 adults start to like them but when 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.390
 they are young they almost do not like it very weird 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.460
 from the hotel or accept I suggest you 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.740
 try to give them at least twice per 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.050
 week if you do not like to give it to you with the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.180
 hand to see if you want it or show it to you 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.280
 minimum but leave are your terrarium or 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.600
 stay hobby since the dragons 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.400
 bearded good for many those 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.260
 vitamins other than calcium bread 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.630
 vitamins that are the ones that have those 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.520
 fruits and vegetables that's the kind 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.240
 number 4 I recommend it a lot to put 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.240
 vegetables always 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.360
 number five and one of the most basic 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.090
 is to always have the focus vb which is the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.460
 baby focus that little you can say that 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.950
 imitate or substitute the rays of where they are 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.270
 them so what they do is they 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.980
 opens the appetite the dragons if not 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.660
 they have that focus most likely is that 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.880
 do not commas or dragon always 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.670
 It is advisable to buy it before purchasing 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.440
 Your animal I think is very important 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.200
 and very basic before having your reptiles 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.640
 for those who deal with almost the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.360
 Most reptiles are going to occupy one 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.370
 but your baby is up and down I think it 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.140
 calls the other good but the point is that 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.910
 Yes baby reptiles occupying the 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.780
 I recommend always from acquiring your 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.750
 pet 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.209
 type number 6 and one of those that I most 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.590
 like and the ones that satisfy me most is 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.380
 always take a while my dragons 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.650
 bearded to my patio that they hit the sun 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.569
 live and it is the most beautiful thing 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.760
 there may be and here they had bearded people 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.910
 is going to clarify it gets more active since 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.860
 the sun how hot they love me and me 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.720
 then the truth very happy when the 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.100
 Live agreement or that you are staying 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.100
 seeing this other pet 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.800
 when he does that when that when he is 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.920
 when the sun can make the 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.019
 beautiful color change they change all the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.209
 it's really nice if you always 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.870
 I will recommend and some of the tips more 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.820
 important and numerous know number 7 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.979
 well this number 7 for me always not 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.840
 be a good benito when they just finished 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.600
 to play their skin or when they move to a 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.610
 good bath with lukewarm water the best for 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.930
 that they would see them dead fall here 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.430
 have a little skin if they realize 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.710
 of the tail because it was moving 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.880
 with a bath of warm water elsa then to 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.070
 barbour ball point 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.150
 you have to have a perfect molt too 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.370
 It is very good I recommend it 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.890
 Tip No. 8 also recommend 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.060
 a lot since it helped me a lot so that 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.430
 my pride dragons are not 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.980
 aggressive and become more more meek 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.840
 will follow the word but then in this 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.620
 time can teach them how as 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.850
 I know what it would be like this guy 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.650
 I recommend to feed them with the 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.720
 hand as well as listen if you have a 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.300
 glow worm have what you have to 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.250
 hand a cockroach, not your hand 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.860
 that he approaches so you go to part goes to 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.630
 gain confidence and somehow 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.460
 will remove the aggressive if they reach 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.230
 being aggressive is going to be more 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.720
 mansitos are going to have more confidence in you 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.070
 is what we want then what 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.420
 I will recommend a lot as with the 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.700
 vegetables and with the fruits put them in 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.500
 your hands and if he approaches the 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.790
 grain they have is shy these canines 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.350
 that is to say that I release the crickets or 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.450
 I have them my hands are thrown because 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.090
 They know I'm not going to hurt them, it 's a 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.720
 something very very true and has helped me 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.910
 quite 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.870
 the tip number 9 I think it would come 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.760
 being always minimum to take it out 15 minutes 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.040
 to your dragon 'and check how it is 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.840
 physically if your dragon 'you see it very 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.690
 exhausted if you aragon you see it very very 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.520
 active and it will last you see it very very weird 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.560
 so check it do not think you can 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.660
 Take about ten minutes to check it on feet 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.080
 to head if you do not have dead skin a 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.240
 little fun whatever it is to be at 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.340
 pending the name in a few words 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.410
 if you see it thinner if you see it fatter 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.140
 I always try to check my 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.670
 bearded dragon to see to see if it 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.800
 something is missing if it is getting very cold 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.130
 if it is very hot if it is 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.510
 stressed out little by little and timba 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.160
 circulation these dragons and you will know 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.470
 how is it going to change physically or 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.130
 emotionally 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.130
 canijo 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.880
 Tip number 10 and the most important 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.010
 everything is 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.960
 he will never leave his reptiles abandoned 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.590
 never forget about them in this case 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.350
 hydronor bush always see where they 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.210
 you can help more if you have the 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.200
 money to buy a radio court 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.550
 bigger or another focus because always 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.160
 support them in some way with the best 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.320
 in this case it will have the terrarium 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.430
 super clean the water every will change all 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.410
 the days 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.570
 try that the dragons have what 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.050
 better so to speak give you the best 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.960
 food if you can 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.360
 I do not know as the most important thing when 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.360
 you have fertile is not it is not so much 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.360
 because they are going away because that 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:15.210
 the most important thing is to pay attention 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.099
 never miss anything neither food nor 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.050
 water the truth always takes care of your 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:22.139
 reptiles is something so wonderful to have 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.819
 bearded dragons do not know how it is 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:25.889
 a happiness not all have like that 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:28.020
 let's say a bearded dragon nor can 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.119
 tell the experience of having one myself 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.999
 I have several ball pythons that brown elbow 

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:34.409
 and the super super happy hug for 

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:36.389
 have this 

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:37.860
 for having this this hobby not to have 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.110
 reptiles the truth is something that 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.749
 love and will never stop doing it 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:46.249

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:49.589

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:52.289

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:54.149

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:56.389

00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:56.389
