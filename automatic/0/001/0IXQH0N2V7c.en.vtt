Yuan Zai: Mama, come here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Yuan Zai: Mama, come here, hurry up!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yuan Zai: I love Mama!!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yuan Zai: I really love Mama

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.460
Mama, in the African Area is a baby lemur

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.500
Take me to see the baby

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.620
Ok, let's go

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.720
Mama, wait for me.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.620
Waiiit!!

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.000
Come a little closer

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.800
Even closer

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you see the baby?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
These ring-tailed lemur twins were born on May 1st

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.660
The twin's mama is Xu Xiao Liu 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.000
Mother's day this year has been especially exhausting for Xu Xiao Liu

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.500
No matter what, or go anywhere

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.720
The twins hold on to mama's chest tightly

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.000
Truly a bittersweet burden

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.820
According to individual Mama Lemurs

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.500
the zookeeper customized postnatal care programs.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.900
Still planning that big meal after the one month quarantine

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.760
In addition to adding calcium powder to meals

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.720
The zookeeper prepared ten whole nourishing meals

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.660
There's lettuce, spinach, Chinese broccoli, tomatoes, guava, papayas

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.000
Apples, whole wheat bread, monkey feed, bananas, gherkins, and soft sweet potatoes

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
All for Mama Lemur so she can receive a well-balanced diet

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.960
For the first 2 weeks since the birth of the twins

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.340
Mama spent double the energy to take care of them

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.980
And even devotes strength to chase away imposing neighbors

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The zookeeper saw the issue,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.700
And immediately tore the frame down

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.960
Relieving Mama's anxiety

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
To protect the twins

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Mama Lemur used to be good at leaping

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Without thinking of where to go

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But now has to plan her route

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Giving up the fastest, direct route,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Picking the steadiest route instead

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.760
She use her hands to protect the babies when moving 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.780
Let's meet another mom and her baby

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.000
Mama's name is Huan Zhen

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.840
This is her fifth baby

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.000
6 weeks old baby can already climb onto Mama's back

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.340
And learning to eat boiled sweet potatoes, bananas, and other foods

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.220
The lemur babies truly are cute and lively

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.320
Let's all cheer for Mama and her babies!
