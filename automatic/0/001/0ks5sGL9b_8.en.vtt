00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
and then I'll take some type of

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.920 
and then I'll take some type of
extension<00:01:36.040> for<00:01:36.490> 12<00:01:36.790> cabinet<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:37.450> do<00:01:37.780> the

stereo track that way so I'm getting the
kind<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.000> same<00:01:40.270> circuitry<00:01:41.140> from<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.470> amp

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650

all<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.380> way<00:01:47.560> up<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:48.040> use<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.550> live<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:49.030> way

all the way up and use it live this way

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.240 
all the way up and use it live this way
because<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.600> really<00:01:49.930> expands<00:01:50.680> more<00:01:51.009> than<00:01:51.130> what

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.620 
tone cut by bringing in the tone cut it
kind<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.470> deletes<00:04:30.890> some<00:04:31.220> high-end<00:04:31.700> trouble<00:04:32.270> so

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
kind of deletes some high-end trouble so

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.390 
kind of deletes some high-end trouble so
between<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.080> channel<00:04:33.650> treble<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.160> tone

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
between that channel treble and the tone

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.730 
between that channel treble and the tone
cut<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.790> cutting<00:04:35.420> out<00:04:35.540> any<00:04:35.690> shrill<00:04:36.170> tones<00:04:36.500> that

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
cut of cutting out any shrill tones that

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.830 
cut of cutting out any shrill tones that
might<00:04:36.920> come<00:04:37.160> out<00:04:37.310> at<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.520> real<00:04:37.730> loud<00:04:37.910> volume<00:04:38.210> the

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
might come out at a real loud volume the

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.440 
might come out at a real loud volume the
trick<00:04:39.170> is<00:04:39.380> is<00:04:39.620> cranking<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.820> master<00:04:41.270> volume

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
trick is is cranking the master volume

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.660 
trick is is cranking the master volume
so<00:04:41.840> I'm<00:04:41.930> getting<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.290> 2<00:04:42.500> power<00:04:42.860> section<00:04:43.400> to

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
so I'm getting the 2 power section to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.760 
so I'm getting the 2 power section to
really<00:04:43.940> work<00:04:44.150> getting<00:04:44.660> clean<00:04:45.110> powerful

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
really work getting clean powerful

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.610 
really work getting clean powerful
Distortion<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:47.030> here's<00:04:47.630> an<00:04:47.810> example<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.560> that

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
Distortion so here's an example of that

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.890 
Distortion so here's an example of that
it's<00:04:48.920> going<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.070> be<00:04:49.190> very<00:04:49.310> percussive<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.240> a

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
it's going to be very percussive and a

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.670 
it's going to be very percussive and a
very<00:04:51.110> warm

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
very warm

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.070 
very warm
percussive<00:04:52.520> crunch<00:04:52.970> which<00:04:53.240> Vox<00:04:53.600> is<00:04:53.750> also

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
percussive crunch which Vox is also

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.790 
percussive crunch which Vox is also
known<00:04:54.260> for

input amp it's 2 channels there's the

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.500 
input amp it's 2 channels there's the
normal<00:05:33.320> channel<00:05:33.710> that<00:05:34.280> has<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:35.060> normal

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
normal channel that has the normal

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.810 
normal channel that has the normal
volume<00:05:36.200> and<00:05:36.410> goes<00:05:37.010> right<00:05:37.190> to<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.430> master

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.280 
volume and goes right to the master
section<00:05:38.090> which<00:05:38.390> is<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.720> tone<00:05:38.900> cut<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.200> the

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.750 
volume it also passes through the reverb
and<00:05:41.660> tremolo<00:05:41.810> circuits<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:43.220> top<00:05:43.490> boost

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
and tremolo circuits the top boost

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.180 
and tremolo circuits the top boost
channel<00:05:44.180> has<00:05:44.810> 2<00:05:45.110> inputs<00:05:45.320> so<00:05:45.590> there's<00:05:45.770> 2<00:05:45.890> inputs

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
channel has 2 inputs so there's 2 inputs

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.800 
channel has 2 inputs so there's 2 inputs
for<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.340> normal<00:05:46.730> and<00:05:46.880> 2<00:05:47.030> inputs<00:05:47.360> for<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.540> top

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
for the normal and 2 inputs for the top

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.110 
for the normal and 2 inputs for the top
boost<00:05:48.080> however<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.830> top<00:05:49.010> boost<00:05:49.370> is<00:05:49.520> a<00:05:49.790> bit

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
boost however the top boost is a bit

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.720 
boost however the top boost is a bit
different<00:05:50.330> circuit<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.680> also<00:05:51.830> features<00:05:52.430> a

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
different circuit and it also features a

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.270 
different circuit and it also features a
treble<00:05:53.360> and<00:05:53.420> bass<00:05:53.600> EQ<00:05:54.200> by<00:05:54.740> jumping<00:05:55.190> the

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
treble and bass EQ by jumping the

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.220 
treble and bass EQ by jumping the
channels<00:05:55.730> I'm<00:05:55.880> going<00:05:56.180> to<00:05:56.240> plug<00:05:56.480> into<00:05:56.750> the

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
channels I'm going to plug into the

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.800 
channels I'm going to plug into the
bottom<00:05:57.800> of<00:05:57.890> the<00:05:58.010> normal<00:05:58.340> Channel<00:05:58.730> and<00:05:58.880> then

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
bottom of the normal Channel and then

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.740 
bottom of the normal Channel and then
the<00:06:00.260> jumper<00:06:00.680> cable<00:06:00.950> will<00:06:01.040> go<00:06:01.160> to<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:01.430> top

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
the jumper cable will go to the top

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.240 
the jumper cable will go to the top
input<00:06:02.750> of<00:06:02.900> the<00:06:03.260> top<00:06:03.470> boost<00:06:03.740> Channel<00:06:04.100> I'm

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
input of the top boost Channel I'm

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.940 
input of the top boost Channel I'm
plugging<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:04.940> guitar<00:06:05.300> into<00:06:06.200> the<00:06:06.350> top<00:06:06.560> input

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
plugging the guitar into the top input

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.500 
plugging the guitar into the top input
of<00:06:07.040> the<00:06:07.130> normal<00:06:07.460> channel<00:06:07.790> so<00:06:07.940> what<00:06:08.060> happens

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
of the normal channel so what happens

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.570 
of the normal channel so what happens
now<00:06:08.690> by<00:06:08.870> jumping<00:06:09.290> this<00:06:09.440> I<00:06:09.560> have<00:06:09.890> access<00:06:10.370> to

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
now by jumping this I have access to

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.090 
now by jumping this I have access to
both<00:06:10.730> channels<00:06:11.150> so<00:06:11.930> I<00:06:12.200> can<00:06:12.410> bleed<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.830> a<00:06:12.860> little

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
both channels so I can bleed it a little

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.620 
both channels so I can bleed it a little
of<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.340> normal<00:06:13.700> Channel<00:06:14.060> and<00:06:14.210> a<00:06:14.270> little<00:06:14.510> of

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
of the normal Channel and a little of

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.720 
of the normal Channel and a little of
the<00:06:14.720> top<00:06:14.930> news<00:06:15.110> channel<00:06:15.560> for<00:06:16.100> a<00:06:16.130> bit<00:06:16.340> different

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
the top news channel for a bit different

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.850 
the top news channel for a bit different
time

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.580 

so<00:06:20.430> here's<00:06:20.700> more<00:06:21.000> normal<00:06:21.510> Channel<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.140> then

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
so here's more normal Channel and then

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.370 
so here's more normal Channel and then
I'll<00:06:22.860> pull<00:06:23.670> in<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:23.940> top<00:06:24.090> whose<00:06:24.360> channel<00:06:24.660> as<00:06:24.900> we

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
I'll pull in the top whose channel as we

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:40.180 
I'll pull in the top whose channel as we
go<00:06:27.410> now<00:06:28.410> more<00:06:28.680> top<00:06:28.920> booster

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.610 

now<00:06:41.190> I<00:06:41.220> could<00:06:41.639> get<00:06:41.789> less<00:06:42.120> normal<00:06:42.569> Channel<00:06:43.050> less

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
now I could get less normal Channel less

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.339 
now I could get less normal Channel less
top<00:06:43.919> boost<00:06:44.190> and<00:06:44.400> clean<00:06:44.610> it<00:06:44.759> up

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:51.649 

now<00:06:49.349> if<00:06:49.500> I<00:06:49.560> bring<00:06:49.770> more<00:06:49.949> normal<00:06:50.430> channel<00:06:50.879> I<00:06:51.030> get

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
now if I bring more normal channel I get

00:06:51.659 --> 00:07:00.450 
now if I bring more normal channel I get
this<00:06:51.810> cone

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.610 

for<00:07:01.120> a<00:07:01.150> more<00:07:01.330> aggressive<00:07:01.420> approach<00:07:01.870> less

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
for a more aggressive approach less

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.880 
for a more aggressive approach less
normal<00:07:03.160> more<00:07:03.790> top<00:07:04.150> boost<00:07:04.510> and<00:07:04.780> I<00:07:05.140> can<00:07:05.350> dial<00:07:05.650> in

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
normal more top boost and I can dial in

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.530 
normal more top boost and I can dial in
more<00:07:06.100> trouble<00:07:06.400> so<00:07:06.700> I'm<00:07:06.790> taking<00:07:07.060> advantage<00:07:07.270> of

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
more trouble so I'm taking advantage of

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.210 
more trouble so I'm taking advantage of
the<00:07:07.660> EQ<00:07:08.020> so<00:07:08.200> I'm<00:07:08.260> getting<00:07:08.380> some<00:07:08.650> of<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:08.830> normal

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.220 
the EQ so I'm getting some of the normal

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.250 
the EQ so I'm getting some of the normal
