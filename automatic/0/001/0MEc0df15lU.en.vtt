what I have is the emulator running here
and<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.840> see<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.050> if<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.380> flip<00:00:22.769> over<00:00:23.070> i

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
and you can see that if I flip over i

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
have an application called day 11 live

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.540 
have an application called day 11 live
tiles<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> application<00:00:26.160> will<00:00:26.279> build

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
tiles this is the application will build

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
tiles this is the application will build
in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.840> example<00:00:28.529> you'll<00:00:28.680> find<00:00:29.420> that<00:00:30.420> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
in the example you'll find that this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.560 
in the example you'll find that this
video<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:30.960> posted<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.450> go

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
video is posted in and so if we just go

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
video is posted in and so if we just go
ahead<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.840> pin<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> our<00:00:34.890> Start<00:00:35.219> menu<00:00:35.460> by

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
ahead and pin this to our Start menu by

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
ahead and pin this to our Start menu by
holding<00:00:35.969> down<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.450> you'd<00:00:36.960> say<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.350> click

holding down on it you'd say I can click

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.610 
holding down on it you'd say I can click
pin<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.860> start<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:39.360> i<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.719> my<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:40.320> tile

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
pin to start and now i have my my tile

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.160 
pin to start and now i have my my tile
this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.670> our<00:00:41.790> default<00:00:42.059> tile<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
this is our default tile this is the the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
this is our default tile this is the the
icon<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.829> provided<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.670> built<00:00:44.910> our

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
icon that we provided when we built our

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.389 
icon that we provided when we built our
application<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> first<00:00:45.809> time<00:00:46.100> but<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.219> want

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
application the first time but we want

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.500 
application the first time but we want
to<00:00:47.460> change<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.329> able<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
to change this we want to be able to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.510 
to change this we want to be able to
update<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.320> our<00:00:49.950> application

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
update it and so our application

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.189 
update it and so our application
actually<00:00:50.700> allows<00:00:51.090> us<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.989> what<00:00:52.170> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
actually allows us to do that so what I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
actually allows us to do that so what I
have<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.710> few<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.280> controls<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.510> my

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
have is a few little controls here on my

circle<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.570> discussed<00:01:31.020> earlier<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
circle as we discussed earlier in the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.460 
circle as we discussed earlier in the
post<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> default<00:01:33.900> layout<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
post this is a default layout the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.749 
post this is a default layout the
circles<00:01:34.799> always<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> same<00:01:35.310> place<00:01:35.369> it's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
circles always in the same place it's

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.789 
circles always in the same place it's
always<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> same<00:01:36.119> colors<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> way<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
always the same colors but it's a way to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.280 
always the same colors but it's a way to
add<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.369> small<00:01:38.820> counter<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> tile<00:01:39.810> very

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
add a small counter to a tile very

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.319 
add a small counter to a tile very
easily<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> first<00:01:41.939> thing<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.180> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
easily so that's the first thing that we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.429 
easily so that's the first thing that we
can<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.750> jump<00:01:42.930> back<00:01:43.110> into<00:01:43.290> our

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
can do if we jump back into our

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.719 
can do if we jump back into our
application<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.250> I'm<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.460> saving

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

application you can see I'm not saving
any<00:01:44.970> values<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.619> change<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.189> 37

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
any values but I can change this to 37

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
any values but I can change this to 37
this<00:01:47.970> time<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.530> I'm<00:01:49.740> also<00:01:49.860> going

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
this time and this time I'm also going

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.230 
this time and this time I'm also going
to<00:01:50.100> change<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> background<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.060> by<00:01:51.180> clicking

let's say the sad face we'll make this a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.120 
let's say the sad face we'll make this a
bigger<00:02:15.790> number<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.300> 70<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.020> we'll<00:02:17.620> write<00:02:17.830> a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
bigger number like 70 and we'll write a

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.390 
bigger number like 70 and we'll write a
sad<00:02:18.790> panda<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.260> text<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.770> if<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.310> hit

sad panda on the text and if we hit

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400 
sad panda on the text and if we hit
update<00:02:21.550> primary<00:02:22.330> title<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.750> time<00:02:22.990> what

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
update primary title this time what

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.930 
update primary title this time what
you'll<00:02:23.560> find<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.310> we've<00:02:24.520> also<00:02:24.700> added

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
you'll find is that we've also added

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.120 
you'll find is that we've also added
text<00:02:25.360> there<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.810> bottom<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.320> these<00:02:26.920> are

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
text there to the bottom so these are

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.650 
text there to the bottom so these are
the<00:02:27.190> three<00:02:27.250> values<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.120> we're<00:02:28.270> able<00:02:28.450> to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
the three values that we're able to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.480 
the three values that we're able to
change<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.260> kind<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.470> fit<00:02:29.710> into<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.160> the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
change and kind of fit into the the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.190 
change and kind of fit into the the
predefined<00:02:30.880> template<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:31.720> us<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.080> a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
predefined template for us that is a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.880 
predefined template for us that is a
live<00:02:32.500> tile<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.910> later<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.330> this<00:02:34.450> article<00:02:35.110> will

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
live tile and later in this article will

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.530 
live tile and later in this article will
also<00:02:36.160> talk<00:02:36.340> about<00:02:36.400> how<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.820> create<00:02:37.120> secondary

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
also talk about how to create secondary

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.780 
also talk about how to create secondary
tiles<00:02:37.860> even<00:02:38.860> do<00:02:38.950> things<00:02:39.160> like<00:02:39.280> make<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.610> flip

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
tiles even do things like make it flip

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.100 
tiles even do things like make it flip
over<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.210> wanted<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.510> make<00:02:40.630> sure<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:41.020> this

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
over but I wanted to make sure that this

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.420 
over but I wanted to make sure that this
would<00:02:41.290> illustrate<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> understood

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
would illustrate it so the understood

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.200 
would illustrate it so the understood
exactly<00:02:42.550> what<00:02:42.910> we're<00:02:43.150> trying<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.450> do<00:02:43.600> thanks
