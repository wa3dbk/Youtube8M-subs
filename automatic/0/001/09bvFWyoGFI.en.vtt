have<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.710> basically<00:00:41.220> just<00:00:41.430> been<00:00:41.580> squished<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
have be basically just been squished and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.820 
have be basically just been squished and
they've<00:00:42.870> talked<00:00:43.080> about<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> item<00:00:43.590> squish

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
they've talked about the item squish

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.290 
they've talked about the item squish
they<00:00:44.430> said<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.000> important<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
they said it's very important to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.520 
they said it's very important to
understand<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.810> it's<00:00:45.900> on<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> nerve<00:00:46.320> two

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
understand that it's on a nerve two

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.290 
understand that it's on a nerve two
enemies<00:00:46.860> because<00:00:47.190> they've<00:00:47.910> also<00:00:48.120> been

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
enemies because they've also been

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.700 
enemies because they've also been
squished<00:00:48.540> as<00:00:48.810> well<00:00:48.930> everything<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.440> squished

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
squished as well everything is squished

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.100 
squished as well everything is squished
so<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.700> relative<00:00:51.330> power<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> exact<00:00:51.930> same

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
so our relative power is the exact same

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.300 
so our relative power is the exact same
but<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> number<00:00:52.710> should<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.070> lot<00:00:53.250> nicer

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
but the number should be a lot nicer

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.000 
but the number should be a lot nicer
they<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:54.630> added<00:00:55.080> a<00:00:55.350> new<00:00:55.530> row<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
they have also added a new row of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.520 
they have also added a new row of
talents<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.460> level<00:00:56.700> 100<00:00:57.120> us<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> expected<00:00:58.020> but

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
talents for level 100 us we expected but

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
talents for level 100 us we expected but
there<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.040> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.340> new<00:00:59.760> perks<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
there are going to be new perks and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.430 
there are going to be new perks and
these<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.810> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.990> be<00:01:01.050> unlocked<00:01:01.320> from

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
these are going to be unlocked from

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.130 
these are going to be unlocked from
level<00:01:01.800> 91<00:01:02.190> 2<00:01:02.490> 99<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:03.630> augment<00:01:03.930> our

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
level 91 2 99 and they will augment our

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.139 
level 91 2 99 and they will augment our
existing<00:01:04.619> ability<00:01:05.039> so<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> does<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.489> blow<00:01:05.909> but

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
existing ability so it does not blow but

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.550 
existing ability so it does not blow but
at<00:01:06.240> least<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.600> adds<00:01:06.719> a<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> reward<00:01:07.259> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
at least it adds a bit of a reward and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.620 
at least it adds a bit of a reward and
some<00:01:07.740> gameplay<00:01:08.159> then<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.210> talked

intellect<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.399> more

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
intellect so it's a little bit more

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.249 
intellect so it's a little bit more
readable<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.149> easier<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> understand<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
readable and easier to understand and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
readable and easier to understand and
also<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.579> bit<00:01:26.729> better<00:01:26.880> for

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
also it's just a bit better for

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.709 
also it's just a bit better for
balancing<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:29.280> also<00:01:29.429> hit<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.270> expertise

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
balancing then also hit and expertise

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.359 
balancing then also hit and expertise
have<00:01:30.869> been<00:01:30.990> removed<00:01:31.170> from<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> game<00:01:31.859> they're

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
have been removed from the game they're

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.249 
have been removed from the game they're
gone<00:01:32.639> so<00:01:33.119> you'll<00:01:33.689> always<00:01:33.929> be<00:01:34.079> able<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
gone so you'll always be able to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
gone so you'll always be able to
reliably<00:01:34.560> land<00:01:35.069> attacks<00:01:35.399> I<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:35.729> that's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
reliably land attacks I think that's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.099 
reliably land attacks I think that's
actually<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.270> really<00:01:36.329> good<00:01:36.659> thing<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.899> do

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
actually a really good thing to do

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.050 
actually a really good thing to do
because<00:01:37.590> hitting<00:01:37.979> expertise<00:01:38.340> caps<00:01:38.639> they<00:01:38.880> just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
because hitting expertise caps they just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.789 
because hitting expertise caps they just
weren't<00:01:39.210> fun<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.840> never<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.319> added<00:01:40.649> much

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
weren't fun it never really added much

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.129 
weren't fun it never really added much
gameplay<00:01:41.069> of<00:01:41.280> decision<00:01:41.670> making<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.719> next<00:01:42.899> he

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
gameplay of decision making so next he

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.980 
gameplay of decision making so next he
said<00:01:43.319> they're<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:43.829> he<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.340> they<00:01:45.240> said<00:01:45.749> that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
said they're not he and they said that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
said they're not he and they said that
the<00:01:46.439> pace<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> healing<00:01:47.069> is<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.429> be

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the pace of healing is going to be

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.309 
the pace of healing is going to be
adjusted<00:01:48.030> basically<00:01:48.749> they<00:01:48.899> want<00:01:49.109> to

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
adjusted basically they want to

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.319 
adjusted basically they want to
emphasize<00:01:49.979> tactical<00:01:50.549> decision<00:01:50.969> making

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
emphasize tactical decision making

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.209 
emphasize tactical decision making
regarding<00:01:51.689> efficiency<00:01:52.499> and<00:01:52.619> throughput<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
regarding efficiency and throughput and

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.399 
regarding efficiency and throughput and
based<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.850> both<00:01:54.060> multi-target<00:01:54.569> and<00:01:54.959> single

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:57.779

targeted<00:01:58.289> healing<00:01:58.619> has<00:01:58.950> been<00:01:59.189> reduced<00:01:59.429> a

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
targeted healing has been reduced a

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.340 
targeted healing has been reduced a
little<00:01:59.700> bit<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.119> emphasize<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.869> actual

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
little bit to emphasize the actual

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260 
little bit to emphasize the actual
choice<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.859> players<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.399> think<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:02.999> a<00:02:03.119> very

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
choice of players I think that's a very

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.669 
choice of players I think that's a very
good<00:02:03.389> thing<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.990> should<00:02:04.139> make<00:02:04.259> healing<00:02:04.499> a

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
good thing and it should make healing a

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.639 
good thing and it should make healing a
lot<00:02:04.859> more<00:02:05.069> mentally<00:02:05.609> engaging<00:02:05.969> fun<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.109> just

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
lot more mentally engaging fun and just

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
lot more mentally engaging fun and just
better<00:02:07.950> overall<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:09.000> am<00:02:09.539> pretty<00:02:09.869> happy

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
better overall I really am pretty happy

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.330 
better overall I really am pretty happy
about<00:02:10.170> those<00:02:10.439> changes<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
about those changes and actually if you

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.770 
about those changes and actually if you
surf<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.549> channel<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.060> already<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> video

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
surf the channel I already have a video

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.610 
surf the channel I already have a video
talking<00:02:13.019> about<00:02:13.349> them

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
talking about them

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
talking about them
next<00:02:14.519> they<00:02:14.610> also<00:02:14.760> said<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.090> rebalance

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
next they also said they rebalance

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.880 
next they also said they rebalance
racial<00:02:16.080> traits<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.739> they<00:02:16.860> are

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
racial traits so that they are

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.309 
racial traits so that they are
essentially<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.209> have<00:02:18.360> similar<00:02:18.870> combat

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
essentially going to have similar combat

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.780 
essentially going to have similar combat
performance<00:02:19.830> much<00:02:20.010> better<00:02:20.280> than<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.549> it<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
performance much better than is it the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.160 
performance much better than is it the
minute<00:02:20.909> there<00:02:21.209> should<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.569> any<00:02:21.690> outliers

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
minute there should not be any outliers

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.500 
minute there should not be any outliers
like<00:02:22.379> say<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.950> orcs<00:02:23.190> overall<00:02:23.909> I'm<00:02:24.209> yeah

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
like say the orcs overall I'm yeah

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.229 
like say the orcs overall I'm yeah
overall<00:02:24.810> extremely<00:02:25.349> good<00:02:25.940> alright<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.090> next

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
overall extremely good alright so next

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.360 
overall extremely good alright so next
I'm<00:02:27.569> whole<00:02:28.019> bunch<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.319> classes<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.739> how<00:02:28.860> some

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
I'm whole bunch of classes of how some

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.280 
I'm whole bunch of classes of how some
of<00:02:29.400> their<00:02:29.610> abilities<00:02:30.090> pruned<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.079> focus

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
of their abilities pruned with the focus

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.080 
of their abilities pruned with the focus
on<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.769> redundant<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.370> less<00:02:32.549> use<00:02:32.849> abilities

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
on the redundant and less use abilities

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.000 
on the redundant and less use abilities
this<00:02:33.810> should<00:02:34.019> basically<00:02:34.230> cut<00:02:34.680> down<00:02:34.860> and

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
this should basically cut down and

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.680 
this should basically cut down and
bottom<00:02:35.190> keybind<00:02:35.760> bloat<00:02:36.030> essentially<00:02:36.540> there's

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
bottom keybind bloat essentially there's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.360 
bottom keybind bloat essentially there's
a<00:02:36.720> lot<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.870> things<00:02:37.140> which<00:02:37.440> are<00:02:37.650> bound<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.250> your

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
a lot of things which are bound to your

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.559 
a lot of things which are bound to your
keyboard<00:02:38.730> because<00:02:38.819> you'll<00:02:39.000> probably<00:02:39.269> need<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
keyboard because you'll probably need to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.720 
keyboard because you'll probably need to
use<00:02:39.780> them<00:02:39.989> at<00:02:40.079> some<00:02:40.349> point<00:02:40.560> during<00:02:40.739> combat<00:02:41.069> but

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
use them at some point during combat but

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.280 
use them at some point during combat but
really<00:02:42.000> they're<00:02:42.269> just<00:02:42.569> kind<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.840> annoying<00:02:43.049> and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
really they're just kind of annoying and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.020 
really they're just kind of annoying and
they<00:02:43.349> add<00:02:43.470> complexity<00:02:44.069> but<00:02:44.280> not<00:02:44.459> necessarily

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
they add complexity but not necessarily

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.900 
they add complexity but not necessarily
depth<00:02:45.420> um<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:47.069> know<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.280> situation<00:02:47.790> was

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
depth um it you know the situation was

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.280 
depth um it you know the situation was
like<00:02:48.060> oh<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.239> need<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.540> use<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.900> contrived

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
like oh you need to use that contrived

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.900 
like oh you need to use that contrived
ability<00:02:49.769> at<00:02:49.859> minute<00:02:50.129> three<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.519> fight<00:02:50.730> or

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
something and hopefully they can still

something and hopefully they can still
offer<00:02:53.370> really<00:02:53.670> interesting<00:02:54.269> class<00:02:54.480> specific

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
offer really interesting class specific

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.720 
offer really interesting class specific
parts<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.319> fights<00:02:55.560> while<00:02:55.829> being<00:02:56.280> able<00:02:56.609> to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
parts of fights while being able to

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
parts of fights while being able to
remove<00:02:57.090> some<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.510> these<00:02:57.810> just<00:02:58.530> more<00:02:58.680> blow<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
remove some of these just more blow the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.680 
remove some of these just more blow the
abilities<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.579> aren't<00:02:59.849> particularly<00:03:00.239> fun

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
abilities that aren't particularly fun

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.110 
abilities that aren't particularly fun
then<00:03:01.379> they've<00:03:01.590> also<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:02.250> course<00:03:02.489> talked<00:03:02.849> about

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
then they've also of course talked about

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.430 
then they've also of course talked about
the<00:03:03.269> reduction<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.780> CC<00:03:04.109> in<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> game

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
the reduction of CC in the game

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.670 
the reduction of CC in the game
primarily<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.220> PvP<00:03:05.640> basically<00:03:06.629> they<00:03:07.290> don't

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
primarily for PvP basically they don't

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.960 
primarily for PvP basically they don't
think<00:03:07.859> it<00:03:07.950> was<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.129> much<00:03:08.159> fun<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.819> then

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
think it was as much fun and then

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.970 
think it was as much fun and then
they've<00:03:09.150> also<00:03:09.329> merged<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.530> whole<00:03:10.650> bunch<00:03:10.829> of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
they've also merged a whole bunch of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.649 
they've also merged a whole bunch of
diminishing<00:03:11.370> returns<00:03:11.430> category<00:03:12.269> so<00:03:12.480> there'll

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
diminishing returns category so there'll

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.539 
diminishing returns category so there'll
be<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.750> little<00:03:12.959> bit<00:03:13.140> more<00:03:13.349> overlap<00:03:14.159> there<00:03:14.370> with

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
be a little bit more overlap there with

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.000 
be a little bit more overlap there with
spells<00:03:14.819> so<00:03:15.150> basically<00:03:15.569> CC<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.230> being<00:03:16.560> nerfed<00:03:16.769> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
spells so basically CC is being nerfed a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.580 
spells so basically CC is being nerfed a
lot<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.639> PvP<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.810> think<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.079> is<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
lot in PvP and I think that is for the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.379 
lot in PvP and I think that is for the
batter<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.040> game<00:03:20.130> really<00:03:20.549> again<00:03:21.090> there's

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
batter of the game really again there's

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.789 
batter of the game really again there's
already<00:03:21.540> video<00:03:22.019> on<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.169> channel<00:03:22.200> about<00:03:22.590> that

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
already video on the channel about that

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.860 
already video on the channel about that
so<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.190> take<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> look<00:03:23.609> they've<00:03:24.419> also<00:03:24.599> done

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
so you can take a look they've also done

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.629 
so you can take a look they've also done
a<00:03:25.200> thing<00:03:25.440> with<00:03:25.590> buffs<00:03:25.859> they<00:03:26.069> have<00:03:26.220> basically

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
a thing with buffs they have basically

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.819 
a thing with buffs they have basically
merged<00:03:27.419> a<00:03:27.690> whole<00:03:27.810> bunch<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.109> common<00:03:28.500> buffs<00:03:28.680> and

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
merged a whole bunch of common buffs and

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.470 
merged a whole bunch of common buffs and
debuffs<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.489> they've<00:03:29.910> worth<00:03:30.060> some<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.389> them

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
debuffs and they've worth some of them

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.030 
debuffs and they've worth some of them
and<00:03:30.660> then<00:03:30.900> they<00:03:31.049> removed<00:03:31.440> some<00:03:31.739> which<00:03:31.919> were

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
and then they removed some which were

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.520 
and then they removed some which were
actually<00:03:32.310> redundant<00:03:32.819> I<00:03:32.989> think<00:03:33.989> that's<00:03:34.139> okay

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
actually redundant I think that's okay

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.369 
actually redundant I think that's okay
there<00:03:35.310> was<00:03:35.459> no<00:03:35.639> fun<00:03:35.879> to<00:03:36.060> me<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.450> going<00:03:36.930> into<00:03:37.200> a

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
there was no fun to me in going into a

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.080 
there was no fun to me in going into a
raid<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.160> him<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.340> sit<00:03:38.609> there<00:03:38.790> for<00:03:38.970> five

in you can raid I'm of course though

in you can raid I'm of course though
there<00:03:46.230> still<00:03:46.440> will<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.650> buffs<00:03:46.949> and<00:03:47.069> debuffs

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
there still will be buffs and debuffs

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.069 
there still will be buffs and debuffs
which<00:03:47.639> you<00:03:47.760> will<00:03:47.849> have<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.120> account<00:03:48.359> for<00:03:48.510> so

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
which you will have to account for so

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:49.879 
which you will have to account for so
it's<00:03:49.199> not<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.440> they're<00:03:49.560> completely

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
it's not like they're completely

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.830 
it's not like they're completely
removing<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.489> hopefully<00:03:51.269> they<00:03:51.359> strike<00:03:51.599> up<00:03:51.750> a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
removing that hopefully they strike up a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.390 
removing that hopefully they strike up a
little<00:03:52.049> bit<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.319> better<00:03:52.500> balance<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:53.099> suppose

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
little bit of a better balance I suppose

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.390 
little bit of a better balance I suppose
but<00:03:54.209> yeah<00:03:54.690> overall<00:03:54.989> interesting<00:03:55.500> enough<00:03:55.680> he

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
but yeah overall interesting enough he

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.710 
but yeah overall interesting enough he

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
characters are going to learn some

giving<00:04:22.289> cast<00:04:22.500> times<00:04:22.770> do<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.979> few<00:04:23.219> spells<00:04:23.969> which

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
giving cast times do a few spells which

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.770 
giving cast times do a few spells which
were<00:04:24.270> previously<00:04:24.450> incidents<00:04:25.140> I'm

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
were previously incidents I'm

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.180 
were previously incidents I'm
it<00:04:25.870> smells<00:04:26.139> I<00:04:26.380> think<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.740> makes<00:04:26.950> sense

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
it smells I think that makes sense

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.730 
it smells I think that makes sense
instance<00:04:27.820> where<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.570> no-brainer<00:04:29.260> in<00:04:29.500> too<00:04:29.620> many

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
instance where a no-brainer in too many

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.030 
instance where a no-brainer in too many
cases<00:04:29.889> especially<00:04:30.400> in<00:04:30.820> PvP<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:32.650> reduced

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
cases especially in PvP and it reduced

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.840 
cases especially in PvP and it reduced
the<00:04:33.130> like<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:34.360> know<00:04:34.480> you<00:04:34.540> could<00:04:35.639> you<00:04:36.639> could

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
the like you know you could you could

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.820 
the like you know you could you could
you<00:04:37.180> have<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.690> fear<00:04:37.870> someone<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.440> stop<00:04:38.680> an

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
you have to fear someone to stop an

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.870 
you have to fear someone to stop an
instant<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.220> couldn't<00:04:39.490> interrupt<00:04:39.669> or

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
instant you couldn't interrupt or

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.640 
instant you couldn't interrupt or
anything<00:04:40.030> like<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:41.260> suppose<00:04:41.500> that

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
anything like that and I suppose that

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.290 
anything like that and I suppose that
just<00:04:41.980> made<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.310> little<00:04:42.460> bit<00:04:42.639> too<00:04:42.850> strong<00:04:43.120> in

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
just made it a little bit too strong in

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.110 
just made it a little bit too strong in
PvP<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:43.870> hopefully<00:04:44.830> this<00:04:44.950> change<00:04:45.460> with<00:04:46.000> the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
PvP and hopefully this change with the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.760 
PvP and hopefully this change with the
overall<00:04:46.330> balance<00:04:46.690> that's<00:04:46.810> going<00:04:47.050> on<00:04:47.169> should

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
overall balance that's going on should

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.760 
overall balance that's going on should
not<00:04:47.889> affect<00:04:47.950> PvE<00:04:48.700> content<00:04:49.380> too<00:04:50.380> much<00:04:50.530> still

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
not affect PvE content too much still

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.350 
not affect PvE content too much still
though<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:50.980> think<00:04:51.040> overall<00:04:51.550> good<00:04:51.850> change<00:04:52.120> and

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
though I think overall good change and

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.450 
though I think overall good change and
then<00:04:53.020> next<00:04:53.260> about<00:04:53.590> vengeance<00:04:53.860> has<00:04:54.160> actually

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
then next about vengeance has actually

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.830 
then next about vengeance has actually
been<00:04:54.550> redesigned<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.300> they're<00:04:55.419> calling<00:04:55.750> it

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
been redesigned and they're calling it

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.140 
been redesigned and they're calling it
to<00:04:56.050> resolve<00:04:56.650> now<00:04:57.130> resolved<00:04:57.460> doesn't<00:04:57.850> increase

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
to resolve now resolved doesn't increase

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.550 
to resolve now resolved doesn't increase
your<00:04:58.300> outgoing<00:04:58.690> damage<00:04:59.020> but<00:04:59.230> it<00:04:59.260> does

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
your outgoing damage but it does

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.440 
your outgoing damage but it does
increase<00:04:59.950> tank<00:05:00.280> self-healing<00:05:00.820> an<00:05:01.030> absorption

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
increase tank self-healing an absorption

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.690 
increase tank self-healing an absorption
based<00:05:02.050> on<00:05:02.230> your<00:05:02.380> damage<00:05:02.740> taking<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.310> think

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
based on your damage taking I think

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.100 
based on your damage taking I think
that's<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:03.970> really<00:05:04.210> cool<00:05:04.419> way<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.570> do<00:05:04.810> it<00:05:04.930> it's<00:05:05.050> a

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
that's a really cool way to do it it's a

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.480 
that's a really cool way to do it it's a
little<00:05:05.290> bit<00:05:05.410> more<00:05:05.530> bounce<00:05:05.830> than<00:05:06.070> vengeance

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
little bit more bounce than vengeance

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.370 
little bit more bounce than vengeance
though<00:05:07.180> i'd<00:05:07.300> imagine<00:05:07.690> some<00:05:07.900> people<00:05:08.200> will

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
though i'd imagine some people will

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.440 
though i'd imagine some people will
perhaps<00:05:08.919> be<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.730> little<00:05:09.880> bit<00:05:10.060> sad<00:05:10.240> they're

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
perhaps be a little bit sad they're

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.480 
perhaps be a little bit sad they're
gonna<00:05:10.570> lose<00:05:10.780> some<00:05:10.990> dps<00:05:11.320> but<00:05:11.650> honestly<00:05:12.010> the

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
gonna lose some dps but honestly the

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.420 
gonna lose some dps but honestly the
people<00:05:12.790> who<00:05:12.910> care<00:05:13.120> about<00:05:13.210> DPS<00:05:13.750> um<00:05:14.280> well<00:05:15.280> are

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
people who care about DPS um well are

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.950 
people who care about DPS um well are
they<00:05:15.550> necessarily<00:05:16.000> going<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.300> be<00:05:16.450> tanks<00:05:16.810> I

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
they necessarily going to be tanks I

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.030 
they necessarily going to be tanks I
don't<00:05:17.200> particularly<00:05:17.530> think<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:17.950> i<00:05:17.979> think

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
don't particularly think so i think

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.070 
don't particularly think so i think
tanking<00:05:18.580> it's<00:05:18.970> more<00:05:19.150> about<00:05:19.270> controlling<00:05:19.720> mobs

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
tanking it's more about controlling mobs

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.810 
tanking it's more about controlling mobs
making<00:05:20.470> sure<00:05:20.620> of<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.830> jura<00:05:21.010> that<00:05:21.220> badass<00:05:21.460> who

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
making sure of the jura that badass who

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.159 
making sure of the jura that badass who
never<00:05:22.000> dies<00:05:22.240> who<00:05:22.450> just<00:05:22.660> you<00:05:22.900> know<00:05:22.990> get

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
never dies who just you know get

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.230 
never dies who just you know get
everything<00:05:23.620> stick<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.100> like<00:05:24.130> glue<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:25.180> I

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
everything stick to you like glue so I

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.760 
everything stick to you like glue so I
think<00:05:25.300> that's<00:05:25.570> probably<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:26.050> very<00:05:26.200> good<00:05:26.320> change

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
think that's probably a very good change

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.950 
think that's probably a very good change
and<00:05:26.950> it<00:05:27.040> just<00:05:27.370> bounces<00:05:27.790> out<00:05:27.940> tanks<00:05:28.330> I'm<00:05:28.540> DPS<00:05:28.930> a

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
and it just bounces out tanks I'm DPS a

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.950 
and it just bounces out tanks I'm DPS a
little<00:05:29.229> bit<00:05:29.350> better<00:05:29.910> plus<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.090> yeah<00:05:31.390> so<00:05:31.690> anyway

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
little bit better plus it yeah so anyway

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.750 
little bit better plus it yeah so anyway
that<00:05:31.990> that's<00:05:32.290> pretty<00:05:32.440> good<00:05:32.650> then<00:05:33.310> also<00:05:33.490> they

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
that that's pretty good then also they

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.550 
that that's pretty good then also they
have<00:05:33.880> got<00:05:34.150> facing<00:05:34.600> requirements<00:05:35.169> just

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
have got facing requirements just

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.960 
have got facing requirements just
tweaked<00:05:35.890> and<00:05:36.070> some<00:05:36.220> abilities<00:05:36.700> I've<00:05:36.820> already

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
tweaked and some abilities I've already

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.520 
tweaked and some abilities I've already
I'm<00:05:37.419> going<00:05:37.630> to<00:05:37.690> cover<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:37.960> suit<00:05:38.140> in<00:05:38.229> a<00:05:38.290> video

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
I'm going to cover the suit in a video

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.560 
I'm going to cover the suit in a video
but<00:05:38.770> some<00:05:39.250> things<00:05:39.430> like<00:05:39.550> backstab<00:05:40.030> can<00:05:40.300> now<00:05:40.419> be

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
but some things like backstab can now be

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.290 
but some things like backstab can now be
used<00:05:40.600> from<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.169> side<00:05:41.430> basically<00:05:42.430> they<00:05:42.640> start

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
used from the side basically they start

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.370 
used from the side basically they start
that<00:05:43.510> some<00:05:43.720> of<00:05:43.840> these<00:05:43.900> things<00:05:44.080> were<00:05:44.229> really

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
that some of these things were really

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
that some of these things were really
annoying<00:05:44.770> from<00:05:44.979> a<00:05:45.039> gameplay<00:05:45.220> perspective

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
annoying from a gameplay perspective

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.520 
annoying from a gameplay perspective
they<00:05:46.390> didn't<00:05:46.600> think<00:05:46.660> they<00:05:46.810> added<00:05:47.080> much<00:05:47.229> depth

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
they didn't think they added much depth

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.800 
they didn't think they added much depth
especially<00:05:48.070> in<00:05:48.220> PvP<00:05:48.729> and<00:05:48.760> some<00:05:49.120> really<00:05:49.419> you

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
especially in PvP and some really you

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.300 
especially in PvP and some really you
know<00:05:49.900> tough<00:05:50.140> scenarios<00:05:50.620> likes<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.860> heroic

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
know tough scenarios likes a heroic

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.880 
know tough scenarios likes a heroic
rating<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.060> they<00:05:52.570> decided<00:05:52.930> just<00:05:53.260> to<00:05:53.380> loosen

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
rating and they decided just to loosen

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.560 
rating and they decided just to loosen
or<00:05:54.100> remove<00:05:54.130> them<00:05:54.490> I<00:05:54.669> think<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:55.030> actually

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
or remove them I think that actually

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.930 
or remove them I think that actually
makes<00:05:55.930> sense<00:05:56.110> but<00:05:56.950> hopefully<00:05:57.580> they<00:05:57.700> still

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
makes sense but hopefully they still

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.159 
makes sense but hopefully they still
keep<00:05:58.060> a<00:05:58.180> little<00:05:58.330> bit<00:05:58.539> of<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.690> flavor<00:05:58.930> there

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
keep a little bit of the flavor there

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.380 
keep a little bit of the flavor there
with<00:05:59.350> those<00:05:59.410> abilities<00:05:59.850> okay<00:06:00.850> so<00:06:00.910> next<00:06:01.180> they

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
with those abilities okay so next they

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.570 
with those abilities okay so next they
also<00:06:01.539> have<00:06:02.020> just<00:06:02.680> amount<00:06:02.890> of<00:06:02.979> cost<00:06:03.130> of<00:06:03.370> some

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
also have just amount of cost of some

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.070 
also have just amount of cost of some
resurrection<00:06:04.150> spells<00:06:04.390> to<00:06:04.539> make<00:06:04.660> a<00:06:04.690> little<00:06:04.900> bit

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
resurrection spells to make a little bit

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.140 
resurrection spells to make a little bit
easier<00:06:05.410> to<00:06:05.530> recover<00:06:05.770> from<00:06:06.010> a<00:06:06.130> wipe<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.520> then

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
easier to recover from a wipe and then

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.820 
easier to recover from a wipe and then
they've<00:06:07.300> also<00:06:07.510> got<00:06:07.930> rid<00:06:08.229> of<00:06:08.260> all<00:06:08.560> of<00:06:08.740> the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
they've also got rid of all of the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.130 
they've also got rid of all of the
combat<00:06:09.250> benefit<00:06:09.970> perks<00:06:10.330> to<00:06:10.570> professions

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
combat benefit perks to professions

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.570 
combat benefit perks to professions
which<00:06:11.289> is<00:06:11.440> certainly<00:06:11.590> a<00:06:11.770> very<00:06:11.979> interesting

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
which is certainly a very interesting

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.850 
which is certainly a very interesting
one<00:06:12.700> actually<00:06:13.060> yeah<00:06:13.810> basically<00:06:14.620> it<00:06:14.710> makes

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
one actually yeah basically it makes

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.140 
one actually yeah basically it makes
professions<00:06:15.340> of<00:06:15.400> personal<00:06:15.760> choice<00:06:15.910> and<00:06:15.940> I

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
professions of personal choice and I

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.090 
professions of personal choice and I
think<00:06:16.330> that<00:06:16.450> is<00:06:16.600> how<00:06:16.780> they<00:06:16.960> should<00:06:17.020> be<00:06:17.380> then

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
think that is how they should be then

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.560 
think that is how they should be then
they<00:06:18.250> said<00:06:18.430> that<00:06:18.520> there's<00:06:18.700> also<00:06:18.789> a<00:06:18.940> multitude

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
they said that there's also a multitude

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.969 
they said that there's also a multitude
of<00:06:19.660> class<00:06:19.900> specific<00:06:20.320> changes<00:06:20.590> including

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
of class specific changes including

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
things like more distinction between

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.930 
things like more distinction between
talent<00:06:23.710> specs<00:06:23.979> and<00:06:24.190> masteries<00:06:24.520> and<00:06:24.550> that<00:06:24.729> kind
