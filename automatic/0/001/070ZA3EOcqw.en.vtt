00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.950
 the man however seems to leave her 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.719
 savior on the high channel doing more 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.060
 high that you get can put 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.029
 fear on top of head 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:44.040
 yesterday morning if you did tail 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:48.140
 very tall horse is made here so goes 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.140
 pick up here at the tip and learn 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.070
 or else stuck 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.300
 the horse's tail just get this ass 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.440
 horse racing or dictating a logic of June 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:16.910
 and put it inside will put it 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:23.720
 inside so to hide s 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:28.280
 It's quick, I put it inside the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.000
 law and now had grams and will 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.000
 learning here 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.650
 just come in, I think I think 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.680
 of the first ponytail 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.190
 with the rain the end opens the carnival 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:55.850
 and goes half the hair so he opened 8 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:59.150
 noon at the same time 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 so the idea goes from here also 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:09.930
 charges the same thing as the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:14.750
 tip in the car parked in my 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.750
 hair too 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.050
 then just you analyze spray 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.100
 the attacker has not the guy, do not vote now 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.850
 You want to leave it is a clear head through 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.160
 From Rio 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.990
 but I will only analyze with enough time 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.700
 that hair will stay perfect night 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.370
 whole and that's it 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.860
 it's a hair goes easy you to leyland 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.230
 It's what saves us like we do not have 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.900
 time or have entered a stage hall 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.080
 hair then tomorrow if you do not like it 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.360
 Do you forget that I liked it? 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.040
 channel to enroll do not know in writing 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.040
 and a half on the back of tea
