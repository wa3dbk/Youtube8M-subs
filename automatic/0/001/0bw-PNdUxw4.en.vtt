 disused t services to launch a very light ueber browser desperate 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.479

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.719
 supports java 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.220
 html that will allow us while simple navigation all screen 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.220
 we will provide many sites to which we detest 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.919
 vimec displayed quite well 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.839
 ibra trampolin perfectly compared to the browser o

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.049
 even if the views band still takes a few seconds 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.679
 here it is 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.019

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.879
 missing photos and video evidence at sea

 karaoke with ahahah display 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.099
 quite complete 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.099
 here comes everything 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:50.609
 affixed we return to our main menu corman said to neglect 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.699
 warns directly to the gore 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.049
 clicking on silk passengers instead what you have configuration menu 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.779
 of the TV 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:02.499
 where we have basic settings for natural lively personal TV 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:04.819
 game cinema that standard 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.579
 cd is very well made 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.250
 but we can change a settings assistant that guides the user to 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.620
 adjusting the preparations 3 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.689
 weight we have we see that makes the screen compare 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.019
 right and left and in choosing which we prefer 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.560
 the user is led to prefer present from above on the right because anyway more 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.050
 darker black while with the left a little lighter little rules of yes 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.860
 been very italy 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.400
 choosing for example those on the right 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.819
 what is even more brilliant 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.559
 that summer more 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.749
 convincing sacred 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:44.759
 these sharper 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.740
 and 'this left is cold clear 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.200
 we find ourselves practically with one 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.509
 profile really very load very bright that is good for TV 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.599
 but that is absolutely not good for cinema so our advice is that 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:58.150
 of 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.300
 however, use the cinema 3 mode very well done 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.870
 when the picture if you do not rely on the regular mail settings 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.629
 contract nullity color the sharpness of the image you feel very high not 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.759
 finish noise reduction 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.339
 transferenza I'm turning off the color you can also customize colors 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.850
 white balance 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.599
 warm cold normal customizing it 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.289
 we can a regular one 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.250
 the green 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.300
 the blue 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.770
 and also roast 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.210
 edilverde and on low lights 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.099
 we return 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.129
 to the menu 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.740
 there were popes always sisal hd 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.460
 they are all the digital filters of the processor so natural motion or 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.530
 the interpolation function of frames that allows to have one 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.069
 more fluid scan 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.810
 rc arts center there is the future 100 hertz myths of the superior 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.420
 a pretend that better contract 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.430
 dynamic contrast 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.660
 dynamic retroversion prince and artefacts means optimization of 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.900
 colors 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.110
 stop 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.469
 we have lol from pc 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.469
 which allows us to extend the range of cinema hits 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.499
 a light sensor can be turned off or on so it had a selectable seat 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:18.470
 front 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.470
 and other image formats 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.129
 in my cost the light changes 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.290
 on turned off you will see engine running on bright colors 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.690
 pvc s camillo slabs practically according to the content even on pokemon 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.030
 white or warm white cold white a blue 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.550
 with that it would have been 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.070
 and also the separation or if right side left side of the mobilarte 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:46.439
 must be separated 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.759
 or it must reproduce exactly the same color tones 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:56.899
 we find the puts the network settings 

00:06:56.899 --> 00:07:00.299
 we can test operation materials regarding 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:07.789
 the digital terrestrial is therefore a very complete menu 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.219
 of phil navigation phase and well done
