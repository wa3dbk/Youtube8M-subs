we go ready to rock and roll good now

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.990 
we go ready to rock and roll good now
remember<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.680> talked<00:01:58.159> about<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.549> tripod

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
remember I talked about this tripod

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.120 
remember I talked about this tripod
before<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.570> previous<00:01:59.600> episode<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.649> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
before in a previous episode and the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.370 
before in a previous episode and the
special<00:02:01.610> thing<00:02:01.729> about<00:02:01.759> this<00:02:02.119> tripod<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.869> you

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
special thing about this tripod is you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.980 
special thing about this tripod is you
can<00:02:03.590> actually<00:02:03.759> take<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.270> column<00:02:05.630> out<00:02:05.750> it's

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
can actually take the column out it's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.440 
can actually take the column out it's
got<00:02:06.200> one<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.409> those<00:02:06.530> multi-angle<00:02:07.450> central

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
got one of those multi-angle central

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.930 
got one of those multi-angle central
column<00:02:08.720> systems<00:02:09.130> such<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.160> long<00:02:10.429> word<00:02:10.610> anyway

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
column systems such a long word anyway

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.270 
column systems such a long word anyway
so<00:02:11.780> what<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.290> do<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:13.040> actually

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
so what you can do is you can actually

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.750 
so what you can do is you can actually
adjust<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:15.530> column

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
adjust this column

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.649 
adjust this column
so<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:18.110> will<00:02:18.890> go<00:02:18.920> perpendicular<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> floor

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
so it will go perpendicular to the floor

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:27.640 
so it will go perpendicular to the floor
it's<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.409> very<00:02:21.769> nice<00:02:21.950> feature<00:02:22.250> there<00:02:26.530> it's<00:02:27.530> on

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
it's a very nice feature there it's on

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.470 
it's a very nice feature there it's on
there<00:02:27.950> right<00:02:28.129> make<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.760> nice<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:28.939> secure

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
there right make it nice and secure

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.080 
there right make it nice and secure
everything's<00:02:29.870> good<00:02:30.079> and<00:02:30.110> tight<00:02:30.439> now<00:02:30.939> just<00:02:31.939> to

everything's good and tight now just to

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.110 
everything's good and tight now just to
be<00:02:32.239> safe<00:02:32.659> if<00:02:33.079> you're<00:02:33.590> using<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:34.069> DSLR<00:02:34.340> which<00:02:35.000> is

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
be safe if you're using a DSLR which is

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.059 
be safe if you're using a DSLR which is
a<00:02:35.150> bit<00:02:35.360> heavier<00:02:35.780> camera<00:02:36.260> you're<00:02:36.769> going<00:02:36.980> to

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
a bit heavier camera you're going to

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.000 
a bit heavier camera you're going to
want<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.340> counter<00:02:37.700> weight<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.470> column<00:02:39.860> and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
want to counter weight the column and

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.860 
want to counter weight the column and
the<00:02:40.430> beauty<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:40.909> column<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.659> got<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
the beauty of this column is it's got a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.110 
the beauty of this column is it's got a
little<00:02:42.019> hook<00:02:42.290> right<00:02:43.220> here<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.640> counter<00:02:43.970> white

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
little hook right here for counter white

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.240 
little hook right here for counter white
look<00:02:44.840> at<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.049> even<00:02:45.319> color<00:02:45.530> coordinated<00:02:46.099> for

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
look at that even color coordinated for

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.059 
look at that even color coordinated for
you<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.239> put<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.569> like<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.650> it's

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
you so you put that like that and it's

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.589 
you so you put that like that and it's
not<00:02:49.250> bad<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.489> do<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> point<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.540> shoot

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
not bad to do it with a point and shoot

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.720 
not bad to do it with a point and shoot
either<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.170> makes<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.739> tripod<00:02:52.159> that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
either it just makes the tripod that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.399 
either it just makes the tripod that
much<00:02:53.000> secure<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.989> want<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.230> put<00:02:54.379> too
