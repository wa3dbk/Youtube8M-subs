00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
here and then you got a black mesh upper

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.480 
here and then you got a black mesh upper
with<00:01:09.409> hyperfuse<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:10.950> added<00:01:11.250> support

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
with hyperfuse in it for added support

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
with hyperfuse in it for added support
and<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.540> use<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:15.960> layers

and it actually are they use two layers
not<00:01:16.650> three<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> actually<00:01:17.460> makes<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> shoe

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
not three so it actually makes the shoe

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.810
