Halo<00:01:20.220> 4<00:01:20.580> since<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.570> boss<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.110> would

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
Halo 4 since this is a boss I would

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.440 
Halo 4 since this is a boss I would
imagine<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.650> weapon<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.130> pretty<00:01:23.460> deadly<00:01:23.700> but

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
imagine that weapon is pretty deadly but

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
imagine that weapon is pretty deadly but
we<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.860> weapon<00:01:26.310> actually

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
we don't see what that weapon actually

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.749 
we don't see what that weapon actually
does<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:27.689> hear<00:01:27.930> any<00:01:28.140> explosions<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:29.159> any

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
does we don't hear any explosions or any

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.690 
does we don't hear any explosions or any
actual<00:01:30.390> gunfire<00:01:30.990> looking<00:01:31.920> closely<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.549> can

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
actual gunfire looking closely we can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
actual gunfire looking closely we can
see<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.000> appears<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.630> flame<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.530> this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
see what appears to be a flame so this

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950 
see what appears to be a flame so this
weapon<00:01:35.430> probably<00:01:35.939> has<00:01:36.090> something<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.450> fire

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the next thing we see is that this guy

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.640 
the next thing we see is that this guy
can<00:01:39.119> teleport<00:01:39.659> making<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.619> more

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
can teleport making them a lot more

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.859 
can teleport making them a lot more
deadlier<00:01:41.189> than<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.460> thought<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
deadlier than we thought so here the

they do here the hunter activated one of

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.750 
they do here the hunter activated one of
his<00:03:00.659> abilities<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.980> looks<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.459> some

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
his abilities and it looks like some

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.570 
his abilities and it looks like some
sort<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.060> Herman<00:03:03.659> grenade<00:03:04.470> explosive<00:03:05.310> thing

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
sort of Herman grenade explosive thing

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.479 
sort of Herman grenade explosive thing
we<00:03:06.480> see<00:03:06.659> this<00:03:06.780> ability<00:03:07.049> being<00:03:07.409> used<00:03:07.590> again<00:03:07.920> but

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
we see this ability being used again but

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.039 
we see this ability being used again but
this<00:03:08.670> time<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.090> doesn't<00:03:09.269> go<00:03:09.480> straight<00:03:09.540> towards

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
this time it doesn't go straight towards

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.740 
this time it doesn't go straight towards
the<00:03:10.409> enemies<00:03:10.769> instead<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:12.000> hovers<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.599> air

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the enemies instead it hovers in the air

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.170 
the enemies instead it hovers in the air
so<00:03:13.590> maybe<00:03:13.799> these<00:03:13.980> things<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.489> be<00:03:14.579> used<00:03:14.849> sort

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
so maybe these things can be used sort

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.270 
so maybe these things can be used sort
of<00:03:15.239> like<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> trap<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.709> other<00:03:16.860> ability<00:03:17.190> that

ability<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.530> incinerate<00:03:20.459> enemies<00:03:21.079> so<00:03:22.079> we've
