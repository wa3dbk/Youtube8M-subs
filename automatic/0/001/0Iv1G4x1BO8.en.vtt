hello<00:00:00.630> everyone<00:00:00.989> my<00:00:01.199> name<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.410> Tyler<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:02.159> this

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hello everyone my name is Tyler and this

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.820 
hello everyone my name is Tyler and this
week<00:00:02.610> we<00:00:02.909> will<00:00:03.090> be<00:00:03.120> going<00:00:03.449> over<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.259> size<00:00:04.529> by

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
week we will be going over the size by

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.579 
week we will be going over the size by
speed<00:00:05.250> tab<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.330> particle<00:00:06.990> system<00:00:07.410> for

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
speed tab in the particle system for

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.820 
speed tab in the particle system for
unity<00:00:08.150> so<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.750> week<00:00:10.050> I've<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.469> set<00:00:10.710> us

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
unity so for this week I've just set us

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.780 
unity so for this week I've just set us
up<00:00:10.980> with<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.700> basic<00:00:12.570> befall<00:00:13.370> particle<00:00:14.370> system

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
up with a basic befall particle system

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.080 
up with a basic befall particle system
no<00:00:15.660> fancy<00:00:16.109> ones<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.619> week<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> guess

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
no fancy ones for this week so I guess

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.810 
no fancy ones for this week so I guess
without<00:00:18.270> further<00:00:18.449> ado<00:00:18.930> let's<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.350> started<00:00:19.820> so

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
without further ado let's get started so

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.750 
without further ado let's get started so
sighs<00:00:21.029> my<00:00:21.240> speed<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.779> kind<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.140> similar<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
sighs my speed is kind of similar to

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.429 
sighs my speed is kind of similar to
color<00:00:23.760> by<00:00:24.000> speed<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.660> define<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.990> speed

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
color by speed where you define a speed

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.640 
color by speed where you define a speed
range<00:00:26.090> for<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.210> particle<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
range for your particle and then you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.800 
range for your particle and then you
kind<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.010> mess<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.400> curve<00:00:30.000> representing

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
kind of mess with a curve representing

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.740 
kind of mess with a curve representing
the<00:00:31.019> size<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.320> your<00:00:31.349> particle<00:00:31.830> over<00:00:32.070> time<00:00:32.750> so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the size of your particle over time so

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.959 
the size of your particle over time so
let's<00:00:34.200> take<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> look<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.850> do

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
let's take a look and see what we can do

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.990 
let's take a look and see what we can do
with<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.250> let's<00:00:38.399> give<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.790> an

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
with that so let's give it an

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
with that so let's give it an
interesting<00:00:39.540> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.930> curve<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.440> kind<00:00:40.710> of

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
interesting kind of curve just kind of

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.979 
interesting kind of curve just kind of
literally<00:00:41.340> over<00:00:41.700> time<00:00:41.940> it'll<00:00:42.540> grow<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.750> size

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
literally over time it'll grow in size

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.110 
literally over time it'll grow in size
but<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> notice<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:44.969> being

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
but as you notice it's not really being

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.119 
but as you notice it's not really being
applied<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.989> particle<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.649> that's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
applied to the particle and that's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.380 
applied to the particle and that's
because<00:00:47.340> um<00:00:48.050> size<00:00:49.050> by<00:00:49.739> speed<00:00:50.129> won't<00:00:50.460> work<00:00:50.789> with

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
because um size by speed won't work with

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.529 
because um size by speed won't work with
the<00:00:52.110> starting<00:00:52.469> speed<00:00:52.770> it'll<00:00:53.039> only<00:00:53.190> work<00:00:53.539> with

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the starting speed it'll only work with

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.020 
the starting speed it'll only work with
velocity<00:00:55.199> over<00:00:55.410> lifetime<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.100> let's<00:00:56.280> give<00:00:56.670> our

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
velocity over lifetime so let's give our

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
velocity over lifetime so let's give our
particle<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:58.590> sort<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.859> velocity<00:00:59.430> over

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
particle some sort of velocity over

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.660 
particle some sort of velocity over
lifetime<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.649> match<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.190> our

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
lifetime and then match it to our

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.700 
lifetime and then match it to our
speed<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.840> give<00:01:06.049> it<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.229> bit<00:01:06.439> higher<00:01:06.680> so

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
speed and give it a bit higher so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.850 
speed and give it a bit higher so
everyone<00:01:07.280> can<00:01:07.430> see<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:09.200> as<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:09.380> can<00:01:09.530> see<00:01:09.710> now

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
everyone can see so as you can see now

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.280 
everyone can see so as you can see now
it's<00:01:10.310> it's<00:01:10.759> more<00:01:11.000> or<00:01:11.119> less<00:01:11.150> working<00:01:11.720> the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
it's it's more or less working the

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.719 
it's it's more or less working the
particles<00:01:12.740> are<00:01:12.830> basically<00:01:13.220> just<00:01:13.430> starting

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
particles are basically just starting

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.580 
particles are basically just starting
off<00:01:13.820> very<00:01:14.060> small<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.630> growing<00:01:14.810> over<00:01:15.560> time

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
off very small and growing over time

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.800 
off very small and growing over time
until<00:01:15.950> they<00:01:16.220> die<00:01:16.399> so<00:01:17.149> that's<00:01:17.600> basically

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
until they die so that's basically

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
until they die so that's basically
essentially<00:01:18.560> what<00:01:18.890> size<00:01:19.729> by<00:01:20.000> speed<00:01:20.360> is<00:01:20.930> the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
essentially what size by speed is the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.680 
essentially what size by speed is the
only<00:01:22.190> kind<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.520> tricky<00:01:22.789> things<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.630> have

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
only kind of tricky things that you have

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.270 
only kind of tricky things that you have
to<00:01:23.750> know<00:01:23.930> about<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.320> is<00:01:24.440> it<00:01:24.590> doesn't<00:01:24.740> work<00:01:25.009> with

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
to know about it is it doesn't work with

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.240 
to know about it is it doesn't work with
the<00:01:25.640> starting<00:01:25.970> speed<00:01:26.299> or<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.979> force<00:01:27.979> over<00:01:28.220> a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
the starting speed or the force over a

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.950 
the starting speed or the force over a
lifetime<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.729> will<00:01:28.820> only<00:01:28.939> work<00:01:29.270> with<00:01:29.420> velocity

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
lifetime it will only work with velocity

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.450 
lifetime it will only work with velocity
over<00:01:30.170> lifetime<00:01:30.530> because<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:30.860> guess<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.159> uses

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
over lifetime because I guess it uses

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.639 
over lifetime because I guess it uses
that<00:01:32.020> specific<00:01:33.020> velocity<00:01:33.560> calculation<00:01:35.649> to

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
that specific velocity calculation to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.109 
that specific velocity calculation to
determine<00:01:36.679> what<00:01:37.220> size<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.580> particle<00:01:37.970> should

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
determine what size the particle should

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.139 
determine what size the particle should
be<00:01:38.270> at<00:01:38.450> but<00:01:39.380> other<00:01:40.280> than<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:40.580> there's<00:01:41.000> not

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
be at but other than that there's not

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.149 
be at but other than that there's not
much<00:01:41.330> else<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:42.050> guess<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:42.530> can<00:01:42.649> just<00:01:42.679> kind

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
much else to it I guess we can just kind

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.520 
much else to it I guess we can just kind
of<00:01:43.220> mess<00:01:43.369> around<00:01:43.520> with<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.880> values<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
of mess around with the values and the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.930 
of mess around with the values and the
curves<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:45.979> stuff<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.369> see<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.700> kind<00:01:46.880> of

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
curves and stuff to see what kind of

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.340 
curves and stuff to see what kind of
interesting<00:01:47.390> things<00:01:47.630> we<00:01:47.869> can<00:01:48.020> come<00:01:48.170> up<00:01:48.200> with

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
interesting things we can come up with

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.740 
interesting things we can come up with
so<00:01:49.310> I'm<00:01:49.399> going<00:01:49.459> to<00:01:49.640> change<00:01:49.880> some<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.539> those

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
so I'm going to change some of those

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.270 
so I'm going to change some of those
right<00:01:51.020> now<00:01:51.340> see<00:01:52.340> let's<00:01:52.700> get<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> nice<00:01:53.600> little

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
right now see let's get a nice little

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.600 
right now see let's get a nice little
kind<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.509> U<00:01:56.509> shape<00:01:56.840> going<00:01:57.259> on<00:01:57.409> make<00:01:58.340> some

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
kind of U shape going on make some

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.699 
kind of U shape going on make some
interesting<00:01:59.209> motion<00:01:59.659> for<00:01:59.869> the<00:01:59.899> particle<00:02:00.470> now

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
interesting motion for the particle now

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.260 
interesting motion for the particle now
let's<00:02:00.920> change<00:02:01.159> their<00:02:01.399> size<00:02:01.580> over<00:02:01.909> speed<00:02:02.240> a

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
let's change their size over speed a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.550 
let's change their size over speed a
little<00:02:02.450> bit<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.929> make<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.080> little<00:02:03.289> bit<00:02:03.470> more

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
little bit to make a little bit more

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.050 
little bit to make a little bit more
interesting<00:02:03.799> as<00:02:04.130> well<00:02:04.959> let's<00:02:05.959> make<00:02:06.200> another

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
interesting as well let's make another

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.359 
interesting as well let's make another
kind<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.149> U<00:02:08.330> shape<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:09.619> time<00:02:09.890> have<00:02:10.340> a

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
kind of U shape but this time have a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.479 
kind of U shape but this time have a
kind<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.030> opposite<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.780> what<00:02:11.959> our<00:02:12.489> velocity

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
kind of opposite to what our velocity

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.599 
kind of opposite to what our velocity
over<00:02:13.760> lifetime<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.769> now<00:02:15.769> let's<00:02:16.070> see<00:02:16.370> what

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
over lifetime is now let's see what

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.000 
over lifetime is now let's see what
should<00:02:16.940> we<00:02:17.150> change<00:02:17.660> we<00:02:18.109> change<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.650> starting

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
should we change we change the starting

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.970 
should we change we change the starting
sighs<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.370> be<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.519> little<00:02:19.760> bit<00:02:19.970> bigger<00:02:20.980> should

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
sighs to be a little bit bigger should

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.410 
sighs to be a little bit bigger should
we<00:02:22.100> change<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.640> lifetime<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.150> be<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.269> bit

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
we change the lifetime to be a bit

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.500 
we change the lifetime to be a bit
little<00:02:23.510> bit<00:02:23.600> longer<00:02:24.489> that's<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.670> bit<00:02:25.850> too<00:02:26.060> big

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
little bit longer that's a bit too big

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.000 
little bit longer that's a bit too big
let's<00:02:26.930> change<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.410> back

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
let's change it back

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.770 
let's change it back
you<00:02:30.010> can't<00:02:30.250> really<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.790> particle<00:02:31.180> size<00:02:31.480> is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
you can't really the particle size is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.180 
you can't really the particle size is
basically<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.500> zero<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.010> can't

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
basically going to zero so you can't

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.500 
basically going to zero so you can't
really<00:02:33.220> see<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.610> right<00:02:33.850> here<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:34.330> makes

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
really see it right here so that makes

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.060 
really see it right here so that makes
it<00:02:34.630> look<00:02:34.810> kind<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:35.050> awkward<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.650> let's<00:02:35.800> raise

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
it look kind of awkward so let's raise

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.330 
it look kind of awkward so let's raise
these<00:02:36.370> up<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.970> little<00:02:37.000> bit<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:39.370> point2<00:02:40.030> ish

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
these up a little bit like point2 ish

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.180 
these up a little bit like point2 ish
that's<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.460> little<00:02:42.700> bit<00:02:42.820> more<00:02:42.970> interesting<00:02:44.190> but

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
that's a little bit more interesting but

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.480 
that's a little bit more interesting but
yeah<00:02:45.370> that's<00:02:45.670> basically<00:02:45.850> about<00:02:47.220> what<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.310> can

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
yeah that's basically about what you can

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.280 
yeah that's basically about what you can
do<00:02:48.610> with<00:02:48.820> size<00:02:49.030> my<00:02:49.300> speed<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.960> don't<00:02:50.140> I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
do with size my speed I don't I

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.600 
do with size my speed I don't I
personally<00:02:50.800> don't<00:02:50.920> use<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.280> very<00:02:51.310> much

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
personally don't use it very much

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.010 
personally don't use it very much
because<00:02:51.820> it's<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.120> little<00:02:52.300> bit<00:02:52.420> more<00:02:52.510> limiting

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
because it's a little bit more limiting

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.680 
because it's a little bit more limiting
than<00:02:53.860> size<00:02:54.160> our<00:02:54.400> lifetime<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.540> have<00:02:55.660> a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
than size our lifetime and you have a

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.270 
than size our lifetime and you have a
lot<00:02:55.870> more<00:02:56.020> on<00:02:56.290> control<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.890> size<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.250> our

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
lot more on control the size of our

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.770 
lot more on control the size of our
lifetime<00:02:57.700> with<00:02:57.850> sighs<00:02:57.970> my<00:02:58.180> speed<00:02:58.450> your<00:02:58.630> kind

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
lifetime with sighs my speed your kind

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.330 
lifetime with sighs my speed your kind
of<00:02:58.870> limited<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.350> using<00:02:59.530> velocity<00:03:00.160> over

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
of limited to using velocity over

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.790 
of limited to using velocity over
lifetime<00:03:00.520> so<00:03:01.450> again<00:03:01.960> I<00:03:02.110> personally<00:03:02.590> don't<00:03:02.680> use

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
lifetime so again I personally don't use

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.470 
lifetime so again I personally don't use
it<00:03:03.010> there<00:03:03.160> very<00:03:03.430> much<00:03:03.580> but<00:03:03.820> it's<00:03:03.970> there<00:03:04.180> if<00:03:04.210> you

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
it there very much but it's there if you

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.330 
it there very much but it's there if you
want<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.930> do<00:03:05.260> something<00:03:05.470> interesting<00:03:05.710> with<00:03:06.070> it

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
want to do something interesting with it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.640 
want to do something interesting with it
but<00:03:06.970> other<00:03:07.240> than<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:08.170> about<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.470> for

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
but other than that that's about it for

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.860 
but other than that that's about it for
this<00:03:09.010> week's<00:03:09.280> video<00:03:09.580> as<00:03:10.120> usual<00:03:10.570> if<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.780> have

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
an answer to the best of my ability next

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.500 
an answer to the best of my ability next
week<00:03:17.200> we're<00:03:17.380> going<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.590> be<00:03:17.650> going<00:03:18.550> into<00:03:19.000> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
week we're going to be going into the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.920 
week we're going to be going into the
more<00:03:19.690> complicated<00:03:20.020> aspects<00:03:20.740> of<00:03:20.920> particles

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
more complicated aspects of particles

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.480 
more complicated aspects of particles
because<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.320> order<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.590> talk<00:03:23.800> about<00:03:23.950> rotation

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
because in order to talk about rotation

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.100 
because in order to talk about rotation
over<00:03:24.670> lifetime<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.150> rotation<00:03:25.510> by<00:03:25.630> speed<00:03:25.960> I

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
over lifetime and rotation by speed I

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.950 
over lifetime and rotation by speed I
need<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.350> talk<00:03:26.560> about<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.970> render<00:03:28.270> tab<00:03:28.480> for

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
need to talk about the render tab for

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.810 
need to talk about the render tab for
unity<00:03:29.440> particles<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:30.160> we'll<00:03:30.370> be<00:03:30.460> going<00:03:30.700> over

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
unity particles so we'll be going over

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.120 
unity particles so we'll be going over
that<00:03:31.090> next<00:03:31.330> week<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.960> hopefully<00:03:32.620> everything

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
that next week and hopefully everything

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.650 
that next week and hopefully everything
goes<00:03:33.280> well<00:03:33.490> so<00:03:33.820> thank<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:34.300> everyone<00:03:34.510> for

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
goes well so thank you everyone for

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.870 
goes well so thank you everyone for
watching
