00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.230
 in what we have believed 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.560
 and know about that 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.410
 and also view of others also what sector 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.079
 those shortcomings 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.209
 here we have the arch 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.389
 primate of the races 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.889
 because it also consists of pollution 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.169
 that have been of 20 races we even saw the asset of the time that 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.169
 the ap the survivor of the favored races 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.819
 and again here is a drawing 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.449
 and he also knows it influenced a lot in the whole world 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.339
 There are so many prejudices 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:36.959
 between groups of people with different physiological aspects 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.320
 is some an example a kepa time to break forever 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.970
 yes, of them 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.990
 about races 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.590
 here we have two friends 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.740
 two 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.750
 Sudan sees them Australia 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.910
 obviously the white man 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.620
 it is decent senden se of the English 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.830
 they were there we were still 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.990
 the man the black skin 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.390
 expo vilely 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.170
 to for example d afp the beech 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.140
 you are very friends were compadres during the second world war 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.500
 when it was taking pictures 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.770
 now I'm not telling you a new thing but with the advance of time 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.550
 we grow old 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.880
 and also with 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.850
 the company and very high begin to fail 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.950
 parts of our body like this happened to the black man 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.070
 his kidneys began to fail 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 to such a degree that I needed to take 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.300
 from a kidney village 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.980
 I noticed that being a doctor 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.480
 to know that not anyone can donate their kidney to another person 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.960
 you have to take into account if blood institute 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.840
 to the capacity that is so big kidney 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.850
 donated 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.520
 kek so much the layer know if I saw kidney and various factors what do you think 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.860
 the man inm white 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.060
 donated his kidney to the black man 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.600
 and it was like 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.540
 admitted to the finger because we are of the same race 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.590
 we are grown by god 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.130
 if we have some small physiological aspects but we are of 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.220
 the same human race we are creation for that that is impressive 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.339
 Tamer has heard the story and the bible says 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.129
 in genesis 2 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.280
 about creation of women then says the Lord God 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.320
 and what yesterday deep sleep 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.759
 about adam 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.069
 and while he was sleeping 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.999
 all god one of his ribs and closed the letter instead 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:42.609
 and the rib that the Lord God took from the man made a woman 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.069
 and work to man 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.409
 for many 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.599
 think this gesture that this 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.019
 for a while this plus a parabola is a little story 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.799
 I think they change 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.669
 in it if it arose 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:57.949
 for example 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.609
 when you break an arm 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.209
 today one leg 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.199
 and the surgeon needs to graft 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.799
 massu bone for 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.179
 by third series ana fracture s 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.919
 every broken bone 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.799
 sometimes surgeons like you can see here all ribs is like a 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.069
 grid 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.609
 - the last ribs 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.779
 they are like bone tissues that extend 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.159
 Carefully remove a film about 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.959
 over ds rib 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.829
 cohort piece of bone you need 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.469
 certain 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.419
 the necessary place 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.959
 and in the rib that was removed 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.009
 duhalde to grow 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.919
 it's not wonderful is the creation by god this is what a story is 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.549
 a true story 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.699
 and also women the bread 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.230
 to us the males 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.370
 we do not lack yet with apostille 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.380
 bobbio to grow in adam 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.099
 and we want two ribs towers 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.229
 I say that creation is wonderful by God 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:09.619
 we want to do is leave the doctor the uat sheen that says 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:11.269
 the fossils 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.569
 creators of these family boats are so scarce 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.410
 so few 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.410
 that there are still more scientists than specimens besides scientists 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.389
 that there is some ever light AIDS 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.270
 the fact 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.190
 this nario contribution is that todd of physical obedience 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.539
 that we have for cumanÃ¡ refund 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.330
 what does not prove anything 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.389
 it can still be was this with extra space 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.189
 inside only up 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:42.040
 and there 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.680
 women 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.700
 there is no compromise nothing of human evolution no more is a credential 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.830
 and we also want to see 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.639
 what the bible says 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.090
 then said God we just annual names his image according to our 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.189
 likeness 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.740
 and it's in the tests the sea 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.169
 in the birds of the heavens and in the knowledge in all the earth 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.400
 and in every animal that crawled on the earth 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.509
 we are gold chest of God we have dignity 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.080
 how we were created 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.369
 they grew up applying those two beliefs to finish here 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.520
 I think we are going with the pollution according to the motion who am I 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.199
 Well, I am 95 kilograms of water and chemicals, where does it come from? 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.349
 of an explosion that happened a few 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.650
 understandable 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.949
 thousands of years 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.949
 because I'm here I do not have the bad idea 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.939
 where will you go after I die 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.939
 well bury me auat problems and chemicals 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.830
 who else answers burned motivation 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.830
 to survive and even to improve myself 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.740
 pamos given the creation 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.449
 according to creation 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.659
 who I am 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.129
 because I am a person and important I have made an image and likeness of my 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.189
 creator 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:01.569
 where does it come from 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.150
 I come from a creation 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.249
 smart and loving 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:06.759
 from god 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.069
 because I am here 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.719
 to know love and obey 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.619
 to my creator 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:14.910
 Where will I go 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.279
 after I die 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.129
 to live externally as Christ must Emilio decide to him 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.960
 back with my creator externally 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.480
 big difference 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.330
 how life looks inside of that 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.879
 point of reference tuppo point 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.409
 Of start 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:38.569
 that has been very important for us to know how we are creation by God 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.860
 what made them yesterday formed us 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.969
 and you deserve to ask yourself how can you believe 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.809
 that something biological like evolution human being 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:51.279
 or chemical occurred in the past 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.430
 that nobody ever albistur 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.930
 nor proven we have passed and not present 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.699
 we see variation in us so we see that there is a monkey and being a man 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:05.550
 man that being monkey 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.460
 we are still how we were created 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.979
 Kurtz the image of God 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:13.979
 God bless our product and if it touches us 

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:16.069
 offers 7 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.389
 about fossils a record of the past is important 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.180
 we know 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.599
 God bless you goodbye
