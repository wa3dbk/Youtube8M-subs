all it is you get that out now just like
that<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:33.169> you<00:04:33.260> just<00:04:33.410> pull<00:04:33.710> up<00:04:33.740> top<00:04:34.130> like<00:04:34.550> so

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
that so you just pull up top like so

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.409 
that so you just pull up top like so
and<00:04:35.139> this<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.830> toy<00:04:37.250> box<00:04:37.460> expansion<00:04:38.210> and

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
and this is the toy box expansion and

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.430 
and this is the toy box expansion and
look<00:04:38.600> I<00:04:38.810> was<00:04:38.990> right

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
look I was right

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.850 
look I was right
battles<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:41.030> then<00:04:41.210> all<00:04:41.419> you<00:04:41.570> would<00:04:41.720> do<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:42.169> guess

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
battles so then all you would do I guess

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.740 
battles so then all you would do I guess
is<00:04:42.919> boot<00:04:43.370> up<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.520> game<00:04:43.820> which<00:04:44.180> we're<00:04:44.510> totally

is boot up the game which we're totally
gonna<00:04:44.900> try<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.380> then<00:04:45.800> stick<00:04:46.160> this<00:04:46.340> here

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
gonna try this and then stick this here

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.330 
gonna try this and then stick this here

the power disks are going to go I

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.890

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
of Disney infinity 2.0 they came in like

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.200 
of Disney infinity 2.0 they came in like
this<00:05:11.720> huge<00:05:12.140> thing<00:05:12.440> so<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:13.550> kind<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:13.820> liked<00:05:14.000> that

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
this huge thing so I kind of liked that

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.360 
this huge thing so I kind of liked that
they're<00:05:14.450> actually<00:05:14.690> putting<00:05:15.230> things<00:05:16.070> that<00:05:16.250> you

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
they're actually putting things that you

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.520 
they're actually putting things that you
want<00:05:16.610> like<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.390> paint<00:05:17.600> backgrounds<00:05:18.440> you

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
want like the the paint backgrounds you

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.590 
want like the the paint backgrounds you
know<00:05:18.650> costumes<00:05:18.890> weapons<00:05:19.850> things<00:05:20.270> like<00:05:20.419> that

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
know costumes weapons things like that

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.390 
know costumes weapons things like that
everything's<00:05:21.500> right<00:05:21.590> there<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.190> if<00:05:22.280> you're

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
everything's right there so if you're

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.860 
everything's right there so if you're
trying<00:05:22.639> to<00:05:22.700> collect<00:05:23.000> stuff<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:23.450> is<00:05:23.630> a<00:05:23.660> lot

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
trying to collect stuff this is a lot

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.230 
trying to collect stuff this is a lot
easier<00:05:24.200> so<00:05:24.410> I<00:05:24.440> like<00:05:24.710> that<00:05:24.919> and<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:25.700> opens<00:05:25.820> just

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
easier so I like that and it opens just

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.510 
easier so I like that and it opens just
like<00:05:26.300> this<00:05:32.290> okay<00:05:33.290> it<00:05:33.380> does<00:05:33.560> not<00:05:33.710> open<00:05:34.040> just

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
like this okay it does not open just

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.010 
like this okay it does not open just
like<00:05:34.669> that<00:05:34.880> in<00:05:35.060> theory<00:05:35.300> so<00:05:35.600> these<00:05:35.750> are<00:05:35.930> the

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
like that in theory so these are the

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.380 
like that in theory so these are the
disks<00:05:36.430> I'm<00:05:37.430> not<00:05:37.669> going<00:05:37.790> to<00:05:37.880> take<00:05:38.060> these<00:05:38.240> out

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
disks I'm not going to take these out

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.940 
disks I'm not going to take these out
