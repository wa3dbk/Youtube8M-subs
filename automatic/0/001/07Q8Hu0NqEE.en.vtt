00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.550 
things and mike is always back in my
houses<00:01:53.520> after<00:01:54.000> they've<00:01:54.450> moved<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.900> whether

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
houses after they've moved in whether

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
houses after they've moved in whether
it's<00:01:55.799> two<00:01:56.400> weeks<00:01:56.640> later<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.270> year<00:01:57.450> later

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it's two weeks later or one year later

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.499 
it's two weeks later or one year later
for<00:01:57.990> some<00:01:58.110> touch-up<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.970> we<00:01:59.970> want<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> really

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
for some touch-up and we want to really

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.330 
for some touch-up and we want to really
reduce<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:01.140> smell<00:02:01.440> later<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:02.009> course

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
reduce that smell later of course

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.389 
reduce that smell later of course
because<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.470> off-gassing<00:02:04.470> paint<00:02:04.920> smell<00:02:05.190> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
because that off-gassing paint smell is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.280 
because that off-gassing paint smell is
not<00:02:05.550> good<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:05.850> deer<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.479> these<00:02:06.840> clients<00:02:07.229> are

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
not good for deer and these clients are

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.490 
not good for deer and these clients are
going<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.649> children<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> house<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
going to have children in the house and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
going to have children in the house and
they<00:02:10.500> can't<00:02:10.739> move<00:02:11.009> out<00:02:11.250> when<00:02:11.550> they<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
they can't move out when they do to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.880 
they can't move out when they do to
touch<00:02:12.150> up<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.319> during<00:02:13.560> construction

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
touch up like we can during construction

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.759 
touch up like we can during construction
so<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.730> zero<00:02:15.180> BAC<00:02:15.420> paint<00:02:15.930> helps<00:02:16.230> us<00:02:16.350> not<00:02:16.560> only

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
so that zero BAC paint helps us not only

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.009 
so that zero BAC paint helps us not only
during<00:02:17.070> construction<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.820> our<00:02:17.850> workmen<00:02:18.330> but

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
during construction for our workmen but

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.600 
during construction for our workmen but
afterwards<00:02:19.530> when<00:02:19.680> our<00:02:19.830> clients<00:02:20.190> are<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.400> there

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
afterwards when our clients are in there

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.310 
afterwards when our clients are in there
and<00:02:20.820> really<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.959> much<00:02:22.170> better

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
and really it's a much better

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.140 
and really it's a much better
environmental<00:02:22.890> paint<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:23.790> great<00:02:24.030> to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
environmental paint and it's great to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.490 
environmental paint and it's great to
hear<00:02:24.269> from<00:02:24.330> minds<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.989> it's<00:02:25.200> covered<00:02:25.470> with

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
hear from minds that it's covered with

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.610 
hear from minds that it's covered with
the<00:02:25.709> same<00:02:25.980> performance<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the same performance and as the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.140 
the same performance and as the
oil-based<00:02:29.160> paint<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.550> we've<00:02:29.700> used<00:02:29.910> for<00:02:30.000> a
