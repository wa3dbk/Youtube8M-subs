00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
to give it a little boost to establish a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.310 
to give it a little boost to establish a
good<00:03:58.370> root<00:03:58.610> system<00:03:58.640> and<00:04:02.860> yeah<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:05.170> there<00:04:06.170> is

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
good root system and yeah so there is

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.149 
good root system and yeah so there is
quite<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.620> bit<00:04:06.740> here

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.470 

hopefully<00:04:14.159> now<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.730> supposed<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.120> be<00:04:15.209> dry<00:04:15.450> for

here<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:42.020> had<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.050> guard<00:04:44.030> guard<00:04:45.030> broke<00:04:45.419> off<00:04:45.690> or

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
here I had a guard guard broke off or

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.129 
here I had a guard guard broke off or
knocked<00:04:46.919> order<00:04:47.539> whatever<00:04:48.539> you<00:04:48.720> want<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.960> call

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
knocked order whatever you want to call

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:59.080

it

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.159 

actually<00:04:59.900> call<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.169> hard

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.920 

not<00:05:04.830> big<00:05:05.069> deal<00:05:05.099> I<00:05:05.669> thought<00:05:06.029> it<00:05:06.090> broke<00:05:06.389> off<00:05:06.629> but

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
not big deal I thought it broke off but

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.379 
not big deal I thought it broke off but
actually<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.960> way<00:05:10.139> of<00:05:10.199> looking<00:05:10.560> at<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:11.389> think

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
actually this way of looking at I think

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.149 
actually this way of looking at I think
the<00:05:12.539> nuts<00:05:12.779> just<00:05:13.050> broke<00:05:13.379> that<00:05:13.409> bolt<00:05:13.889> itself

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
the nuts just broke that bolt itself

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.920 
the nuts just broke that bolt itself
croco<00:05:16.669> somebody<00:05:17.669> said<00:05:17.939> realistically<00:05:18.779> I

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
croco somebody said realistically I

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.420 
croco somebody said realistically I
should<00:05:19.169> just<00:05:19.259> go<00:05:19.439> ahead<00:05:19.529> and<00:05:19.650> replace<00:05:19.830> all<00:05:20.310> the

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
should just go ahead and replace all the

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.820 
should just go ahead and replace all the
guard<00:05:20.639> down<00:05:20.879> here<00:05:21.180> just<00:05:21.990> by<00:05:22.199> looking<00:05:22.590> at<00:05:22.680> the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
guard down here just by looking at the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.290 
guard down here just by looking at the
back<00:05:23.069> here<00:05:23.779> let's<00:05:24.779> see<00:05:24.960> how<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.139> swirl<00:05:26.300> pretty

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
back here let's see how it swirl pretty

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.399
