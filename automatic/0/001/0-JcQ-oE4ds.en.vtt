00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.720
 series that is called opening envelopes with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.160
 the big hair and I think that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.750
 let's do well let's go to what 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.920
 which is the store stickers so that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.680
 we find ourselves here as you can see 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.930
 I have 107 thousand coins and I have what they are 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.120
 two envelopes here to obviously open 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.230
 so let's start with these and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.989
 let's also open what is a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.590
 package that you already know is one of 40,000 no 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.810
 which is a new skin or monkey not so 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
 well let's go first with this 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.620
 package soldier at level 6 let 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.320
 quickly to see what we have to catch 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 our charge good or good at least 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.680
 they touched me of monitos good thing 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.510
 closing not but good 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.740
 I touched what is the lonely star 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.410
 what is the cap is common this skin is 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.780
 also desert glasses these glasses 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.180
 I like the truth is water puts right now 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.170
 and whether you're from my favorite monkey 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.020
 the crest says common is like a wet 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.700
 so I think it will cure and the monkey 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.790
 what I do not like is that you can not 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.130
