games and three is it always online so
let's<00:01:06.119> begin<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> last<00:01:08.159> one<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
let's begin with the last one is it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.990 
let's begin with the last one is it
always<00:01:08.820> online<00:01:09.290> no<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.369> play<00:01:11.610> movies

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000

you can play single-player games offline

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
you can play single-player games offline
but<00:01:14.820> they're<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> give<00:01:15.990> developers<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
but they're going to give developers the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.490 
but they're going to give developers the
capability<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.520> use<00:01:17.820> their<00:01:18.210> cloud<00:01:18.630> computing

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
capability to use their cloud computing

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.859 
capability to use their cloud computing
which<00:01:19.950> means<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.549> game<00:01:20.909> developers<00:01:21.210> can't

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
which means that game developers can't

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.130 
which means that game developers can't
can<00:01:22.200> actually<00:01:22.680> run<00:01:23.490> game<00:01:23.759> processes<00:01:24.509> from<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
can actually run game processes from the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
can actually run game processes from the
cloud<00:01:25.590> instead<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.130> actually<00:01:26.520> using<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
cloud instead of actually using the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.569 
cloud instead of actually using the
processing<00:01:27.450> power<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.500> Xbox<00:01:28.920> console<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
processing power on the Xbox console so

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.940 
processing power on the Xbox console so
that's<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.180> give<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.200> developers

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that's going to give you know developers

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.760 
that's going to give you know developers
all<00:01:32.159> sorts<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.750> wiggle<00:01:33.750> room<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.619> they

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
all sorts of wiggle room with what they

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.800 
all sorts of wiggle room with what they
want<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.180> means<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.570> any

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
want to do but what that means is any

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.060 
want to do but what that means is any
game<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.229> takes<00:01:37.380> advantage<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
game that takes advantage of a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249 
game that takes advantage of a
technology<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.060> where<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.600> cloud<00:01:39.900> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
technology like that where the cloud is

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.880 
technology like that where the cloud is
used<00:01:41.119> then<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.840> requiring<00:01:43.500> an

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
used then it's going to be requiring an

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
used then it's going to be requiring an
internet<00:01:44.310> connection<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.939> basically<00:01:45.360> it's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
internet connection so basically it's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
internet connection so basically it's
left<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> developers<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.280> decide

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
left up to the developers to decide

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
left up to the developers to decide
whether<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.689> game<00:01:48.869> will<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.259> always

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
whether or not the game will be always

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.940 
whether or not the game will be always
connected<00:01:50.280> or<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:52.350> next<00:01:52.590> big<00:01:52.740> question

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
connected or not the next big question

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.780 
connected or not the next big question
will<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.939> play<00:01:54.210> Xbox<00:01:54.840> 360<00:01:55.470> games<00:01:55.680> short<00:01:56.430> answer

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
will it play Xbox 360 games short answer

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.620 
will it play Xbox 360 games short answer
no<00:01:57.259> it's<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.280> play<00:01:59.399> Xbox<00:01:59.969> 360<00:02:00.450> games

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
no it's not going to play Xbox 360 games

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
game onto their hard drive so it looks

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.040 
game onto their hard drive so it looks
like<00:04:32.290> used<00:04:32.650> games<00:04:32.919> may<00:04:33.310> be<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.550> possibility<00:04:34.540> but

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
like used games may be a possibility but

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.590

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
big is that fee is the fee going to be

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.790 
big is that fee is the fee going to be
the<00:04:39.910> same<00:04:40.120> as<00:04:40.330> what<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.169> would<00:04:41.350> have<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.620> buy<00:04:41.770> a

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
the same as what you would have to buy a

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.860 
the same as what you would have to buy a
new<00:04:42.070> game<00:04:42.460> anyway<00:04:42.880> if<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.540> went<00:04:43.750> out<00:04:43.840> and

to phase out the disk to make it really

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.040 
to phase out the disk to make it really
just<00:04:56.979> a<00:04:57.370> code<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:58.330> buy<00:04:58.540> that<00:04:58.810> you

bit better and easier to deal with but I

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.529 
bit better and easier to deal with but I
thought<00:06:11.500> this<00:06:11.740> deserved<00:06:12.160> a<00:06:12.400> video<00:06:12.880> in<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.479> of

thought this deserved a video in and of

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.080 
thought this deserved a video in and of
itself<00:06:13.960> because<00:06:14.560> it<00:06:14.919> is<00:06:15.220> such<00:06:15.400> big<00:06:15.669> news<00:06:15.849> so

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
itself because it is such big news so

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.219
