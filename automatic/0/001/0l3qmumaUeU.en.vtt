00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.400
 asked for ideas of what to give 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.730

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.680
 dedicated to this to give you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.230
 some ideas 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.960
 then we start with gifts for him and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.760
 for her or romantic I wrote myself 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 everything and so now I tell myself then always 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.190
 according to my taste they are just ideas that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:48.989
 I try to give myself then it would be nice 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:51.629
 receive or give a ring that is or 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.840
 is not the engagement ring however a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:01.289
 ring I think is always something that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:07.350
 welcome a bracelet should not be 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:10.380
 necessarily valuable things but, lo 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 also regarding her and also 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.960
 give one that carries a little heart 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.720
 in my opinion also something romantic 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.820
 another thing I'd like is one 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.400
