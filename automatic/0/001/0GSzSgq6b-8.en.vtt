00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.390
 in a tranquility and a plus in this 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.390
 stage of the year 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.469
 if we start already the other week of the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.490
 presentation is apparently going to be the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.490
 30 that data 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.760
 only that rivals are that data goes 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 to give weak and Jose Suarez teacher very 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.609
 good morning on the subject of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.320
 reinforcements has not yet materialized 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.820
 it because it was voiced that josÃ© carvallo 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.130
 there was still a possibility that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.230
 come to him as he has been driving and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.149
 another what I said last week what 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 I reiterate today I worry about those who are 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.469
 here there are no names last week 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.010
 we are very advanced with some 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.350
 names already praised but while not 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.270
 is signed we will not anticipate anything 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.520
 Today we worry about putting a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.320
 the guys that are with us that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.300
 is what today takes away our sleep if 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.280
 well I think about the issue of two reinforcements 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.230
 in which the two reinforcements 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.440
 to see that we bring people dating 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.350
 with rhythm so that when it arrives it is not 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.960
 feel in another phase of training 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.520
 as they are already feeling the companions 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.520
 that are entering the rhythm of competition 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.509
 right now because they are right now 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.130
 we have more than 90% of the campus and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.860
 on the basis that it is on that basis 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.570
 sure we will think of a presentation 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.450
 we will start in the first matches of the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.039
 tournament would be foreign nationals that 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:38.080
 you can overtake the two players are 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:39.940
 extraterrestrial euros on some 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.399
 rivals if there are good rivals this 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.470
 good teams all some in a 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.030
 new process others that are already known 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.680
 since last year 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.770
 will be reading that group to be 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.110
 even and hope to be up to the job and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.720
 to be able to see how the first one is 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.790
 illusion of all the groups together the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.100
 three best 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.740
 yes but today football is this what 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.540
 We did the truth last year 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.330
 account for nothing does not give you any 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.770
 advantage is more up to a certain point is 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.470
 the disadvantage because everyone already sees you 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.420
 as a strong rival but it 's a 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.180
 new story every game is different 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.860
 and as such we are, you are not us 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.760
 we are preparing likes the system 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.760
 which is going to be used now 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.700
 and you have to respect it because it's proven 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.959
 that if I like it I do not like it it's not going to 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.450
 change in nothing if I do not see him much much 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.890
 meaning that going to the topic of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.640
 selection was appointed professor juan 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.990
 Carlos Oblitas as we say the part 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.310
 not the person in charge of the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.320
 sporting part what opinion deserves 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.360
 being let's say the person who is in the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920
 led in the selection when to repeat 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.440
 what I did last week if there is 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.050
 changes hopefully they light up so that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.430
 changes be 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.680
 important for the improvement but 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.650
 congratulate juan carlos a person 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.290
 Honest capable that I knew a lot is fine 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.720
 intentional today in this medium I think that 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:10.020
 does not abound a lot and Juan Carlos sure 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:13.050
 that plus of clarity of office and a 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.880
 person tries that makes us pretty good 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.550
 from that basis I think we start 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.230
 with advantage I hope you feel supported 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.410
 I hope they give all the conditions 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.880
 so you can do better what the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.430
 He has been working with 29 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.020
 players with how many will stay here and 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.630
 we go to a week or what has 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.490
 planned that does not bother me that's the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.490
 competition according to what surrender 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.430
 they do not have the truth we do not have 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.670
 no impediment that they are 22 23 29 and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.250
 30 with whom we want to stay with 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.930
 the best ones and on that we are going to decide 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.960
 I 'm not interested in the number I'm interested in 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.790
 yes there is internal competition and that's what 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.220
 they will mark their individual performance and 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.530
 mystical theme of the golero diego fields 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.390
 we see training and came more 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.340
 last week and I was in reserve 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.660
 since Monday we see it in the first 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.330
 team what opinion of it has something 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.280
 to tell us anything you do not command 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.050
 we make the decisions you 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.900
 throughout the tournament they will see who is 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.800
 whoever is not, I think that's not true 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.630
 he has to worry about them because 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:22.440
 here we are going to finish deciding 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:24.150
 we are pretty good is the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.810
 Real people, I'm very good 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.620
 predisposition this is one put the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.570
 value I think 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.320
 if we compare with last year we are 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.479
 a little step forward many things and that 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.550
 leave calm that's why we take it easy 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.960
 The reflections 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.960
 and thanks
