00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
okay so here's the grill what we

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.880 
okay so here's the grill what we
fabricated<00:00:29.310> using<00:00:30.529> aluminum<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> steel

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
fabricated using aluminum and steel

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.700 
fabricated using aluminum and steel
expanded<00:00:32.520> steel<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> protect

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
expanded steel this is going to protect

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.889 
expanded steel this is going to protect
the<00:00:34.829> intercooler<00:00:35.399> right<00:00:36.390> now<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.719> kind<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the intercooler right now it's kind of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
the intercooler right now it's kind of
ugly<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.590> unfinished<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.520> not

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
ugly because it's unfinished and not

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.490 
ugly because it's unfinished and not
painted<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.100> rusting<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.149> done

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
painted and rusting but when we get done

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.160 
painted and rusting but when we get done
should<00:00:43.500> look<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:43.710> good<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
should look really good so this is the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.270 
should look really good so this is the
custom<00:00:49.170> grill<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.500> we've<00:00:49.649> been<00:00:49.770> working<00:00:49.950> on

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
custom grill that we've been working on

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.020 
custom grill that we've been working on
and<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.350> looks<00:00:52.500> great<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.010> lot<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
and I think it looks great a lot of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.479 
and I think it looks great a lot of
people<00:00:54.440> may<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.590> feel<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> same<00:00:56.070> way<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
people may not feel the same way but I

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.619 
people may not feel the same way but I
don't<00:00:56.760> really<00:00:56.850> care<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.600> looks

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
don't really care I think it looks

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:50.610 
don't really care I think it looks
fantastic

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620
