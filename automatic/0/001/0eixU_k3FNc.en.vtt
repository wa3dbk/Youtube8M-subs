00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.450
 company yes it's about the g- 127 2 9 ac of 21 point five inches that also 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.750
 to allow us connected to a pc also has various entries for 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.470
 connect television signals including coax input 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.849
 the feared 127 double bac the yes allows us to enjoy an image of 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.750
 excellent quality in full hd resolution has input for connection 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.390
 digital pass of henry 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.160
 for which we can comment for example a game console in addition if 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.480
 we have digital cable signal we can connect it and use it to see 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.720
 digital television this model has good size with entry 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.060
 coax for those who own this type of television connection by 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.879
 cable used as a computer monitor is an excellent option 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.790
 for her and March 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.030
 since your resolution does not show all the details of a 3d game and has a 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.860
 very good time response plus possess of arland is of good quality 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.300
 sound so we do not need to connect some external 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.010
 by this characteristic we could say that it is ideal as a center of 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.510
 entertainment since you can only enjoy it as a full hd monitor 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.880
 and also like a television with remote control all this without occupying much 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.110
 physical space and at an excellent price externally we observe that it has a 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.390
 glossy black finish with an aesthetic detail in the part 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.960
 bottom of the red screen what's 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.680
 it was a termination with a modern and elegant style on the front of the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.860
 monitor inside the kill we found the speakers of the team that 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.110
 As we mentioned earlier they have good sound quality 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.180
 considering its size in the lower right corner it is in letters 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.650
 power indicator on the right side we can see the control panel 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.759
 of the monitor 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.310
 starting from top to bottom let's give it the imp button 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.899
 which allows you to select the input signal is rigid hdmi 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.409
 audio and video coax etc. etc. below is the button 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.409
 menu where we have adjustment and configuration options among others 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.110
 then we have the other in letter two buttons to control the cube volume 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.960
 towers to change channels and finally we have the power button 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.590
 to learn and stop the team it is clear that all these options are 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.080
 can also be accessed through the remote control that is included with the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.860
 unit under your buttons we found an audio output to be able to connect 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.980
 an 'orejuda' art a stereo audio equipment in the back we will see 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.030
 on the left side the input for the power cable to the current 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.310
 electric 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.560
 Right we have a panel where all the connectors of the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.870
 personal monitor a port hdmi a gate obesity tread to connect 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.350
 a computer an audio entry also to conquer club type for 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.459
 connect the sound of the computer 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.400
 an audio and video input composed of r audio and video files and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.940
 components finally we see an entry for coax cable for 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.989
 cable television, although when a large variety of tickets is available, 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.870
 missing the digital connection must and is the type of digital connection used 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.049
 by computers although the difference in quality with respect to the entrance of gea 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.430
 it would have been minimal to expect this type of connection to the right of the panel 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.159
 of connectors we observed a kensington slot to connect a cable 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.049
 of security and finally the lower center part we have a computer 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:23.909
 cables 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.560
 it's like an entrance where we can place 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.090
 and pass all the cables so that they remain in a coordinated and neat way 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.580
 holder has the same glossy black finish as the monitor and although 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.680
 has a weight of only 200 grams its design allows the assembly of the same 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.690
 very firm way as well as to cost 1 degree the inclination incidió 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.739
 horizontal although not of height 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.560
 another advisor included remote control that although it's simple allows me 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.700
 perform all the necessary actions and also include batteries for the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.120
 operation of it 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.010
 the monitor founded with him behaved like a space of 52 centimeters long 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.590
 by 40 centimeters high and 19 centimeters deep so 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.360
 does not need much space to be able to mount it we also have the option of 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.279
 acquire with support to be able to place it on a wall 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.879
 and thus occupy less space still talking now about the features 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.419
 of the screen has a size of 21 form 5 diagonal inches and a 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.160
 resolution 1920 by 1080 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.169
 which is what allows us to watch videos and movies in high definition 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.300
 full hd irán is the highest resolution available for game consoles and 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.280
 even to play movies in blu-ray format without loss of quality 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:34.509
 image has an aspect ratio of 16 over nine which 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.590
 allows you to watch movies in their original format without the annoying black lines 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.289
 that appear above and below the image, in addition the band has a treatment 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.580
 anti-glare to enjoy the images in bright places 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:50.109
 another important feature of the panel the sd the one that has a time 

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:53.619
 response time of 5 milliseconds is a good value to enjoy movies 

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:58.729
 of action with a lot of movement and even for fast 3d games without 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.179
 blurry images occur and the phantom effect ovo hussein the 

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:06.609
 Accessories that are included are the power cord the sadc tyc cable 

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:07.319
 look-out 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.309
 the remote control the batteries for the same the instruction manual of use 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:15.550
 an HDMI cable is not included so if we want to use digital signals 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.929
 of better quality we will be acquiring separately as well as the rest of 

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:24.659
 such as audio composite video and components in 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.730
 conclusion the 227 cilic double monitor of art 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.840
 is ideal to have it as part of a comprehensive entertainment center I know 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.600
 that we can have it connected to a PC and use it as a high monitor 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.510
 definition 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.000
 also with a game console to a blu-ray player and enjoy 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.540
 games and movies in full hd 1080p quality and also to use it as a 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.130
 television whether we have digital connection hrm icccpo television 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.510
 by coax cable and with the convenience of performing all the actions with which 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.030
 Count the monitor through the remote control 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.950
 all with excellent image quality with reflection surfaces and very good 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.200
 response time to avoid blurry images the most important thing the 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.430
 very convenient price since if we had to with the monitor of 21 5 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.000
 inches with speakers and a television with full hd resolution separately we 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.690
 it would cost almost twice as much and would take up twice as much space
