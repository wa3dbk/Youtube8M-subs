00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this is a jammer anyone which really

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990 
this is a jammer anyone which really
evens<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.619> my<00:01:55.799> skin<00:01:56.070> tone<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.520> i<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:56.640> have

find<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.310> helps<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> could<00:02:00.450> use<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
find that this helps but you could use a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.600 
find that this helps but you could use a
more<00:02:00.899> cleansing<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> clay<00:02:02.070> mask<00:02:02.280> if

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
more cleansing one like a clay mask if

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.700
