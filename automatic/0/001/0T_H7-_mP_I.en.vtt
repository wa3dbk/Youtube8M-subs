00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
by now it does have a fingerprint

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.950 
by now it does have a fingerprint
scanner<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> back<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.630> order<00:00:27.810> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
scanner on the back so in order to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.779

activate<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.680> fingerprint<00:00:29.279> scanner<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.580> need

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
activate that fingerprint scanner I need

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.849 
activate that fingerprint scanner I need
to<00:00:29.880> hit<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> home<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.080> power<00:00:31.260> button<00:00:31.560> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
implemented quick charge unlike the one

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.399 
implemented quick charge unlike the one
so<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:39.119> able<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.450> charge<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.380> battery

4.3 and sense 5.5 to close it the back
here<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.149> basically<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.560> hinges<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
here you basically put the hinges on the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.539 
here you basically put the hinges on the
left<00:01:53.399> drop<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.049> closes<00:01:55.549> unfortunately

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
left drop it and it closes unfortunately

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.539 
left drop it and it closes unfortunately
my<00:01:57.149> pre<00:01:57.420> production<00:01:57.600> unit<00:01:58.140> doesn't<00:01:59.040> close<00:01:59.340> all

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
my pre production unit doesn't close all

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
my pre production unit doesn't close all
the<00:01:59.670> way<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.060> does<00:02:00.270> snag<00:02:00.689> somewhat<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the way so it does snag somewhat on the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.880 
the way so it does snag somewhat on the
edges<00:02:01.979> here<00:02:02.840> I'm<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.170> hoping<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
edges here I'm really hoping that that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.960 
edges here I'm really hoping that that
gets<00:02:05.070> fixed<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:05.939> production<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:08.670> got<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
gets fixed in production you got the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.729 
gets fixed in production you got the
same<00:02:09.209> great<00:02:09.509> speakers<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> left<00:02:10.590> and

right grateful videos and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.900 
right grateful videos and
it<00:02:13.260> acts<00:02:13.590> really<00:02:14.720> acts<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.350> great<00:02:16.910> speaker

so<00:03:08.700> let<00:03:08.820> me<00:03:08.910> give<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> quick<00:03:09.360> size

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
so let me give you a quick size

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.120 
so let me give you a quick size
comparison<00:03:10.320> between<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.980> max<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.390> one

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.400 

4.7<00:03:17.130> inch<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:19.230> one<00:03:19.440> versus<00:03:20.930> 5.9<00:03:21.930> inch<00:03:21.959> on

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
4.7 inch on the one versus 5.9 inch on

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.630 
4.7 inch on the one versus 5.9 inch on
the<00:03:22.890> max<00:03:23.630> it's<00:03:24.630> dramatically<00:03:25.530> larger<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.910> size

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
the max it's dramatically larger in size

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.440 
the max it's dramatically larger in size
and<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:31.170> lose<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.500> lot<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.190> details<00:03:32.670> such

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
and you lose a lot of the details such

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.620 
and you lose a lot of the details such
as<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.720> diamond<00:03:34.230> cut<00:03:34.410> bezel<00:03:34.650> here<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.390> one

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
as the diamond cut bezel here on the one

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.320 
as the diamond cut bezel here on the one
that<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.560> wouldn't<00:03:37.860> get<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.910> one<00:03:39.090> match

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
that you wouldn't get on the one match

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.010 
that you wouldn't get on the one match
so<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:40.890> my<00:03:41.100> opinion<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.730> feels<00:03:42.239> cheaper<00:03:42.630> it

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
so in my opinion it feels cheaper it

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
so in my opinion it feels cheaper it
looks<00:03:43.230> cheaper<00:03:45.380> that's<00:03:46.380> basically<00:03:46.770> it<00:03:46.890> for

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
looks cheaper that's basically it for

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.250 
looks cheaper that's basically it for
the<00:03:47.310> quick<00:03:47.550> Hardware<00:03:47.940> walkthrough<00:03:48.510> now<00:03:48.989> let's

the quick Hardware walkthrough now let's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.640 
the quick Hardware walkthrough now let's
give<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.280> an<00:03:51.120> idea<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.750> how<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
give you a an idea of how the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.790 
give you a an idea of how the
fingerprint<00:03:53.370> scanner<00:03:53.670> works<00:03:54.630> in<00:03:54.930> terms<00:03:55.650> of

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
fingerprint scanner works in terms of

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.430 
fingerprint scanner works in terms of
setting<00:03:56.160> up<00:03:59.330> okay

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.400 

let's<00:04:03.130> get<00:04:03.520> in<00:04:03.700> here<00:04:04.920> fingerprint<00:04:05.920> scanner<00:04:06.220> I
