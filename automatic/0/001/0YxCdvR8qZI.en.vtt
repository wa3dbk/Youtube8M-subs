00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.340 
the sound and I like the UH the muffling
rings<00:03:58.880> because<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.540> really<00:04:00.050> gives<00:04:00.200> that

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
rings because it really gives that

dampen<00:04:01.220> Sam<00:04:01.910> because<00:04:02.210> I<00:04:02.330> don't<00:04:02.480> like<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.630> lot<00:04:02.810> of

overtones<00:04:03.440> from<00:04:03.770> each<00:04:03.890> drum<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:06.110> that's

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
overtones from each drum so that's

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.200 
overtones from each drum so that's
pretty<00:04:06.590> much<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:08.180> hope<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.930> enjoyed
