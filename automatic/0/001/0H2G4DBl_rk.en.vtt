00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.060
 at the end of the world where the 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.100
 patagonia where the continent ends 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.200
 an animal that has accompanied the man in 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.780
 the history of civilization lives in 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.059
 the most complete and absolute freedom no longer 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.470
 there are practically in the world corners 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.869
 that shelter this real show 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.359
 of nature valued by 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.130
 scientists by wildlife scholars and 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.599
 by those who defend and protect 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.750
 this symbol of the history of the 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 humanity are the herds of horses 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 wild 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.690
 this is the yendegaia ranch located in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 the commune of navarino are 38 thousand 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
 hectares that the entrepreneur acquired and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.199
 conservationist pithagoras tonkín in the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 90s and through its 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.089
 Degaña own foundation and gave the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.269
 Chilean state to build a park 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:58.079
 national the world was not forming 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.210
 mayoral national park then it is a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.250
 historical moment the former himself 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.229
 president sebastián piñera traveled to the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.210
 area on January 4 of this year and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.310
 symbolically received the documents 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.380
 that certify the donation but 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.990
 meanwhile papers a contract that to the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.330
 it seems nobody read and that nobody took in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.369
 this document that has just been 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.259
 publicly known a few months ago is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.490
 the one that has generated the outrage 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.950
 only of those who defend these 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.319
 horses that have been in these for 60 years 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.750
 mountains but also to the current 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.990
 authorities that to date did not manage 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.690
 this information the document is the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.399
 contract signed in July 2013 between 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.159
 the yendegaia foundation and a hunter 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.990
 miguel louis near rosemary to whom 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.130
 authorize you to marry and withdraw 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.200
 animals for living 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.869
 from the stay yendegaia called me the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.130
 attention because the horse hunt and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.810
 It also caught our attention because 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.030
 I think that for the first time in my life I see 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.039
 that a horse hunter appears with 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.289
 a formal contract now not a contract 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.939
 anybody because a contract originated 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.649
 in a foundation of such high prestige 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.090
 as the one that protects the lord 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.740
 the reasons that argues the own 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.049
 foundation in the document to take 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.550
 this controversial decision lies in 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.410
 that the horses and cattle that live 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.150
 the place are in a state of 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.459
 abandonment so they have lost their 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.440
 condition of domestic animals in addition 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.750
 of which they indicate they generate damage in the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.790
 ecosystem damage the flora and transmit 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.040
 diseases to species specific to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.739
 place this is the cause and in de gaia in 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.410
 an older distance and in the last 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.500
 austral stands of the world that has 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.880
 pastures and pasture sufficient to be able 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.489
 keep this horse in a rational way 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.760
 and sustainable what happens that the Anglos 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.560
 previous owners including the foundation 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.599
 they never invested in doing this management 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.040
 sustainable that is one of the issues that 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.890
 those who defend these argue 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.230
 unique examples in the world before 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.940
 is an entrepreneur in the zone who created 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.100
 horses and is the one who awoke the rejection 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.590
 absolute of this initiative a 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.720
 environmentalist foundation defending the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.880
 natural life because we have been to it 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.650
 permanently denouncing who we 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.570
 is doing inmate is making use of it 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.680
 what contract says is with hunting the and 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.930
 hunting those with medium that are 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.970
 with or without unacceptable ando the network in 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.340
 meshes and fishing nets 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.739
 hence, you saw a photograph of 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 horse fractured horses that has been 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.060
 pierced by dart with this flaw 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.040
 Extra you are using to hunt 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.720
 images are brutal is that the method 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.270
 of house that applies miguel close is 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.100
 ruthless in these images are appreciated 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.019
 fishing nets installed in 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.930
 nooks where the horses take 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.519
 to try to keep them tied and 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.739
 take them to those who can even 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.200
 corral and these are some of the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.110
 consequences horses split two 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.500
 injured by blows and others attacked by 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.870
 dogs 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.820
 in this other photo you can see the arches 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.270
 the crossbows on the hunter's back 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.330
 we do not know if they use anesthetics or 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.520
 another type of projectile witnessing said 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.830
 brutality is jose alvarado machuca 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.380
 until four months ago caretaker of the 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.330
 stay that until they hired the 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.190
 hunter as part of what I what 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.700
 that I found new out a horse that 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.960
 they are not wires that died because as 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.160
 holder with crossbow the other past 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.160
 and this that I found why 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
 terms 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:26.210
 look what he shoots one afternoon he found 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.669
 30 streets leaves because a vulgar shoe 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.680
 complete a horse that will die to a 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.810
 dead horse is not counted that coexisted 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.090
 with the wild herds for 17 years 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.190
 that the place conserves great pastures 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.410
 introduced by the ranchers that the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.729
 place is so big that he believes that the 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.729
 horses do not hurt 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.130
 I believe that we are a conaf entity that 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.470
 will take possession of the property once 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.360
 be fiscal on this controversial contract 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.430
 although they recognize that in some parks 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.039
 control of fauna external to the 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.639
 ecosystem the methods are totally 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.669
 different 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.100
 what but it is proceeded is the elaboration 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.470
 of a control program already and the 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.759
 control program obviously has several 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.710
 variables you have to control the 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:17.190
 population obviously that that population 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.470
 and not increase and gradually so 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.539
 gradual you have to start trying to 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.330
 control it and for that there are different 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.949
 tools that serve you the problem 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.599
 is that so that they are definitely of 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.580
 state may be several months 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.130
 issue that depends on the ministry of 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.960
 national goods we exposed justly 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.120
 to the minister of said portfolio this 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.460
 document to know your vision of what 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.460
 what is happening I heard your response 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.990
 you were in the knowledge d 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.970
 contract document from us 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.220
 killed with elements they did not know about the 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.780
 existence of this controversial contract that 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.729
 I said in passing has a duration of 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.740
 four years to hunt horses 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.120
 he argues that they received the dossier 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.400
 left by the previous administration 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.949
 that was analyzed and of which there is no 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.889
 repairs but this contract opens a new 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.960
 scenario this totally changed the 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.030
 government position I have taken in 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.710
 confidence the decision to interrupt the 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.319
 administrative acts to conform the 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.419
 signature of the donation contract while 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.979
 we do not have an answer from the 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.139
 foundation xente gai in relation to this 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.419
 matter that obviously can with 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.009
 reason to be cause for concern 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.930
 the ministry required immediately 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.669
 information to the foundation about it 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.860
 however the answers have not been 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.449
 satisfactory the doors are 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.849
 open but the minister wants 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.639
 transparency we contact and request 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.810
 an interview with the yendegaia foundation 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.090
 dependent on the pumalín foundation of 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.610
 dubbing tonkin but declined to refer 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.900
 to the subject in an email 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.300
 they indicated that all the knowledge is 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.130
 of the sag and conaf that all the 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.120
 permissions that is not being fired 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.340
 horses 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.800
 just driving them to get them out of the 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.290
 that will be a future national park without 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.120
 However the sag and conaf and the own 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.460
 Minister of National Property pointed out 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.650
 have no history of said contract 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.650
 and the most serious of the authorizations 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.840
 corresponding that should have 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.180
 the equestrian sports organizations 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.310
 they have already expressed their absolute rejection of 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.560
 this unprecedented hunt also those who have 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.229
 been for years observing these 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.030
 copies as the pia vergara photographer 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:19.860
 and he is one of the few people who has 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.620
 managed to get close to this kind of 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:25.320
 Horses in Patagonia worldwide 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.910
 above all there is as an appreciation 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.440
 much stronger than what's here in 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.750
 chili what it means to have a 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.000
 good wild hair because in the world 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.310
 there are very few if unfortunately 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.530
 days and weeks pass while in the 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.539
 last mountains of the world where before 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.820
 there was a stay where up to six months 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:44.030
 these horses ran free follow 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.650
 pursuing them in an absurd task 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.870
 considering that there are about 60 herds 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.120
 a thousand wild horses in the mountain range 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.949
 of darwin acclimated to the cold and 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.590
 true rain owners of these 

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:57.660
 beautiful landscapes inexplicably today 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.000
 and under the protection of an institution that 

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:03.169
 says to be an advocate of low nature 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.169
 Death threat
