00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
out of your tree go ahead and pinch the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.319 
out of your tree go ahead and pinch the
distal<00:02:01.500> ends<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:03.090> we're<00:02:03.180> going<00:02:03.299> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
distal ends like so and we're going to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.149 
distal ends like so and we're going to
go<00:02:03.420> ahead<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.570> put<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.009> remember<00:02:05.009> guys

it's all about tension we're going to go

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
it's all about tension we're going to go
from<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.280> side<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.879> branch<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
from one side of the branch on to the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.380 
from one side of the branch on to the
other

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
other

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.090 
other
it's<00:02:10.509> balancing<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.319> branches<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:11.890> I'm<00:02:11.980> going

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
it's balancing the branches so I'm going

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.470 
it's balancing the branches so I'm going
to<00:02:12.160> go<00:02:12.220> in<00:02:12.370> here<00:02:12.400> I'm<00:02:12.760> going<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.970> go<00:02:13.030> from<00:02:13.210> one

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
to go in here I'm going to go from one

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.860 
to go in here I'm going to go from one
side<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.250> other<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.790> that's<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.720> there

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
side to the other and that's in there

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.840 
side to the other and that's in there
just<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.560> now<00:02:18.280> with<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.580> devil

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
just like that now with the devil

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
classic though we have options so we can

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.880 
classic though we have options so we can
