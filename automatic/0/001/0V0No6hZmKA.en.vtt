they're round they'll be fine

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.310 
they're round they'll be fine
so<00:03:40.700> take<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> little<00:03:41.180> bit<00:03:41.360> at<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.540> time<00:03:41.600> like<00:03:42.050> a

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
so take a little bit at a time like a

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.790 
so take a little bit at a time like a
little<00:03:43.190> bit<00:03:43.310> bigger<00:03:43.550> then<00:03:44.470> it's<00:03:45.470> kind<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.680> like

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
little bit bigger then it's kind of like

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.740 
little bit bigger then it's kind of like
golf<00:03:46.040> ball<00:03:46.340> size<00:03:46.580> that's<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.000> size<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.390> like<00:03:47.570> to

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
golf ball size that's the size I like to

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.870 
golf ball size that's the size I like to
do<00:03:50.080> I'm<00:03:51.080> gonna<00:03:51.200> pop<00:03:51.440> them<00:03:51.680> in<00:03:51.830> here<00:03:51.860> I'm<00:03:52.700> gonna

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
just stick my skewer in here and if

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.370 
just stick my skewer in here and if
bubbles<00:03:58.430> come<00:03:58.700> up<00:03:58.910> in<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.239> steady<00:03:59.510> stream<00:03:59.900> then

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
bubbles come up in a steady stream then

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.290 
bubbles come up in a steady stream then
your<00:04:00.590> oil<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:01.100> ready<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:01.790> if<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.090> have<00:04:02.269> a

your oil is ready so if you have a

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.759 
your oil is ready so if you have a
thermometer<00:04:02.720> go<00:04:03.110> ahead<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.440> check<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769
