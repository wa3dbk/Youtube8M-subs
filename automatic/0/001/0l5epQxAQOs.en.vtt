that<00:01:09.000> everybody<00:01:09.570> else<00:01:09.780> overlooked<00:01:10.939> there<00:01:11.939> are

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that everybody else overlooked there are

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.230 
that everybody else overlooked there are
typically<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.659> reasons<00:01:13.619> why<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.240> overlooked

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
typically two reasons why we overlooked

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.469 
typically two reasons why we overlooked
talent<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> potential<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.240> first

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
talent and potential and the first

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.499 
talent and potential and the first
reason<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.240> see

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
reason is that we think that what we see

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.280 
reason is that we think that what we see
is<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> sprinter

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
is what we get so if we have a sprinter

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.440 
is what we get so if we have a sprinter
here<00:01:25.470> running<00:01:25.680> ten<00:01:26.009> six<00:01:26.310> under<00:01:26.670> 100<00:01:27.060> meters

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
here running ten six under 100 meters

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.890 
here running ten six under 100 meters
and<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.950> running<00:01:29.220> tenth<00:01:29.549> -<00:01:29.900> who

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and one here one running tenth - who

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.710 
and one here one running tenth - who
would<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> choose<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.119> majority<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
would you choose and the majority of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.480 
would you choose and the majority of
people<00:01:33.900> would<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> tension<00:01:35.130> guy

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
people would take the tension guy

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.630 
people would take the tension guy
because<00:01:36.090> he's<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> fastest

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
because he's the fastest

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.710 
because he's the fastest
xever<00:01:38.360> Francis<00:01:38.780> would<00:01:38.930> say<00:01:39.790> maybe<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.540> not

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
xever Francis would say maybe but not

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.440 
xever Francis would say maybe but not

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
basically train on its own and not in a

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.540 
basically train on its own and not in a
structured<00:02:08.630> way<00:02:08.720> at<00:02:09.050> all<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.500> paints<00:02:10.460> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.790 
different picture of the potential the
lesson<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.930> when<00:02:14.930> you're<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.500> spot

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
lesson is when you're going to spot

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.360 
lesson is when you're going to spot
talent<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:17.330> not<00:02:17.600> only<00:02:17.900> good<00:02:18.500> performance

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
talent it's not only good performance

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.880 
talent it's not only good performance
that<00:02:19.459> counts<00:02:19.790> it's<00:02:20.570> also<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.230> story<00:02:21.650> about

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890

that counts it's also the story about
the<00:02:22.490> performance<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.470> second<00:02:24.860> problem<00:02:25.010> we

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
the performance so the second problem we

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.760 
the performance so the second problem we
typically<00:02:25.670> face<00:02:26.000> when<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.570> are<00:02:26.660> going<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:27.080> spot

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.720 
typically face when we are going to spot
talent<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.209> we<00:02:29.450> tend<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.990> overrate

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
talent is that we tend to overrate

certificates<00:02:31.730> an<00:02:32.000> underrated<00:02:32.900> character<00:02:33.850> so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
certificates an underrated character so

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.060
