00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.099
 Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.830
 dear guests 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.370
 I've been known for 25 years 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 region kurdistan turkey syria irak a lot 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.340
 good and have been right on the spot 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.050
 as now the Jewish refugees of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.550
 the mpg these are the folks units in 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.949
 Syria from the Kurds and the PKK 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.800
 were freed and I still have 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.840
 the terrible pictures in front of your eyes and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.630
 looks saw tens of thousands 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.040
 Jewish refugees before the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.280
 killerbanden the iss self-proclaimed 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.670
 Islamic states fled are women 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.989
 have reported as their husbands 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.750
 limbs were massacred 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.760
 their sons were cut off 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.120
 executed there were hundreds of thousands 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.210
 from children to their whole family whole 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.879
 family has lost and there was massacre 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.439
 without end rape delays 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.420
 of thousands of women in the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.100
 slavery 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.710
 You can do it in a few words here 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 do not play what we experienced there 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.430
 and that's why I want one 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.060
 oppermann and mr. kauder here completely 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.220
 clearly we say the left ones are the ones 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.500
 the very last ones are not the right ones 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.509
 Customers the right of the customers here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.360
 they would deny that they were against 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.350
 defend and assassinate these murderous gangs 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.549
 We sit down 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.920
 because and yet I want to be here completely 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.530
 clearly say that weapons delivery in 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.020
 this region is not the right way 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.790
 there are plenty of weapons and me there 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.140
 I also want to give examples for that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.409
 already the weapons from the us to the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.229
 Iraqi army have been delivered in 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.829
 the hands of the calf's ss fell 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.990
 and they are not there with that 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.440
 he has been suggested for months like this 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.960
 rather 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.220
 They have been fighting there for years and man 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.160
 Just have to be very clear here 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.710
 say that these god-warriors are also in 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.080
 Germany and throughout Europe always as 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.140
 the opposition was designated 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.540
 as the rebels and thus has too 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.970
 Germany made it jointly responsible 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.180
 have been watching for years like 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.570
 This state could do it 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.960
 second example of iran equips the usa 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.470
 there for a long time and only in the 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.520
 June are the weapons of the Iraqi 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.280
 army without a fight in the mossul of it 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.250
 practically fallen in the hands in the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.640
 August the trade has now experienced the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.680
 Packers short for everyone in the beginning of August 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.830
 leaving the shangla region 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.620
 they have the seven defenseless there 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.040
 let it be and we have it too 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.440
 many refugees confirm that always 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.930
 again, above all jpg and pkk 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.570
 they have been the corridor for them 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.930
 have fought freely and who today 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.670
 to deliver missiles to Kurdish troops 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.010
 risk seeing that this 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.380
 weapons with the jihadists or 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.780
 possibly in the land it 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.370
 can and therefore i ask you can 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.120
 you even have that responsibility 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.239
 Take care of these weapon walks 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.310
 I can not control 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.720
 and a decisive part in the fight 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.940
 I already have that against it 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.800
 said in the army units 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.570
 syria and the pkk and not the 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.140
 us air force we've been so geriert 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.730
 they do not have tens of thousands he Yazidi 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.070
 who saved the life 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.080
 it was the flight corridor that was built 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.970
 has been and I will also 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.730
 oppermann still 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.650
 say very clearly if you and also 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.300
 of course we do not have to chew 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.000
 you still talk about Iran 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.980
 but also about syria to who this 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.340
 look at the map can see 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.820
 third from iraq a third from the bsr of 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.370
 Syria are in the hands of as &amp; s are 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.610
 fight as I said for a long time 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.240
 run and that can be for example 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.940
 Kurdish area in Syria Roger was 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.750
 for two years they have been defending there 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.310
 Kurds this region against the s and they 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.690
 are in front of all things also in hunger 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.910
 book exposed something quite restrictive of 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.370
 Turkey is enforced but unfortunately 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.690
 also from the bazany government that is 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.730
 they do not have it here with one 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.340
 to do united army of the Kurds 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.320
 but only with one and that 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.810
 Many Kurds also told me that 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.430
 you wish that more pressure on 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.610
 ankara is exercised 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.220
 because Ankara and Turkey support 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.220
 the statisticians and jerez for example 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.419
 Weapons become weapons there 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.360
 made the limit 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:59.590
 There are own border crossings there 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.190
 He is under law 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.430
 to be controlled 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.190
 and there are always wounded ones 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.960
 esd in turkish hospitals 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.150
 I can also help you 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.229
 Unfortunately, meal is long 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.850
 for this contribution 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.490
 but I just want to be clear 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.380
 if you want to achieve something 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.900
 You have to be against it first 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.770
 make sure that too 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.630
 the roads stopped are like weapons 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.700
 These people come as you do them 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.540
 can control and that includes 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.970
 the nato partner turkey under pressure too 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.540
 finally put up with this support 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.540
 to make a conclusion 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.249
 even the day's topics have some in mind 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.179
 days reports how traffic there 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:52.610
 between ds and the turks over the 

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:55.129
 border is constantly open and the 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.259
 Turkish borders must be yours 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.719
 are tied against these men and the 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.849
 I already told him that grabs 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:05.179
 your turn with the nato states 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.999
 turkey and the terrorbanden he is worth 

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:10.999
 really believable it wants to fight 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:13.159
 must first dense these supply lines 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:16.550
 and that does not mean any 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.949
 weapons more to the states like Saudi 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.959
 to send arabia or qatar or the 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.749
 turkey you are really the one 

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:25.729
 main supporter of the is and it is 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:29.509
 but really unbelievable my ladies 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:31.759
 and gentlemen that we calculated it 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.050
 here in Germany did not forbid 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.749
 let alone that on the 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.969
 eu terrorist list stands instead 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.800
 the pkk the most obvious 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:42.169
 saved the lives of thousands of people 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.529
 and that shows for me here as well 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:47.809
 a tremendous hypocrisy to her of this policy 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:50.619
 if suddenly the quotas now discovered 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:52.999
 and you want to give him weapons 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:55.610
 behind it is also what if you ask 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:58.039
 why should it biel mr 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.110
 And these are the weapons by megaphone 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.149
 get and bazany then you have to 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.759
 clearly how cool it is here 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:07.759
 the oil around the oil business with turkey 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:10.099
 already provides Bazany against 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:13.999
 government in Baghdad against the will 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:16.579
 there to turkey and i think so 

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:18.499
 Once again it's all about oil and oil 

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:20.689
 less about human rights and 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:22.669
 people what they pretend to be here 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:23.689
 Otherwise I would like to conclude 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:26.260
 make it clear once 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:30.540
 Of course we support 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:33.250
 Humanitarian aid no question at all 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.960
 on the contrary, much more 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.750
 claim as it has been decided here 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.080
 is for ideas for the iraq and for 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:44.620
 Syria and we especially want that 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:47.500
 heirs were lifted against song 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.570
 In Syria this is really a hunger 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.600
 There is nothing embargoed 

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.910
 Medication hardly he studer and therefore 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.550
 we want that embargo lifted 

00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:00.400
 and I ask her too 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.800
 volatile program something here already 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.330
 is addressed construction of al kaida me 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.890
 consider it urgently necessary that 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:14.890
 Refugees recorded in Germany 

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:18.360
 gerda hasselfeldt is the next one 

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.360
 speaker for the cdu / csu group
