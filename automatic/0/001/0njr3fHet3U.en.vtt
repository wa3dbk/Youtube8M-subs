00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
best out how he loses in d if it's a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.650 
best out how he loses in d if it's a
great<00:01:33.110> competitive<00:01:33.680> fight<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.850> don't<00:01:35.630> think

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
they're looking at it they're taking

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.150 
they're looking at it they're taking
things<00:01:41.990> fight<00:01:42.260> by<00:01:42.440> fight<00:01:42.710> with<00:01:42.920> Floyd

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
things fight by fight with Floyd

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.680 
things fight by fight with Floyd
Mayweather<00:01:43.190> in<00:01:44.000> their<00:01:44.150> head<00:01:44.300> are<00:01:44.540> they

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
Mayweather in their head are they

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.969 
Mayweather in their head are they
already<00:01:44.960> trying<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.380> get<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:45.680> next

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
already trying to get that next

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.130 
already trying to get that next
opponents<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.940> down<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.330> road<00:01:47.510> you're

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
opponents and down the road you're

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.810 
opponents and down the road you're
always<00:01:48.440> doing<00:01:48.619> that<00:01:48.770> I<00:01:48.830> guess<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> promoter

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
always doing that I guess is a promoter

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.690 
always doing that I guess is a promoter
and<00:01:50.300> I<00:01:51.050> think<00:01:51.680> they<00:01:51.800> would<00:01:51.979> like<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.340> not<00:01:52.490> think

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
and I think they would like to not think

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.070 
and I think they would like to not think
that<00:01:52.790> way<00:01:53.030> because<00:01:53.240> they<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:53.690> high<00:01:53.900> hopes

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
that way because they have high hopes

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.050 
that way because they have high hopes
for<00:01:54.260> Canelo<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:55.550> it's<00:01:55.700> an<00:01:55.820> interesting

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
for Canelo and it's an interesting

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.850 
for Canelo and it's an interesting
relationship<00:01:56.360> now<00:01:57.050> with<00:01:57.080> golden<00:01:57.530> boy<00:01:57.710> in

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
relationship now with golden boy in

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.070 
relationship now with golden boy in
Mayweather<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:59.030> know<00:01:59.149> that's<00:01:59.600> good<00:01:59.750> oh<00:01:59.840> hi

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
Mayweather you know that's good oh hi

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.690 
Mayweather you know that's good oh hi
I'm<00:02:00.229> let's<00:02:00.440> face<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.800> alone<00:02:01.009> you<00:02:01.430> know<00:02:01.550> we

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
I'm let's face it alone you know we

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.980 
I'm let's face it alone you know we
certainly<00:02:02.030> feel<00:02:02.180> bad<00:02:02.450> about<00:02:02.570> his<00:02:02.780> current

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
certainly feel bad about his current

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.380 
certainly feel bad about his current
situation<00:02:03.740> coming<00:02:04.220> out<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.670> predicting<00:02:05.270> that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
situation coming out and predicting that

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.580 
situation coming out and predicting that
Canelo<00:02:05.690> would<00:02:05.930> win<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.410> don't<00:02:06.530> know

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
Canelo would win that I don't know

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.830 
Canelo would win that I don't know
whether<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.860> was<00:02:07.100> for<00:02:07.340> shower<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.720> know

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
whether that was for shower you know

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.540 
whether that was for shower you know
either<00:02:09.170> way<00:02:09.470> when<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.770> promoter<00:02:10.100> does<00:02:10.340> that

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
either way when the promoter does that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.240 
either way when the promoter does that
it<00:02:10.670> aligns<00:02:11.120> himself<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.040> it's<00:02:13.190> an

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
it aligns himself and so it's an

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.190 
it aligns himself and so it's an
interesting<00:02:13.459> relationship<00:02:13.940> between<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.959> two

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
interesting relationship between the two

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.370 
interesting relationship between the two
but<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.820> think<00:02:16.910> they're<00:02:17.750> concentrating

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
but I so I think they're concentrating

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.900 
but I so I think they're concentrating
on<00:02:18.470> Canelo<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.040> golden<00:02:19.310> boy<00:02:19.400> people<00:02:19.760> but

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
on Canelo the golden boy people but

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.550 
on Canelo the golden boy people but
clearly<00:02:20.239> there<00:02:20.750> probably<00:02:21.050> have<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.230> mind

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
clearly there probably have a mind

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.010 
clearly there probably have a mind
toward<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.950> winner<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.250> Matisse<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.020> Garcia

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
toward the winner of Matisse and Garcia

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.640 
toward the winner of Matisse and Garcia
being<00:02:24.320> a<00:02:24.410> possible<00:02:24.920> opponent

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
being a possible opponent

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.530 
being a possible opponent
we<00:02:26.159> have<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.579> how<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.909> one<00:02:27.090> plays<00:02:27.150> out

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
we have to see how this one plays out

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.230 
we have to see how this one plays out
