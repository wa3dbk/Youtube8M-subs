00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.920
 apples cheeks 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.400
 and only then apply tonal 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.250
 foundation on the face this technique makes 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.780
 the blush is very natural to break through 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:42.619
 from the inside I like to use 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:44.990
 the base under the shade of mary kay is her very 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.320
 I put a thin layer on the skin under 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.250

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.570
 clog folds and he will go to bed 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.729
 very even layer and of course powder 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.729
 skin with light blotting movements 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.130

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.250

 put on the center of the century 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.690
 do this wet application 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.000
 because it will allow to manifest all 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.670

 put a dark shade 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.540
