00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
folders it's to pick two panes why would

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
folders it's to pick two panes why would
you<00:00:58.079> want<00:00:58.260> two<00:00:58.530> panes<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> same<00:00:59.309> window

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you want two panes in the same window

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.180 
you want two panes in the same window
well<00:00:59.940> let's<00:01:00.480> say<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> want<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> copy<00:01:01.289> these

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
well let's say you want to copy these

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.910 
well let's say you want to copy these
files<00:01:02.250> from<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:03.180> over<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:03.989> well<00:01:04.650> then

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
files from here over there well then

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.109 
files from here over there well then
you'd<00:01:05.040> normally<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.670> open<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:05.970> two

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you'd normally have to open up two

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.030 
you'd normally have to open up two
windows<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.900> through<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.290> complicated

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
windows or go through some complicated

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.600 
windows or go through some complicated
you<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.119> mess<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.740> scripts<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.220> clicks

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you know mess of scripts or right clicks

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.980 
you know mess of scripts or right clicks
I<00:01:11.729> mean<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.479> much<00:01:12.540> easier<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.900> have

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I mean it's just so much easier to have

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
I mean it's just so much easier to have
two<00:01:13.260> panes<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> same<00:01:14.850> window

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
two panes right there in the same window

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.770 
two panes right there in the same window
and<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.960> cross<00:01:16.200> platform<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> gonna

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and it's cross platform and and it gonna

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
and it's cross platform and and it gonna
cost<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> thing<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.130> files<00:01:20.310> are

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
cost you a thing all the files are

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
cost you a thing all the files are

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.380 
let's see what we have
okay<00:03:40.260> I'm<00:03:40.380> gonna<00:03:40.530> trust<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:40.980> certificate<00:03:41.580> look

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
okay I'm gonna trust a certificate look

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.860 
okay I'm gonna trust a certificate look
at<00:03:42.480> that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
at that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.960 
at that
it's<00:03:43.410> pretty<00:03:43.800> much<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.160> looks<00:03:44.370> exactly<00:03:44.550> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
it's pretty much it looks exactly the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.490 
it's pretty much it looks exactly the
same<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.690> utility<00:03:45.930> that's<00:03:46.260> running

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
same as the utility that's running

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.699 
same as the utility that's running
locally<00:03:47.489> it's<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.510> same<00:03:48.690> thing<00:03:48.930> only<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.560> just

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
locally it's the same thing only it just

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.590 
locally it's the same thing only it just
launched<00:03:50.100> directly<00:03:50.310> from<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.850> website<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:53.250> I

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
launched directly from the website so I

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.699 
launched directly from the website so I
don't<00:03:54.600> know<00:03:54.690> what<00:03:54.810> else<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.080> say<00:03:55.260> there's<00:03:55.620> a

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
don't know what else to say there's a

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.199 
don't know what else to say there's a
few<00:03:55.980> options<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.550> you're<00:03:56.730> gonna<00:03:56.820> be<00:03:56.970> able<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
few options that you're gonna be able to

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.500 
few options that you're gonna be able to
trip<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:57.930> there<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:59.250> does<00:03:59.519> run<00:03:59.820> in<00:03:59.880> Java<00:04:00.239> which

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
trip in there it does run in Java which

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.390 
trip in there it does run in Java which
for<00:04:00.870> some<00:04:01.080> people<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.470> kind<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.680> like<00:04:01.830> EE<00:04:02.070> it

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
for some people is kind of like EE it

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.670 
for some people is kind of like EE it

that it was built with I guess in the if

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.930 
that it was built with I guess in the if
you<00:04:35.190> remember<00:04:35.600> way<00:04:36.600> back<00:04:36.630> when<00:04:37.070> Norton<00:04:38.070> had<00:04:38.520> a

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
you remember way back when Norton had a

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.780 
you remember way back when Norton had a
program<00:04:39.330> called<00:04:39.510> Norton<00:04:39.930> commander<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.790> so

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
program called Norton commander and so

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.330 
program called Norton commander and so
that<00:04:42.660> kind<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.170> went<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.410> way<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.800> dodo<00:04:43.980> it

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
that kind of went the way of the dodo it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.150 
that kind of went the way of the dodo it
no<00:04:44.460> longer<00:04:44.640> exists<00:04:45.480> but<00:04:46.410> some<00:04:46.710> people<00:04:46.950> still

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
liked the Norton commander instead of

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.700
