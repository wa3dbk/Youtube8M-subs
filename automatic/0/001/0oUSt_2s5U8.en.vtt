00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.149
 and in this video tutorial we'll talk more 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.549
 with you about engines 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.680
 let's sort such moments as volume 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.260
 engine talk about power 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.260
 engine pro torque and pro 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.420
 fuel consumption and so engine size 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.390
 car can by engine size 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.580
 divided into 3 groups 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.850
 the first group is the subcompacts 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.200
 cars whose engine size is less 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.169
 one and a half liter 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.239
 average lead horns whose volume 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.180
 engine from one and a half to two 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.900
 half a liter and over two 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.750
 half liters is a big lead horns 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.510
 fuel consumption well, if pretty 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.380
 not to dress strongly 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:55.410
 then in the city mode subcompact 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:58.750
 consume up to 9 liters an average of 6 7 liters 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.320
 average liter of fuel consumes from 9 to 14 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.790
 liters 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.439
 large lead horns from 14 to 25 on average 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.709
 and higher 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:12.639
 what I would like to say about the small car 

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:14.799
 here there is such a nuance let's say 

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:16.539
 to such a car with a small 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.590
 engine capacity to keep in general 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.740
 flow in the city 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.130
 need to maintain higher momentum 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.689
 that is, put more pressure on the gas pedal 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.719
 switch more often to reduced 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.270
 transfer more spin the engine 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.130
 accordingly, consumption will increase 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.819
 fuel so small motor 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.029
 have a hard time especially when still 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.889
 turn on the air conditioner which takes 

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.959
 10-20 percent of the power then such 

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:47.139
 the engine will significantly lose accelerating 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.919
 dynamics and if you plant another 4 more 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:51.520
 human 

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:54.069
 then there is the normal acceleration a 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.469
 the engine will need to spin up 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.229
 four five thousand revolutions 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.189
 which is fraught with increased fuel consumption 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.739
 and 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.469
 engine wear but still in 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:08.200
 urban cycle such a car he 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.630
 will be more economical than average 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.319
 stained glass to as regards fuel consumption on 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.380
 track 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.200
 then let's say with average speed 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.810
 car traffic is 80-90 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.910
 kilometers per hour like a car with 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.620
 small engine size and 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.400
 car with a large engine 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.260
 is almost the same rate as the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.970
 there is again if we allow small car 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.980
 included air conditioning sit four 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.250
 man but the expense will be 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.270
 but certainly not less than the average 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.610
 grass car 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.610
 as for the average liter jack and 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.020
 big liter jack in the city 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.220
 significant difference in gas mileage 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.800
 if we take the track we are on our own 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.190
 cars checked ford focus 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.570
 engine 1 and 4 at speed 120 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.790
 kilometers per hour on board computer 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.350
 showed consumption of 9 and 3-9 and 6 liters and 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.480
 audi a6 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.250
 whose engine size is significant 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.480
 more than four and two liters 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.910
 + all-wheel drive fuel consumption was 9 and 1 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.770
 liter on the highway middle liter of big 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.790
 liters of liquid they spend practically 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.310
 the same amount of fuel at 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.940
 higher volume engines 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.090
 in the sense that less so let's say 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.000
 stiffens the engine and so what about 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.680
 It depends on accelerating dynamics of the car in 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.990
 First , of course, it depends on 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.780
 power here is the amount of horsepower 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.470
 also an important parameter exists 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.960
 such as 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.740
 rpm number of revolutions 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.240
 engine 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.670
 and if you look at the characteristics 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.220
 any car manufacturers 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.310
 indicate power 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.500
 horsepower per revolution per minute given 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.520
 the maximum power that is there 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.690
 it is indicated it is possible only when 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.590
 certain turns that is just 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.900
 at the same speed as indicated by 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.750
 manufacturer if the turnover will be less 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.209
 below it and under the pedal you will not 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.550
 full motor power for each 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.860
 car can build such a schedule 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.920
 that is, we see here that the maximum 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.260
 power on apr 4 and a half thousand 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.350
 turns and we see that approximately 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.020
 at two thousand revolutions there is only 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.680
 half of all this power which 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.900
 engine available 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.720
 that is, in normal city mode if 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.870
 you will move around the city ​​somewhere average 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.880
 the engine spins from 2 to 3 thousand 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.460
 turns respectively under your pedals 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.710
 approximately half of all 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.050
 the power that the engine has 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.810
 to get maximum power you 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.570
 will need to spin the engine exactly 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.600
 up to four and a half thousand RPM and 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.169
 on top of the specified torque on the blue 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.289
 line torque it characterizes 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.090
 the speed of the revolutions that is what 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.940
 higher torque the faster 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.270
 engine revs lower chart 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.210
 he tells us fuel consumption times 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.090
 optimal fuel consumption will be from 2 to 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:18.080
 3 thousand revolutions on this chart 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.000
 well, on average, approximately given 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.580
 schedule it fits most 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.020
 cars that is on the tachometer which 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.440
 located near the speedometer 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.919
 car can be drawn visually 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.479
 two ranges is an economical range 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.300
 that is, two to three and a half 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.919
 thousand revs where fuel consumption will be 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.139
 minimal and 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.440
 range of three and a half to 6000 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:45.260
 turns which will provide you 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.650
 better acceleration of the car but 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.479
 increased fuel consumption is not to say that 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.440
 engine power it depends 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.289
 from volume 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.979
 they are making a very small engine now 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.930
 and very small volume which have 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.210
 pretty impressive power 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.430
 also put turbines on the engine 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.030
 there are also other various 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.139
 moments of increase in engine power 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.289
 if we talk about some optimal 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.789
 ratio 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.520
 given the transport tax 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.530
 the value of which depends on the quantity 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.530
 horsepower on your car then 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.169
 Probably the power will be optimal 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:27.229
 150 horsepower is the most purchased 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:30.440
 cars with engine displacement in 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:33.139
 an average of 2 liters and surely you 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.330
 heard such abbreviations title 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:39.590
 engines like for example 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.900
 on the Toyota in tc oh so engines that 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.620
 used on honda and so on these 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.990
 consoles 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.139
 mean the presence of phase systems 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.520
 gas distribution 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.360
 such engines have decent 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.030
 power 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.659
 with a fairly small amount 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.389
 engine 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.939
 hence they are economical i.e. 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.860
 the ratio of savings and power in the data 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:04.370
 engines it is very, very even 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.870
 good in this video tutorial all go 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.870
 to the next video lesson
