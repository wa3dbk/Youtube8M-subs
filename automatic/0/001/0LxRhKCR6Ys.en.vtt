00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 so in fact when we studied the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.730
 teaching methodologies to us 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.929
 have seen several methods herved the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.090
 manga method is long 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.230
 alfred cortot there were a lot of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.330
 German methods escada 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 that is to say, we were given 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.109
 very broad vision and after everyone has 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.090
 chose what he prefers but there was 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.289
 a method that has been strongly 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.390
 advisable 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 I absolutely agree with with 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.610
 the round tips actually I 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.969
 only use that with beginners 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.520
 it's a step back from the pieces 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.230
 of a man who was called in art myers 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:48.530
 because it was a great concert performer has to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 both poet is both painter and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.710
 after the death of her husband after 30 years 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.199
 of concert career and has 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.770
 entirely devoted to the education of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.500
 students 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.059
 she taught both in two 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.189
 schools for children located in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.549
 montrouge and in the school near 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.240
 conservatory tchaikovsky and at school 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.100
 mini shrink and among his students pay 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.810
 the greatest current pianists by 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.040
 example Ashkenazi a plate that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:26.159
 do not forget dead in cases the last 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.900
 the youngest who won contest there 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.280
 had three laureates of the greatest 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.939
 international competitions 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.740
 so he proved it by his results that 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.170
 what she does it works all 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.810
 it just works for sure 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.610
 very interesting it's very musical 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 know exactly what a 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.479
 piece and this method lafay to the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.090
 end of his life the habit 83 years is 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.530
 just before his death with his disciples 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.630
 and his assistants and the two meets 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.720
 pitfalls first went for the first 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.110
 year it's true 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.950
 from the first step and second 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.470
 it's for 2nd 3rd and 4th years but is 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.710
 which corresponds for the Russians to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.540
 first four years to 4 4 hours per 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.160
 day in rhythm - in goumois 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.990
 intensive it can correspond to 6 this 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.020
 year that is all that he has 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.570
 did and he did that with his own 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.610
 experience in stroller side job of 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.280
 when you read what he writes he 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.459
 does not claim to have the answer to everything 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.410
 she simply chose and attest 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.440
 on several children and that's what 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.610
 works best 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.350
 second thing that is very interesting 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.670
 in this method what the first 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.220
 thing that matters is the music to 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.020
 from first piece to you have the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.740
 different character the sounds 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.360
 different 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.880
 it's the real music that starts all 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.040
 right away because the other methods 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.110
 that I see that there are thousands of 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:02.380
 thousands it's very difficult 2 to 2 2 me 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.810
 be yesterday a few something because 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.900
 in fact most of the methods are 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.340
 easy pieces where there are melodies 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.739
 in the right hand 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.320
 agreements in the same cause whatever 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.470
 very common thing it's so much I 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.420
 have to say he knew nowhere because 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.910
 that actually when you are his pieces 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.670
 or face they forgive years of which 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.800
 side there is that on the other side there is the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.420
 true pianism there is no report 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.930
 between the two there is no bridge that 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.470
 leads from one side to the other side while 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.260
 at home as this method it is 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.090
 as she is and concertist so for 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.650
 she first resort with a go 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.709
 it was the first step in a 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.660
 precise direction at it's advanced and so 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.019
 I will show you one after the other 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.750
 why because all my friends 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.140
 musicians 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.290
 when they have children that still poses 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.730
 problem of finding our teachers and 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.380
 I always tell them that you can 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.980
 do it yourself especially when you are 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.840
 musician 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.360
 even if you're not a musician if you 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.100
 have already done a few years of piano 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.970
 you can help your children to 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.890
 start from scratch with with sweets 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.630
 explanations you can start with 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:21.720
 besides to artur mas risk and the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.950
 most of the time moms studied with 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.940
 childhood z 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.830
 because it said that on one side it creates 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.530
 ties 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.120
 two sides that allows mom to follow 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.790
 exactly what's going on with his 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.460
 child and understand what is it 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.320
 doing and it will go up to 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.240
 the child that there is no age for 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.160
 learning is never too late 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.930
 and that's always the goal 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.530
 so here I am going to start from 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.540
 of the first piece which when does that 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.810
 I wanted to say that today I'm going 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.930
 save the beginning of the method for 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.910
 beginners really two first 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.740
 piano top approaches because 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.990
 I kept and on the internet what is it 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.640
 that there is for beginners and it's a 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.930
 little anything and forever the world 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.789
 in fact 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.530
 leveled because the methods 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.770
 piano learning there is 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.840
 since a long time ago there are already 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.550
 methods that have proven 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.520
 efficiency is really what we 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.289
 calls in France the sure values he 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.240
 knows all that is to say that they have 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.009
 if the first step the second pan of the 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.039
 third, we know very well that 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:41.669
 blacks here and we see in one direction 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:44.430
 very precise in advance and has acquired a 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.289
 what time we play and what 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.740
 what we want is to do and there I fall 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:52.860
 on really competent things that 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.630
 get nowhere is very weird because 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.990
 that for example added I fell on the 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.240
 video where sir very seriously has 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.889
 conquered the rules of pianism that 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.310
 is called the period rules 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.690
 even he says things 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.320
 exactly what not to do because 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.349
 that he says that for example he says he 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:20.909
 must stay in this area 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:22.800
 there keys but touch these rooms 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:24.479
 to all that is the whole length 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.720
 when I see the methods that offers 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.720
 to develop it play somewhere here 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:36.389
 cc it's not feasible in addition she says 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:39.060
 that we must play with the right and that the 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.590
 rest of arms must remain motionless 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.110
 that I would like to know how he wants 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.979
 play with his rules to him how she 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.979
 will handle that for example 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.900
 I propose to stay in this area 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:07.139
 there he did not move his arms he moved 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.550
 just anything so in fact 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.539
 I think today we will start 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.759
 really revisit the most method where the 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:16.800
 effective lawn that exist and that has 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:19.430
 proven effective and you will see 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.430
 what do you mean
