00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
product after finished off soldering

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.780 
product after finished off soldering
these<00:02:44.580> two<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:46.220> we<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:47.490> ahead<00:02:47.610> and

these two in we can go ahead and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.930 
these two in we can go ahead and
download<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.360> app<00:02:48.480> zaza<00:02:48.960> remote<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.940> works
