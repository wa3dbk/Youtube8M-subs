00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.179 

the<00:00:20.970> whole<00:00:21.150> shot<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.960> least<00:00:22.170> 85<00:00:22.590> 90<00:00:22.920> percent

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the whole shot is at least 85 90 percent

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.130 
the whole shot is at least 85 90 percent
of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.310> race<00:00:23.539> if<00:00:24.539> you're<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.019> win

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
of the race if you're going for the win

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.500 
of the race if you're going for the win
I<00:00:25.410> think<00:00:25.920> getting<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.250> start<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.939> huge<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
I think getting a start is is huge in a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.240 
I think getting a start is is huge in a
race<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.080> don't<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.619> mean<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
race and if you don't I mean that's a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.209 
race and if you don't I mean that's a
you<00:00:30.029> know<00:00:30.150> possibly<00:00:31.080> 15<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> 20<00:00:32.040> other<00:00:32.160> guys

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
you know possibly 15 to 20 other guys

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.950 
you know possibly 15 to 20 other guys
you're<00:00:32.550> gonna<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> pass<00:00:35.360> going<00:00:36.360> into<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
you're gonna have to pass going into a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.420 
you're gonna have to pass going into a
race<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.129> mind<00:00:38.309> set

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
race you have to have your mind set

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.850 
race you have to have your mind set
right<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> first

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
right to know that you can be the first

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470 
right to know that you can be the first
one<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> corner<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.300> that

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
one to that corner and have that

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.910 
one to that corner and have that
confidence<00:00:42.840> getting<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> think

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
confidence getting in there and I think

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440 
confidence getting in there and I think
that's<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> key<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.789> getting<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.090> whole<00:00:45.210> shot

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that's the key to getting a whole shot

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
that's the key to getting a whole shot
also<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.079> whole<00:00:46.530> shot<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> very<00:00:47.039> very<00:00:47.219> important

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
also a whole shot is very very important

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.889 
also a whole shot is very very important
for<00:00:47.700> my<00:00:47.820> race<00:00:47.969> because<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.660> want<00:00:48.840> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
for my race because you know you want to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.510 
for my race because you know you want to
be<00:00:48.989> out<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.260> front<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> beginning<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
be out in front at the beginning you

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.010 
be out in front at the beginning you
know<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.120> leave<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> gay<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.870> want

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
know so when you leave the gay you want

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.110 
know so when you leave the gay you want
to<00:00:52.079> want<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.649> stuck<00:00:52.890> behind<00:00:53.399> everybody<00:00:53.969> or

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to want to be stuck behind everybody or

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.639 
to want to be stuck behind everybody or
expect<00:00:54.420> an<00:00:54.510> oval<00:00:54.809> pack<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.199> easier<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> win

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
expect an oval pack it's easier to win

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
expect an oval pack it's easier to win
that<00:00:55.770> way

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.270 

when<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.050> pick<00:01:05.230> a<00:01:05.260> gay<00:01:05.470> I<00:01:05.500> think<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.920> biggest

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
when you pick a gay I think the biggest

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.640 
when you pick a gay I think the biggest
thing<00:01:06.550> that<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:07.600> know<00:01:07.720> for<00:01:07.930> me<00:01:08.080> is<00:01:08.290> that<00:01:08.500> to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
thing that you know for me is that to

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.080 
thing that you know for me is that to
make<00:01:08.770> sure<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:09.130> it's<00:01:09.250> just<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.580> clean<00:01:09.820> line

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
make sure that it's just a clean line

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.480 
make sure that it's just a clean line
you<00:01:11.020> obviously<00:01:11.320> want<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.560> look<00:01:11.740> at<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.100> track

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
you obviously want to look at the track

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.890 
you obviously want to look at the track
position<00:01:12.910> as<00:01:13.030> well<00:01:13.180> where<00:01:13.420> it'll<00:01:13.540> put<00:01:13.690> you<00:01:13.810> on

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
position as well where it'll put you on

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.410 
position as well where it'll put you on
the<00:01:13.960> inside<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.440> outside<00:01:14.770> but<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:16.240> last

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
the inside of the outside but the last

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.570 
the inside of the outside but the last
thing<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:16.690> want<00:01:16.869> is<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:16.960> rut<00:01:17.260> it's<00:01:17.500> crooked<00:01:18.250> or

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
thing you want is a rut it's crooked or

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.120 
thing you want is a rut it's crooked or
has<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.760> big<00:01:18.970> hole<00:01:19.119> in<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.500> that's<00:01:20.860> probably

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
has a big hole in it so that's probably

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.410 
has a big hole in it so that's probably
the<00:01:21.280> most<00:01:21.369> important<00:01:21.760> thing<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.970> me<00:01:22.090> the

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
the most important thing to me the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.330 
the most important thing to me the
surface<00:01:22.810> affects<00:01:23.229> my<00:01:23.410> start<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:23.890> know<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.010> want

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
surface affects my start you know I want

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.010 
surface affects my start you know I want
to<00:01:24.430> look<00:01:24.640> for<00:01:24.850> good<00:01:25.000> traction<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.660> stuff<00:01:25.869> like

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
to look for good traction and stuff like

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.840 
to look for good traction and stuff like
that<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:27.040> know<00:01:27.100> something<00:01:27.430> that<00:01:27.580> strong

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
that and you know something that strong

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.400 
that and you know something that strong
and<00:01:28.090> salad<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.600> helps<00:01:28.780> me<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:28.900> leave<00:01:29.200> better

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
and salad it helps me to leave better

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.910 
and salad it helps me to leave better
that<00:01:29.650> way<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:30.550> know<00:01:30.670> not<00:01:30.970> dry<00:01:31.240> or<00:01:31.660> just<00:01:32.590> good

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
that way you know not dry or just good

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.380 
that way you know not dry or just good
traction<00:01:33.190> that's<00:01:33.520> what<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.670> look<00:01:33.910> for<00:01:33.940> for<00:01:34.330> a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
traction that's what I look for for a

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.630 
traction that's what I look for for a
good<00:01:34.540> start<00:01:34.780> once<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.380> gate<00:01:35.530> drops<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.130> we're

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
good start once the gate drops and we're

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.850 
good start once the gate drops and we're
moving<00:01:36.790> forward<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.330> think<00:01:37.360> my<00:01:38.290> biggest<00:01:38.320> thing

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
moving forward I think my biggest thing

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.499 
moving forward I think my biggest thing
is<00:01:38.890> getting<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.369> shift<00:01:39.729> right<00:01:39.970> out<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.330> gate

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
is getting a shift right out of the gate

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.690 
is getting a shift right out of the gate
to<00:01:41.050> make<00:01:41.200> sure<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:41.680> can<00:01:41.800> have<00:01:42.009> maximum

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
to make sure that we can have maximum

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.400 
to make sure that we can have maximum
power<00:01:43.149> all<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.479> way<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.780> first<00:01:43.990> turn<00:01:44.229> and

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
power all the way to the first turn and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.070 
power all the way to the first turn and
having<00:01:44.710> your<00:01:44.800> head<00:01:45.479> looking<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.810> where<00:01:46.930> you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
having your head looking to where you

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.270 
having your head looking to where you
want<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.289> go<00:01:47.380> into<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.649> first<00:01:47.860> turn<00:01:48.039> and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
want to go into the first turn and

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.590 
want to go into the first turn and
that's<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.700> know<00:01:48.789> it's<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:49.030> key<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.300> getting<00:01:49.450> a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
that's you know it's a key to getting a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.570 
that's you know it's a key to getting a
good<00:01:49.750> start<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.590> surface<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.070> very<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.430> think

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
good start the surface is very I think

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.779 
good start the surface is very I think
from<00:01:52.060> race<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.300> race<00:01:52.479> dirt<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.470> dirt<00:01:53.789> sometimes

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
from race to race dirt to dirt sometimes

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.279 
from race to race dirt to dirt sometimes
it's<00:01:54.970> hard<00:01:55.149> in<00:01:55.240> shiny<00:01:55.479> sometimes<00:01:55.930> it's<00:01:56.080> really

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
it's hard in shiny sometimes it's really

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.880 
it's hard in shiny sometimes it's really
lonely<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.740> really<00:01:57.399> ruddy<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.869> I<00:01:58.899> think<00:01:59.080> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
lonely and really ruddy so I think the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950 
lonely and really ruddy so I think the
important<00:02:00.310> thing<00:02:00.340> is<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:00.970> not<00:02:01.300> really<00:02:01.660> that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
important thing is is not really that

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960 
important thing is is not really that
your<00:02:02.170> your<00:02:02.619> stand<00:02:03.039> out<00:02:03.190> on<00:02:03.340> one<00:02:03.520> but<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.820> you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
your your stand out on one but that you

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.240 
your your stand out on one but that you
can<00:02:04.149> adapt<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.920> know<00:02:05.950> use<00:02:06.220> your

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
can adapt and and you know use your

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.990 
can adapt and and you know use your
throttle<00:02:06.760> in<00:02:06.850> your<00:02:06.970> body<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.420> make<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.170> work

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.820 

right<00:02:13.000> when<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.269> gate<00:02:13.420> even<00:02:14.140> flinches<00:02:14.650> is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
right when the gate even flinches is

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.350 
right when the gate even flinches is
when<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.010> pretty<00:02:15.220> much<00:02:15.310> let<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.700> go<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:15.850> mean<00:02:16.180> it's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
when I pretty much let it go I mean it's

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.180 
when I pretty much let it go I mean it's
all<00:02:16.480> about<00:02:16.630> reaction<00:02:16.840> time<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> start<00:02:17.890> so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
all about reaction time on the start so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.250 
all about reaction time on the start so
once<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.030> see<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.239> gate<00:02:19.540> even<00:02:19.780> just<00:02:19.989> flinch

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
once you see that gate even just flinch

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.950 
once you see that gate even just flinch
it's<00:02:20.500> it's<00:02:20.890> go<00:02:21.100> time<00:02:21.130> so

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.740 

the<00:02:25.530> starting<00:02:25.830> device<00:02:26.600> basically<00:02:27.600> it's

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the starting device basically it's

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.350 
the starting device basically it's
pretty<00:02:27.990> easy<00:02:28.250> concept<00:02:29.250> there's<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.820> piece<00:02:30.120> on

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
pretty easy concept there's a piece on

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.810 
pretty easy concept there's a piece on
the<00:02:30.900> 40-yard<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.920> which<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.250> stationary<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
the 40-yard the which is stationary and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.460 
the 40-yard the which is stationary and
there's<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> piece<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> fork<00:02:33.900> which<00:02:34.080> moves

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
there's a piece on the fork which moves

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.890 
there's a piece on the fork which moves
with<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.490> for<00:02:35.880> what<00:02:36.270> we<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.420> here<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.810> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
with the for what we have here is a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420 
with the for what we have here is a
lockdown<00:02:37.140> device<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.890> front<00:02:38.130> fork

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
lockdown device in the front fork

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.660 
lockdown device in the front fork
there's<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.680> hook<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.370> there's<00:02:41.610> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
there's a little hook here and there's a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.820 
there's a little hook here and there's a
button<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.180> mechanism<00:02:42.780> here<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.740> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
button in this mechanism here so on the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
button in this mechanism here so on the
start<00:02:44.100> line<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.730> pull<00:02:45.000> down<00:02:45.180> with<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.570> help

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
start line you pull down with the help

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.630 
start line you pull down with the help
of<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> rider<00:02:46.080> usually<00:02:46.530> pull<00:02:47.190> down<00:02:47.370> to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
of the rider usually pull down to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280 
of the rider usually pull down to
compress<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.120> fork<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.720> when<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:48.990> part

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
compress the fork and when this part

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.680 
compress the fork and when this part
goes<00:02:49.500> pass<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.130> button<00:02:50.520> we<00:02:50.970> push<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.540> to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
goes pass the button we push it in to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.780 
goes pass the button we push it in to
lock<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.130> does<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.340> keeps<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
lock it in what that does is keeps the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.790 
lock it in what that does is keeps the
forks<00:02:54.150> compressed<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.780> start<00:02:55.080> line<00:02:55.290> so

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
forks compressed in the start line so

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.960 
forks compressed in the start line so
when<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.950> dump<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.220> clutch<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:56.700> doesn't

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
when the dump the clutch it doesn't

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.190 
when the dump the clutch it doesn't
wheelie<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.390> they<00:02:57.510> get<00:02:57.660> better<00:02:57.780> forward

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
wheelie and they get better forward

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.170 
wheelie and they get better forward
momentum<00:02:58.320> getting<00:02:59.250> off<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.520> line<00:02:59.580> it's<00:02:59.940> more

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
momentum getting off the line it's more

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.260 
momentum getting off the line it's more
trying<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.810> keep<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.110> throttle<00:03:01.350> steady

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
trying to keep the throttle steady

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.130 
trying to keep the throttle steady
making<00:03:03.270> sure<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.600> you're<00:03:03.690> not<00:03:03.780> getting<00:03:04.080> a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
making sure that you're not getting a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.600 
making sure that you're not getting a
lot<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.290> wheel<00:03:04.500> spin<00:03:04.770> or<00:03:05.010> getting<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.490> know

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
lot of wheel spin or getting you know

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.130 
lot of wheel spin or getting you know
less<00:03:05.880> little<00:03:06.180> spin<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.690> way<00:03:06.810> your<00:03:06.930> front

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
less little spin so that way your front

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.470 
less little spin so that way your front
wheels<00:03:07.320> not<00:03:07.530> lifting<00:03:07.860> up<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.610> mostly<00:03:09.390> just

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
wheels not lifting up but mostly just

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.850 
wheels not lifting up but mostly just
getting<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.870> good<00:03:10.080> drive<00:03:10.290> off<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.680> gate

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
getting a good drive off the gate

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.680 
getting a good drive off the gate
keeping<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.520> thrall<00:03:11.760> steady<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.270> move<00:03:12.450> and

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
keeping the thrall steady and move and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.320 
keeping the thrall steady and move and
just<00:03:13.020> driving<00:03:13.410> forward<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.790> weird<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.240> a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
just driving forward it's weird in a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.620 
just driving forward it's weird in a
start<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:17.220> know<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.760> think<00:03:18.330> can<00:03:18.450> only

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
start you know that I think can only

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.330 
start you know that I think can only
think<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.960> two<00:03:19.020> or<00:03:19.320> three<00:03:19.350> starts<00:03:19.740> from<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
think of two or three starts from the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.030 
think of two or three starts from the
last<00:03:20.820> couple<00:03:21.090> years<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.450> really<00:03:21.840> remember

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
last couple years that I really remember

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.250 
last couple years that I really remember
being<00:03:23.040> down<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.340> start<00:03:23.580> straight<00:03:24.260> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
being down the start straight it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.380 
being down the start straight it
happened<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.010> quickly<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.490> I<00:03:26.730> really<00:03:27.180> can't

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
happened so quickly and I really can't

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.990 
happened so quickly and I really can't
explain<00:03:27.950> what<00:03:28.950> all<00:03:28.980> takes<00:03:29.280> place<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.790> on

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
explain what all takes place going on

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.690 
explain what all takes place going on
but<00:03:30.210> it's<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.200> it's<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.890> unique<00:03:32.190> feeling<00:03:32.400> and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
but it's a it's a unique feeling and

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.460 
but it's a it's a unique feeling and
then<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.240> know<00:03:33.330> things<00:03:33.690> like<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.440> know

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
then you know things like that you know
