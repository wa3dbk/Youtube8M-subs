00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
in here somewhere we're going to have

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.390 
in here somewhere we're going to have
some<00:03:49.170> trees<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.740> background<00:03:49.920> they're

tree where the shapes actually go where

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.260 
tree where the shapes actually go where
they<00:04:06.990> head<00:04:07.200> off<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.820> you<00:04:08.820> can't<00:04:09.090> get<00:04:09.240> that

they head off to you can't get that

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.550 
they head off to you can't get that
anywhere<00:04:09.450> else<00:04:09.750> well<00:04:10.080> without<00:04:10.230> coming

actually see why I'm trying to think
it's<00:05:04.470> a<00:05:04.530> whole<00:05:04.710> lot<00:05:04.950> of<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.070> can<00:05:05.190> kind<00:05:05.400> of<00:05:05.490> do

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
it's a whole lot of you can kind of do

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.740 
it's a whole lot of you can kind of do
it<00:05:05.700> in<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.820> studio<00:05:06.150> these<00:05:06.390> things<00:05:06.630> are
