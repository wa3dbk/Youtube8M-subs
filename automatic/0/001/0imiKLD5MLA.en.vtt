 at the second mistake 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.710
 and with the 4c ​​of all costs and the cyber war 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.710
 little steaming easily 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.159
 the carver bmw m3 should dominate 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.129
 the lead but could her figure 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.389
