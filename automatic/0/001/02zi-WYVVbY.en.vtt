00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
replayability really makes up for the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.830 
replayability really makes up for the
shortness<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.730> main<00:03:21.970> game<00:03:22.239> if<00:03:22.690> you

there are alternate paths you can take

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.220 
there are alternate paths you can take
but<00:03:30.700> most<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.239> them<00:03:31.390> are<00:03:31.510> designed<00:03:31.659> so<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.109> if

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
but most of them are designed so that if

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.479 
but most of them are designed so that if
you<00:03:32.319> don't<00:03:32.470> do<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.739> certain<00:03:32.980> thing<00:03:33.129> in<00:03:33.370> that

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
you don't do a certain thing in that

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.130 
you don't do a certain thing in that
particular<00:03:33.940> spot<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.420> level<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.959> won't

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
particular spot in the level you won't

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.509 
particular spot in the level you won't
be<00:03:35.230> able<00:03:35.379> to<00:03:35.530> go<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:35.920> alternate<00:03:36.340> path

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
be able to go on that alternate path

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.309 
be able to go on that alternate path
therefore<00:03:36.909> making<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.599> replay<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.049> level

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
therefore making you replay the level

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.050 
therefore making you replay the level
until<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.680> get<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:38.950> right<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.549> if<00:03:39.970> you

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
until you get it right that is if you

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.490 
until you get it right that is if you
care<00:03:40.269> about<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.569> side<00:03:40.720> quests<00:03:41.140> which<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.440> do

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
care about the side quests which I do

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.170 
care about the side quests which I do
the<00:03:42.099> graphics<00:03:42.489> are<00:03:42.670> awesome

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
the graphics are awesome

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.940 
the graphics are awesome
everything<00:03:43.659> is<00:03:43.780> rich<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.109> colorful<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.769> it's

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
everything is rich and colorful and it's

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.710 
everything is rich and colorful and it's
not<00:03:45.130> just<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.459> graphics<00:03:45.669> but<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.180> animation

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
not just the graphics but the animation

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.509 
not just the graphics but the animation
style<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.109> very<00:03:47.139> unique<00:03:47.680> I'm<00:03:48.010> not<00:03:48.220> too<00:03:48.340> sure

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
style is very unique I'm not too sure

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.190 
style is very unique I'm not too sure
how<00:03:48.669> to<00:03:48.730> explain<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.269> but<00:03:49.599> I<00:03:49.660> guess<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.019> best

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
how to explain it but I guess the best

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.720 
how to explain it but I guess the best
way<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:50.919> like<00:03:51.130> you're<00:03:51.310> watching<00:03:51.430> a

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
way is it's like you're watching a

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.490 
way is it's like you're watching a
cartoon<00:03:52.150> but<00:03:52.389> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.660> alter<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:52.989> characters

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
cartoon but you can alter the characters

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.170 
cartoon but you can alter the characters
as<00:03:53.680> you're<00:03:53.829> watching<00:03:53.950> sorry<00:03:54.639> if<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.910> sounds

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
as you're watching sorry if that sounds

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.089 
as you're watching sorry if that sounds
confusing<00:03:55.239> now<00:03:56.079> I<00:03:56.139> know<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.349> lot<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.709> games<00:03:56.919> have

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
confusing now I know a lot of games have

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.009 
confusing now I know a lot of games have
that<00:03:57.220> cartoony<00:03:57.700> animation<00:03:58.180> look<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.690> but

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
that cartoony animation look to it but

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.720 
that cartoony animation look to it but
this<00:03:59.109> game<00:03:59.349> is<00:03:59.500> different<00:03:59.709> maybe<00:04:00.400> this<00:04:00.609> is

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
this game is different maybe this is

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.460 
this game is different maybe this is
because<00:04:01.030> it's<00:04:01.209> hand-drawn<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.900> really<00:04:02.319> don't

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
because it's hand-drawn I really don't

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.990 
because it's hand-drawn I really don't
know<00:04:02.560> how<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.769> explain<00:04:03.129> it<00:04:03.190> very<00:04:03.340> well<00:04:03.669> so<00:04:03.970> I

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
know how to explain it very well so I

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.580 
know how to explain it very well so I
guess<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.359> best<00:04:04.510> way<00:04:04.690> for<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.049> understand

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
guess the best way for you to understand

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.050 
guess the best way for you to understand
it<00:04:05.680> is<00:04:05.769> just<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.129> play<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.700> only<00:04:06.940> other

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
it is just to play it the only other

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.250 
it is just to play it the only other
game<00:04:07.299> where<00:04:07.480> I've<00:04:07.569> seen<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:07.870> style<00:04:08.109> of

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
game where I've seen this style of

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.050 
game where I've seen this style of

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
looked up the GameSpot review for this

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.939 
looked up the GameSpot review for this
game<00:04:28.599> and<00:04:28.930> they<00:04:29.050> gave<00:04:29.229> it<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.470> demerit<00:04:29.860> of

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
game and they gave it the demerit of

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.339 
game and they gave it the demerit of
broken<00:04:30.310> controls<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.970> have<00:04:31.449> no<00:04:31.780> idea<00:04:32.169> what

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
broken controls I have no idea what

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:33.089 
broken controls I have no idea what
they're<00:04:32.470> talking<00:04:32.860> about

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
they're talking about

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.980 
they're talking about
I<00:04:33.280> thought<00:04:33.639> they<00:04:33.789> were<00:04:33.849> great<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.510> guess<00:04:34.870> the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
I thought they were great I guess the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.180 
I thought they were great I guess the
only<00:04:35.080> problem<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:35.500> would<00:04:35.650> have<00:04:35.800> was<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.099> the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
only problem I would have was that the

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.589 
only problem I would have was that the
motion<00:04:36.490> controls<00:04:36.820> would<00:04:36.970> at<00:04:37.120> times<00:04:37.389> not

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
motion controls would at times not

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.540 
motion controls would at times not
respond<00:04:37.990> correctly<00:04:38.139> but<00:04:38.830> seriously<00:04:39.220> this

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
respond correctly but seriously this

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.610 
respond correctly but seriously this
would<00:04:39.699> rarely<00:04:40.000> happen<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:41.020> boss<00:04:41.169> fights<00:04:41.440> were

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620

fun but just a little too easy in the
beginning<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:43.690> they<00:04:43.840> do<00:04:43.930> become<00:04:44.260> harder<00:04:44.530> in

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
beginning but they do become harder in
