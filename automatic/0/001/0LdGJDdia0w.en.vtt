00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 and I'm here in the small town of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.600
 another villain in the French mountains 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 I'm going to take a walk in the snow. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.800
 I'll take you along with me and at the end 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.780
 From the video we go back to the kitchen to 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:28.650
 to show the true recipe of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:31.859
 cheese walk in the snow people bills 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.000
 roc fund left and even found on average 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:01:08.150
 if only I had the border 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:01:08.150
 there I went to the skin in silence 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.240
 these people in the front are 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.870
 making a fan that is a scheme that you 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.880
 walk on mountain 10 hey leaf disc 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:43.380
 only the dogs in your name not coming 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:44.729
 here and after this walk in the middle of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.310
 snow we will now go back to produce 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:57.060
 to show you the fund's revenue 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:59.400
 cheese to make the recipe of these 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.810
 I'm going to use two types of 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.280
 cheese and the content that is in the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.080
 Brazil, it 's harder to find 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.940
 you can substitute cheese 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.640
 steppe that works too 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.500
 the cheeses here are already quiet then 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.320
 I'll just mix it here in that bowl. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.090
 some fundy proceeds ask for up to three 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.989
 cheeses then the process is the same as 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.760
 People just have to split 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.120
 proportionally to the quantity of each 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.120
 cheese 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.360
 now I'm going to get my clique spread 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.000
 and will rub a clove of garlic that I 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.100
 cut in half on the bottom and walls 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.920
 inside the clique 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.820
 This gives a taste of everything special. 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.190
 depth then raises pan on fire 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.620
 I'm going to add 100 ml of 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.600
 white wine when the wine begins to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.450
 to boil people is adding that already 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.340
 the little ones and the stirring is always 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.260
 placing the important cheese 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.910
 little and always stirring 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.890
 otherwise he will smash everything will not go 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.410
 solve in the river will become a ball of 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.850
 cheese 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.890
 then the cheese already has everything 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.320
 melt is incorporated in the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.970
 informing you believe in this very thick I 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.120
 I like to add a little nut 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.120
 nutmeg 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.270
 so just take our little clique to the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.730
 show to serve 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.710
 there is only serving with small pieces of bread 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.910
 hunting and sharing with the people who 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.550
