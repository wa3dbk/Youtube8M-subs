not<00:00:15.660> require<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.170> drive<00:00:16.379> over<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> chain<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
not require to drive over a chain so it

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.519 
not require to drive over a chain so it
simply<00:00:17.820> wraps<00:00:18.060> around<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.420> tire<00:00:18.660> connect<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> few

here we had our tire chain laid out and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.609 
here we had our tire chain laid out and
you<00:00:27.570> can<00:00:27.750> tell<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.289> end<00:00:28.470> that's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
you can tell if it's one end that's

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.109 
you can tell if it's one end that's
labeled<00:00:28.980> yellow<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.580> will<00:00:29.670> happen<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.090> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.870 
and we'll pull our tensioning cable
again<00:01:43.560> try<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.250> far<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> can

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
again try to get as far as you can

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.249 
again try to get as far as you can
underneath<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> tape<00:01:45.570> underneath<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:45.990> tire

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
underneath the tape underneath the tire

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.460 
underneath the tape underneath the tire
here<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.130> really<00:01:47.460> helps<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> lot<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:49.110> then

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
here it really helps out a lot and then

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.170 
here it really helps out a lot and then
you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.100> through<00:01:50.190> this<00:01:50.310> buckle<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
you can put it through this buckle you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.680 
you can put it through this buckle you
just<00:01:51.450> open<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.900> up<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.240> just<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> stick

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
just open this up and just kind of stick

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.580 
just open this up and just kind of stick
it<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:56.630> try<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.690> get<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> few<00:01:57.990> links<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.380> there

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it in I try to get a few links in there

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
it in I try to get a few links in there
hold<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.030> go<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.210> our<00:02:00.390> attention

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
hold that then you go to our attention

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.240 
hold that then you go to our attention
and<00:02:00.810> device<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.470> we<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.710> pull<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.100> and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and device and we just pull it down and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.590 
and device and we just pull it down and
make<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> last<00:02:02.670> connection<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> looks

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
make the last connection so as it looks

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.210 
make the last connection so as it looks
right<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:06.840> lecture<00:02:07.530> looks<00:02:07.710> pretty<00:02:08.040> awkward

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
right now lecture looks pretty awkward

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.550 
right now lecture looks pretty awkward
but<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.030> fact<00:02:09.239> as<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.510> rotate<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.290> alaq'

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
but in fact as you rotate it alaq'

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.740 
but in fact as you rotate it alaq'
self-center<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.610> alright<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.360> got<00:02:12.450> both

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
self-center so alright now we got both

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.420 
self-center so alright now we got both
four<00:02:12.930> tires<00:02:13.140> chained<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:13.769> we'll<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.160> ahead<00:02:14.280> and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
four tires chained up we'll go ahead and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:36.190 
four tires chained up we'll go ahead and
take<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> test<00:02:15.209> drive

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.500 

as<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.040> can<00:02:37.130> see<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.520> self-centering<00:02:38.090> system

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
as you can see the self-centering system

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.510 
as you can see the self-centering system
actually<00:02:38.810> worked<00:02:38.990> pretty<00:02:39.170> good<00:02:39.319> we<00:02:40.160> started

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
actually worked pretty good we started

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.820 
actually worked pretty good we started
off<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.270> only<00:02:41.390> about<00:02:41.569> right<00:02:41.900> here<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.440> it

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
off with it only about right here and it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.559 
off with it only about right here and it
actually<00:02:42.950> pulled<00:02:43.459> itself<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:44.030> or<00:02:44.150> towards<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
actually pulled itself to or towards the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.240 
actually pulled itself to or towards the
middle<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.410> can<00:02:45.470> see<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.830> chain<00:02:46.099> is

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
middle and you can see the chain is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.220 
middle and you can see the chain is
relatively<00:02:46.720> centered<00:02:47.720> around<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.989> tire

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
relatively centered around the tire

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.290 
relatively centered around the tire
cutter<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.099> couple<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.430> little<00:02:49.550> test<00:02:49.849> runs<00:02:50.060> here

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
cutter a couple of little test runs here

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.790 
cutter a couple of little test runs here
you<00:02:50.480> can<00:02:50.599> actually<00:02:50.930> tell<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> chain<00:02:51.650> is

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
you can actually tell that the chain is

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.410 
you can actually tell that the chain is
actually<00:02:51.950> centered<00:02:52.459> itself<00:02:52.850> even<00:02:53.060> more<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.360> a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
actually centered itself even more in a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.940 
actually centered itself even more in a
tire<00:02:53.630> which<00:02:53.900> proves<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.319> system<00:02:54.770> worked

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
tire which proves the system worked

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.860 
tire which proves the system worked
quite<00:02:55.250> well<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:56.180> there<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.690> for

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
quite well then there you have it for

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.830 
quite well then there you have it for
part<00:02:57.020> number<00:02:57.080> th01571245
