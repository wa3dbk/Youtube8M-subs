00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
later and he never did that but when we

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.400 
later and he never did that but when we
were<00:00:56.120> in<00:00:56.239> our<00:00:56.390> state<00:00:56.630> of<00:00:56.750> crisis<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.230> thought

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
were in our state of crisis I thought

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.740 
were in our state of crisis I thought
well<00:00:57.620> if<00:00:57.890> I<00:00:58.100> would<00:00:58.280> give<00:00:58.460> mark<00:00:59.149> five<00:00:59.510> hundred

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
well if I would give mark five hundred

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.330 
well if I would give mark five hundred
dollars<00:01:00.020> maybe<00:01:00.230> people<00:01:00.590> would<00:01:00.739> give<00:01:00.890> us<00:01:01.040> money

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
dollars maybe people would give us money

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.190 
dollars maybe people would give us money
and<00:01:01.610> then<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:02.149> sort<00:01:02.329> of<00:01:02.420> lay<00:01:02.600> out<00:01:02.629> how<00:01:02.960> you're

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
and then you sort of lay out how you're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.800 
and then you sort of lay out how you're
going<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.500> pay<00:01:03.710> that<00:01:04.580> money<00:01:04.759> back<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.360> cheese

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
going to pay that money back and cheese

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.930 
going to pay that money back and cheese
so<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.530> way<00:01:06.619> it<00:01:06.649> works<00:01:06.770> is<00:01:07.190> we<00:01:07.369> have<00:01:07.550> three

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
so the way it works is we have three

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.810 
so the way it works is we have three
sort<00:01:08.509> of<00:01:08.600> prices<00:01:09.259> for<00:01:10.100> subscriptions<00:01:10.700> and

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
sort of prices for subscriptions and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.460 
sort of prices for subscriptions and
they're<00:01:10.970> 200<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.509> 500<00:01:11.660> and<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.050> thousand

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
they're 200 and 500 and a thousand

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.200 
they're 200 and 500 and a thousand
dollars<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:13.729> if<00:01:13.909> I<00:01:14.000> use<00:01:14.180> a

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
dollars and so if I use a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.469 
dollars and so if I use a
five-hundred-dollar<00:01:14.990> model<00:01:15.619> if<00:01:15.770> people<00:01:16.100> give

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
five-hundred-dollar model if people give

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.580 
five-hundred-dollar model if people give
140<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.510> check<00:01:17.720> for<00:01:17.900> five<00:01:18.049> hundred<00:01:18.170> dollars

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
140 a check for five hundred dollars

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.410 
140 a check for five hundred dollars
then<00:01:19.070> for<00:01:19.340> each<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.760> next<00:01:20.000> five<00:01:20.180> years

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
then for each of the next five years

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.050 
then for each of the next five years
including<00:01:20.960> 2010<00:01:21.650> we<00:01:21.830> give<00:01:22.010> them<00:01:22.310> one<00:01:22.790> hundred

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
including 2010 we give them one hundred

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.910 
including 2010 we give them one hundred
and<00:01:23.150> fifty<00:01:23.390> dollars<00:01:24.140> worth<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:24.440> cheese<00:01:24.680> in
