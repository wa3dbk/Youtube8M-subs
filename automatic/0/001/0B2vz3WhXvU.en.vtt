your<00:01:34.149> stencil<00:01:34.659> if<00:01:35.409> you<00:01:35.619> had<00:01:35.710> too<00:01:35.890> much<00:01:36.040> on

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
your stencil if you had too much on

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.450 
your stencil if you had too much on
there<00:01:36.630> making<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.659> stencil<00:01:38.200> unusable<00:01:39.189> again

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
there making the stencil unusable again

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.410 
there making the stencil unusable again
and<00:01:40.469> it<00:01:41.469> often<00:01:41.799> was<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.549> bit<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.909> mess

the<00:02:30.740> thickener

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
the thickener

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.000 
the thickener
okay<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.200> right<00:02:33.200> there<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.530> half<00:02:33.770> your

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
okay so right there is half your

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.300 
okay so right there is half your
ingredients<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.670> this<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:36.310> propylene

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
ingredients and this the propylene

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.910 
ingredients and this the propylene
glycol<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.740> straight<00:02:43.340> chemical

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
glycol is this is straight chemical

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.440 
glycol is this is straight chemical
version<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.580> happen<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.940> use<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.300> other

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
version I just happen to use for other

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.830 
version I just happen to use for other
applications<00:02:48.340> okay<00:02:49.340> that's<00:02:50.090> all<00:02:50.240> it<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.450> it's

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
applications okay that's all it is it's

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.690 
applications okay that's all it is it's
an<00:02:51.050> oily<00:02:51.350> kind<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.740> baby<00:02:51.950> oil<00:02:52.070> but<00:02:52.520> what

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
an oily kind of like baby oil but what

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.840 
an oily kind of like baby oil but what
propylene<00:02:53.690> glycol<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.850> penetrating

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
propylene glycol is is a penetrating

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.710 
propylene glycol is is a penetrating
agent<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:57.590> will<00:02:57.860> actually<00:02:58.040> pull<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.480> ink

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
agent that will actually pull the ink

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.710 
agent that will actually pull the ink
from<00:03:00.050> your<00:03:00.290> stencil<00:03:00.740> into<00:03:01.250> your<00:03:01.370> skin<00:03:01.720> that's

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
from your stencil into your skin that's

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.140 
from your stencil into your skin that's
why<00:03:02.990> it<00:03:03.050> lasts<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.440> long<00:03:03.910> that's<00:03:04.910> why

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
why it lasts so long that's why

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.600 
why it lasts so long that's why
everybody<00:03:05.570> uses<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:06.020> forever

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
everybody uses this forever

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.740 
everybody uses this forever
so<00:03:07.610> propylene<00:03:08.030> glycol<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.600> main

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
so propylene glycol is the main

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.470 
so propylene glycol is the main
ingredient<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.260> here<00:03:09.970> next<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.180> sodium

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
ingredient in here next to sodium

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.980 
ingredient in here next to sodium
stearate

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
stearate

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.650 
stearate
which<00:03:12.830> is<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.700> other<00:03:13.820> ingredients<00:03:14.390> sodium

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
which is the other ingredients sodium

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.470 
which is the other ingredients sodium
stearate<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.170> salt<00:03:15.800> soap<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:19.300> basically<00:03:20.300> it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
stearate is a salt soap so basically it

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.470 
stearate is a salt soap so basically it
uses<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.870> salt<00:03:21.110> soap<00:03:21.320> as<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> thickener<00:03:22.480> mixed

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
uses a salt soap as a thickener mixed

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.210 
uses a salt soap as a thickener mixed
with<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.750> propylene<00:03:24.020> glycol<00:03:24.560> which<00:03:24.860> is<00:03:25.070> the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
with the propylene glycol which is the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.840 
with the propylene glycol which is the
penetrating<00:03:25.640> agent<00:03:26.030> now<00:03:27.430> which<00:03:28.430> want<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.760> do

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850

you'll always see the fall I mean the

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:47.969 
you'll always see the fall I mean the
car<00:04:46.750> bomber<00:04:46.960> all<00:04:47.110> that<00:04:47.259> crap<00:04:47.440> is<00:04:47.680> because<00:04:47.860> it

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
car bomber all that crap is because it

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.559 
car bomber all that crap is because it
has<00:04:48.069> to<00:04:48.190> be<00:04:48.220> mixed<00:04:48.400> together<00:04:48.610> as<00:04:49.000> certain<00:04:49.300> pH

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
has to be mixed together as certain pH

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.439 
has to be mixed together as certain pH
or<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:49.990> creates<00:04:50.319> as<00:04:50.470> GL<00:04:50.949> to<00:04:51.310> begin<00:04:51.550> with<00:04:51.699> so

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
or it creates as GL to begin with so

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.270 
or it creates as GL to begin with so
those<00:04:52.690> are<00:04:52.840> all<00:04:52.960> just<00:04:53.229> extra<00:04:53.979> things<00:04:54.190> that

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
those are all just extra things that

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.249 
those are all just extra things that
just<00:04:54.930> again<00:04:55.930> everything<00:04:56.590> that's<00:04:56.770> in<00:04:58.259> this

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
just again everything that's in this

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.890 
just again everything that's in this
tensile<00:04:59.919> shit<00:05:00.130> is<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.550> here<00:05:00.759> everything<00:05:01.539> is<00:05:01.660> in

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
tensile shit is in here everything is in

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.550 
tensile shit is in here everything is in
the<00:05:02.889> stencil<00:05:03.220> shit<00:05:03.400> is<00:05:03.580> in<00:05:03.759> here<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.900> these<00:05:05.259> two

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
the stencil shit is in here so these two

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.950 
the stencil shit is in here so these two
things<00:05:05.770> together<00:05:06.210> are<00:05:07.210> what<00:05:07.389> make<00:05:07.570> it<00:05:07.599> you're

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
things together are what make it you're

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.860 
things together are what make it you're
mixing<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.620> little<00:05:09.160> extra<00:05:09.400> alcohol<00:05:09.840> to<00:05:10.840> the

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
speed stick to keep it liquid state

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.200 
speed stick to keep it liquid state
until<00:05:14.889> you<00:05:15.009> mix<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.340> with<00:05:15.460> this<00:05:15.669> so<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.120> it

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
until you mix it with this so that it

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.110 
until you mix it with this so that it
stays<00:05:16.449> liquid<00:05:16.720> now<00:05:17.650> you're<00:05:17.770> going<00:05:17.889> to<00:05:17.949> mix<00:05:18.120> one

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
stays liquid now you're going to mix one

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.930 
stays liquid now you're going to mix one

liquid state the other version I've

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.249 
liquid state the other version I've
heard<00:05:39.460> people<00:05:39.639> talk<00:05:40.030> about<00:05:40.060> I<00:05:40.599> just<00:05:40.960> saw<00:05:41.110> this

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
heard people talk about I just saw this

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:42.719 
heard people talk about I just saw this
the<00:05:41.440> other<00:05:41.560> day<00:05:41.650> because<00:05:42.220> I<00:05:42.340> haven't<00:05:42.490> watched

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
the other day because I haven't watched

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.020 
the other day because I haven't watched
the<00:05:42.940> video<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.270> like<00:05:44.250> forever<00:05:45.250> first<00:05:45.820> time<00:05:45.940> I

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
the video and like forever first time I

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.080 
the video and like forever first time I
watched<00:05:46.210> it<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.479> second<00:05:46.990> Nicko<00:05:47.710> video<00:05:48.090> he

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
watched it the second Nicko video he

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.700 
watched it the second Nicko video he
talks<00:05:49.330> about<00:05:49.449> taking<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:52.110> speed<00:05:53.110> sick<00:05:53.380> Milton

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
talks about taking the speed sick Milton

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.969 
talks about taking the speed sick Milton
went<00:05:53.800> down<00:05:54.009> with<00:05:54.340> equal<00:05:54.729> parts<00:05:54.909> green<00:05:55.449> soap<00:05:55.979> to

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
went down with equal parts green soap to

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.230 
went down with equal parts green soap to
me<00:05:57.009> that's<00:05:57.370> a<00:05:57.460> little<00:05:57.639> redundant<00:05:58.150> because

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
me that's a little redundant because

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.730 
me that's a little redundant because
green<00:05:58.750> soap<00:05:59.400> first<00:06:00.400> of<00:06:00.550> all<00:06:00.810> like<00:06:01.810> I<00:06:01.870> said<00:06:02.020> this

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
green soap first of all like I said this

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.620 
green soap first of all like I said this
already<00:06:02.949> has<00:06:03.310> the<00:06:03.699> sodium<00:06:04.060> stearate<00:06:04.300> man

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
already has the sodium stearate man

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.540 
already has the sodium stearate man
which<00:06:04.900> is<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.590> salt<00:06:06.039> based<00:06:06.280> soap<00:06:07.169> so<00:06:08.370> it's<00:06:09.370> kind

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
which is a salt based soap so it's kind

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.510 
which is a salt based soap so it's kind
of<00:06:09.580> done<00:06:09.820> to<00:06:10.000> add<00:06:10.120> soap<00:06:10.509> to<00:06:10.539> soap<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:12.340> other

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
of done to add soap to soap the other

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.550 
of done to add soap to soap the other
thing<00:06:12.699> is<00:06:12.849> green<00:06:13.570> soap<00:06:13.949> already<00:06:14.949> has<00:06:15.509> probably

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
thing is green soap already has probably

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.129 
thing is green soap already has probably
20-some<00:06:17.560> percent<00:06:18.509> alcohol<00:06:19.509> in<00:06:19.659> it<00:06:19.780> which<00:06:19.990> is

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
20-some percent alcohol in it which is

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.080 
20-some percent alcohol in it which is
why<00:06:20.320> I<00:06:20.349> tell<00:06:20.740> people<00:06:20.770> not<00:06:21.190> to<00:06:21.250> use<00:06:21.669> it<00:06:21.699> on<00:06:21.969> your

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
why I tell people not to use it on your

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.999 
why I tell people not to use it on your
tattoos<00:06:22.449> because<00:06:22.599> it's<00:06:22.840> very<00:06:23.020> irritating<00:06:23.440> and

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
tattoos because it's very irritating and

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.610 
tattoos because it's very irritating and
it<00:06:24.699> also<00:06:25.000> wears<00:06:25.300> off<00:06:25.630> your<00:06:26.020> stencil<00:06:26.469> but

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
it also wears off your stencil but

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.430 
it also wears off your stencil but
that's<00:06:26.800> another<00:06:27.070> video<00:06:27.930> so<00:06:28.930> it's<00:06:29.259> kind<00:06:29.409> of

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
that's another video so it's kind of

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.629 
that's another video so it's kind of
redundant<00:06:29.860> it's<00:06:29.949> already<00:06:30.159> got<00:06:30.280> things<00:06:30.490> that

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
redundant it's already got things that

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.640 
redundant it's already got things that
you're<00:06:30.759> already<00:06:30.909> using<00:06:32.340> basically<00:06:34.440> if<00:06:35.440> that's

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
you're already using basically if that's

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.959 
you're already using basically if that's
if<00:06:35.889> that<00:06:36.009> works<00:06:36.190> for<00:06:36.340> you<00:06:36.430> I'm<00:06:36.520> sure<00:06:36.550> it<00:06:36.789> works

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:36.969 
if that works for you I'm sure it works

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:38.310 
if that works for you I'm sure it works
great<00:06:37.180> for<00:06:37.240> him<00:06:37.509> so<00:06:37.719> it'll<00:06:37.840> work<00:06:37.990> great<00:06:38.169> for

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
great for him so it'll work great for

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.920 
great for him so it'll work great for
you<00:06:38.380> but<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.770> point<00:06:39.010> is<00:06:39.510> the<00:06:40.510> whole<00:06:40.539> point<00:06:40.750> to

you but the point is the whole point to

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.980 
you but the point is the whole point to

melt this down cut it with the alcohol
and<00:06:56.120> you're<00:06:57.120> done<00:06:57.590> it's<00:06:58.590> that<00:06:58.650> simple

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
and you're done it's that simple

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:05.050 
and you're done it's that simple
application<00:06:59.940> wise<00:07:00.680> you<00:07:01.680> apply<00:07:02.010> it<00:07:02.070> and<00:07:02.540> you

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
application wise you apply it and you

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.850 
application wise you apply it and you
play<00:07:06.060> it<00:07:06.180> Finley<00:07:06.570> so<00:07:06.840> they<00:07:07.020> it<00:07:07.470> what<00:07:07.740> it<00:07:07.830> does

play it Finley so they it what it does

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.290 
play it Finley so they it what it does
is<00:07:08.130> because<00:07:08.430> it's<00:07:08.580> thinned<00:07:08.850> out<00:07:08.970> now<00:07:09.120> it's

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
is because it's thinned out now it's

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.470 
is because it's thinned out now it's
going<00:07:09.420> to<00:07:09.480> dry<00:07:09.810> a<00:07:10.140> lot<00:07:10.380> quicker<00:07:10.560> soak<00:07:11.220> in<00:07:11.580> once

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
going to dry a lot quicker soak in once

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.060 
going to dry a lot quicker soak in once
it<00:07:12.630> soaks<00:07:12.840> into<00:07:13.140> the<00:07:13.260> skin<00:07:13.530> to<00:07:13.560> a<00:07:13.710> point<00:07:13.950> where

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
it soaks into the skin to a point where

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.050 
it soaks into the skin to a point where
you<00:07:14.130> can<00:07:14.250> barely<00:07:15.410> feel<00:07:16.410> it<00:07:16.760> that's<00:07:17.760> when<00:07:17.970> you

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
you can barely feel it that's when you

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.890 
you can barely feel it that's when you
want<00:07:18.240> to<00:07:18.390> apply<00:07:18.690> it<00:07:19.970> over<00:07:20.970> time<00:07:21.390> you'll<00:07:21.600> you'll

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
want to apply it over time you'll you'll

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.620 
want to apply it over time you'll you'll
get<00:07:22.110> a<00:07:22.140> touch<00:07:22.470> for<00:07:22.950> exactly<00:07:23.820> when<00:07:24.150> that<00:07:24.330> point

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
get a touch for exactly when that point

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.260 
get a touch for exactly when that point
is<00:07:25.160> but<00:07:26.160> that's<00:07:26.310> how<00:07:26.400> simple<00:07:26.460> it<00:07:26.880> is<00:07:26.910> right

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
is but that's how simple it is right

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.770 
is but that's how simple it is right
there

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.010
