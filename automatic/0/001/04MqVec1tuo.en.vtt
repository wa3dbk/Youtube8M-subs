00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 another pvp tutorial 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.620
 this time it's about the bow and first 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.960
 it's about dodging 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.150
 how I was perfect for you 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.820
 so you have to run as funny as possible 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.609
 that means in zigzag the f5 mode 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.770
 use and the time quite like that 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.180
 but do not run back and forth 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.730
 evenly but sometimes too 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.519
 it's the way it is and so you will never be 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.529
 met by as an example object that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.840
 Do not break it bad 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.850
 will never meet me because of this 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.660
 evades technology already damn good 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.920
 because the enemy never knows where he is going 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.070
 and then you can do the bow 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.460
 completely confused tensions and yes 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 so can a fast meet as you see 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.850
 At the end he will be with a few times 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.649
 meet but in itself is pretty much 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.480
 hard for him because whenever he thinks 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.190
 okay there I go now I am too 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 exactly where else where he does not know 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.210
 where then you can also a few arrows 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.170
 from time to time collect or paint 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.379
 firing a shot 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.930
 and yes, it's pretty perfect 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.909
 In addition, you can get bells through it 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.470
 one exactly 50 percent of the damage and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.229
 Sometimes I only get half 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.659
 heart despite pretty tight bow and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.939
 then this is okay because here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.920
 I watched collect three arrows have 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.619
 three heart less cash in even more 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.240
 that I can do more than that 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 and then if I'm not blogger I am 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.580
 after two shots death half life 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.710
 two shots now we come to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.810
 to meet 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.720
 The best way to meet them is to count 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.970
 between my head and upper body my 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.159
 hobbies 105 in the fall but it does 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.530
 not much difference so always up 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.110
 then pull the head and on the chest 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.360
 I always meet you also have to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.920
 always calculate where he is going so if 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 he now runs to the left then runs there 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.520
 there or you can also all the time 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.320
 Static on a point if he 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.540
 running back and forth like you do not 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.520
 should do while dodging and then 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.649
 you always have a good example 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.440
 I miss now because that's hard 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.630
 to meet someone while pursuing 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.670
 only now, for example , I know yes 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.399
 about where he goes and then you can 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.410
 meet him quite well 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.180
 Here you can see that again just fine 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.640
 you can do it as he runs and 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.570
 and then you shoot into his 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.870
 running purely 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.550
 that works perfectly now and that's the way it works 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.080
 because he always runs left and right 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.390
 if he then goes in one direction then 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.280
 If you know a car, you have to go 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.350
 to have good aiming and to do that 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.989
 everything you have to fully tension 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.880
 here you see now is the arch come her 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.250
 just have a short spamming 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.410
 is wrong or long and gives afterwards 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.440
 come or that just arrived like one 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.519
 that you make the bow 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.640
 Here we see one again 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.330
 Standard fight how to fight 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.590
 could 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.300
 without angel of course and there we use 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.880
 But some elements do not do that 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.530
 Everything perfect and try us one 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.210
 a little bit out there he gives us a blatant 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.430
 combo he does not get the most 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.270
 if there is a death but it is in 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.270
 compared to others 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.070
 Here we always try these sheets 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.160
 combo to the conclusion we do then 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.140
 right now and now we do 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.000
 another shock trick because I can 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.350
 Maike boss the water with the video last 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.340
 but definitely a positive one 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.410
 rating I would be very happy and 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.570
 Of course you can also do the video 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.350
 send it to people who had problems 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.950
 or so 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.110
 Yes 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.640
 Here you can see the end of the purchase and 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.400
 Otherwise, we'll see you next time 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.410
 the old ones will follow you if they are 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.180
 this one helped you write us 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.180
 problems in the comments until then
