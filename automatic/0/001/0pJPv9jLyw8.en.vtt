00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
finger them back a little bit or finger

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.580 
finger them back a little bit or finger
up<00:01:25.140> give<00:01:25.439> them<00:01:25.530> somebody<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:27.290> same<00:01:28.290> thing

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
up give them somebody and same thing

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.140 
up give them somebody and same thing
here<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> brushed<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
here but I just kind of brushed the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.960 
here but I just kind of brushed the
banks<00:01:30.479> forward<00:01:30.930> first<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.490> gives

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
banks forward first I think this gives

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.770 
banks forward first I think this gives
it<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.390> natural<00:01:34.110> look<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:35.420> mean<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.630> get

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it a more natural look I mean I can get

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.609 
it a more natural look I mean I can get
in<00:01:36.900> close<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.979> lace<00:01:38.189> front<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.780> then

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
in close it's a lace front so right then

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.620 
in close it's a lace front so right then
here<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> lights<00:01:42.180> when<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.390> get
