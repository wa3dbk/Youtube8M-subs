00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
happened for everyone who loves it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.650 
happened for everyone who loves it
watches<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.959> coaches<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.799> plays<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:46.540> know

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
watches it coaches it plays it you know

watches it coaches it plays it you know
goes<00:02:46.900> down<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.379> to<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.920> ymca<00:02:48.370> no<00:02:48.640> matter<00:02:48.819> who

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
goes down to to the ymca no matter who

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.500 
goes down to to the ymca no matter who
it<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:50.069> it's<00:02:51.069> basketball<00:02:51.370> as<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.760> whole<00:02:51.940> no

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
it is it's basketball as a whole no

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.089 
it is it's basketball as a whole no
matter<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:52.900> level<00:02:53.079> do<00:02:53.650> matter<00:02:53.890> what

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
matter what level do matter what

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.979 
matter what level do matter what
capacity<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.849> so<00:02:55.030> that's<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.660> different

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
capacity and so that's a different

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.349 
capacity and so that's a different
responsibilities<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.680> W<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.359> born

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
responsibilities that W and be born

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.110 
responsibilities that W and be born
overseas<00:02:58.950> college

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.180 

you<00:03:04.120> know<00:03:04.240> mostly

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you know mostly

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.510 
you know mostly
watching<00:03:07.190> us<00:03:07.400> interact<00:03:08.180> with<00:03:08.360> each<00:03:08.390> other

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.840 
watching us interact with each other
as<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.240> said<00:03:11.100> these<00:03:12.100> are<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.370> same<00:03:12.520> players

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
as I said these are the same players

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.130 
as I said these are the same players
that<00:03:13.060> played<00:03:13.270> in<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.450> World<00:03:13.660> Championships

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
that played in the World Championships

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.380 
that played in the World Championships
that<00:03:14.560> we've<00:03:15.100> added<00:03:15.220> smote<00:03:15.640> Augustus<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.270> out

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
that we've added smote Augustus and out

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.230 
that we've added smote Augustus and out
of<00:03:16.510> cameras<00:03:16.810> by<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.980> how<00:03:18.820> much<00:03:19.000> does<00:03:19.180> that

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
of cameras by so how much does that

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.470 
of cameras by so how much does that
change<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.720> dynamic<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.380> team<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:22.270> game

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
change the dynamic of the team the game

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
change the dynamic of the team the game
it<00:03:22.900> was<00:03:23.020> two<00:03:23.290> more<00:03:23.500> really<00:03:23.800> good<00:03:23.950> players<00:03:25.500> so

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
it was two more really good players so

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.830 
it was two more really good players so
it's<00:03:26.830> not<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.220> well<00:03:28.120> we<00:03:28.300> need<00:03:28.480> these<00:03:28.630> three

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
it's not like well we need these three

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.950 
it's not like well we need these three
days<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.170> find<00:03:29.380> out<00:03:29.530> who's<00:03:29.710> good<00:03:29.920> drove<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.960> we

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
days to find out who's good drove it we

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.700 
days to find out who's good drove it we
need<00:03:32.110> these<00:03:32.320> three<00:03:32.560> days<00:03:32.710> to<00:03:33.010> see<00:03:33.390> who<00:03:34.710> who

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
need these three days to see who who

works<00:03:35.950> well<00:03:36.220> together<00:03:36.370> what<00:03:37.060> things<00:03:37.390> working

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
works well together what things working

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.960 
works well together what things working
with<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.260> group<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:40.410> your<00:03:41.410> kind<00:03:41.590> of

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
springboard because now when they leave

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.610 
springboard because now when they leave
and<00:03:54.640> go<00:03:54.730> play<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.060> WNBA<00:03:55.240> season<00:03:55.690> when<00:03:56.590> I

is at least we'll have some frame of

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.200 
is at least we'll have some frame of
reference<00:04:01.240> this

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
reference this

it's built to win a gold medal hopefully

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.480 
it's built to win a gold medal hopefully
to<00:04:19.370> do<00:04:19.490> that<00:04:20.680> while<00:04:21.680> we<00:04:21.800> talked<00:04:22.040> about<00:04:22.190> that

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
to do that while we talked about that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.070 
to do that while we talked about that
briefly<00:04:22.700> we<00:04:23.210> talked<00:04:23.450> about<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.870> briefly<00:04:24.880> and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
briefly we talked about that briefly and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.570 
briefly we talked about that briefly and
the<00:04:27.080> advantage<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.560> we<00:04:27.740> have<00:04:28.040> most

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
the advantage that we have most

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.760 
the advantage that we have most
countries<00:04:29.030> is<00:04:29.980> work<00:04:30.980> deeper<00:04:32.470> there<00:04:33.470> are<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.620> lot

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
countries is work deeper there are a lot

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.140 
countries is work deeper there are a lot
of<00:04:33.800> great<00:04:34.130> players<00:04:34.280> in<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.670> world<00:04:34.850> and

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
of great players in the world and

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.720 
of great players in the world and
there's<00:04:35.360> some<00:04:35.840> believability<00:04:39.520> going<00:04:40.520> with

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
there's some believability going with

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.660 
there's some believability going with
the<00:04:40.850> premise<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.600> want<00:04:41.870> we<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:43.100> a<00:04:43.400> lot<00:04:43.640> of

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
the premise that I want we have a lot of

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.490 
the premise that I want we have a lot of
good<00:04:43.970> players<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.540> other<00:04:44.690> teams<00:04:45.020> have<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.260> lot

good players the other teams have a lot

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.180 
good players the other teams have a lot
of<00:04:45.530> complexity<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:47.240> world<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.950> gap

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
of complexity of world that the gap

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.190 
of complexity of world that the gap
between<00:04:49.370> our<00:04:49.790> first<00:04:50.060> five<00:04:50.300> in<00:04:50.570> our<00:04:50.660> next<00:04:50.960> five

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
between our first five in our next five

between our first five in our next five
and<00:04:51.500> said<00:04:51.650> may<00:04:52.250> not<00:04:52.490> be<00:04:52.640> as<00:04:52.730> great<00:04:53.030> as<00:04:53.180> some

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
and said may not be as great as some

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.360 
and said may not be as great as some
