about a portable generator as you can
see<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.370> right<00:02:44.519> here<00:02:44.880> has<00:02:45.480> wheels<00:02:45.959> and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
see this one right here has wheels and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.080 
see this one right here has wheels and
if<00:02:46.319> we<00:02:46.440> zoom<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.670> can<00:02:47.819> see<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
if we zoom in on it you can see the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.660 
if we zoom in on it you can see the
wheels<00:02:48.239> here<00:02:48.680> my<00:02:49.680> recommendation<00:02:50.040> would<00:02:50.519> be

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
wheels here my recommendation would be

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.670 
wheels here my recommendation would be
to<00:02:50.819> get<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.600> kind<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:52.140> wheels<00:02:52.410> because

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
to get the kind with wheels because

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.250 
to get the kind with wheels because
these<00:02:52.920> things<00:02:53.220> are<00:02:53.519> heavy<00:02:54.269> heavy<00:02:54.989> heavy

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
these things are heavy heavy heavy

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.680 
these things are heavy heavy heavy
puppies<00:02:56.010> I've<00:02:56.310> lifted<00:02:56.760> plenty<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.299> these<00:02:57.450> with

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
puppies I've lifted plenty of these with

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.380 
puppies I've lifted plenty of these with
some<00:02:57.870> friends<00:02:58.230> off<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.700> back<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:00.090> trucks

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
some friends off of the back of trucks

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.660

and<00:03:00.569> they<00:03:00.780> are<00:03:01.019> extremely<00:03:01.380> heavy<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.370> make

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and they are extremely heavy so make

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.160 
and they are extremely heavy so make
sure<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.120> get<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.540> ones<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.930> wheels

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
