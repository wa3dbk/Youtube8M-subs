earth<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:34.200> playing<00:00:34.559> technically<00:00:35.190> an

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
earth we are not playing technically an

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.830 
earth we are not playing technically an
adventure<00:00:35.700> map<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.030> more<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> puzzle<00:00:36.510> map

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
adventure map it's more of a puzzle map

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.299 
adventure map it's more of a puzzle map
but<00:00:37.050> there's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> little<00:00:37.590> twist<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
but there's a little twist it's like a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.180 
but there's a little twist it's like a
race<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:39.629> made<00:00:39.870> by<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.079> guy<00:00:40.290> named<00:00:40.559> king<00:00:40.860> drew

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
race it's made by a guy named king drew

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.580 
race it's made by a guy named king drew
ii<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.520> he<00:00:42.000> designed<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.540> map<00:00:43.200> called<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
ii and he designed this map called the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.229 
ii and he designed this map called the
gauntlet<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> it's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
gauntlet and and it's and it's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.860 
gauntlet and and it's and it's
essentially<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> race<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.690> guess<00:00:48.690> there's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
essentially a race and I guess there's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.600 
essentially a race and I guess there's
like<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.079> series<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.500> challenges<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.489> know<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
like a series of challenges you know I

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.040 
like a series of challenges you know I
one<00:00:50.969> after<00:00:51.210> another<00:00:51.239> whatever<00:00:51.780> whoever

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
one after another whatever whoever

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.689 
one after another whatever whoever
finishes<00:00:52.289> first<00:00:52.530> wins<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.430> designed

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
finishes first wins and it's designed

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.869 
finishes first wins and it's designed
for<00:00:53.760> two<00:00:54.000> people<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.350> figure<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.340> since

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
for two people and I figure that since

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.549 
for two people and I figure that since
it's<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> competition<00:00:57.840> thing<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.410> guys

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
it's like a competition thing you guys

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's like a competition thing you guys
can<00:00:58.920> post<00:00:59.579> video<00:00:59.940> responses<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.050> guys
