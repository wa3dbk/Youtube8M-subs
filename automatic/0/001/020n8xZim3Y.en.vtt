00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello youtube welcome here 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.269
 is the not family we have united 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.889
 here the note 1 the 0 2 and the current one 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.850
 not 34 times the size comparison so 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.800
 from the principle of doing everything away 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.449
 yes, note one is wider than that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.250
 other and you can see the edges 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.390
 have become in the course of development 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.130
 ever smaller 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 but the biggest factor actually remains 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.579
 the same from the side is the north 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 1 still followed by distance the thickest 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.100
 from o2 and the note 3 if you have it now 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 all times directly compare 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.780
 like the whole thing out there still short 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.829
 focus 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:56.390
 so you can see the whole here you can see 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.390
 that's just fine and the back 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.490
 so you can see that note 3 is 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.540
 really the most elegant with this one 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.060
 This looks really nice 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.000
 pretty good and then we look 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.000
 give us all the pins 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.659
 here we have the pen of note 3 0 2 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.819
 and 0 1 so synonymous because of the size ago 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.440
 not much has happened 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.690
 it is still around from note one 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.819
 the button difficult to find the foundation 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.159
 note 2 was then I corner with 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.140
 This lace is really light 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.409
 So it was already spring-loaded 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.299
 nice writing and here at note 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.429
 3 also donated in the corner and this 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.950
 small tip is not quite so 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.420
 flexible as the Bernese twice so 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.649
 already a little tight on it 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.030
 rewrite 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.170
 but it really feels so you have 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.780
 by a bit more resistance and 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.239
 it definitely feels better 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.619
 here again in the right light 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:10.929
 here the note 3 the 0 2 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.370
 now it gets complicated here and that 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:19.510
 once renewed and the pens maybe 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:22.209
 also sort 23 briefly and the note 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.849
 1 even if it is a bit and now 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.280
 Symmetrical is the conclusion that was mine 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.569
 Comparison of the emergency we catch up 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.569
