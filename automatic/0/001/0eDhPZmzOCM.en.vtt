this overactivity of the mind as the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
that come off in pairs left and right so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.990 
that come off in pairs left and right so
it's<00:02:13.870> got<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> sort<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.830> geometry<00:02:15.160> about<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
it's got a sort of geometry about the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's got a sort of geometry about the
way<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.540> structured<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:20.050> leaves<00:02:20.620> grow

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
way that it's structured the leaves grow

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.670 
way that it's structured the leaves grow
close<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> ground<00:02:22.390> for<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.200> most<00:02:23.410> part

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
close to the ground for the most part

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.170 
close to the ground for the most part
and<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:25.030> stems<00:02:25.330> grow<00:02:26.110> up<00:02:26.440> they<00:02:27.220> seem<00:02:28.030> to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
and as the stems grow up they seem to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.800 
and as the stems grow up they seem to
grow<00:02:28.360> away<00:02:28.780> from<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.200> leaves<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.709> into<00:02:30.340> space

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
grow away from the leaves and into space

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.150 
grow away from the leaves and into space
so<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.170> as<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:33.310> look<00:02:33.700> at<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.600> flowers

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
so that as you look at the flowers

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.430 
so that as you look at the flowers
they're<00:02:36.160> like<00:02:36.640> little<00:02:37.030> stars<00:02:37.600> held<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:39.130> space

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
they're like little stars held in space

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.220 
they're like little stars held in space
so<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> positive<00:02:41.769> side<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.640> vervain<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.390> shown

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
so the positive side of vervain is shown

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.120 
so the positive side of vervain is shown
in<00:02:44.560> this<00:02:44.820> very<00:02:45.820> beautiful<00:02:46.540> pale<00:02:47.170> move<00:02:47.560> in<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
expresses the idea that perhaps we

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.380 
expresses the idea that perhaps we
should<00:02:54.820> watch<00:02:55.780> life<00:02:56.709> rather<00:02:57.220> than<00:02:57.549> force<00:02:58.120> it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
should watch life rather than force it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.509 
should watch life rather than force it
not<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.140> try<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.440> impose<00:02:59.950> our<00:03:00.250> will<00:03:00.280> upon
