00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
actually a surprisingly high amount I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.689 
actually a surprisingly high amount I
didn't<00:00:54.780> expect<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.410> 11<00:00:56.010> responses<00:00:56.129> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
didn't expect to get 11 responses that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.349 
didn't expect to get 11 responses that
we<00:00:56.850> did<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.780> 11<00:00:58.170> plus<00:00:58.710> me<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.969> means<00:01:00.180> we

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
we did so 11 plus me so that means we

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.869 
we did so 11 plus me so that means we
have<00:01:00.480> 12<00:01:00.780> judges<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.469> both<00:01:02.070> nominate<00:01:02.670> gains

for Game of the Year and then at the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.160 
for Game of the Year and then at the
very<00:01:05.220> end<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.729> would<00:01:05.909> take<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> boat<00:01:06.390> so

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
very end then we would take a boat so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.530 
very end then we would take a boat so
exactly<00:01:07.770> how<00:01:07.890> does<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> process<00:01:08.460> work<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
exactly how does the process work so

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.260 
exactly how does the process work so
each<00:01:09.869> channel<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.950> submit<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.790> nominees

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and once all the nominees Rin I would

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.679 
and once all the nominees Rin I would
take<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.590> top<00:01:16.979> three<00:01:17.340> games<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> most

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
take the top three games with the most

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.070 
take the top three games with the most
nominations<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.030> each<00:01:21.030> channel<00:01:21.540> regardless

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
nominations and each channel regardless

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.010 
nominations and each channel regardless
of<00:01:22.340> subscriber<00:01:23.340> size<00:01:23.670> following<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> all

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
of subscriber size following and all

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140 
of subscriber size following and all
that<00:01:25.200> kind<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.500> stuff<00:01:25.560> would<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.880> single

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that kind of stuff would get one single

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.609 
that kind of stuff would get one single
vote<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.229> each<00:01:28.530> channel<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.159> vote<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:30.619> each

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
vote so each channel would vote for each

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.429 
vote so each channel would vote for each
game<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.490> top<00:01:32.670> three<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:34.200> one

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
game in the top three and then the one

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.130 
game in the top three and then the one
game<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> most<00:01:35.759> vote<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> top<00:01:36.840> three

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
game with the most vote of the top three

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.800 
game with the most vote of the top three
