00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.610 
long as the Maybelline tattoo and it's
funny<00:02:26.640> because<00:02:26.730> there<00:02:27.120> was<00:02:27.299> I<00:02:27.540> could<00:02:28.349> have<00:02:28.470> got

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
funny because there was I could have got

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.039 
funny because there was I could have got
this<00:02:28.799> all<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.220> tattoo<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.000> thought<00:02:30.659> I'd<00:02:30.840> get

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
this all the tattoo I thought I'd get

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.250 
this all the tattoo I thought I'd get
this<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:32.450> bourgeois<00:02:33.450> one<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.900> see<00:02:34.049> what<00:02:34.170> they

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
this and bourgeois one to see what they

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.960 
this and bourgeois one to see what they
were<00:02:34.349> like<00:02:34.590> because<00:02:35.129> I've<00:02:35.310> already<00:02:35.519> tried<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
were like because I've already tried the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.789 
were like because I've already tried the
tattoo<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.480> know<00:02:36.540> they're<00:02:36.810> good<00:02:37.019> that

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
tattoo and I know they're good that

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.649 
tattoo and I know they're good that
doesn't<00:02:38.099> really<00:02:38.220> make<00:02:38.760> any<00:02:38.819> sense<00:02:39.269> does<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.540> I

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
doesn't really make any sense does it I

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.729 
doesn't really make any sense does it I
should<00:02:39.840> have<00:02:39.959> gone<00:02:40.049> with<00:02:40.109> one<00:02:40.409> night<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.650> it

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
should have gone with one night and it

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.170 
should have gone with one night and it
was<00:02:40.859> good<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.069> they've<00:02:41.489> got<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.849> exact

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
was good because they've got the exact

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.360 
was good because they've got the exact
same<00:02:42.420> color<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.159> tattoo<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.680> formula<00:02:47.069> is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
same color in the tattoo this formula is

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.770 
same color in the tattoo this formula is
more<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:49.650> softer<00:02:50.190> than<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.609> tattoo<00:02:50.909> off<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.450> can

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
more is softer than the tattoo off I can

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.960 
more is softer than the tattoo off I can
see<00:02:52.019> which<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:53.010> make<00:02:53.159> sense<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.549> it's<00:02:53.819> not

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
see which would make sense that it's not

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.660 
see which would make sense that it's not
going<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.510> last<00:02:55.319> as<00:02:55.620> long<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:56.190> see<00:02:56.340> I'm<00:02:56.459> just

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
going to last as long can see I'm just

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.059 
going to last as long can see I'm just
keep<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:56.909> layering<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.389> on<00:02:57.510> because<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:58.560> this

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
keep on layering it on because with this

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.879 
keep on layering it on because with this
is<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> real<00:02:59.549> sort<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.879> dramatic<00:03:00.650> definite<00:03:01.650> Navy

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
is a real sort of dramatic definite Navy

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.460 
is a real sort of dramatic definite Navy
look<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.519> blended<00:03:03.000> out<00:03:03.120> blue<00:03:03.989> or<00:03:04.200> anything

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
look not blended out blue or anything

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.920 
look not blended out blue or anything
like<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.190> going<00:03:05.400> literally<00:03:06.329> up<00:03:06.599> to

I<00:03:27.970> wanted<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.690> stop<00:03:28.960> join<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.470> color<00:03:29.740> there

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.040 

i<00:03:37.300> canna<00:03:38.080> sort<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.380> V<00:03:38.620> there<00:03:39.720> as<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.930> other

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
i canna sort of V there as the other

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.040 
i canna sort of V there as the other
side<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:42.100> kind<00:03:43.060> as<00:03:43.240> far<00:03:43.450> as<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.660> need<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.870> to

skaara<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.520> actually<00:05:16.000> forgot<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.570> put<00:05:16.720> mascara

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
skaara I actually forgot to put mascara

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.170 
skaara I actually forgot to put mascara
on<00:05:17.170> before<00:05:17.590> putting<00:05:17.800> these<00:05:17.980> eyelashes<00:05:18.760> on<00:05:18.970> and

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
on before putting these eyelashes on and

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.100 
on before putting these eyelashes on and
I<00:05:19.240> think<00:05:19.270> that<00:05:19.510> made<00:05:19.690> it<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.840> little<00:05:19.960> bit

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
I think that made it a little bit

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.190 
I think that made it a little bit
difficult<00:05:20.970> because<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.300> don't<00:05:22.540> know<00:05:22.630> why<00:05:22.810> but<00:05:23.080> I

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
difficult because I don't know why but I

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.950 
difficult because I don't know why but I
think<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.620> feel<00:05:23.800> like<00:05:23.890> it<00:05:24.040> did<00:05:27.030> I'm<00:05:28.030> just<00:05:28.270> a

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
think I feel like it did I'm just a

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.750 
think I feel like it did I'm just a
she's<00:05:29.170> definitely<00:05:30.070> not<00:05:30.100> be<00:05:30.340> able<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.550> be<00:05:30.700> used

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
she's definitely not be able to be used

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.140 
she's definitely not be able to be used
again<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.830> so<00:05:32.830> that's<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.160> eyes<00:05:33.280> done<00:05:33.550> I<00:05:33.760> just

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150

myself to be honest I really like the
color<00:05:56.110> i<00:05:56.290> think<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.590> blue<00:05:56.890> is<00:05:57.130> a<00:05:57.160> stunning

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
color i think the blue is a stunning

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.860 
color i think the blue is a stunning
color<00:05:57.970> but<00:05:58.210> i'm<00:05:58.300> just<00:05:58.330> one<00:05:58.570> hundred<00:05:58.720> percent

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870

sure of it on me and i don't know
whether<00:06:00.580> that's<00:06:00.700> I<00:06:01.150> think<00:06:01.660> it<00:06:01.930> might<00:06:02.050> look

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
whether that's I think it might look

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.950 
whether that's I think it might look
better<00:06:02.380> on<00:06:02.680> younger<00:06:03.430> skin<00:06:03.850> may<00:06:04.060> be<00:06:04.120> warmer

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
better on younger skin may be warmer

better on younger skin may be warmer
skin<00:06:05.290> may<00:06:05.770> be<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:05.920> different<00:06:06.190> color<00:06:06.280> eyes<00:06:06.520> i'm
