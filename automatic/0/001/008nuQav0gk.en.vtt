it's<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.150> difficult<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.409> know

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
it's really difficult because you know

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.020 
it's really difficult because you know
when<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.829> guys<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.280> from<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.610> EXO<00:01:42.000> abilities

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
when you guys go from like EXO abilities

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330

anything<00:01:52.470> at<00:01:52.710> all<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.159> whereas<00:01:53.700> when<00:01:53.850> I'm

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
anything at all and whereas when I'm

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880 
anything at all and whereas when I'm
used<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> tapping<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.689> over<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.200> over<00:01:55.320> I'm

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
used to tapping that over and over I'm

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.550 
used to tapping that over and over I'm
pressing<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> XO<00:01:57.149> grapple<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.259> kind<00:01:58.530> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
pressing the XO grapple so it's kind of

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
pressing the XO grapple so it's kind of
a<00:01:58.680> pain<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.009> butt<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.490> used<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> but

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
a pain in the butt to get used to but

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.510 
a pain in the butt to get used to but
for<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> most<00:02:00.600> part<00:02:00.719> XO<00:02:01.200> grapple<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.770> nothing

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
for the most part XO grapple is nothing

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249

core mechanics is the exact same but for

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.369 
core mechanics is the exact same but for
the<00:02:16.730> most<00:02:16.939> part<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.720> know<00:02:17.840> there's<00:02:18.049> a<00:02:18.110> there's

the most part you know there's a there's
a<00:02:18.470> few<00:02:18.860> minor<00:02:19.069> adjustments<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.879> it<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.599> apart

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
a few minor adjustments to it but apart

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.350 
a few minor adjustments to it but apart
from<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.349> guys<00:02:21.650> again<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.849> game<00:02:23.000> plays<00:02:23.209> on

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.089 
from that guys again the game plays on
the<00:02:23.480> greatest<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.500> far<00:02:24.709> I'm<00:02:24.950> really

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
the greatest but so far I'm really

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.069 
the greatest but so far I'm really
enjoying<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.730> DLC<00:02:26.209> apart<00:02:26.810> from<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.019> fact

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
enjoying the DLC apart from the fact

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.710 
enjoying the DLC apart from the fact

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that i was uploading a video and i was

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.030 
that i was uploading a video and i was
lagging<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.440> know<00:02:30.500> somewhat<00:02:30.890> while

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
lagging you know somewhat while

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.160 
lagging you know somewhat while
uploading<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:32.269> know<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.390> actually<00:02:32.629> did<00:02:32.959> fairly

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
uploading you know I actually did fairly

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.990 
uploading you know I actually did fairly
well<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.069> far<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.489> know<00:02:34.579> there's<00:02:34.760> three

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
well and so far you know there's three

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.610 
well and so far you know there's three
lanes<00:02:35.239> throughout<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.629> map<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.379> know<00:02:36.500> if

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
lanes throughout this map you know if

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.050 
lanes throughout this map you know if
there's<00:02:36.769> not<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.980> lot<00:02:37.190> of<00:02:37.220> room<00:02:37.549> where<00:02:37.760> people

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
there's not a lot of room where people

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.119 
there's not a lot of room where people
can<00:02:38.180> go<00:02:38.299> above<00:02:38.690> ground<00:02:38.720> or<00:02:39.109> below<00:02:39.349> ground<00:02:39.680> so

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
can go above ground or below ground so

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.679 
can go above ground or below ground so

time I got killed it was from somebody

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.539 
time I got killed it was from somebody
that<00:03:02.599> was<00:03:02.989> on<00:03:03.139> level<00:03:03.470> ground<00:03:03.500> as<00:03:03.920> me<00:03:04.099> which<00:03:04.370> is

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
something that very seldom happens

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.839 
something that very seldom happens
that's<00:03:06.470> one<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.769> reasons<00:03:07.069> why<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.519> just

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
often because after a while you know I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.869 
often because after a while you know I
just<00:03:12.290> get<00:03:12.440> yer<00:03:12.620> Tate<00:03:12.889> it<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.220> know<00:03:13.340> died<00:03:13.549> from
