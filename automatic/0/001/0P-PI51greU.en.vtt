yeah<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.660> know<00:00:06.899> it's<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.200> it's<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:08.069> it's<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:09.030> it's

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
yeah you know it's a it's a it's a it's

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.080 
yeah you know it's a it's a it's a it's
a<00:00:09.450> lot<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.930> hard<00:00:10.080> space<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.500> be<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:11.090> sometimes

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
a lot of hard space to be in sometimes

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.450 
a lot of hard space to be in sometimes
especially<00:00:12.440> if<00:00:13.440> teams<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> roll<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
especially if teams on a roll and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.369 
especially if teams on a roll and
there's<00:00:14.880> not<00:00:15.000> many<00:00:15.120> changes<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.200> sort

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
there's not many changes and just sort

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.080 
there's not many changes and just sort
of<00:00:16.410> waiting<00:00:16.800> but<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.669> suppose<00:00:18.119> that's<00:00:18.360> the

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
of waiting but I suppose that's the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.540 
of waiting but I suppose that's the
it's<00:00:20.600> a<00:00:20.660> hard<00:00:20.840> thing<00:00:20.900> about<00:00:21.190> about<00:00:22.190> it<00:00:22.370> but

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
it's a hard thing about about it but

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.780 
it's a hard thing about about it but
it's<00:00:22.670> also<00:00:23.890> it's<00:00:24.890> actually<00:00:25.460> also<00:00:25.580> quite

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
it's also it's actually also quite

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.060 
it's also it's actually also quite
exciting<00:00:26.210> because<00:00:26.300> you<00:00:26.570> can<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:27.440> can<00:00:27.890> get<00:00:28.040> a

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
exciting because you can you can get a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.470 
exciting because you can you can get a
gap<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:28.580> then<00:00:28.670> it<00:00:28.760> goes<00:00:28.910> well<00:00:29.119> for<00:00:29.360> you<00:00:29.390> and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
gap and then it goes well for you and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.220 
gap and then it goes well for you and
and<00:00:29.900> sort<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:30.740> look<00:00:30.830> like<00:00:30.860> a<00:00:31.010> hero<00:00:31.220> but<00:00:31.720> yeah<00:00:32.720> it

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
and sort of look like a hero but yeah it

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.030 
and sort of look like a hero but yeah it
can<00:00:34.160> be<00:00:34.280> difficult<00:00:34.400> but<00:00:34.850> you<00:00:35.030> know<00:00:35.150> it's<00:00:36.040> often

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
can be difficult but you know it's often

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.500 
can be difficult but you know it's often
I've<00:00:37.520> sort<00:00:37.879> of<00:00:38.199> got<00:00:39.199> away<00:00:39.290> around<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:40.580> make

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
I've sort of got away around it I make

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.869 
I've sort of got away around it I make
sure<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:41.780> i'm<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.930> i'm<00:00:42.199> prepared<00:00:42.670> what<00:00:43.670> every

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
sure that i'm a i'm prepared what every

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.150

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
just the case of sort of mentally

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.020 
just the case of sort of mentally
switching<00:00:48.199> on<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.350> going<00:00:49.129> to<00:00:49.280> your<00:00:49.370> processes

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
and just yeah I just kind of have to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.290 
and just yeah I just kind of have to
wing<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.190> just<00:00:55.340> go<00:00:55.489> with<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:55.850> mean<00:00:55.940> what

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
wing it you just go with it I mean what

wing it you just go with it I mean what
else<00:00:56.329> what<00:00:56.809> else<00:00:56.840> do<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.340> yeah<00:00:58.840> at<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.989> moment

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
else what else do it yeah at the moment

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.139 
else what else do it yeah at the moment
I<00:01:00.320> still<00:01:00.559> think<00:01:00.710> I'm<00:01:00.800> part<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.190> until<00:01:02.030> I'm

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
I still think I'm part of it until I'm

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.280 
I still think I'm part of it until I'm
told<00:01:02.329> otherwise<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.250> it's<00:01:04.250> it's<00:01:04.610> easier<00:01:04.970> to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
told otherwise so it's it's easier to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.200 
told otherwise so it's it's easier to
it's<00:01:06.290> easier<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:06.770> get<00:01:06.950> myself<00:01:07.130> ready<00:01:07.850> for<00:01:08.149> it

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's easier to get myself ready for it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.090 
it's easier to get myself ready for it
and<00:01:08.240> then<00:01:08.540> let<00:01:08.990> down<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.470> tell<00:01:09.770> them<00:01:09.890> I'm<00:01:09.950> not

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
and then let down and tell them I'm not

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.560 
and then let down and tell them I'm not
playing<00:01:10.340> then<00:01:10.640> other<00:01:10.940> way<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.240> think<00:01:11.390> well

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
playing then other way and think well

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.029 
playing then other way and think well
I'm<00:01:11.660> not<00:01:11.810> playing<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:12.200> inside<00:01:12.440> me<00:01:12.590> oh<00:01:12.740> I've

got<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.340> switch<00:01:13.670> on<00:01:13.820> I'd<00:01:14.000> rather<00:01:14.149> switch<00:01:14.420> on

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
got to switch on I'd rather switch on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.840 
got to switch on I'd rather switch on
from<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.869> couple<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.200> days<00:01:15.320> out<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.009> get<00:01:16.550> to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and keeping everything in check but I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.260 
and keeping everything in check but I
think<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:25.850> work<00:02:26.000> well<00:02:26.030> together<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:27.230> think<00:02:28.010> we

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
think we work well together I think we

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.460 
think we work well together I think we
similar<00:02:29.270> in<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.420> way<00:02:29.450> as<00:02:29.840> I'm<00:02:30.140> see<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> bit

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
similar in a way as I'm see a bit

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.440 
similar in a way as I'm see a bit
quicker<00:02:30.710> but<00:02:31.010> i<00:02:31.310> think<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.700> looking<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
quicker but i think we looking to the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.270 
quicker but i think we looking to the
same<00:02:32.630> thing<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.290> think<00:02:33.770> we<00:02:33.830> work<00:02:33.950> well<00:02:33.980> as<00:02:34.220> a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
same thing and I think we work well as a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.410 
same thing and I think we work well as a
body<00:02:34.490> shop<00:02:34.990> no<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.020> don't<00:02:36.800> think<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:38.300> know<00:02:38.390> I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
body shop no I don't think so you know I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.960 
body shop no I don't think so you know I
just<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:39.080> feel<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.340> last<00:02:40.520> couple<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.820> days

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
just I feel that the last couple of days

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.610 
just I feel that the last couple of days
around<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.360> guys<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.810> almost<00:02:42.200> seems<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.500> be<00:02:42.590> a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
around the guys it almost seems to be a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.680 
around the guys it almost seems to be a
bit<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.920> spring<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.280> our<00:02:43.370> step<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:44.660> you

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
bit of a spring in our step that you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.810 
bit of a spring in our step that you
know<00:02:44.870> what<00:02:44.990> we<00:02:45.050> actually<00:02:45.170> can<00:02:45.470> do<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.830> it's

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
know what we actually can do that it's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.520 
know what we actually can do that it's
all<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.090> critics<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.690> everyone's<00:02:48.350> saying

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
all the critics and everyone's saying

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.880 
all the critics and everyone's saying
that<00:02:48.710> we<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.100> we<00:02:49.130> can't<00:02:49.460> and<00:02:50.710> Russia<00:02:51.710> gone

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
that we that we can't and Russia gone

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.780 
that we that we can't and Russia gone
the<00:02:51.980> other<00:02:52.010> way<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.280> don't<00:02:52.490> think<00:02:52.640> guys<00:02:52.760> are

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
the other way I don't think guys are

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.890 
the other way I don't think guys are
going<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.090> sit<00:02:53.210> back<00:02:53.360> i<00:02:53.540> think<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:53.810> is

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
going to sit back i think this is

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.570 
going to sit back i think this is
actually<00:02:53.990> just<00:02:54.260> going<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.440> take<00:02:54.620> us<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
actually just going to take us to the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.520 
actually just going to take us to the
next<00:02:55.610> step<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.000> just<00:02:56.780> believe<00:02:57.050> even<00:02:57.350> more

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
next step and just believe even more

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.440 
next step and just believe even more
whatever<00:02:58.160> conditions<00:02:58.670> whoever<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
whatever conditions whoever that the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.590 
whatever conditions whoever that the
opposition<00:02:59.690> is<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:00.620> we<00:03:00.740> can<00:03:00.890> actually<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.190> it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
opposition is that we can actually do it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.810 
opposition is that we can actually do it

that<00:03:38.680> what<00:03:39.680> we<00:03:39.800> were<00:03:39.920> never<00:03:40.100> going<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> get

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
that what we were never going to get

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.280 
that what we were never going to get
there<00:03:40.670> but<00:03:40.850> at<00:03:41.300> least<00:03:41.480> he<00:03:41.630> knows<00:03:41.780> now<00:03:42.020> that<00:03:42.050> he

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
there but at least he knows now that he

there but at least he knows now that he
that<00:03:42.620> he<00:03:42.680> made<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.340> effort<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.700> couldn't<00:03:44.270> get

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
that he made in effort and couldn't get

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.390 
that he made in effort and couldn't get
then<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.840> that's<00:03:45.650> what<00:03:45.770> abies<00:03:46.010> asked<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.370> us

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
then and that's what abies asked for us

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.890 
then and that's what abies asked for us
he<00:03:46.580> said<00:03:46.700> he<00:03:46.820> once<00:03:47.000> once<00:03:47.390> has<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.690> create

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
he said he once once has to create

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.199 
he said he once once has to create
chances<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.680> that's<00:03:49.640> what<00:03:49.730> we<00:03:49.820> did<00:03:49.940> we<00:03:50.060> gave

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
chances and that's what we did we gave

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.030 
chances and that's what we did we gave
ourselves<00:03:50.330> every<00:03:50.930> every<00:03:51.380> chance<00:03:51.650> there<00:03:51.920> the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
ourselves every every chance there the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.610 
ourselves every every chance there the
other<00:03:52.160> night<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:53.050> like<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.140> said<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.350> think<00:03:54.560> it's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
other night and like I said I think it's

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.740 
other night and like I said I think it's
just<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:55.040> that's<00:03:55.940> just<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.240> confidence<00:03:56.420> thing

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
just a that's just the confidence thing

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.390 
just a that's just the confidence thing
now<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.020> we<00:03:57.140> actually<00:03:57.260> can<00:03:57.590> do<00:03:57.770> it<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.040> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
now that we actually can do it and and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.540 
now that we actually can do it and and
we<00:03:59.000> can<00:03:59.150> take<00:03:59.510> it<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.810> next<00:03:59.900> level

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550
