00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
live and everything one up started to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.940 
live and everything one up started to
get<00:02:03.960> lunch<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:05.189> came<00:02:05.430> back<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.969> then<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:07.439> just

get lunch and came back and then it just
randomly<00:02:08.879> disconnected<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.709> fixing

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
randomly disconnected and I'm in fixing

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.730 
randomly disconnected and I'm in fixing
it<00:02:11.250> ever

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
it ever

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.890 
it ever
and<00:02:12.070> I<00:02:12.160> have<00:02:12.250> no<00:02:12.310> idea<00:02:12.910> what<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.720> hell

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
and I have no idea what the hell

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.510 
and I have no idea what the hell
happened<00:02:14.350> it's<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.920> not<00:02:15.010> working<00:02:15.310> anymore

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
happened it's just not working anymore

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.370 
happened it's just not working anymore
so<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:18.120> basically<00:02:19.120> have<00:02:19.600> no<00:02:19.780> ideas<00:02:20.140> how<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.260> fix

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so I basically have no ideas how to fix

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.770 
so I basically have no ideas how to fix
it<00:02:20.710> at<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:20.980> point<00:02:21.220> most<00:02:22.180> people<00:02:22.450> said<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.720> I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
it at this point most people said that I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.150 
it at this point most people said that I
should<00:02:23.020> just<00:02:23.140> probably<00:02:23.350> try<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.680> wait<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:23.980> out

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
should just probably try to wait it out

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.010 
should just probably try to wait it out
then<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.520> comes<00:02:24.640> back<00:02:24.760> after<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.360> while<00:02:25.570> but

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
then it comes back after a while but

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.280 
then it comes back after a while but

now on and I'm still learning how it
works<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.710> it's<00:03:30.040> still<00:03:30.130> trying<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.460> get<00:03:30.520> used

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
works and it's still trying to get used

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.170 
works and it's still trying to get used
to<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:31.270> I<00:03:31.330> may<00:03:31.600> not<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:32.440> know<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:33.730> videos

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.780 
to it so I may not you know have videos
for<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.720> that's<00:03:35.020> used<00:03:35.260> from<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.590> much<00:03:35.950> but

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
for it that's used from it that much but

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.540 
for it that's used from it that much but
in<00:03:37.480> time<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.140> will<00:03:38.200> you'll<00:03:38.680> start<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.220> see<00:03:39.310> the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
in time I will you'll start to see the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.820 
in time I will you'll start to see the
progress<00:03:39.760> or<00:03:40.300> grow<00:03:40.420> even<00:03:40.600> further<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.260> all

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
progress or grow even further and all

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.180 
progress or grow even further and all
that<00:03:42.070> type<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.280> stuff<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:43.290> hopefully<00:03:44.290> i'll<00:03:44.920> get

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
that type of stuff so hopefully i'll get

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.720 
that type of stuff so hopefully i'll get
used<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.550> assume<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.300> then<00:03:47.340> start<00:03:48.340> using<00:03:48.520> it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
used to assume and then start using it

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.150 
used to assume and then start using it
but<00:03:49.030> can't<00:03:49.540> do<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.870> until<00:03:50.080> i<00:03:50.230> have<00:03:50.470> xbox<00:03:50.860> live

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
but can't do that until i have xbox live

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.910 
but can't do that until i have xbox live
but<00:03:51.490> oh<00:03:51.700> well<00:03:52.540> guess<00:03:52.900> we'll<00:03:53.620> just<00:03:53.680> have<00:03:53.830> to

like<00:05:15.790> short<00:05:16.240> little<00:05:16.389> comedy<00:05:17.320> skits<00:05:17.800> I<00:05:18.010> guess

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
like short little comedy skits I guess

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.790 
like short little comedy skits I guess
that<00:05:18.550> I'll<00:05:18.669> try<00:05:18.970> to<00:05:19.000> make<00:05:19.169> but<00:05:20.169> those<00:05:20.440> are<00:05:20.590> most

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
that I'll try to make but those are most

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.379 
that I'll try to make but those are most
likely<00:05:21.010> be<00:05:21.190> uploaded<00:05:21.550> on<00:05:21.610> my<00:05:21.729> second<00:05:22.090> channel

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
likely be uploaded on my second channel

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.520 
likely be uploaded on my second channel
because<00:05:22.600> this<00:05:22.810> channel<00:05:23.139> is<00:05:23.200> mainly<00:05:23.380> for

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
because this channel is mainly for

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.510 
because this channel is mainly for
gaming<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.280> stuff<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:25.660> I'll<00:05:26.110> probably<00:05:26.770> try<00:05:27.460> to

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
gaming and stuff so I'll probably try to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.779 
gaming and stuff so I'll probably try to
just<00:05:28.210> do<00:05:28.389> a<00:05:29.010> walk-through<00:05:30.010> of<00:05:30.039> saints<00:05:30.430> row<00:05:30.580> two

by<00:05:32.800> myself<00:05:33.010> I<00:05:33.490> know<00:05:33.940> I<00:05:34.090> told<00:05:34.479> everybody<00:05:34.690> that<00:05:34.960> I

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
by myself I know I told everybody that I

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.740 
by myself I know I told everybody that I
would<00:05:35.440> do<00:05:35.620> it<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:35.830> co-op<00:05:36.250> but<00:05:36.550> I<00:05:36.610> can't<00:05:37.090> right

now so i'll see if i can just do that in
single<00:05:40.990> player<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.500> then<00:05:43.380> yeah<00:05:44.380> that's

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
single player and then yeah that's
