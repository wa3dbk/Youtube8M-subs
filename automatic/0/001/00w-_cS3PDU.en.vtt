be unable to control the situation and
at<00:03:11.879> that<00:03:12.180> point<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:13.049> think<00:03:13.379> he<00:03:13.709> will<00:03:13.950> become<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
at that point I think he will become a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.670 
at that point I think he will become a

the army as well a significant danger is
that<00:03:21.269> Pakistan<00:03:22.019> may<00:03:22.290> come<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.680> resemble<00:03:23.129> Iran

that Pakistan may come to resemble Iran

I<00:07:25.580> mentioned<00:07:26.089> they're<00:07:26.389> all<00:07:26.509> worrying<00:07:26.779> about

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
I mentioned they're all worrying about

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.860

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870 
there also is in Pakistan a significant

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.230 
there also is in Pakistan a significant
moderate<00:07:30.620> middle<00:07:30.860> that<00:07:31.219> tends<00:07:31.490> to<00:07:31.729> write

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 
moderate middle that tends to write

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.879 
moderate middle that tends to write
itself<00:07:32.629> whenever<00:07:32.990> the<00:07:33.169> country<00:07:33.499> goes<00:07:33.650> into

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:33.889 
itself whenever the country goes into

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.469 
itself whenever the country goes into
chaos<00:07:34.219> so<00:07:34.669> they're<00:07:34.819> hoping<00:07:35.089> for<00:07:35.240> that

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 
chaos so they're hoping for that

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.839 
chaos so they're hoping for that
self-correcting<00:07:36.409> mechanism<00:07:36.439> now<00:07:37.099> to<00:07:37.610> start

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:37.849
