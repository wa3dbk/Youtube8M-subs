00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.260
 Y 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.220
 before saying it before continuing to play 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.190
 it's like I had to go up 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.120
 win or lose the game your voice because 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.510
 there are also people who are telling me 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.510
 what 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.380
 lately going up many jars of 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.390
 adoc and other things that were not so much 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.220
 sniper so let's try on 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.930
 this weapon game 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.930
 I fucking let me kill myself 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.480
 hey I pay you 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.140
 with this gun we do not even talk 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.560
 buff to all this is much less question 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.650
 and comments and as it was my 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 sensitivity my sensitivity normally 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.760
 I used to take it to 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.250
 at 13 mirage on the martino team of 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.470
 cable the sensitivity the soybeans carry 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.890
 13 ok but lately I'm not 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:48.100
 going up a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.100
 took her to 14 voucher of 5 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.350
 I chose in market so the sensitivity 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.939
 he took her to 14 for what 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.330
 come ask me to go Fluff 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.330
 stuck 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.320
 and parley 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.319
 they are already starting to come out from 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.599
 here and they start to come out weapons 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.540
 semi-automatic look is that I knew it and 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.010
 I'm lucky there but it's not 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.950
 I know which ones are automatic and which are 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.870
 semiautomatic I have that little 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.400
 good problem played just game of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.440
 weapon then 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.450
 I still do not have the classes well 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.879
 rather 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.879
 the embassies and out there 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.510
 come now that does what it says 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.570
 re 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.570
 what is not fluffed 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.970
 the next 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.500
 well do not give a word of my 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.500
 accuracy with sensitivity 14 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.569
 and there it was I think it's 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.609
 semiautomatic 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.600
 you're exactly like the lack that 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.430
 highlight agreement 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.760
 once playing I thought it was a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.099
 submachine gun and the street 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.099
 and around here 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.910
 I hope that is 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.910
 we go 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.319
 berries of the bag suddenly bursts me 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.500
 the car had the uncle there to shoot 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.240
 and this junk looks 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.240
 reselling cars again 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.500
 It would be taking off 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.319
 what the fuck 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.750
 look at it 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.750

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.780
 he gave me a whore 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.140
 look at it 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.850
 they have to stay very few 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.930
 to see yes 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.930
 I killed something 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.470
 go with him 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.280

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.190

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.670
 saying so 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.300
 Yes I am saying yes so that 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.380
 snipers are or kill many 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.380
 alive and over 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.520
