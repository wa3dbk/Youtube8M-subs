break won't you buy the machine has

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.559 
break won't you buy the machine has
refused<00:02:43.840> each<00:02:44.409> time<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.219> we<00:02:45.370> must<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.969> to<00:02:46.120> put<00:02:46.329> a

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
refused each time so we must be to put a

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.979 
refused each time so we must be to put a
two<00:02:46.689> piece<00:02:47.170> or<00:02:47.379> Tim<00:02:47.769> be<00:02:47.799> together<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.980> make<00:02:51.159> one

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
two piece or Tim be together to make one

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.420 
two piece or Tim be together to make one
siblings<00:02:52.989> like<00:02:53.349> this<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.129> there<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.400> a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
siblings like this so there is a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.330 
siblings like this so there is a
stronger<00:02:54.969> than<00:02:55.299> the<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:55.810> piece<00:02:56.079> yeah<00:02:56.500> all<00:02:57.069> we

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
stronger than the one piece yeah all we

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.369 
stronger than the one piece yeah all we
can<00:02:57.549> use<00:02:57.730> as<00:02:57.939> they<00:02:58.150> always<00:02:58.480> finish<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.079> ears

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
can use as they always finish the ears

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
then later by the big with machines to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.009 
then later by the big with machines to
use<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.430> fabric<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.239> make<00:03:04.359> it<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.599> colors

and later on tonight yes this will be

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.120 
and later on tonight yes this will be
pollution<00:03:09.819> model<00:03:10.269> thing

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
pollution model thing

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.920 
pollution model thing
bench<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.430> gears<00:03:12.730> for<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.180> double<00:03:13.570> pockets

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
bench the gears for the double pockets

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.200 
bench the gears for the double pockets
to<00:03:14.410> be<00:03:14.530> communicated<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:15.460> scenes<00:03:15.700> are<00:03:15.970> out

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
to be communicated the scenes are out

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.960 
to be communicated the scenes are out
further<00:03:16.600> laters<00:03:17.200> stretch<00:03:18.190> mobile<00:03:18.670> in<00:03:18.820> this

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
further laters stretch mobile in this

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.730 
further laters stretch mobile in this
morning's

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.530 

so<00:03:25.740> we<00:03:25.860> for<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.190> small<00:03:26.459> its<00:03:26.700> arms<00:03:27.120> with<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
so we for the small its arms with the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.140 
so we for the small its arms with the
tiny<00:03:27.810> little<00:03:28.260> laters<00:03:28.860> then<00:03:29.160> we<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.790> put<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.060> in

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
tiny little laters then we can put it in

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.210 
tiny little laters then we can put it in
the<00:03:30.239> court<00:03:30.480> against<00:03:31.050> judge<00:03:31.590> move<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the court against judge move to the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.479 
the court against judge move to the
individual<00:03:32.790> all<00:03:33.030> we<00:03:33.360> can<00:03:33.540> use<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.870> same<00:03:34.080> ways

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
individual all we can use the same ways

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.390 
individual all we can use the same ways
so<00:03:35.489> big<00:03:35.760> we<00:03:36.300> needed<00:03:36.660> seven<00:03:37.260> times<00:03:37.620> relators

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
so big we needed seven times relators

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.090 
so big we needed seven times relators
with<00:03:39.000> joy<00:03:39.270> buzzer<00:03:39.599> mushy<00:03:39.930> with<00:03:40.080> chela<00:03:40.560> soup

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
with joy buzzer mushy with chela soup

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.220 
with joy buzzer mushy with chela soup
materials<00:03:41.580> like<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:42.000> room<00:03:42.180> will<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:42.870> how<00:03:43.170> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
materials like this room will be how to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.559 
materials like this room will be how to
use<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.650> one<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:43.920> make<00:03:44.220> false<00:03:44.489> blanket<00:03:45.090> so

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
use this one to make false blanket so

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.410 
use this one to make false blanket so
you<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:45.989> see<00:03:46.520> evenly<00:03:47.520> under<00:03:47.880> slow<00:03:48.209> days<00:03:48.390> and

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
you can see evenly under slow days and

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.440 
you can see evenly under slow days and
narrow<00:03:49.200> well<00:03:49.560> years<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:50.459> finish<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.330> blanket

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
narrow well years to finish the blanket

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.270 
narrow well years to finish the blanket
is<00:03:54.450> all<00:03:56.720> tsunami<00:03:57.720> poses<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:58.260> much<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.620> latency

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
is all tsunami poses so much is latency

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.590 
is all tsunami poses so much is latency
back<00:03:59.580> in<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.120> meadows<00:04:00.480> it's<00:04:01.290> just

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.220 

so<00:04:05.600> we<00:04:05.750> thus<00:04:06.230> images<00:04:06.770> last
