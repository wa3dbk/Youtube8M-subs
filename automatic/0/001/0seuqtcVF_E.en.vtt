hi this is yolanda from vanveenbulbs.com
and<00:00:03.659> in<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.170> section<00:00:04.560> we're<00:00:04.890> going<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.069> talk

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
and in this section we're going to talk

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.350 
and in this section we're going to talk
about<00:00:05.279> how<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.819> control<00:00:06.330> corn<00:00:06.960> ear<00:00:07.440> worms<00:00:08.360> now

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
about how to control corn ear worms now

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.150 
about how to control corn ear worms now
there's<00:00:09.630> all<00:00:09.870> types<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.290> bugs<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.740> affect

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
there's all types of bugs that affect

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.160 
there's all types of bugs that affect
our<00:00:11.280> crops<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.820> United<00:00:11.880> States<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.960> big

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
our crops in the United States and a big

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.560 
our crops in the United States and a big
problem<00:00:13.620> right<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:15.269> corn

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
problem right now for all the corn

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.140 
problem right now for all the corn
industries<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.980> corn<00:00:17.220> earworm<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
industries is the corn earworm and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.330 
industries is the corn earworm and
basically<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.170> really<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> caterpillar

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
basically it really is a caterpillar

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.439 
basically it really is a caterpillar
that<00:00:21.060> gets<00:00:21.330> into<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> corn<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.439> then<00:00:23.369> makes<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
that gets into the corn and then makes a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
that gets into the corn and then makes a
little<00:00:24.600> cocoon<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.380> then<00:00:25.980> turns<00:00:26.220> into<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.519> moth

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
little cocoon and then turns into a moth

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.000 
little cocoon and then turns into a moth
it<00:00:27.510> eats<00:00:27.750> into<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> corn<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.470> does<00:00:28.560> terrible

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it eats into the corn and does terrible

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.220 
it eats into the corn and does terrible
damage<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.150> ruin<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.539> whole<00:00:30.570> crop

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
damage and so it can ruin a whole crop

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979 
damage and so it can ruin a whole crop
but<00:00:32.040> there's<00:00:32.250> different<00:00:32.489> types<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.570> methods

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
but there's different types of methods

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
but there's different types of methods
that<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.350> use<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.980> rid<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.670> corn<00:00:35.940> fields

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that you can use to rid the corn fields

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.389 
that you can use to rid the corn fields
of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.630> corn<00:00:36.840> earworms<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> most

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
of the corn earworms so one of the most

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.180 
of the corn earworms so one of the most
organic<00:00:38.820> ways<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.570> rid<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> problem<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.739> as

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
organic ways to rid the problem is as

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
organic ways to rid the problem is as
soon<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> corn<00:00:41.969> head<00:00:42.210> starts<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> develop

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
soon as the corn head starts to develop

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.819 
soon as the corn head starts to develop
actually<00:00:43.980> put<00:00:44.489> corn<00:00:44.879> oil<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.600> mineral<00:00:46.320> oil<00:00:46.649> or

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
actually put corn oil or mineral oil or

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
actually put corn oil or mineral oil or
vegetable<00:00:47.070> oil<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.910> tips<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> corn

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
vegetable oil on the tips of the corn

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.529 
vegetable oil on the tips of the corn
because<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> where<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.539> caterpillars

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
because that is where the caterpillars

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
because that is where the caterpillars
entered<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> corn<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:53.160> don't<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
entered the corn and they don't like the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
entered the corn and they don't like the
oil<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.180> breaks<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.600> their<00:00:55.050> outer<00:00:55.469> coating

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
oil it breaks down their outer coating

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.189 
oil it breaks down their outer coating
so<00:00:56.250> it'll<00:00:56.730> stop<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.210> from<00:00:57.600> coming<00:00:57.989> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
so it'll stop them from coming in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.950 
so it'll stop them from coming in
another<00:00:59.100> trick<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> farmers<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.930> been

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
another trick that the farmers have been

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.709 
another trick that the farmers have been
using<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:02.129> soon<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.820> corn<00:01:03.120> develops

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
using is as soon as the corn develops

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.649 
using is as soon as the corn develops
they<00:01:04.350> spray<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.769> whole<00:01:05.250> crop<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
they spray the whole crop with a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.870 
they spray the whole crop with a
bacillus<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.680> tine<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.189> bacteria

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
bacillus it's a tine of a bacteria

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.080 
bacillus it's a tine of a bacteria
called<00:01:09.420> BT<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.950> safe<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.400> children<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
called BT and it's safe for children and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.710 
called BT and it's safe for children and
animals

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
animals

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
animals
the<00:01:13.320> only<00:01:13.470> setback<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.729> kills<00:01:14.970> all

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the only setback is that it kills all

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.969 
the only setback is that it kills all
caterpillars<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> beautiful

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
caterpillars so all the beautiful

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.980 
caterpillars so all the beautiful
butterflies<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.700> kills<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.270> well

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
butterflies it kills it as well

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.899 
butterflies it kills it as well
but<00:01:19.590> apparently<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.430> something<00:01:20.640> that's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
but apparently it's something that's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.789 
but apparently it's something that's
needed<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.509> used<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> problem

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
needed to be used if you have a problem

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.899 
needed to be used if you have a problem
with<00:01:22.920> corn<00:01:23.189> earworms

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
with corn earworms

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.140 
with corn earworms
and<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.689> works<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.619> bacterias<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.729> used<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and it works so bacterias can be used to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
and it works so bacterias can be used to
kill<00:01:27.330> corn<00:01:27.720> earworms<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.100> other

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
kill corn earworms but there's other

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.359 
kill corn earworms but there's other
methods<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.000> well<00:01:30.740> pyrethrins<00:01:31.740> which<00:01:32.130> are

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
methods as well pyrethrins which are

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.789 
methods as well pyrethrins which are
really<00:01:32.610> bad<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.000> other<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.170> types<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
really bad for other all types of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.580 
really bad for other all types of
insects<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.700> used<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.810> basically<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
insects are used and it's basically a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
insects are used and it's basically a
chemical<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.280> taken<00:01:38.579> from

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
chemical that's taken from

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.330 
chemical that's taken from
chrysanthemums<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.350> organic<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
chrysanthemums so it is organic but it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
chrysanthemums so it is organic but it
is<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> most<00:01:42.119> dangerous<00:01:42.869> chemicals

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
is one of the most dangerous chemicals

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
is one of the most dangerous chemicals
known<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.310> man<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.390> even<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.170> something's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
known to man so even if something's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.530 
known to man so even if something's
marked<00:01:46.920> organic<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.729> might<00:01:48.060> still<00:01:48.390> be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
marked organic it might still be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
marked organic it might still be
dangerous<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.079> other<00:01:49.259> animals<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
dangerous to other animals and to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630 
dangerous to other animals and to
different<00:01:51.659> pets<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.350> other<00:01:52.560> bugs<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.430> always

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
