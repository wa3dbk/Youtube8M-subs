different things but at the heart of it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.290 
different things but at the heart of it
is<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.109> PV<00:00:24.650> matte<00:00:25.160> box<00:00:25.460> from<00:00:25.789> Jenna's<00:00:26.090> tech

is the PV matte box from Jenna's tech

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.599 
is the PV matte box from Jenna's tech
and<00:00:26.599> this<00:00:27.410> one<00:00:27.590> is<00:00:27.679> a<00:00:27.710> little<00:00:28.039> different<00:00:28.400> from

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
and this one is a little different from

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.280 
and this one is a little different from
the<00:00:28.880> smaller<00:00:29.269> lighter<00:00:31.360> genis<00:00:32.360> tech<00:00:32.810> light

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
the smaller lighter genis tech light

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.810 
the smaller lighter genis tech light
matte<00:00:33.500> box<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:33.950> talked<00:00:34.160> about<00:00:34.250> earlier

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
matte box that we talked about earlier

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.380 
matte box that we talked about earlier
this<00:00:35.390> one<00:00:35.750> is<00:00:36.020> larger<00:00:36.470> wider<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.580> it<00:00:38.030> also

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
this one is larger wider and it also

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.930 
this one is larger wider and it also
accommodates<00:00:39.020> wider<00:00:39.620> angle<00:00:40.160> lenses<00:00:40.610> much

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
accommodates wider angle lenses much

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.560 
accommodates wider angle lenses much
better<00:00:41.270> it<00:00:41.750> also<00:00:41.810> has<00:00:42.110> two<00:00:42.650> stages<00:00:43.490> one<00:00:44.120> fixed

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
better it also has two stages one fixed

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.800 
better it also has two stages one fixed
one<00:00:44.960> rotating<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.130> instead<00:00:46.580> of<00:00:46.760> 4x4<00:00:47.450> filters

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
one rotating and instead of 4x4 filters

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.830 
one rotating and instead of 4x4 filters
this<00:00:48.020> accepts<00:00:48.470> four<00:00:48.770> by<00:00:49.040> five<00:00:49.910> point<00:00:50.270> six<00:00:50.510> five

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
this accepts four by five point six five

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.450 
this accepts four by five point six five
filters<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:51.800> you're<00:00:51.980> getting<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.310> different

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
filters so you're getting a different

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.090 
filters so you're getting a different
kind<00:00:52.700> of<00:00:52.730> filter<00:00:53.000> set<00:00:53.440> than<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.920> light

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
kind of filter set than on the light

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.800 
kind of filter set than on the light
matte<00:00:55.280> box<00:00:55.490> it's<00:00:56.000> also<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.330> little<00:00:56.570> different

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
matte box it's also a little different

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.990 
matte box it's also a little different
when<00:00:56.870> it<00:00:56.990> comes<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.380> actual<00:00:57.500> flags<00:00:58.070> on<00:00:58.430> the

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
when it comes to the actual flags on the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.640 
when it comes to the actual flags on the
light<00:00:59.330> matte<00:00:59.510> box<00:00:59.720> you'll<00:00:59.990> notice<00:01:00.290> there's<00:01:00.470> no

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
light matte box you'll notice there's no

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.450 
light matte box you'll notice there's no
way<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:00.950> attach<00:01:01.480> flags<00:01:02.480> on<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.170> side<00:01:03.650> you

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
way to attach flags on to the side you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.360 
way to attach flags on to the side you
only<00:01:04.610> have<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.330> top<00:01:05.630> eyebrow<00:01:06.350> flag<00:01:06.620> this<00:01:07.130> one

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.060 
comes with the top eyebrow front flag as
well<00:01:09.680> as<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.630> ability<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.660> add<00:01:11.930> side<00:01:12.710> flags

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
well as the ability to add side flags

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.890 
well as the ability to add side flags
the<00:01:13.700> other<00:01:13.820> unique<00:01:14.000> thing<00:01:14.180> about<00:01:14.360> this

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
the other unique thing about this

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.990 
the other unique thing about this
particular<00:01:15.080> kit<00:01:15.680> is<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.130> not<00:01:16.370> only<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:16.790> it<00:01:16.820> a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
particular kit is that not only is it a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.210 
particular kit is that not only is it a
clip-on<00:01:17.390> but<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.020> also<00:01:18.230> can<00:01:18.620> be<00:01:18.650> attached<00:01:19.040> with

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
clip-on but it also can be attached with

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.700 
clip-on but it also can be attached with
rods<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:20.090> not<00:01:20.600> just<00:01:20.900> attaching<00:01:21.380> with<00:01:21.470> rods

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
rods and not just attaching with rods

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.260 
rods and not just attaching with rods
but<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:21.980> comes<00:01:22.130> with<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.340> height-adjustable

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
height of the actual mat box this is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.830 
height of the actual mat box this is
great<00:01:28.280> because<00:01:28.700> not<00:01:29.060> only<00:01:29.120> can<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.480> do<00:01:29.600> clip

so right here I have a Canon 5d and

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.050 
so right here I have a Canon 5d and
you'll<00:01:39.710> see<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.980> matte<00:01:40.100> boxes<00:01:40.460> attached<00:01:40.790> with

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
you'll see the matte boxes attached with

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.950 
you'll see the matte boxes attached with
rods<00:01:41.330> but<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:42.170> also<00:01:42.430> attached<00:01:43.430> at<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.960> lens

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
rods but it's also attached at the lens

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.950 
rods but it's also attached at the lens
with<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.950> actual<00:01:46.700> clip<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:47.390> just<00:01:47.720> like

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
with the actual clip on so just like

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.830 
with the actual clip on so just like
matte<00:01:48.800> box<00:01:49.010> light<00:01:49.430> we<00:01:49.670> have<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.300> rod<00:01:50.510> here

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
matte box light we have the rod here

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.350 
matte box light we have the rod here
that<00:01:51.050> allows<00:01:51.260> us<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.530> attach<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.729> lens

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
that allows us to attach it to the lens

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.440 
that allows us to attach it to the lens
ring<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.100> solidify<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.159> down<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.150> actual

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
ring and solidify it down to the actual

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.930 
ring and solidify it down to the actual
rod<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.080> so<00:01:57.620> this<00:01:57.770> matte<00:01:57.950> box<00:01:58.190> really<00:01:58.460> is<00:01:58.700> for

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
rod so so this matte box really is for

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.580 
rod so so this matte box really is for
professionals<00:01:59.450> who<00:01:59.600> need<00:01:59.870> the<00:02:00.110> ability<00:02:00.560> to

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
professionals who need the ability to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.300 
professionals who need the ability to
add<00:02:01.220> all<00:02:01.670> flags<00:02:02.150> as<00:02:02.479> well<00:02:03.170> as<00:02:03.440> have<00:02:03.979> two

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
add all flags as well as have two

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.870 
add all flags as well as have two
filters<00:02:04.760> so<00:02:05.090> for<00:02:05.810> example<00:02:06.380> let's<00:02:06.530> say<00:02:06.880> you

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
filters so for example let's say you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.180 
filters so for example let's say you
need<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.149> have<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.630> polarizer<00:02:09.259> and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
need to have a polarizer and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.760 
need to have a polarizer and
a grad<00:02:11.150> filter<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.230> could<00:02:12.320> have<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> grad

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
a grad filter you could have the grad

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.680 
a grad filter you could have the grad
filter<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> fixed<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.940> polarizer<00:02:14.360> in

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
filter in the fixed and the polarizer in

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.380 
filter in the fixed and the polarizer in
the<00:02:14.900> rotating<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:16.670> could<00:02:16.820> have<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.360> know

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the rotating and you could have you know

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.930 
the rotating and you could have you know
the<00:02:18.080> ability<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.590> use<00:02:18.890> both<00:02:19.190> at<00:02:19.460> once

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
the ability to use both at once

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.300 
the ability to use both at once
the<00:02:20.540> other<00:02:20.690> nice<00:02:20.870> thing<00:02:21.140> about<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.770> mat<00:02:22.040> box

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
the other nice thing about this mat box

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.450 
the other nice thing about this mat box
is<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.330> can<00:02:23.750> actually<00:02:23.950> drop<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:24.980> filters

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
is that it can actually drop the filters

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.690 
is that it can actually drop the filters
down<00:02:25.820> as<00:02:26.240> opposed<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.900> only<00:02:27.320> up<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.070> for

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
down as opposed to only up so for

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.700 
down as opposed to only up so for
example<00:02:29.120> let's<00:02:29.330> say<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.630> have<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.960> grad<00:02:30.290> filter

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
example let's say you have a grad filter

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.650 
example let's say you have a grad filter
and<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.430> want<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:32.030> do<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.080> horizon<00:02:33.770> on<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.040> shot

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
and you want to do a horizon on a shot

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.990 
and you want to do a horizon on a shot
obviously<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.680> grad<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.280> going<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.550> start<00:02:37.910> at

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
obviously the grad is going to start at

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.090 
obviously the grad is going to start at
the<00:02:38.120> top<00:02:38.330> with<00:02:38.630> dark<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.170> slowly<00:02:39.440> fade<00:02:39.920> to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
the top with dark and slowly fade to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.070 
the top with dark and slowly fade to
transparent<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.330> problem<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.050> just

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
transparent the problem is if you just

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.440 
transparent the problem is if you just
throw<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.650> mat<00:02:42.830> box<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.820> might<00:02:44.210> not

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
throw it in the mat box you might not

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.270 
throw it in the mat box you might not
have<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.810> just<00:02:45.110> where<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.440> want<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.860> grad<00:02:46.070> to

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
have it just where you want the grad to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.910 
have it just where you want the grad to
end<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:47.180> on<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:47.750> particular<00:02:47.930> mat<00:02:48.350> box<00:02:48.590> you

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
end so on this particular mat box you

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.610 
end so on this particular mat box you
can<00:02:49.100> just<00:02:49.310> simply<00:02:49.630> adjust<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.810> height<00:02:51.350> wise

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
can just simply adjust it height wise

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.930 
can just simply adjust it height wise
going<00:02:52.340> up<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.700> little<00:02:52.910> bit<00:02:53.060> or<00:02:53.590> drop<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.770> down<00:02:55.070> so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
going up a little bit or drop it down so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.510 
going up a little bit or drop it down so
that<00:02:55.970> actually<00:02:56.540> goes<00:02:56.720> below<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.920> lens<00:02:58.160> and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
that actually goes below the lens and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.550 
that actually goes below the lens and
that<00:02:58.550> way<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.420> adjust<00:02:59.540> the<00:03:00.050> height<00:03:00.260> of

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
that way you can adjust the height of

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.100 
that way you can adjust the height of
your<00:03:00.740> grad<00:03:01.010> once<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.940> assemble<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.660> brackets

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
your grad once you assemble the brackets

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.440 
your grad once you assemble the brackets
that<00:03:03.170> screw<00:03:04.130> on<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.580> actual<00:03:04.880> mat<00:03:05.030> box<00:03:05.240> it

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
that screw on to the actual mat box it

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.930 
that screw on to the actual mat box it
makes<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.050> really<00:03:06.320> easy<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.860> remove<00:03:07.640> all<00:03:07.880> of

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
makes it really easy to remove all of

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.570 
makes it really easy to remove all of
the<00:03:08.180> flags<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.870> top<00:03:09.620> one<00:03:09.800> slides<00:03:10.100> off<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.460> the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
the flags the top one slides off to the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.140 
the flags the top one slides off to the
side<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.060> then<00:03:11.630> comes<00:03:12.140> off<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.710> then<00:03:13.460> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
side and then comes off and then the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.110 
side and then comes off and then the
side<00:03:14.420> ones<00:03:14.720> just<00:03:15.110> go<00:03:15.290> straight<00:03:15.680> out<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.340> then

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
side ones just go straight out and then

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.850 
side ones just go straight out and then
what<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.270> like<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.510> do<00:03:20.720> is<00:03:20.959> tighten<00:03:21.230> down<00:03:21.410> all<00:03:21.800> of

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
what I like to do is tighten down all of

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.949 
what I like to do is tighten down all of
the<00:03:22.220> screws<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.360> you<00:03:23.480> don't<00:03:23.630> have<00:03:23.810> any

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
the screws so that you don't have any

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.800 
the screws so that you don't have any
screws<00:03:24.640> finding<00:03:25.640> their<00:03:25.760> way<00:03:25.910> off<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.630> mat

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
screws finding their way off of the mat

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.220 
screws finding their way off of the mat
box<00:03:27.050> and<00:03:27.380> then<00:03:27.680> lost<00:03:28.630> in<00:03:29.630> once<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.959> tighten

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
box and then lost in once you tighten

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.310 
box and then lost in once you tighten
all<00:03:30.320> those<00:03:30.500> down<00:03:30.739> now<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:31.760> gives<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.180> a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
all those down now this gives you a

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.280 
all those down now this gives you a
awesome<00:03:33.320> nice<00:03:33.800> compact<00:03:34.580> setup<00:03:35.450> if<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.110> don't

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
awesome nice compact setup if you don't

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.560 
awesome nice compact setup if you don't
need<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.680> flags<00:03:36.920> at<00:03:37.100> all<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:38.180> now<00:03:38.300> I'm<00:03:38.390> going

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
need the flags at all so now I'm going

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.350 
need the flags at all so now I'm going
to<00:03:38.630> remove<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.170> from<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.470> rod<00:03:39.650> setup<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.360> really

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
to remove it from the rod setup I really

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.600 
to remove it from the rod setup I really
like<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.750> way<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.500> attached<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:43.190> the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
like the way that this attached to the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.229 
like the way that this attached to the
rods<00:03:43.820> it's<00:03:44.209> very<00:03:44.510> easy<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.080> remove<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.239> here

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
rods it's very easy to remove and here

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.500 
rods it's very easy to remove and here
it<00:03:47.420> is<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.170> there's<00:03:48.470> two<00:03:48.680> screws<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.340> attach

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
it is so there's two screws that attach

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.500 
it is so there's two screws that attach
the<00:03:50.510> adjustable<00:03:51.200> bracket<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.610> mat<00:03:53.239> box

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
the adjustable bracket to the mat box

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.160 
the adjustable bracket to the mat box
itself<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:55.280> have<00:03:55.310> one<00:03:55.700> screw<00:03:56.060> here<00:03:56.420> that

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
itself and you have one screw here that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.020 
itself and you have one screw here that
allows<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.769> adjust<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.160> height<00:03:58.280> of<00:03:58.670> the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
allows you to adjust the height of the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.449 
allows you to adjust the height of the
mat<00:03:59.209> box<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.810> what<00:04:00.709> I<00:04:00.739> like<00:04:00.920> about<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.250> is

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
mat box and what I like about this is

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.220 
mat box and what I like about this is
it's<00:04:01.640> not<00:04:01.700> just<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:02.180> knob<00:04:02.420> but<00:04:02.810> they<00:04:02.959> actually

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
it's not just a knob but they actually

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.650 
it's not just a knob but they actually
give<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.890> Phillips<00:04:04.550> screw<00:04:04.880> this<00:04:05.420> way<00:04:05.600> you

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
give you a Phillips screw this way you

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.140 
give you a Phillips screw this way you
can<00:04:05.870> really<00:04:06.410> get<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.590> sucker<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.160> tight<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
can really get that sucker on tight the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.759 
can really get that sucker on tight the
other<00:04:08.269> thing<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.480> like<00:04:08.600> about<00:04:08.660> this<00:04:09.019> mat<00:04:09.290> box<00:04:09.530> as

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
other thing I like about this mat box as

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.550 
other thing I like about this mat box as
opposed<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.910> light<00:04:11.360> matte<00:04:11.600> box<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:12.140> it's

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
opposed to the light matte box is it's

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.860 
opposed to the light matte box is it's
just<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:12.800> much<00:04:13.070> easier<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.880> access<00:04:14.120> everything

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
just so much easier to access everything

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.409 
just so much easier to access everything
and<00:04:15.080> obviously<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.860> big<00:04:16.100> part<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.760> the

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
and obviously a big part of that is the

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.940 
and obviously a big part of that is the
size<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:17.989> matte<00:04:18.169> box<00:04:18.320> because<00:04:18.650> it's<00:04:18.830> a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
size of the matte box because it's a

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.310 
size of the matte box because it's a
little<00:04:19.220> larger<00:04:19.640> it's<00:04:20.120> easier<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.630> access<00:04:20.900> so

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
little larger it's easier to access so

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.790 
little larger it's easier to access so
if<00:04:21.380> we<00:04:21.470> look<00:04:21.650> at<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.450> light<00:04:23.450> matte<00:04:23.630> box

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
if we look at the light matte box

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.470 
if we look at the light matte box
this<00:04:25.100> is<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.370> little<00:04:25.550> cramped<00:04:25.850> when<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.360> have

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
this is a little cramped when you have

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.730 
this is a little cramped when you have
the<00:04:26.570> lens<00:04:26.780> all<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.080> way<00:04:27.140> buttered<00:04:27.440> up<00:04:27.530> there

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
the lens all the way buttered up there

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.210 
the lens all the way buttered up there
and<00:04:27.950> then<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.520> little<00:04:28.730> screw<00:04:29.240> on<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.750> side

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
and then this little screw on the side

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.950 
and then this little screw on the side
to<00:04:31.220> adjust<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:32.920> rotation<00:04:33.920> is<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:35.390> little

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
to adjust the rotation is a little

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.050 
to adjust the rotation is a little
difficult<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.380> access<00:04:36.670> it's<00:04:37.670> better<00:04:37.850> than<00:04:38.000> a

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
difficult to access it's better than a

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.250 
difficult to access it's better than a
lot<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.270> matte<00:04:38.480> boxes<00:04:38.810> I've<00:04:38.960> worked<00:04:39.170> with

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
lot of matte boxes I've worked with

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.870 
lot of matte boxes I've worked with
before<00:04:39.440> but<00:04:39.980> still<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.280> little<00:04:40.460> difficult

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
before but still a little difficult

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.230 
before but still a little difficult
whereas<00:04:41.150> on<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.960> pv<00:04:42.470> matte<00:04:42.710> box<00:04:42.950> we<00:04:43.610> have<00:04:43.880> a

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
whereas on the pv matte box we have a

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.000 
whereas on the pv matte box we have a
very<00:04:45.080> easy<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.560> access<00:04:45.910> knob<00:04:46.910> for<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:48.110> tension

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
very easy to access knob for the tension

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.940 
very easy to access knob for the tension
and<00:04:49.490> tightening<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.840> clip<00:04:51.290> on<00:04:51.440> section

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
and tightening of the clip on section

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.370 
and tightening of the clip on section
you<00:04:52.460> also<00:04:52.670> have<00:04:53.000> two<00:04:53.270> screws<00:04:53.720> on<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.020> side

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
you also have two screws on the side

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.880 
you also have two screws on the side
these<00:04:55.130> are<00:04:55.190> for<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.210> filter<00:04:56.600> trays<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.170> it's

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
these are for the filter trays and it's

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.020 
these are for the filter trays and it's
very<00:04:58.400> easy<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:58.880> access<00:04:59.450> them<00:04:59.660> and<00:04:59.870> adjust<00:05:01.030> to

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
very easy to access them and adjust to

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.780 
very easy to access them and adjust to
get<00:05:02.240> your<00:05:02.690> filter<00:05:03.290> trays<00:05:03.530> out<00:05:03.860> or<00:05:04.430> if<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.640> need

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
get your filter trays out or if you need

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.930 
get your filter trays out or if you need
to<00:05:04.880> adjust<00:05:04.970> them<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:05.570> that<00:05:06.140> they<00:05:06.350> are<00:05:06.940> lowered

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
to adjust them so that they are lowered

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.610 
to adjust them so that they are lowered
and<00:05:08.180> then<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:08.870> can<00:05:08.990> tighten<00:05:09.140> them<00:05:09.290> back<00:05:09.320> up

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
and then you can tighten them back up

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.980 
and then you can tighten them back up
with<00:05:09.950> ease<00:05:10.280> so<00:05:10.610> it's<00:05:11.030> a<00:05:11.060> great<00:05:11.240> matte<00:05:11.420> box<00:05:11.660> but

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
with ease so it's a great matte box but

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.310 
with ease so it's a great matte box but
again<00:05:12.170> it's<00:05:12.350> not<00:05:12.440> huge<00:05:13.070> this<00:05:13.460> isn't<00:05:14.260> going<00:05:15.260> to

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
again it's not huge this isn't going to

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.920 
again it's not huge this isn't going to
be<00:05:15.400> ridiculous<00:05:16.400> for<00:05:16.880> setting<00:05:17.420> it<00:05:17.510> up<00:05:17.660> with

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
be ridiculous for setting it up with

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.960 
be ridiculous for setting it up with
various<00:05:18.290> rigs<00:05:18.830> or<00:05:19.100> if<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.400> need<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.640> change<00:05:19.820> a

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
various rigs or if you need to change a

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.380 
various rigs or if you need to change a
lens<00:05:20.180> or<00:05:20.300> something<00:05:20.800> they<00:05:21.800> make<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.310> just<00:05:23.240> the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
lens or something they make it just the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.460 
lens or something they make it just the
right<00:05:23.540> size<00:05:23.720> is<00:05:23.960> big<00:05:24.140> enough<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:24.380> accommodate

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
right size is big enough to accommodate

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.340 
right size is big enough to accommodate
those<00:05:24.950> wide-angle<00:05:25.460> lenses<00:05:25.790> and<00:05:26.260> gives<00:05:27.260> you<00:05:27.320> a

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
those wide-angle lenses and gives you a

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.630 
those wide-angle lenses and gives you a
little<00:05:27.470> more<00:05:27.590> flexibility<00:05:28.220> with<00:05:28.370> having<00:05:28.550> the

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
little more flexibility with having the

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.520 
little more flexibility with having the
two<00:05:28.790> trays<00:05:29.090> but<00:05:29.420> it's<00:05:29.570> not<00:05:29.720> a<00:05:29.900> monster<00:05:30.380> and

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
two trays but it's not a monster and
