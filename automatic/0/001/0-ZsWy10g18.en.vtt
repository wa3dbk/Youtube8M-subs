00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Isabelle with one of the men 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.109
 match of course with mathieu 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 bastareaud macho huge mathieu 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.440
 performance of your team you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.269
 reach for the first time half 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 finals of the european cup 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:19.590
 the historic agreement since since the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.900
 qualification that it is a city 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.369
 waited for that we offered them these voices 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.570
 there personally I have never lived 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 emotions like that it's these francs to 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.830
 the cena said it this club is no but I 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.950
 think today at the lardin turn 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.590
 we gave everything from john deere duo 24 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.329
 because we have an audience 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.280
 twenty fourth rather exceptional man 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.710
 so that's going on now 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.960
 direction tottenham 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.789
 here it is it's great we will savor 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 that I assure you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.340
 and then we will prepare this match which is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.500
 a bit like a quarter-final against 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.260
 clermont next week here is 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.149
 it's quite magical it's no this match 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.980
 it was complicated at first your team 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.399
 suffered a lot during the first 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.239
 period 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.950
 what did you do that you have 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.570
 reverse the trend simply we have 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.010
 made a lot of mistakes in this game at 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.860
 ground we knew that the refereed land 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.470
 was very pious about it we got it 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.870
 seen this morning the video here is done 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.070
 a lot these things needed after I 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.730
 think if we did not panic we 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.170
 knew question if we noticed from 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.120
 focus on the ground in the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.470
 gone to let them go 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.330
 that's been a tough battle it's 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.520
 still leicester is it's a 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.850
 big team 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.740
 here is a little message on time 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.510

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.840
 manu tuilagi 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.550
 there was revenge in the air and 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.190
 visibly you are going a little bit and has 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.400
 marked a little bit I can leave a 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.890
 little in my pride on all that 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.229
 I could then dad not say because I 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.310
 do not read but I do not have the press of everything 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.750
 what I heard on the achievements 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.120

 there is a lot of respect it's not I 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.580
 do not think the match 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.709
 summed up a single duel and there was a 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.140
 did we see it at the match we won 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.170
