00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
it's nice to know that previously in

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.380 
it's nice to know that previously in
Lancefield<00:01:38.369> were<00:01:38.460> known<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.759> compassion<00:01:39.180> farm

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
Lancefield were known as compassion farm

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.569 
Lancefield were known as compassion farm
and<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:40.290> were<00:01:40.470> strictly<00:01:40.860> vegetables<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and we were strictly vegetables with a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
and we were strictly vegetables with a
few<00:01:41.759> eggs<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.509> definitely<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.899> be

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
few eggs so here we're definitely to be

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.319 
few eggs so here we're definitely to be
more<00:01:43.170> diverse<00:01:43.350> we've<00:01:43.860> been<00:01:44.070> farming<00:01:44.369> now<00:01:44.759> here

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
more diverse we've been farming now here

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.770 
more diverse we've been farming now here
on<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> property<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.470> four<00:01:46.890> years

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
on this property for about four years

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.810 
on this property for about four years
around<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.500> guess<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> motivations<00:01:50.549> for

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
around here I guess the motivations for

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.170 
around here I guess the motivations for
farming<00:01:51.509> would<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.790> longer<00:01:53.790> growing

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
farming would be just longer growing

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.709 
farming would be just longer growing
season<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.670> kind<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.000> quality<00:01:57.540> like

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
season and just the kind of quality like

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539 
season and just the kind of quality like
when<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.469> know<00:01:58.560> raising<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> kids<00:01:59.399> in

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
when I was you know raising the kids in

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.740 
when I was you know raising the kids in
gardening<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:02.060> just<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> quality<00:02:03.659> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
gardening I just just the quality of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.679 
gardening I just just the quality of
food<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.049> could<00:02:04.259> produce<00:02:04.409> and

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
food you could produce and

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.940 
food you could produce and
you<00:02:05.749> know<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.990> flavored<00:02:06.530> nutritional

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
you know the flavored nutritional

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.660 
you know the flavored nutritional
quality<00:02:07.340> was<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:07.490> high<00:02:07.819> I<00:02:08.060> thought<00:02:08.269> why

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
quality was so high I thought why

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.490 
quality was so high I thought why
doesn't<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.030> know<00:02:11.150> like<00:02:11.450> right<00:02:11.810> we

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
doesn't that you know like right we

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.540

growing<00:04:28.750> lettuce<00:04:29.750> greens<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.620> think<00:04:31.010> is

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
growing lettuce greens I think is

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.390 
growing lettuce greens I think is
something<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:31.790> we<00:04:31.910> were<00:04:32.030> able<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:33.160> use<00:04:34.160> as<00:04:34.370> a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
something that we were able to use as a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.690 
something that we were able to use as a
main<00:04:34.669> crop<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.630> satisfy<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:37.070> customers<00:04:37.550> and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
main crop to satisfy the customers and

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.360 
main crop to satisfy the customers and
it<00:04:37.760> was<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.880> way<00:04:38.060> for<00:04:38.300> us<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.450> be<00:04:38.720> able<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:39.370> break

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
it was a way for us to be able to break

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.650 
it was a way for us to be able to break
into<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:42.290> customer<00:04:43.070> base<00:04:43.540> because<00:04:44.540> there

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
into the customer base because there

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.390 
into the customer base because there
wasn't<00:04:44.960> enough<00:04:45.230> of<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.440> available<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.280> that

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
wasn't enough of that available so that

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.790 
wasn't enough of that available so that
was<00:04:46.520> something<00:04:46.760> that<00:04:46.790> we<00:04:47.290> were<00:04:48.290> able<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.560> work
