line and he wasn't cutting right in
front<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.220> me<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:57.850> I<00:04:57.880> couldn't<00:04:58.120> really<00:04:58.270> say

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
front of me so I couldn't really say

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.550 
front of me so I couldn't really say
anything<00:04:58.510> about<00:04:58.810> it<00:04:59.050> because<00:04:59.200> it<00:04:59.320> was<00:04:59.440> like

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
anything about it because it was like

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.230 
anything about it because it was like
three<00:04:59.770> or<00:04:59.890> four<00:04:59.920> people<00:05:00.280> ahead<00:05:00.370> but<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.120> just

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
three or four people ahead but it just

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.630 
three or four people ahead but it just
made<00:05:01.360> me<00:05:01.480> so<00:05:01.900> furious<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:02.950> this<00:05:03.220> person<00:05:03.550> felt

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
made me so furious that this person felt

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.250 
made me so furious that this person felt
you<00:05:04.030> know<00:05:04.150> what<00:05:04.330> I'm<00:05:04.480> too<00:05:04.720> good<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:05.020> have<00:05:05.140> to

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
you know what I'm too good to have to

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.810 
you know what I'm too good to have to
wait<00:05:05.380> on<00:05:05.530> line<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.980> that<00:05:06.100> felt<00:05:06.280> they<00:05:06.400> were<00:05:06.460> you

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
wait on line and that felt they were you

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.220 
wait on line and that felt they were you
know<00:05:06.850> better<00:05:07.180> than<00:05:07.330> me<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:07.810> everyone<00:05:08.170> else

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
know better than me and everyone else

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.830 
know better than me and everyone else
that<00:05:08.530> they<00:05:08.620> cut<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:10.180> think<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.570> this<00:05:10.660> is

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
that they cut so I think that this is

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.990 
that they cut so I think that this is
like<00:05:10.990> an<00:05:11.110> undercurrent<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:12.850> know<00:05:12.970> I

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
like an undercurrent and you know I

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.970 
like an undercurrent and you know I
wonder<00:05:13.630> how<00:05:13.750> many<00:05:13.810> warning<00:05:14.500> signs<00:05:14.530> they're

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
wonder how many warning signs they're

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.500 
wonder how many warning signs they're
gonna<00:05:15.100> have<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.310> be<00:05:15.460> for<00:05:15.700> society<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.240> take

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
gonna have to be for society to take

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
gonna have to be for society to take
this<00:05:16.660> stuff<00:05:16.840> seriously

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
this stuff seriously

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.110 
this stuff seriously
because<00:05:18.010> it's<00:05:18.190> becoming<00:05:18.490> worse<00:05:18.760> and<00:05:18.940> worse

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120
