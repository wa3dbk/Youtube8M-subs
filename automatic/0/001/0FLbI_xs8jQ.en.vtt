00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.510 
hoping that it gives people a chance to
sort<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:04.140> things<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
sort of see things I think one of the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.710 
sort of see things I think one of the
interesting<00:02:05.580> things<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.390> this

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
interesting things is that because this

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.809 
interesting things is that because this
is<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> first<00:02:07.020> ever<00:02:07.560> Brooklyn<00:02:08.160> Art<00:02:08.310> Fair<00:02:08.550> and

we're<00:02:12.450> setting<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.650> precedent<00:02:14.100> then<00:02:14.670> we'll<00:02:15.000> be

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
we're setting a precedent then we'll be

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.780 
we're setting a precedent then we'll be
hopefully<00:02:15.540> we'll<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.870> able<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.050> come<00:02:16.230> back<00:02:16.380> in
