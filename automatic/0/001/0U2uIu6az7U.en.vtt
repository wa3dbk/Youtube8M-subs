00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.809
 it goes here comes to another 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.740
 video in my video today I will 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.180
 the sniper rifles 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.130
 or imagine his work 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.090
 who will be big in call of duty 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.410
 We always want to do this job completely 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.450
 visible subscribers a thanking 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.619
 has madness weapon and yes without 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.849
 I would not have so far 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.079
 can make it as detailed as it is now 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.399
 has made because it's really hard it 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.239
 about such weapons on the internet 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.849
 to find out 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.950
 so thanks again to you so the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.410
 first weapon is the l 115 which comes from 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.059
 the youth was developed since 1996 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.980
 in the description she is a picture 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.989
 action stars as one with chambers 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.219
 closure and that it is deadly so 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.410
 a team is making over in the area 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.089
 the thigh from the stock offer 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.190
 ballistic processes up to the 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.480
 So first four kills helps if you can 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.149
 he did not help four kings 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.620
 More is a pretty funny idea that 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.850
 the weapon almost to the first four 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.629
 kilt is stronger and then something 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 becomes weaker 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.370
 I think that's really realistic 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.539
 yes it is not real if you have many 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.760
 people then formed that weapon 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.170
 is worse but yes is on everyone 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.610
 a funny idea and should the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.900
 then do something more balanced 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.510
 not quite as strong as it is now 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.680
 not with this limit who fell 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.350
 Incidentally, should briefly comment 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.490
 she is akin to the l 118 a the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.920
 you can already see the look and 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.030
 actually synonymous s.name so that will 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.219
 probably quite similar 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.020
 Feel like the parent operates 118 meters 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.460
 otherwise I found out 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.250
 that you need a magazine of five 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.840
 So shot has like the l 118 but 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.789
 also and like most baltic sea 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.960
 Sniper I have to say that I believe 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.640
 that's pretty strong because of her 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.689
 has a pretty high damage and that 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.310
 People also said that with the 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.780
 already played because at the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.189
 multiplayer reviews because you could with 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.539
 the games so there were little 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.359
 weapons that you could play but with 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.439
 this weapon could be played and so 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.310
 which has a pretty high damage 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.950
 if you think about it 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.020
 Thighs above half so higher than that 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.789
 dsr 50 and the dsf 15 degrees already 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.189
 always as a weapon with m high damage 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.170
 and yes, even faster 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.609
 visier he is 50 at least that's what he sees 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.740
 out and there say people confirmed that 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.299
 So you played with her 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.429
 about as fast in sight as the ms 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.439
 he earlier in mw3 times without him 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.570
 fast access so also relatively fast 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.710
 actually have as next weapon 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.530
 we have a pretty promising one 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.550
 weapons though the usa and the special 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.040
 it is that they of remington 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.240
 was produced and mentioned in the tree 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.319
 I know that extra now so you know 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.970
 I'm pretty much reminiscing 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.020
 made many weapons and then in the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.090
 acr 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.790
 the shotgun in mw3 the pump actions 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.680
 shotgun there and the special is that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.520
 she also made the amazon mp3 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.840
 so have the most popular mp3 so what 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.490
 I want to remark briefly here on 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.590
 The picture looks like the whole 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.970
 rough heat but I do not know if that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.190
 just looks bad is yes 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.630
 a bad picture quality under that 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.130
 somehow mistake is or so on everyone 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.300
 case in real it once big it is 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.190
 now not so in the ball is so 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.320
 time and you like where you do not 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.850
 So video can be packed on top of it 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.560
 has in real already quite normal sniper 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.180
 visier so in the description stands that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.680
 she is a boutique that she beat 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.390
 deadly from the hip respectively 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.190
 detail me up is the waistline 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.150
 virtually and that we are a very fast 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.530
 handling has 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.940
 besides, she also has 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.160
 Built-in ball is in the processor 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.780
 up to the first four kills works that way 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.580
 that's also pretty similar again 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.530
 he will if we think back 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.140
 the msr then harm a little less than 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.960
 the l 118 but for what i have something 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.610
 faster in sight and yes she is yes 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.020
 here only lethal from the goodness line 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.550
 and the other weapon was from 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.680
 thighs off so that's class 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.390
 a little lower but now hurt 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.740
 not a big difference so now 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.860
 not so much difference visible 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.790
 is the dsr 50 in backup 2 but already on 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.010
 little difference 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.770
 and played out yes here faster action 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.640
 So faster movement and and in the year 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.630
 That's why I think that's something 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.590
 faster, however, is the target 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.330
 not that, of course not 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.040
 say one hundred percent because still 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.959
 nobody so nobody public with 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.160
 this weapon could play otherwise 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.370
 The next weapon will be used for a long time 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.959
 known the Gepard gm 61 the dates 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.820
 from Hungary and then became 1990 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.260
 developed and with this weapon though 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.360
 No description but I have at 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.530
 all weapons something researched and there 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.120
 I found out that they are 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.380
 so it is not automatically a chamber 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.790
 So lock has that quasi located 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.340
 Shoot again directly in a row 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.440
 Can and a magazine size of five 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.090
 shot has dared that much 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.740
 sound at a 7 automatic weapon 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.480
 five shot but if we again 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.010
 back in mw3 think so the comparison 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.540
 come with mp3 quite often because that 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.830
 game is similar to mp3 because 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.560
 is also from the same developers 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.480
 and so you think back to the 150th 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.459
 euro that was also semi automatic 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.200
 had five shots and for those 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.970
 five shots pretty high damage and 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200
 But you just could not do it like that 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.090
 shoot really fast so I think 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.419
 that they are similar to the as50 in mp3 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.980
 becomes 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.780
 and that was actually with 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.220
 a lot of people are quite popular as such 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.360
 next week with interesting then 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.860
 even with distance the hardest to 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.599
 identifying weapon 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.159
 namely that the vk is so at least 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.319
 that's why she's in call of duty why me 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.240
 especially mention that again 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.680
 we come to the same unfortunately so can 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.090
 you could see something in the picture because 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.500
 you only briefly saw it in the cellar 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.639
 It is very small and it is not 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.400
 description available 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.810
 but what is striking is that 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.330
 she has a pretty long run and 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.740
 a pretty dark run so the sid 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.139
 that does not really fit that 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.270
 Sniper resourceful and yes she a bit 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.099
 screwed out and if you're at 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.289
 this weapon looks good then 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.300
 the vsk would look very similar to the 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.129
 was made in Russia and me 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.479
 ask you times by the vsk in real as well 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.379
 picture in the description and you will 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.180
 see that they are pretty similar 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.370
 So look the complete rear part 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.960
 is actually almost identical and the 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.490
 almost a weapon with one 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.629
 built-in silencer what yes too 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.610
 her would fit because she sees now 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.900
 after that, and we have the yes 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.099
 Information has come that one 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.689
 neighbors call of duty goes one 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.529
 built-in headlights will have and 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.719
 there she is, that's a lot 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.949
 promising candidate but that 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:28.870
 only problem is just that the woman 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.180
 Is it cold a protection sniper is 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.590
 and you have the vhs course and trailer 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.599
 seen and she had a magazine with 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.009
 14 shot still and the guy already had 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.020
 So shot more than 14 shot 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.250
 it will have been and you could 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.409
 also do not really realize that his 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.629
 bolt access is close and therefore give 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.129
 we also still the vsk 94 in 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:47.770
 ask which also comes from Russia 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.300
 Was manufactured in 1994 and this weapon 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.639
 also has a built-in silencer 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.800
 so that would fit and the vsk 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.199
 490 hero semih automatically so that 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.430
 would work better and otherwise can 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.080
 I still tell her that she is extreme 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.909
 so soft is these offers switch 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.449
 really pretty well forfeits you hear 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.490
 hardly 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.229
 And she has a magazine size of 20 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.089
 shot which would fit if you were there 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.919
 seen has 14 bullet in it are 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:11.050
 So that would fit too 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.330
 and that's why I think that the vks me 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.430
 yes the vks call the vks or 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.819
 so and that's why i think that the vks 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.789
 indigos will look like the vsk though 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.839
 behave like the vsk 94 so 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.620
 I hope you can help me a bit 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.689
 consequences 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.710
 why I think first because 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.479
 the big magazine 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.370
 secondly, because the lock chambers 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.379
 absolutely saw each other and im 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.389
 third though an automatic whole 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.770
 picture action star in cottbus not 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.240
 really good 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.529
 that is of course total now 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.089
 speculation but I could do a lot 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:41.469
 better a semi automatic sniper 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.080
 imagine the built-in switches 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.220
 as a bowtech that's just such a 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.380
 feeling like it was in call of duty so far 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.340
 and how it would fit in there and that 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.780
 fourth point is actually the 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.800
 most convincing, and I think so 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.810
 that the developers of call of duty 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.140
 never bring in a bolt action star 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.180
 would 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.430
 the 15 school town and a built-in 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.960
 silencer so far I think so 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.820
 everywhere is the checklist with the 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.140
 sizes magazine orient magazine from 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.390
 So seven shots really are 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.950
 worlds between and in the year therefore 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.420
 I think that it will be like that sees 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.510
 like the driver but it is 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.830
 behave like the vsk 94 treetop 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.210
 for the way it has done now and why 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.820
 only look easy that my 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.320
 vsk 94 perhaps what any 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.410
 communication error the quasi the 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.060
 graphic artists who made vsk and and 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.990
 programmers vsk 490 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.610
 have programmed 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.780
 that can be because these weapons are not 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.460
 You can really know them 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.040
 quickly messed up though I did 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.510
 that's pretty embarrassing 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.680
 Well, we'll get her and write to me 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.300
 quiet my comments what you believe 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.680
 that the find is sniper and you can 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.940
 we also write quiet which name yes 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.890
 are promising found 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.600
 and yes, if you like me 

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.530
 always very hurry and that's it 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.530
 for today two three people
