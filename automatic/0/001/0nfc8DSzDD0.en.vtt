how hard-working they are and knowing
coach<00:00:42.660> Harbaugh<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.040> stuff

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
coach Harbaugh I think all of that stuff

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.150 
coach Harbaugh I think all of that stuff
played<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> part<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:46.230> I'm<00:00:46.289> I've<00:00:46.950> been

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
played a part and you know I'm I've been

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.760 
played a part and you know I'm I've been
most<00:00:47.370> excited<00:00:47.520> about<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.649> how<00:00:49.649> does<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
most excited about that how does that

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.950 
most excited about that how does that
contrast<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> last<00:00:51.180> two<00:00:51.390> years<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
contrast in the last two years with the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
contrast in the last two years with the
team<00:00:53.690> um<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.350> think<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.399> contrast<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.180> didn't

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
team um I think the contrast is I didn't

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.380 
team um I think the contrast is I didn't
really<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:58.129> anyone<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.250> there<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
really know anyone out there and and it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
really know anyone out there and and it
was<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> new<00:01:01.079> area<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.530> me<00:01:01.920> those<00:01:02.579> are<00:01:02.609> probably

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
was a new area for me those are probably

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
was a new area for me those are probably
the<00:01:03.090> biggest<00:01:03.329> differences<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.350> out

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the biggest differences and then out

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.910 
the biggest differences and then out
here<00:01:04.790> there<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.240> familiarity<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
here there is that familiarity with the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.700 
here there is that familiarity with the
area<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:09.030> players<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.229> coaches

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
area and with players and with coaches

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
area and with players and with coaches
so<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.640> been<00:01:11.820> probably<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> biggest

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so it's been probably the biggest

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.499 
so it's been probably the biggest
difference<00:01:13.760> defensive<00:01:14.760> team<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> play<00:01:15.479> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
difference defensive team kind of play a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.820 
difference defensive team kind of play a
part<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> mean<00:01:16.290> while<00:01:16.439> there's<00:01:16.650> been<00:01:16.799> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
part in it I mean while there's been a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.050 
part in it I mean while there's been a
lot<00:01:17.009> written<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.670> fact<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.270> know

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.800 

I<00:01:24.409> think<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:26.360> 49ers<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> good

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
I think that I think 49ers have a good

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.469 
I think that I think 49ers have a good
mix<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.470> what<00:01:28.740> Vic<00:01:29.610> Fangio<00:01:29.820> does<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
mix you know what Vic Fangio does I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.590 
mix you know what Vic Fangio does I
think<00:01:30.689> has<00:01:30.810> been<00:01:30.960> awesome<00:01:32.119> over<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> last<00:01:33.390> two

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
think has been awesome over the last two

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.319 
think has been awesome over the last two
years<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.350> I've<00:01:34.500> seen<00:01:35.329> obviously

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
years as much as I've seen obviously

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
years as much as I've seen obviously
I'll<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.659> more<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.829> watching<00:01:38.040> filming

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
I'll see more as I'm watching filming

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.530 
I'll see more as I'm watching filming
and<00:01:38.820> learning<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> plays<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:42.420> know

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
and learning the plays but you know

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120 
and learning the plays but you know
having<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.320> chance<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.950> again

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
having a chance to do it again

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
having a chance to do it again
definitely<00:01:45.380> had<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> make<00:01:46.649> sure<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> scheme

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
definitely had to make sure the scheme

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.340 
definitely had to make sure the scheme
was<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.970> was<00:01:48.180> something<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.229> know<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350

Francisco<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> scheme<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.710> thought

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
