have seen the images online this is

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.640 
have seen the images online this is
basically<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.000> screenshot<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.439> is

moment the main point i think is the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.539 
moment the main point i think is the
fact<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.119> does<00:01:36.360> say<00:01:37.340> computer<00:01:38.340> game

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
