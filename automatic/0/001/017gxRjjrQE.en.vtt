range anyway one thing I did notice

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.569 
range anyway one thing I did notice
about<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:37.040> you're<00:00:38.040> not<00:00:38.070> typically

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
about this one that you're not typically

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.250 
about this one that you're not typically
going<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.629> bottom<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.110> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
going to see is that the bottom of this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
going to see is that the bottom of this
is<00:00:40.469> shaped<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> cone<00:00:41.309> whereas<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> last

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
is shaped like a cone whereas the last

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
is shaped like a cone whereas the last
my<00:00:42.870> head<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.290> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.010> flat<00:00:44.340> piece<00:00:44.579> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
my head was just kind of a flat piece of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.369 
my head was just kind of a flat piece of
metal<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.420> holes<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> bottom<00:00:46.230> of

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
metal with just holes in the bottom of

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.990 
metal with just holes in the bottom of
it<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.010> that's<00:00:47.219> an<00:00:47.340> improvement

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
it so that's an improvement

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.470 
it so that's an improvement
and<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.480> didn't<00:00:48.719> even<00:00:48.840> notice<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.620> had<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
and I didn't even notice that it had the

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.209 
and I didn't even notice that it had the
air<00:00:51.480> vents<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> side<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.829> which<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
air vents on the side here which is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.790 
air vents on the side here which is
another<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:55.110> cheaper<00:00:55.469> model

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
another thing that the cheaper model

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.049

going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.869> plastic<00:01:06.950> handle

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
going to get was this plastic handle

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.899 
going to get was this plastic handle
leather<00:01:08.159> handle<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.930> wood<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:11.310> year<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> we

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
leather handle was wood this year and we

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.580 
leather handle was wood this year and we
call<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> hippie<00:01:12.780> handle<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.409> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
call this a hippie handle because I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
call this a hippie handle because I
don't<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.310> any<00:01:14.520> purpose<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.390> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
don't really see any purpose for this I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.170 
don't really see any purpose for this I
mean<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:17.040> wasted<00:01:17.490> money<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.939> guess

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
mean this was wasted money and I guess

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.210 
mean this was wasted money and I guess
they<00:01:18.689> could<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.320> probably<00:01:19.500> sold<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> me

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
they could have probably sold this to me

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.850 
they could have probably sold this to me
for<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.700> dollar<00:01:21.240> 50<00:01:21.659> less<00:01:21.840> without<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.350> handle

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
for a dollar 50 less without this handle

if you want to kind of take a look in
there<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.959> think<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.709> little<00:03:40.800> bit<00:03:40.950> earlier<00:03:41.280> I

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
there I think a little bit earlier I

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.790 
there I think a little bit earlier I
kind<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.030> got<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> little<00:03:42.840> Roger<00:03:43.140> Clemens<00:03:43.530> on

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
kind of got a little Roger Clemens on

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.680 
kind of got a little Roger Clemens on
you<00:03:43.950> guys<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.459> think<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.790> misspoke<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.269> little<00:03:45.569> bit

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
you guys I think I misspoke a little bit

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.539 
you guys I think I misspoke a little bit
earlier<00:03:46.049> what<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> was<00:03:46.830> seeing<00:03:47.010> was<00:03:47.220> when<00:03:47.400> my

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
earlier what I was seeing was when my

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.850 
earlier what I was seeing was when my
other<00:03:47.670> chimney<00:03:48.660> went<00:03:48.959> out<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.110> was<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.650> using

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
other chimney went out I was just using

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.699 
other chimney went out I was just using
lighter<00:03:50.819> fluid<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.870> figured<00:03:52.230> lighter<00:03:52.440> flow

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
lighter fluid and figured lighter flow

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.559 
lighter fluid and figured lighter flow
is<00:03:52.769> good<00:03:52.950> enough<00:03:53.040> for<00:03:53.100> Myron<00:03:53.519> Mixon<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.360> good

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
is good enough for Myron Mixon it's good

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.600 
is good enough for Myron Mixon it's good
enough<00:03:54.750> for<00:03:54.959> me<00:03:55.080> too<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.040> was<00:03:56.250> using<00:03:56.580> that

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
enough for me too so I was using that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.039 
enough for me too so I was using that
but<00:03:56.910> then<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.090> started<00:03:57.390> realizing<00:03:57.569> how<00:03:57.900> much

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
but then I started realizing how much

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.720 
but then I started realizing how much
money<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.440> was<00:03:58.500> spending<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:58.950> lighter<00:03:59.190> fluid<00:03:59.489> and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
money I was spending a lighter fluid and

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.430 
money I was spending a lighter fluid and
I<00:04:00.239> probably<00:04:00.569> wasting<00:04:00.870> more<00:04:00.959> money<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.319> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
I probably wasting more money on the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.979 
I probably wasting more money on the
lighter<00:04:01.620> fluid<00:04:01.890> than<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:03.030> anyway<00:04:03.239> this

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
lighter fluid than this so anyway this

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.350 
lighter fluid than this so anyway this
should<00:04:04.260> be<00:04:04.350> good<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.620> go

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
should be good to go

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.580 
should be good to go
the<00:04:06.360> handle<00:04:06.750> actually<00:04:07.080> is<00:04:07.140> pretty<00:04:07.260> cool<00:04:07.530> I

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
the handle actually is pretty cool I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.740 
the handle actually is pretty cool I
brought<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.010> glove<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.670> be<00:04:08.819> safe<00:04:09.390> but<00:04:09.660> I'm

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
brought a glove just to be safe but I'm

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.810 
brought a glove just to be safe but I'm
not<00:04:09.870> going<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.080> need<00:04:10.200> that<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.190> throw<00:04:11.640> that

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
not going to need that so I throw that

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.680 
not going to need that so I throw that
over<00:04:11.970> there<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.570> then<00:04:14.180> this<00:04:15.180> little<00:04:15.329> hippie

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
over there and then this little hippie

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.690 
over there and then this little hippie
handle<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.229> really<00:04:16.769> don't<00:04:16.950> see<00:04:17.039> a<00:04:17.160> need<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.400> it

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
handle I really don't see a need for it

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.430 
handle I really don't see a need for it
I<00:04:17.760> guess<00:04:18.030> if<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.359> wanted<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.049> could<00:04:19.200> do<00:04:19.350> it

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
I guess if you wanted to you could do it

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.610 
I guess if you wanted to you could do it
like<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.820> but<00:04:20.820> we're<00:04:21.450> not<00:04:21.600> gonna<00:04:21.810> do<00:04:22.410> that

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
like this but we're not gonna do that

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.910 
like this but we're not gonna do that
we're<00:04:22.830> just<00:04:22.860> gonna<00:04:23.070> bring<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.580> over<00:04:23.789> here

that's<00:04:39.460> how<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.640> use<00:04:39.910> it<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.920> as<00:04:41.920> far<00:04:42.220> as<00:04:42.280> my

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
that's how you use it and as far as my

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.020 
that's how you use it and as far as my
review<00:04:44.560> on<00:04:44.680> this<00:04:44.830> goes<00:04:45.070> I<00:04:45.400> definitely<00:04:45.910> think

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
review on this goes I definitely think

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.880 
review on this goes I definitely think
it's<00:04:46.240> worth<00:04:46.330> extra<00:04:46.870> four<00:04:47.170> dollars<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.680> could

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
it's worth extra four dollars you could

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.280 
it's worth extra four dollars you could
spend<00:04:48.280> or<00:04:48.580> five<00:04:49.000> dollars<00:04:49.360> scuse<00:04:49.570> me<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:50.050> could

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
spend or five dollars scuse me you could

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.900 
spend or five dollars scuse me you could
spend<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.620> little<00:04:50.740> less<00:04:50.890> getting<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.550> smaller

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
spend a little less getting the smaller

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.480 
spend a little less getting the smaller
Weber<00:04:52.240> which<00:04:52.540> might<00:04:52.810> be<00:04:52.990> fine<00:04:53.830> if<00:04:54.070> you're<00:04:54.250> just

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
Weber which might be fine if you're just

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.550 
Weber which might be fine if you're just
using<00:04:54.910> like<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.450> kettle<00:04:55.720> grill<00:04:55.900> or<00:04:56.260> something

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
using like a kettle grill or something

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.800 
using like a kettle grill or something
like<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:56.740> for<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.850> smoker<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.330> think<00:04:58.600> you<00:04:58.690> need

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
like that for a smoker I think you need

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.630 
like that for a smoker I think you need
something<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.140> little<00:04:59.230> bit<00:04:59.440> bigger<00:04:59.650> in<00:04:59.950> terms

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
something a little bit bigger in terms

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.460 
something a little bit bigger in terms
of<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:00.970> cheaper<00:05:01.330> models<00:05:01.720> with<00:05:01.870> just<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.200> flat

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
of the cheaper models with just the flat

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.070 
of the cheaper models with just the flat
metal<00:05:02.920> bottom<00:05:03.520> with<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.420> holes<00:05:04.630> in<00:05:04.900> it

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
metal bottom with the holes in it

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.380 
metal bottom with the holes in it
without<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.400> holes<00:05:06.580> on<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:06.820> side<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.300> think

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
without the holes on the side I think

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.960 
without the holes on the side I think
it's<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:08.530> takes<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:09.100> much<00:05:09.220> longer<00:05:09.610> for<00:05:09.730> that<00:05:09.850> to

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
it's it takes so much longer for that to

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.520 
it's it takes so much longer for that to
heat<00:05:10.120> up<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.510> again<00:05:10.960> they're<00:05:11.170> a<00:05:11.200> little<00:05:11.350> bit

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
heat up and again they're a little bit

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.730 
heat up and again they're a little bit
smaller<00:05:11.710> so<00:05:12.300> my<00:05:13.300> rating<00:05:13.540> on<00:05:13.720> this<00:05:13.960> 5<00:05:14.320> out<00:05:14.500> of<00:05:14.530> 5

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
smaller so my rating on this 5 out of 5

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.160 
smaller so my rating on this 5 out of 5
stars<00:05:15.130> and<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.400> give<00:05:15.610> this<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:16.030> 5<00:05:16.660> stars<00:05:18.150> anyway

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
stars and I give this the 5 stars anyway

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.800 
stars and I give this the 5 stars anyway
