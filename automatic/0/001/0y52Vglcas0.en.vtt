before<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:26.880> another<00:00:27.240> quote<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.050> his<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
before with another quote of his in the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.220 
before with another quote of his in the
past<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> final<00:00:30.840> nail<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
past but this is the final nail in the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.760 
past but this is the final nail in the
coffin<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.070> ice<00:00:32.219> climbers<00:00:33.200> but<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.559> big

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
coffin for the ice climbers but the big

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.869 
coffin for the ice climbers but the big
problem<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.950> why<00:00:37.950> did<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.610> need

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
problem with this is why did we need

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.350 
problem with this is why did we need
equal<00:00:39.210> rosters<00:00:39.960> or<00:00:40.379> why<00:00:41.280> did<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> rosters

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
equal rosters or why did the rosters

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.709 
equal rosters or why did the rosters
have<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.840> completely<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:44.160> same<00:00:44.539> like<00:00:45.539> we

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
have to be completely the same like we

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.360 
have to be completely the same like we
could<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:45.960> had<00:00:46.110> ice<00:00:46.289> climbers<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.100> wii

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
could have had ice climbers and wii

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.850 
could have had ice climbers and wii
version<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.629> don't<00:00:48.989> know<00:00:49.170> maybe<00:00:49.469> another

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
version in I don't know maybe another

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.160 
version in I don't know maybe another
clone<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.520> 3d<00:00:50.879> aspiration<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.690> give<00:00:51.899> Alf

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
clone in the 3d aspiration like give Alf

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.400 
clone in the 3d aspiration like give Alf
his<00:00:52.530> own<00:00:52.710> character<00:00:53.670> slot<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:55.230> brings

his own character slot and this brings

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.220 
his own character slot and this brings
up<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.949> major<00:00:56.190> major<00:00:56.760> question<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> before<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
up a major major question and before I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.819 
up a major major question and before I
say<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.100> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> say<00:00:59.670> that

smashburger is-3s was probably my most

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.899 
smashburger is-3s was probably my most
hyped<00:01:03.690> game<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> year<00:01:04.619> maybe<00:01:05.489> even<00:01:05.729> more

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
hyped game of the year maybe even more

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.460

playing<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.860> 3ds<00:01:08.130> version<00:01:08.250> first<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
playing the 3ds version first but the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.039 
playing the 3ds version first but the
major<00:01:10.080> question<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.860> raises<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.840> was<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
major question this raises is was the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.070 
major question this raises is was the
3ds<00:01:13.439> version<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:14.189> good<00:01:14.400> idea<00:01:15.080> originally

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
3ds version a good idea originally

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
3ds version a good idea originally
soccer<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.619> stated<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> 3ds<00:01:17.880> version<00:01:17.909> was

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
soccer I stated that the 3ds version was

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.719 
soccer I stated that the 3ds version was
going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> only<00:01:18.990> version<00:01:19.460> which<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.640> my

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going to be the only version which in my

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.620 
going to be the only version which in my
opinion<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.110> bad<00:01:22.320> idea<00:01:22.820> but<00:01:23.820> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
opinion is kind of a bad idea but of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.800 
opinion is kind of a bad idea but of
course<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:25.590> versions<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.810> if

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
course now we have two versions and if

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
course now we have two versions and if
the<00:01:27.900> 3ds<00:01:28.350> version<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> hold<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the 3ds version was going to hold the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.200 
the 3ds version was going to hold the
wii<00:01:29.640> u<00:01:29.820> version<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:30.479> was<00:01:30.869> he<00:01:31.079> worth<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.560> i

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
wii u version back was he worth it i

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.390 
wii u version back was he worth it i
mean<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.299> got<00:01:33.479> smash<00:01:33.840> run<00:01:34.200> which<00:01:34.740> isn't<00:01:35.159> even

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
mean we got smash run which isn't even

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
mean we got smash run which isn't even
online<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.930> def<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.650> went

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
online and all that def time that went

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.319 
online and all that def time that went
into<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> 3ds<00:01:38.520> version<00:01:38.549> could<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.180> went

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
into the 3ds version could have went

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.289 
into the 3ds version could have went
into<00:01:39.540> wii<00:01:39.810> u<00:01:39.990> version<00:01:40.290> making<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> better

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
into wii u version making it better

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.350 
into wii u version making it better
bigger<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> end<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> day<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> kind

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
bigger but at the end of the day is kind

given to the ice climbers because their
