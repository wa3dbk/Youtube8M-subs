00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.989
 eating together 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.629
 ingredients we read then together of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 ingredients to prepare ten twelve 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.899
 severed fingers 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.739
 then we have 20 grams of cornstarch 30 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.580
 grams of grated Parmesan cheese 30 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.150
 g of butter 45 grams of semolina 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 re-milled with durum wheat then 5 grams of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.140
 tomato paste half sachet of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.680
 instant yeast twenty years of liters 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.410
 about milk and a pinch of salt 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.450
 we prepare the whole 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.300
 let's start with the preparation of the companies 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.430
 chopped moon bullies let's first put all of them 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.040
 the dry ingredients or the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.520
 grana cheese the remilled semolina la 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.960
 maizena instead of mai zeno you can 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 also use potato starch 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:50.870
 if you find yourself better and then also the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.870
 instant yeast and mix well 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.850
 now let's close the concentrate of 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.220
 tomato in and slightly warmed 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.920
 so we will also give a pink color 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.920
 to our dough that will look like 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.380
 very much to human fingers 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:19.830
 now let's take our powder 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.350
 we pour the milk with the concentrate of 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.880
 tomato inside and then we also have 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.280
 in melted butter in the microwave 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.430
 let's pour that down too 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.570
 all and then mix together to form a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.570
 nice compact dough 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.220
 here now we have also mixed the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.750
 our pasta we got one 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.700
 first I didn't tell you a thing 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.989
 naturally I took it for granted 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.550
 however inside the dough 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.470
 we have also added a pinch of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.840
 indispensable rooms are another to give one 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.610
 certain flavor to the mixture though 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.440
 we already find the grana cheese 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.500
 do not abound with salt 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.360
 now the dough is little we can 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.160
 wrap it inside a sheet of 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.550
 transparent film to leave it 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.650
 rest for about 30 minutes later 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.959
 half an hour we can also proceed to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.530
 that finger preparation then 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:14.250
 from the dough or removed a loaf of 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.850
 in short, about 68 cm and start with the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.750
 hands to form a little more pillar 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:27.980
 regular maybe we keep this 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:31.660
 excess part and one end la 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.480
 we prepare to accommodate an almond 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:40.760
 that will serve us as a nail you see so 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:45.260
 with our fingers we crush give a little 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.500
 like a perfect finger now 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.570
 with the knife 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.850
 let's build the folds of the finger though seen 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.450
 which is a severed finger that they also serve 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.020
 of worms coming out of what to do 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.060
 we cut in half the pine nuts 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.660
 now we can also include them in 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.500
 opposite end to the almond as well 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.500
 like I'm doing now 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.650
 and our finger is ready we also have 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.260
 lined a plate with paper from 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.010
 oven and now we can go to 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.540
 place our finger on the plate e 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.310
 we continue in this way up to 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.000
 running out of the stage I'm fixing up 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.060
 the last finger 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.400
 here they are 12 so two hands for two 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.770
 fingers and now we go to inform them at 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.000
 180 degree oven temperature already 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.130
 cat warm for up to 12 aid 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.500
 think of a dinner that begins 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.540
 right with these fingers cut off yes 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.540
 it will be a thrilling evening
