and<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:04.300> gives<00:04:04.450> me<00:04:04.600> some<00:04:04.870> sort<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.140> more

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
and it gives me some sort of more

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.100 
and it gives me some sort of more
realism<00:04:06.220> into<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.610> game<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.660> reason<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.930> say

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
realism into the game the reason I say

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.750 
realism into the game the reason I say
this<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.440> because<00:04:08.470> even<00:04:09.280> with<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.550> game

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
this is because even with the game

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.320 
this is because even with the game
coming<00:04:10.150> out<00:04:10.330> we<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.350> add<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:12.310> know<00:04:12.400> at<00:04:13.000> siege

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.180 
happen they don't it doesn't happen
enough<00:05:06.580> enough<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:08.200> know<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.919> be<00:05:09.010> able<00:05:09.070> to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
enough enough to you know to be able to

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.350 
enough enough to you know to be able to
put<00:05:09.370> on<00:05:09.460> this<00:05:09.550> list<00:05:09.789> or<00:05:09.970> anything<00:05:10.120> like<00:05:10.300> that

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
put on this list or anything like that

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.420 
put on this list or anything like that
but<00:05:11.229> he<00:05:11.320> says<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.620> works<00:05:11.830> so<00:05:12.010> if<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.190> guys<00:05:12.250> want

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
but he says it works so if you guys want

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.320 
but he says it works so if you guys want
to<00:05:12.460> go<00:05:12.550> ahead<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.700> try<00:05:12.850> both<00:05:13.030> of<00:05:13.150> them<00:05:13.240> in

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
to go ahead and try both of them in

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.270 
to go ahead and try both of them in
combination<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.200> I<00:05:14.380> think<00:05:14.650> it'll<00:05:14.860> be<00:05:15.010> worked

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
combination and I think it'll be worked

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.010 
combination and I think it'll be worked
pretty<00:05:15.430> well<00:05:15.640> because<00:05:15.820> you'll<00:05:16.060> have<00:05:16.180> masses

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
pretty well because you'll have masses

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.440 
pretty well because you'll have masses
amounts<00:05:17.440> of<00:05:17.590> civilians<00:05:18.190> fighting<00:05:18.700> whatever

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
amounts of civilians fighting whatever

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.690 
amounts of civilians fighting whatever
soldiers<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:20.110> brought<00:05:20.289> to<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.500> city<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:21.039> it

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
soldiers you brought to the city and it

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.040 
soldiers you brought to the city and it
could<00:05:21.820> get<00:05:21.880> pretty<00:05:21.940> gruesome<00:05:22.360> one<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:22.990> my

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
could get pretty gruesome one of my

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.510 
could get pretty gruesome one of my
favorite<00:05:23.320> moves<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.650> they<00:05:23.770> do<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.220> well

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
favorite moves that they do the well

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.590 
favorite moves that they do the well
usually<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:25.150> army<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:26.289> military<00:05:26.320> wins<00:05:27.250> but

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
usually the army the military wins but

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.350 
usually the army the military wins but
one<00:05:28.600> of<00:05:28.630> my<00:05:28.720> favorite<00:05:29.100> little<00:05:30.360> techniques

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
one of my favorite little techniques

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.270 
one of my favorite little techniques
that<00:05:31.510> they<00:05:31.600> use<00:05:31.780> is<00:05:31.960> when<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.680> civilian<00:05:33.100> comes

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
that they use is when the civilian comes

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.440 
that they use is when the civilian comes
