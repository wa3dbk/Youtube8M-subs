00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.530 
I can go for them if I want to and
there's<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.710> really<00:02:55.890> any<00:02:56.430> penalties<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.450> I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
there's not really any penalties and I

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.330 
there's not really any penalties and I
think<00:02:57.780> when<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.230> pop<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.680> smaller<00:02:58.980> slimes

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
think when you pop the smaller slimes

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.640 
think when you pop the smaller slimes
the<00:02:59.550> casters<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.060> less<00:03:00.300> life<00:03:00.600> then<00:03:01.350> like

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the casters have less life then like

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.890 
the casters have less life then like
when<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.540> pop<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> larger<00:03:04.350> slime<00:03:05.600> like<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
when you pop a larger slime like in the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.150 
when you pop a larger slime like in the
beginning<00:03:06.989> when<00:03:07.410> you're<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.739> first

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
beginning when you're just first

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.340 
beginning when you're just first
attacking<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.000> as<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.140> one

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
attacking it so as you can see this one

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.110 
attacking it so as you can see this one
takes<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.739> little<00:03:10.920> bit<00:03:11.100> longer<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.610> take<00:03:11.850> my<00:03:11.970> time

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
takes a little bit longer I take my time

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.479 
takes a little bit longer I take my time
much<00:03:12.660> much<00:03:12.989> more<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.560> don't<00:03:13.980> really<00:03:14.070> need<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.370> be

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
much much more I don't really need to be

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.340 
much much more I don't really need to be
hasty<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.180> there's<00:03:15.720> not<00:03:15.900> really<00:03:16.110> any

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
hasty because there's not really any

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.410 
hasty because there's not really any
build-up<00:03:17.070> any<00:03:17.280> threatening<00:03:17.670> presences

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
build-up any threatening presences

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.510 
build-up any threatening presences
around<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.530> only<00:03:19.709> time<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:19.890> might<00:03:20.220> need<00:03:20.430> to

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
around the only time I might need to

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.560 
around the only time I might need to
rush<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.790> little<00:03:20.940> bit<00:03:21.030> as<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:21.270> there<00:03:21.420> are

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
rush a little bit as if there are

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.660 
rush a little bit as if there are
casters<00:03:22.050> because<00:03:22.410> every<00:03:23.040> time<00:03:23.250> they<00:03:23.400> cast

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
casters because every time they cast

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.430 
casters because every time they cast
that's<00:03:23.940> another<00:03:24.120> chance<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.140> might<00:03:25.290> be

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that's another chance that I might be

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.000 
that's another chance that I might be
hit<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.989> doing<00:03:27.989> pretty<00:03:28.140> well<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.500> far<00:03:28.530> and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
hit so doing pretty well so far and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.699 
hit so doing pretty well so far and
again<00:03:29.370> these<00:03:29.940> smaller<00:03:30.300> slimes<00:03:30.690> they<00:03:30.989> all<00:03:31.260> give

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
again these smaller slimes they all give

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.770 
again these smaller slimes they all give
you<00:03:31.980> plus<00:03:32.280> 9<00:03:32.580> HP<00:03:32.940> if<00:03:33.120> you've<00:03:33.270> got<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.570> much

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
you plus 9 HP if you've got that much

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.050 
you plus 9 HP if you've got that much
vamper<00:03:34.200> vampirism<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.010> that's<00:03:35.550> good<00:03:35.760> as<00:03:35.880> well

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
vamper vampirism so that's good as well

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.080 
vamper vampirism so that's good as well
finely<00:03:36.930> chopping<00:03:37.260> down<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:38.190> last<00:03:38.520> slime<00:03:38.880> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
finely chopping down that last slime the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.760 
finely chopping down that last slime the
spikes<00:03:39.390> are<00:03:39.630> disabled<00:03:40.200> once<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.500> defeat<00:03:40.709> the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
spikes are disabled once you defeat the

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.930 
spikes are disabled once you defeat the
boss<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.340> don't<00:03:41.489> have<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.640> worry<00:03:41.820> about

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
boss so you don't have to worry about

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.520 
boss so you don't have to worry about
that<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.360> animation<00:03:42.840> still<00:03:43.020> plays<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
that the animation still plays but the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.100 
that the animation still plays but the
spikes<00:03:43.770> don't<00:03:44.580> actually<00:03:44.880> work<00:03:45.060> collecting<00:03:45.989> on

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
spikes don't actually work collecting on

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.690 
spikes don't actually work collecting on
my<00:03:46.320> fatty<00:03:46.680> Lutz
