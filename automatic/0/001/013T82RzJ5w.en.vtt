not and what about lucid dreaming then

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.110 
not and what about lucid dreaming then
is<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.040> difficult<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.700> do

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
is that difficult to do

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.150 
is that difficult to do
well<00:00:36.600> lucid<00:00:37.020> dreaming<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.469> simply<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
well lucid dreaming is simply that the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.100 
well lucid dreaming is simply that the
brain<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.450> simply<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.899> REM<00:00:40.079> sleep

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
brain is not just simply in REM sleep

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.190 
brain is not just simply in REM sleep
but<00:00:40.559> part<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> brain<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.550> awake<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
but part of the brain is awake so you

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.250 
but part of the brain is awake so you
are<00:00:43.739> conscious<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.489> your<00:00:45.030> dreams<00:00:45.329> that's<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
are conscious of your dreams that's the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.740 
are conscious of your dreams that's the
whole<00:00:46.440> thing<00:00:46.710> about<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> many<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.390> us<00:00:48.510> do

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
whole thing about it and many of us do

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.959 
whole thing about it and many of us do
that<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.410> young<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.820> we

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
that when we're young but when we

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.700 
that when we're young but when we
shorten<00:00:51.390> our<00:00:51.449> sleep<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.530> sleep

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
shorten our sleep and we do not sleep

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.060 
shorten our sleep and we do not sleep
that<00:00:53.070> long<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.760> are<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.660> doing<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.680> anymore

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that long we are not doing that anymore

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
that long we are not doing that anymore
but<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.640> able<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.660> lucid

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
but we are able to do this lucid

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.549 
but we are able to do this lucid

any one of us so we're able to do is is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
any one of us so we're able to do is is
it<00:01:01.050> difficult<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.949> what's<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
benefits of doing it anyway well well

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.260 
benefits of doing it anyway well well
there<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.309> benefit<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.090> not

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
there was really a benefit we do not

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.420 
there was really a benefit we do not
know<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.470> post-traumatic<00:01:07.740> stress

technique now you yourself have your own

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.929 
technique now you yourself have your own
clinic<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:39.990> you're<00:01:40.520> dealing<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.549> people

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.830 
this technique on them well there are
two<00:01:49.409> basic<00:01:50.280> basic<00:01:50.729> groups<00:01:50.970> we're<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.450> taking

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
two basic basic groups we're not taking

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260 
two basic basic groups we're not taking
care<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> apnea<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> snoring<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.090> do

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
care of apnea and and snoring but we do

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
care of apnea and and snoring but we do
take<00:01:54.509> care<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.869> those<00:01:55.079> people<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.829> non

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
take care of those people with non

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.399 
take care of those people with non
restorative<00:01:56.939> sleep<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.990> second<00:01:58.320> big

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
restorative sleep and the second big

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.429 
restorative sleep and the second big
group<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.920> those<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.640> are<00:02:00.180> active<00:02:00.899> during

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
group is those that are active during

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.679 
group is those that are active during
sleep<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.280> sleepwalking<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> not

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
sleep that is sleepwalking which is not

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.929 
sleep that is sleepwalking which is not
a<00:02:03.719> disorder<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.439> such<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.100> there's<00:02:05.579> no

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
a disorder as such but there's no

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
a disorder as such but there's no
security<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.899> those<00:02:07.140> people<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.829> are

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
security in those people that are

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.090 
security in those people that are
wandering<00:02:08.369> around

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
wandering around

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.370 
wandering around
but<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.490> big<00:02:09.700> group<00:02:09.970> there<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.750> those<00:02:11.140> that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
but the big group there is those that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.740 
but the big group there is those that
act<00:02:11.680> out<00:02:11.950> their<00:02:12.280> dreams<00:02:12.580> when<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.480> have<00:02:13.600> your

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
do not yell do not fight and that is

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.800 
do not yell do not fight and that is
because<00:02:18.460> you're<00:02:18.640> paralyzed<00:02:19.150> during<00:02:19.450> REM

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
because you're paralyzed during REM

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.140 
because you're paralyzed during REM
sleep<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.640> paralyzes<00:02:21.640> does<00:02:21.910> not

sleep and if this paralyzes does not
work<00:02:22.390> anymore<00:02:22.720> if<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.410> does<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:23.860> work

work anymore if that does not work

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.310 
work anymore if that does not work
properly<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.360> act<00:02:25.570> out<00:02:25.810> your<00:02:26.080> dream

funny<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:14.170> there's<00:03:14.470> lots<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:14.920> research<00:03:15.340> being

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
funny but there's lots of research being

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.120 
funny but there's lots of research being
done<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.540> past<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.110> we<00:03:17.230> do<00:03:17.410> not<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:17.920> any

but<00:03:37.840> we<00:03:37.960> do<00:03:38.140> not<00:03:38.350> know<00:03:38.530> but<00:03:38.770> dream<00:03:39.070> sleep<00:03:39.430> as

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
but we do not know but dream sleep as

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.510 
but we do not know but dream sleep as
such<00:03:40.090> yes<00:03:40.570> that's<00:03:41.230> dramatically<00:03:41.830> important

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
such yes that's dramatically important

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.420 
such yes that's dramatically important
the<00:03:42.880> brain<00:03:43.090> there<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.480> most<00:03:44.290> active<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:45.070> even

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
the brain there is most active it's even

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.280 
the brain there is most active it's even
more<00:03:45.640> active<00:03:46.240> than<00:03:46.360> during<00:03:46.840> during<00:03:47.080> the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
more active than during during the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.740 
more active than during during the
daytime<00:03:47.710> so<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.460> work<00:03:48.790> that's<00:03:49.060> being<00:03:49.600> done

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
daytime so it's work that's being done

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.740 
daytime so it's work that's being done
during<00:03:50.140> doing<00:03:50.770> REM<00:03:50.950> sleep<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.460> that's<00:03:52.000> first

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
during doing REM sleep and that's first

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.920 
during doing REM sleep and that's first
of<00:03:52.930> all<00:03:53.110> that's<00:03:53.530> learning<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.510> secondly<00:03:55.510> it's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
of all that's learning and secondly it's

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.100 
of all that's learning and secondly it's
the<00:03:56.110> coordination<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.010> metabolic<00:03:57.370> processes

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
the coordination of metabolic processes

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.180 
the coordination of metabolic processes
