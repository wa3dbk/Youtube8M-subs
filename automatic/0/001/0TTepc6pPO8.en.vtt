00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
pentatonic minor blues scale from the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.060 
pentatonic minor blues scale from the
last<00:00:14.610> lesson<00:00:14.900> so<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.929> decided<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> fill<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
last lesson so I decided to fill a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.810 
last lesson so I decided to fill a
lesson<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.960> but<00:00:18.960> i<00:00:19.560> may<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.310> scrap<00:00:20.789> it

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
lesson with that but i may just scrap it

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.470 
lesson with that but i may just scrap it
since<00:00:21.420> i<00:00:21.570> don't<00:00:21.630> really<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.199> scales<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.920> i

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
since i don't really like scales and i

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.750 
since i don't really like scales and i
don't<00:00:24.480> know<00:00:24.539> i<00:00:24.869> think<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> lot

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
don't know i think it's just a lot

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.279 
don't know i think it's just a lot
easier<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.210> figure<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.570> what's<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.869> good<00:00:28.109> by

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
easier to figure out what's not good by

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.830 
easier to figure out what's not good by
yourself<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:30.029> want<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> learn<00:00:30.390> scales

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
yourself but if you want to learn scales

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
position to the same scale that we

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.740 
position to the same scale that we
learned<00:01:42.960> last<00:01:43.320> time<00:01:44.240> we<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.420> piece<00:01:45.720> it

learned last time we can piece it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.310 
learned last time we can piece it
together<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> say<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:48.630> playing<00:01:48.810> something

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
together so say if I'm playing something

together so say if I'm playing something
on<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:51.770> third<00:01:52.770> position<00:01:53.009> which<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:54.000> we

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
on the third position which was what we

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200 
on the third position which was what we
learned<00:01:54.630> last<00:01:54.750> lesson<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.710> could<00:01:56.430> connect<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
learned last lesson we could connect it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.550 
learned last lesson we could connect it
with<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.710> fourth<00:01:59.160> position<00:01:59.479> or<00:02:00.560> fourth

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
with the fourth position or fourth

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.100 
with the fourth position or fourth
position<00:02:02.539> all<00:02:03.539> right<00:02:03.660> let<00:02:03.840> me<00:02:03.930> run<00:02:04.080> through

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
position all right let me run through

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:35.320 
position all right let me run through
that<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.649> more<00:02:04.710> time

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.570 

now<00:02:36.330> once<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.290> learn<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:37.920> scale<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.310> you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
now once you learn that scale and you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.460 
now once you learn that scale and you
can<00:02:38.730> go<00:02:38.940> through<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.690> down<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:40.260> keep

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
can go through it up and down just keep

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.290 
can go through it up and down just keep
doing<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.280> down<00:02:41.400> up<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.760> down<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
doing it up and down up and down up and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.710 
doing it up and down up and down up and
down<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:42.810> tire<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.670> then<00:02:44.670> when<00:02:45.629> you're

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
down to your tire and then when you're

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900 
down to your tire and then when you're
not<00:02:45.870> tired<00:02:46.080> come<00:02:46.349> back<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.680> do<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.769> again<00:02:46.910> when

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
not tired come back and do it again when

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.460 
not tired come back and do it again when
you<00:02:48.030> don't<00:02:48.209> have<00:02:48.330> anything<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.989> your<00:02:49.230> board

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
you don't have anything to do your board

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.380 
you don't have anything to do your board
for<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.769> couple<00:02:50.220> minutes<00:02:50.340> run<00:02:51.090> through<00:02:51.269> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
for a couple minutes run through the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.860 
for a couple minutes run through the
scale<00:02:51.690> or<00:02:51.959> practice<00:02:52.500> practice<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:53.280> some<00:02:53.519> way

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
scale or practice practice in some way

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.199 
scale or practice practice in some way
because<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.050> all<00:02:55.380> good<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> but<00:02:56.910> check

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
because it's all good for you but check

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.640 
because it's all good for you but check
it<00:02:57.239> out<00:02:57.360> see<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:58.019> was<00:02:58.290> talking<00:02:58.590> about

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
it out see I was talking about

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.100 
it out see I was talking about
connecting<00:02:59.569> the<00:03:00.569> scales<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.630> we're<00:03:03.780> gonna<00:03:03.870> go

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
connecting the scales so we're gonna go

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.039 
connecting the scales so we're gonna go
we're<00:03:04.500> gonna<00:03:04.650> start<00:03:05.160> with<00:03:05.580> third<00:03:06.450> position

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
we're gonna start with third position

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.670 
we're gonna start with third position
which<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:07.830> what<00:03:08.099> we<00:03:08.220> learned<00:03:08.459> last<00:03:08.750> time<00:03:09.750> I'm

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
which is what we learned last time I'm

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.589 
which is what we learned last time I'm
going<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.890> go<00:03:11.040> up<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.489> scale<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.060> then<00:03:12.269> I'm

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
going to go up the scale and then I'm

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.610 
going to go up the scale and then I'm
going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> bring<00:03:13.079> it<00:03:13.200> up<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:14.640> fourth<00:03:15.150> position

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
going to bring it up to fourth position

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.430 
going to bring it up to fourth position
and<00:03:16.620> that's<00:03:16.769> going<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.010> go<00:03:17.130> down<00:03:17.720> like<00:03:18.720> get<00:03:19.290> it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and that's going to go down like get it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.180 
and that's going to go down like get it
down<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:20.450> sound<00:03:21.450> does<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.630> little<00:03:21.900> work<00:03:22.190> okay

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
down like sound does a little work okay

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:35.500 
down like sound does a little work okay
