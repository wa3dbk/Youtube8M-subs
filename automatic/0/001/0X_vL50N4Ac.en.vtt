00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
think that's a lot of point a point that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.530 
think that's a lot of point a point that
a<00:01:38.130> lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> people<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.729> missing<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.479> I

how to fly and myself included but I've
kind<00:02:49.330> of<00:02:49.450> held<00:02:49.630> off<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:50.230> flying<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.769> Jets

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
kind of held off like flying the Jets

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.740 
kind of held off like flying the Jets
and<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.220> helicopters<00:02:51.850> too<00:02:52.090> much<00:02:52.299> unless<00:02:52.600> I

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
and the helicopters too much unless I

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.199 
and the helicopters too much unless I
know<00:02:52.810> my<00:02:53.019> team<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.350> going<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.500> win<00:02:53.560> because

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
know my team is going to win because

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.640 
know my team is going to win because
frankly<00:02:55.209> it's<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.630> waste<00:02:55.870> if<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.230> pick<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.500> up

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
frankly it's a waste if you pick it up

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.309 
frankly it's a waste if you pick it up
and<00:02:56.830> crash<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.400> 15<00:02:58.209> seconds<00:02:58.660> later<00:02:58.840> which<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.260> do

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
and crash it 15 seconds later which I do

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.650 
and crash it 15 seconds later which I do
most<00:02:59.709> times<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.849> don't<00:03:01.000> wait<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.269> minute

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
most times so you don't wait a minute

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.750 
most times so you don't wait a minute
and<00:03:01.810> see<00:03:01.870> if<00:03:02.500> your<00:03:02.620> team's<00:03:02.830> gets<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.160> lead<00:03:03.400> and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
and see if your team's gets to lead and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.759 
and see if your team's gets to lead and
then<00:03:04.420> take<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:04.690> plane<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.470> don't<00:03:05.620> piss

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
then take that plane so you don't piss

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.199 
then take that plane so you don't piss
somebody<00:03:06.040> off<00:03:06.220> there's<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.580> lot<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.790> really

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
somebody off there's a lot of really
