00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:02.740
 hello 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.220
 well I'm new to you tube registered this is my first tutorial 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.639
 xd xd xd xd I hope you are not so cruel with the comments 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.659
 jajajajajajaja 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:16.289
 I am pharaoh month of July and what this time I will show you that as 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.730
 customize the windows 7 home screen we will do it through this 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.769
 program and size madow imposed logomarca a charger 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.519
 One of the advantages of this software is that it can be used without the need 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.739
 to install it since it is a portable application 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.379
 The steps that we must carry out are as follows once the 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.860
 Program 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 enter the rda file 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.300
 enter the folder windows 7 compares a charger 3 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.729
 access the application that has the same name 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.589
 We wait a moment for the program to be there and then we will enjoy the 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.059
 Advantages of this application will first show us some wallpaper that already lives 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.840
 included with the program these are boats 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.980
 to forests 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.750
 and others but some of these do not catch your attention 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.800
 they will be able to choose other images that they have saved in the computer only 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.430
 it will be necessary to indicate in which directory they are stored I show some 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.680
 collages made by my friends to collaborate with my tutorial these were 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.320
 made with picasa and also a folder with some wallpaper 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.580
 One recommendation I give you is to get images in a good 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.410
 resolution as this will not show your home screen with the image 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.010
 distorted age jejejejeje something I had forgotten to tell them at the beginning 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.110
 xd xd xd xd xd apart from the drinking the file also comes with an installer 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.110
 in the installation folder if they decide to install it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 of this it looks like a tongue twister 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.640
 hahaha but good let's continue with the instructions 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.400
 Once you find the image that best suits you, just click on the button 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.300
 that is called the pli wait for carthage this is pretty fast and 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.120
 then they will have their new start screen if the program is nothing 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.320
 he lost his the opposite is very very easy and manageable finally there 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.800
 interesting options with which we can reset the folder of the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.110
 wallpapers and place them that come by default this one also brings the image 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.960
 from the windows itself that is already on the home screen we can also 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.220
 apply different effects to the background as the shadow of the texts that appear on the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.450
 start of the session 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.890
 this is so that the letters that are on top of the box 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.890
 passwords are still displayed just as sharp 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.759
 I know that the video tutorial is not excellent gg is the first video tutorial I've 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:34.309
 done in the whole life hahaha, but I promise that in the coming months 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.719
 I will force to make them much better 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.809
 I'm not very aware of all the functions of you tube but good anyway 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.099
 I asked them street 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.049
 please subscribe and leave comments if you have any problems 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.340
 with the program let me know to see if I give them a little help thanks vl 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.999
 there's still a bit of time left before the video ends so what 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.230
 I will use to tell you that I hope to arrive soon with new projects 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.909
 tutorials the famous reviews 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.509
 some parodies 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:06.709
 and something else that comes to mind while I'm exaggerating
