00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
days before another big game is that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.940 
days before another big game is that
fair<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:33.799> it's<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:35.009> fair<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.299> what

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
fair I think it's not fair but it's what

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.149 
fair I think it's not fair but it's what
calendar<00:01:37.950> has<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.079> league<00:01:40.290> has<00:01:40.950> dictated

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
calendar has and the league has dictated

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
calendar has and the league has dictated
and<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.570> follow<00:01:42.750> others<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and we have to to follow others but I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.490 
and we have to to follow others but I
don't<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.399> fair<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:45.500> particularly

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
don't think is fair because particularly

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.870 
don't think is fair because particularly
after<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> game<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.759> know

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
after the game like this we you know

most of these players they won't have

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730 
most of these players they won't have
lots<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.450> chances<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.930> be<00:01:52.140> involved<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
lots of chances to be involved in the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.670 
lots of chances to be involved in the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
could still be strong instead of sort of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.060 
could still be strong instead of sort of
game<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> mind<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> market<00:02:01.770> is
