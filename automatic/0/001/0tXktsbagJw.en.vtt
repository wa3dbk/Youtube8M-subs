00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.849
Hello, my name is Aoki Misako.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:24.210
I will show you how to do strawberry Hello Kitty nails.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.999
I have only applied this varnish once, but the color came out very well,

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.319
I can really recommend you this nail varnish.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.410
Even at one coin shops they started selling reasonable nail varnish.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.899
They even started selling nail stickers at one coin shops.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.680
My recommendation would be a simple white nail varnish.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.660
A thick white color is a great base for Hello Kitty.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.020
I am using this one a lot and I can really recommend it.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.790
You won't be painting all your nails white,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.540
and it thus would be a waste to buy an expensive nail varnish.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.080
I can therefore recommend you get some cheap white nail varnish.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.760
Today, I am wearing pinks and reds on my coordinate.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.440
That is why I chose to do pink and red nails.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.420
Nails are an important part of your fashion style.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.460
You therefore have to decide on what you wear first,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.520
before choosing your nail design. This will improve your style.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.900
Important point when doing the strawberry nails is that

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.380
you first have to color your nail completely red.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.329
After it dries, add the artwork on top.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.380
The green stem of the strawberry is painted just like

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.220
I did my melty chocolate nails.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.160
For the dots of the strawberry I use a bright white nail varnish.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.390
For the application I use the back of a toothpick.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.860
Adding small dots makes it look more like a real strawberry.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.689
And I think that looks really cute.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.409
For my middle finger I will be drawing Hello Kitty.

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.449
The bow is really hard to make,

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.161
Brush on 1 2 3 dots.

00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:26.501
By connecting them together, you create a really cute bow.

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:31.750
I used a permanent marker to draw the eyes and whiskers.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.769
Furthermore, for beginners it is hard

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.590
to draw the whole body of a character.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.459
That is why my nail is one little Hello Kitty,

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.400
This is just Hello Kitty's face.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.680
The next nail will be easy.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.139
We will just add some nail stickers on top.

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.549
When adding the stickers, it is again easier to use a toothpick.

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.609
That way they are easier to apply.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.660
Also if you use your fingers its hard to avoid fingerprints.

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:20.379
I therefore use toothpicks to gently stick them on.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.759
Applying the stickers after the base has completely dried,

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.979
is the best way to apply it without getting any smudges.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:32.539
Finally ad clear top coating in order to keep them from getting shabby.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.420
These nails are super easy to do.

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.589
The stone on my pinkie

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:46.089
is a rhine stone that I bought at a place called "Kiwa seisaku".

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:50.950
They sell 20 stones for 170 Yen. That is really reasonable.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.370
There has been a recent trend to wear them below the eyes.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.140
When putting them on your nails, you will need a top coat varnish.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.958
You will have to layer it up to get the stone to stick properly.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.380
First apply it as base, then add the rhine stone.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.420
After that apply the top coat about 2-3 times.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.820
Because you use your fingertips a lot, you will need lots of varnish

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.580
to make sure it does not fall off.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.263
That's my hint for you.

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.979
This is the glitter for the thumb.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.361
For this one I chose a varnish that contains

00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:27.360
red, yellow and pink.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.520
With this I created a naildo that contains all colours and some glitter

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.719
and arranged them randomly on my thumb.

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.039
After all, you move your hands a lot

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.540
and when there is something sparkling on your nails it looks really cute.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.420
So thinking about the whole picture, I decided to use glitter

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.180
and jotted it down on my nails.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.340
Because it is so simple, you have to only apply it from the bottle.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.520
But you need to consider the balance of the glitter.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.980
If the colours overlap the balance will be off.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.409
Therefore use the toothpick again before the varnish dries,

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.160
and arrange them accordingly.

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.889
Add a top coating on top to create a good balance.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.560
Check out my pastel nail tutorial too!

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.020
This is Hello Kitty's way...

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.699
No that was wrong.

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.339
One more time please.

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:33.859
On the brush bit... no wait ... it is not a brush...

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.360
It's a stem! Sorry!

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.740
Today I will teach you more about Lolita Manners

00:05:48.194 --> 00:05:50.194
Don't write in messy handwriting!

00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.741
Most embarrassing behaviour:

00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:05.365
Most kawaii behaviour:
