00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.480 
it probably a week or two later because
it<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.810> didn't<00:00:22.350> work<00:00:22.440> out<00:00:22.620> for<00:00:22.680> me<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.220> far<00:00:23.430> as

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
it just didn't work out for me as far as

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.090 
it just didn't work out for me as far as
being<00:00:23.730> able<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.210> pack<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.600> my<00:00:24.750> stand<00:00:25.110> my<00:00:25.740> sticks

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
being able to pack in my stand my sticks

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.160 
being able to pack in my stand my sticks

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
wear it all on my back at the same time

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.720 
wear it all on my back at the same time
so<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.540> ended<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:30.930> going<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.339> monster

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.450 
so I ended up going with the monster
fanny<00:00:32.969> pack<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.449> lot<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.629> research<00:00:34.460> about

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
fanny pack at a lot of research about

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.669 
fanny pack at a lot of research about
fanny<00:00:35.820> packs<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> decided<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
fanny packs so I decided to go with the

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.139 
fanny packs so I decided to go with the
fanny<00:00:37.859> pack<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.160> couple<00:00:38.579> things<00:00:38.699> I<00:00:38.850> liked<00:00:39.030> about

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
fanny pack a couple things I liked about

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.720 
fanny pack a couple things I liked about
it<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.809> has<00:00:39.989> shoulder<00:00:40.350> straps<00:00:40.679> I<00:00:41.010> took<00:00:41.579> them

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it it has shoulder straps I took them

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.239 
it it has shoulder straps I took them
off<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.199> I'm<00:00:43.320> doing<00:00:43.350> some<00:00:43.710> scouting<00:00:44.010> I'll

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
off but if I'm doing some scouting I'll

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.040 
off but if I'm doing some scouting I'll
usually<00:00:44.489> throw<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> shoulder<00:00:45.030> straps<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.839> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
usually throw the shoulder straps on and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
usually throw the shoulder straps on and
then<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.199> can<00:00:46.409> hike<00:00:46.769> around<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.399> not<00:00:48.030> worry

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
then I can hike around and not worry

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.750 
then I can hike around and not worry
about<00:00:48.269> the<00:00:48.510> pack<00:00:48.690> being<00:00:48.960> uncomfortable<00:00:49.760> when

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
about the pack being uncomfortable when

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.290 
about the pack being uncomfortable when
I'm<00:00:50.879> hunting

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I'm hunting

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
I'm hunting
I<00:00:51.449> took<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.230> straps<00:00:52.469> off<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.429> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I took the straps off because I like to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.869 
I took the straps off because I like to
wear<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> front<00:00:54.120> I'm<00:00:54.929> shorter<00:00:55.319> walks<00:00:55.879> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
wear in the front I'm shorter walks so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.340 
wear in the front I'm shorter walks so
that<00:00:56.999> I<00:00:57.059> corn<00:00:57.300> my<00:00:57.390> standing<00:00:57.749> my<00:00:57.870> sticks<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.260> my

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that I corn my standing my sticks on my

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.599 
that I corn my standing my sticks on my
back<00:00:58.609> also<00:01:00.079> if<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> longer<00:01:01.710> walk<00:01:01.890> I'll

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
back also if it's a longer walk I'll

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.190 
back also if it's a longer walk I'll
actually<00:01:02.850> won't<00:01:03.420> even<00:01:03.600> wear<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> fanny<00:01:04.080> pack

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.200 
actually won't even wear the fanny pack

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.530 
actually won't even wear the fanny pack
I<00:01:04.620> will<00:01:05.070> hang<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.730> over<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> back<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
I will hang it over the back of the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
I will hang it over the back of the
stand<00:01:06.870> off<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.800> top<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.190> just<00:01:08.250> let<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.490> hang

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
stand off the top and just let it hang

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.180 
stand off the top and just let it hang
there<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.860> with

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
there so that's kind of what I do with

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.580 
there so that's kind of what I do with
my<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.820> fanny<00:01:12.090> pack<00:01:12.180> once<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> the

my my fanny pack once I get up in the
tree<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.690> I<00:01:15.690> can<00:01:16.410> basically<00:01:17.270> strap<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.510> right

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
tree I I can basically strap this right

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.390 
tree I I can basically strap this right
to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> tree<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> usually<00:01:19.740> hang<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.980> bow<00:01:20.130> hook

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
to the tree I usually hang a bow hook

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.060 
to the tree I usually hang a bow hook
strap<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> tree<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
strap it right to the tree and then I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.620 
strap it right to the tree and then I
have<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.460> my<00:01:23.580> pockets<00:01:24.000> available<00:01:24.450> pretty

easily and then I usually will strap my
quiver<00:01:28.020> onto<00:01:28.770> my<00:01:28.920> top<00:01:29.580> strap<00:01:29.910> right<00:01:30.120> here<00:01:31.310> I'll

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
quiver onto my top strap right here I'll

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
quiver onto my top strap right here I'll
strap<00:01:32.580> my<00:01:32.730> quiver<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.390> since<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.350> down

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
strap my quiver on there since it down

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.550 
strap my quiver on there since it down
nice<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.740> tight<00:01:34.980> so<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.430> an<00:01:35.580> extra<00:01:35.940> arrow

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
nice and tight so I have an extra arrow

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.840 
nice and tight so I have an extra arrow
available<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:38.070> me<00:01:38.280> whenever<00:01:38.730> I<00:01:39.000> might<00:01:39.420> need<00:01:40.260> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
available to me whenever I might need it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.750 
available to me whenever I might need it
also<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:43.260> my<00:01:43.470> walk-in<00:01:43.680> I'll<00:01:44.010> typically<00:01:44.460> put<00:01:44.640> my

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
also on my walk-in I'll typically put my
