00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.040
 of course also purchased from someone one 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.170
 And with that we go the top of it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.329

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.190
 you can also know what i used to do 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.750
 find it below in the description 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 but then I always write a lot 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 if I have an edge 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.640
 nicely flattened and bag flattened with 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.650
 well on top other we new 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.229
 so can the course pots go 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.770
 use and allows you to every club for 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.450
 which you like yourself and which I create 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.340
 game on the modpodge just had one 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.530
 low over it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.290
 i was completely throw myself in arms and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.310
 glitters over it like a slightly dried 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.549
 scale another layer of you 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.549
 anoint 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 and I use them a piece became to will 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 I have fallen in the middle where I am 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.939
 shoot out then I can all great that that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.939
 put back in the jar 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.280
 actually letter and easiest 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.860
 robin ever i bought on men 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030
 so looked such a nice layer 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.520
 across 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.930
 Make sure everything is well covered and I can 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.619
 so by giving it a bag later 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.670
 use 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.670
 so i'm doing well here 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.200
 if a little dry in between minutes 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.770
 or about ten goes a second late 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.420
 grumbles over to collapse and if 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.940
 The house collapsed two days or there 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.490
 discussed my it is really good fixed 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.050
 then you must brush carefully and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.150
 there little places with you forget to 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.560
 stay level did not want good at all 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.860
 is a bit like that now 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.780
 brushes I have these glasses earlier 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.370
 I made it and then they stuck each other and there 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.510
 are not going to release a piece 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.640
 this way in julia we go again the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.380

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.810
