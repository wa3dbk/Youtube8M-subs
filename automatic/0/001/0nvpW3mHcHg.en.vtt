00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
they need support directly across is the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.330 
they need support directly across is the
second<00:02:02.430> design<00:02:02.700> they<00:02:03.390> see<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:04.070> couple<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.100> words

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
second design they see a couple of words

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.039 
second design they see a couple of words
floating<00:02:05.909> through<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.689> many

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
once again no difference on the roof but

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.360 
once again no difference on the roof but
listen<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.599> haven't<00:02:09.899> got<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.080> floor<00:02:10.370> these

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.170 
still you get a pretty decent one I
think<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.360> maximum<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.959> 15<00:02:21.610> don't<00:02:22.610> really<00:02:23.030> get

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
think the maximum is 15 don't really get

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.520 
think the maximum is 15 don't really get
any<00:02:23.390> difference<00:02:23.810> at<00:02:24.019> all

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
any difference at all

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.309 
any difference at all
apart<00:02:25.310> from<00:02:25.459> an<00:02:25.760> extra<00:02:26.090> 10<00:02:26.330> which<00:02:26.930> is<00:02:26.959> still<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
apart from an extra 10 which is still a

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.530 
apart from an extra 10 which is still a
different<00:02:27.769> sport<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.730> still<00:02:29.060> want<00:02:29.269> those

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
different sport you still want those

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.100 
different sport you still want those
magical<00:02:30.230> level<00:02:30.920> 50<00:02:31.480> enchantments<00:02:34.720> next<00:02:35.720> we

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
magical level 50 enchantments next we

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.870 
magical level 50 enchantments next we
have<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.560> small<00:02:36.800> combined<00:02:37.459> one<00:02:38.319> yeah<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:40.610> see

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
have a small combined one yeah you see

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.809 
have a small combined one yeah you see
just<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.019> normal<00:02:42.470> enchantment<00:02:43.340> table<00:02:43.760> at

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
just the normal enchantment table at

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.240 
just the normal enchantment table at
once<00:02:44.030> again<00:02:44.390> nothing<00:02:45.260> special<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:46.190> is

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
once again nothing special this is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.940 
once again nothing special this is
because<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.180> words<00:02:47.390> have<00:02:47.660> no<00:02:47.870> room<00:02:48.620> to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
because the words have no room to

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.020 
because the words have no room to
connect<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:51.230> enchantment<00:02:51.799> table<00:02:52.190> they

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
connect to the enchantment table they

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.059 
connect to the enchantment table they
have<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.569> con<00:02:53.780> even<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.500> book<00:02:54.709> doesn't

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
have the con even the book doesn't

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.440 
have the con even the book doesn't
really<00:02:55.220> connect<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.849> either

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
really connect to you either

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.479 
really connect to you either
unless<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.950> hop<00:02:58.190> inside<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:01.130> that's<00:03:01.280> not

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
unless you hop inside so that's not

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.089 
unless you hop inside so that's not
really<00:03:01.910> an<00:03:02.000> effective<00:03:02.420> one<00:03:02.510> over<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.709> find

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
really an effective one over this I find

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.370 
really an effective one over this I find
is<00:03:04.400> probably<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.819> most<00:03:04.970> effective<00:03:05.420> design

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
is probably the most effective design

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.890 
is probably the most effective design
yes<00:03:07.280> I've<00:03:07.519> added<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.970> roof<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.750> floor

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
yes I've added the roof and the floor

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.990 
yes I've added the roof and the floor
but<00:03:09.410> that's<00:03:09.590> just<00:03:09.829> of<00:03:09.980> my<00:03:10.160> choice<00:03:10.459> because<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
but that's just of my choice because it

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880 
but that's just of my choice because it
gives<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.480> wooden<00:03:11.780> look<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.739> can<00:03:12.860> just

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
gives you the wooden look you can just

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.250 
gives you the wooden look you can just
obviously<00:03:13.310> use<00:03:13.489> one<00:03:13.700> planks<00:03:14.150> book<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.630> really

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
obviously use one planks book I really

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.870 
obviously use one planks book I really
couldn't<00:03:15.440> be<00:03:15.530> bothered<00:03:15.680> just<00:03:15.890> going<00:03:16.579> into<00:03:16.700> my

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
couldn't be bothered just going into my

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.629 
couldn't be bothered just going into my
inventory<00:03:17.260> scrolling<00:03:18.260> down<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.440> couple<00:03:18.859> what

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
inventory scrolling down a couple what

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.550 
inventory scrolling down a couple what
yeah<00:03:19.790> that's<00:03:20.359> just<00:03:20.540> because<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:21.109> did<00:03:21.440> this

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
yeah that's just because I did this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.420 
yeah that's just because I did this
quite<00:03:21.829> quickly<00:03:23.290> what<00:03:24.290> you'll<00:03:24.440> see<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.799> when<00:03:25.370> I

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
quite quickly what you'll see it when I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.849 
quite quickly what you'll see it when I
enter<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:25.910> sword<00:03:26.180> straight<00:03:26.569> away<00:03:26.900> very<00:03:27.500> high

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
enter this sword straight away very high

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.309 
enter this sword straight away very high
level<00:03:28.370> enchantment<00:03:28.940> level<00:03:29.030> 38<00:03:30.100> lower<00:03:31.100> 47<00:03:32.319> low

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
level enchantment level 38 lower 47 low

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.300 
level enchantment level 38 lower 47 low
45<00:03:34.100> this<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.910> because<00:03:35.650> all<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.889> way<00:03:37.010> around

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
45 this is because all the way around

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.340 
45 this is because all the way around
the<00:03:37.579> top<00:03:37.819> blade<00:03:38.120> doesn't<00:03:38.510> really<00:03:38.810> make<00:03:39.109> much

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
the top blade doesn't really make much

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.009 
the top blade doesn't really make much
difference<00:03:39.410> like<00:03:40.160> but<00:03:40.880> it's<00:03:41.359> these<00:03:41.690> two

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
difference like but it's these two

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:42.640 
difference like but it's these two
layers<00:03:42.260> here

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
layers here

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.710 
layers here
the<00:03:43.160> third<00:03:43.430> ones<00:03:43.730> just<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.120> give<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.389> more<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.600> a

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
the third ones just to give it more of a

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.840 
the third ones just to give it more of a
roomy<00:03:45.109> feel<00:03:45.319> instead<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.769> being<00:03:45.950> squashed<00:03:46.340> and

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
roomy feel instead of being squashed and

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.220 
roomy feel instead of being squashed and
stuff<00:03:47.150> like<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.590> these<00:03:48.739> two<00:03:49.100> lazier

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
stuff like that so these two lazier

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.050 
stuff like that so these two lazier
give<00:03:51.230> out<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.410> good<00:03:51.769> source<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
give out a good source of the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.319 
give out a good source of the
enchantment<00:03:53.799> there's<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.889> one<00:03:55.190> layer<00:03:55.430> gap<00:03:55.760> but

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
enchantment there's a one layer gap but

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.569 
enchantment there's a one layer gap but
there's<00:03:56.510> still<00:03:56.660> enough<00:03:56.930> room<00:03:57.280> obviously<00:03:58.280> to

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
there's still enough room obviously to

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.819 
there's still enough room obviously to
place<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:59.000> enchantment<00:03:59.480> table<00:03:59.840> it<00:04:00.560> doesn't

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
place the enchantment table it doesn't

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.309 
place the enchantment table it doesn't
matter<00:04:01.130> really<00:04:01.579> about<00:04:02.090> this<00:04:02.299> one<00:04:02.599> but<00:04:03.079> really

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
matter really about this one but really

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.410 
matter really about this one but really
if<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.769> just<00:04:03.799> did<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:04.519> an<00:04:04.670> enclosed<00:04:05.030> one<00:04:05.299> you

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
if you just did one an enclosed one you

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.309 
if you just did one an enclosed one you
can<00:04:05.569> still<00:04:05.870> have<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.560> don't<00:04:07.160> know<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:08.750> going<00:04:09.230> to

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
can still have I don't know you going to

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.610 
can still have I don't know you going to
decide<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.250> then<00:04:11.260> coming<00:04:12.260> up<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.380> top

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
decide it and then coming up the top

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.930 
decide it and then coming up the top
here<00:04:12.829> or<00:04:12.889> something<00:04:13.310> like<00:04:13.400> that<00:04:13.609> but<00:04:13.790> that

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
here or something like that but that

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.849 
here or something like that but that
doesn't<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.419> matter<00:04:14.599> because<00:04:15.019> you<00:04:15.590> still

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
doesn't really matter because you still

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.219 
doesn't really matter because you still
getting<00:04:16.099> higher<00:04:16.340> level<00:04:16.750> sometimes<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.959> find

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
getting higher level sometimes I find

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.130 
getting higher level sometimes I find
low<00:04:18.889> 50<00:04:19.459> isn't<00:04:20.060> even<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.450> best<00:04:20.570> most<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:21.079> the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
low 50 isn't even the best most of the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.520 
low 50 isn't even the best most of the
time<00:04:21.400> because<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.849> will<00:04:22.970> still<00:04:23.240> give<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.530> like

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
time because it will still give you like

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.700 
time because it will still give you like
a<00:04:24.680> level

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
a level

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.370 
a level
for<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.580> will<00:04:26.699> still<00:04:26.940> give<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.360> like<00:04:27.630> more<00:04:28.169> to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
for it will still give you like more to
