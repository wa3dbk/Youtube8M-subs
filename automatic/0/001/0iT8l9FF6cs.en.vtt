00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
certainly does indicate that here the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.410 
certainly does indicate that here the
Sun<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.770> tend<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> win<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.879> little

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
Sun will tend to win out on this little

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
Sun will tend to win out on this little
discussion<00:00:55.010> however<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.670> other

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
discussion however there is one other

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
discussion however there is one other
thing<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> occurs<00:00:57.809> throughout<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.440> day<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
thing that occurs throughout the day and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.160 
thing that occurs throughout the day and
that<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> involvement<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.480> sweet<00:01:00.809> Venus

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that is the involvement of sweet Venus

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.490 
that is the involvement of sweet Venus
in<00:01:01.620> sweet<00:01:02.430> cancer<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:04.080> she<00:01:04.320> may<00:01:04.470> feel

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
in sweet cancer and I think she may feel

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
in sweet cancer and I think she may feel
a<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:04.979> shunted<00:01:05.519> off<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.240> side<00:01:06.510> here

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
a little shunted off to the side here

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
a little shunted off to the side here
she<00:01:07.439> doesn't<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.310> she<00:01:08.549> pulls<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.000> we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
she doesn't like it but she pulls in we

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480 
she doesn't like it but she pulls in we
pull<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> maybe<00:01:10.140> become<00:01:10.619> quiet<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.369> our

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
pull in and maybe become quiet with our

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
pull in and maybe become quiet with our
feelings<00:01:11.939> yeah<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.020> reason<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
feelings yeah and I think the reason is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
feelings yeah and I think the reason is
that<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:14.010> may<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.520> attended<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
that we may not be attended to on a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
that we may not be attended to on a
personal<00:01:15.750> level<00:01:15.810> cancer<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> water<00:01:16.950> sign

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
personal level cancer is a water sign

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.450 
personal level cancer is a water sign
that's<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.600> individual<00:01:19.229> Pisces<00:01:20.220> where

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that's about the individual Pisces where

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
that's about the individual Pisces where
the<00:01:20.580> full<00:01:20.790> moon<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> water<00:01:21.810> sign<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the full moon is is a water sign that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.800
