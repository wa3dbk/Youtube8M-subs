00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.339
 the colorful icons in the mobile phone display looks 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.370
 You do not know which app to trust 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.260
 can and do not sympathetic 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.420
 it somehow all but dims out 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.980
 because some app should be better 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 do not trust blindly 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.420
 this is especially true for android phones 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
 There are currently the most 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.130
 Fraudulent apps contain sensitive data 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.510
 steal the until a few months ago 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.160
 needed smartphone users 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.050
 actually do not worry 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.210
 first there was no fraudulent ore 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.070
 meanwhile this looks completely different 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 from and above all android users 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.870
 have to be careful because for 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.250
 Android devices fraudulent apps in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 Unfortunately, it is impossible to get around 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.820
 comparatively easy in apple world 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 it looks different from apple 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.230
 controls every single app in the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.570
 app store lands and you can only 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.129
 Get apps from the app store and should 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.660
 It's about as problematic 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.579
 then it will turn out of the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 app store is removed and can even 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.870
 for the devices to be removed again 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.239
 much more security for apple 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.670
 users in the android world there you can 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.040
 load apps from different sources 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.290
 not just from the google place of the gate 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.000
 is still relatively safe there you should it 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.100
 also best to load but you can just 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 apps also come from other sources 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 example of websites and never can 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.280
 Nobody control so easily 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 check the reliability 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 so you should be careful 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.259
 and you should be an android user too 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.420
 to become active 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.140
 Protect your tablet and protect your tablet 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.060
 the data stored on it as well 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.759
 There are now various protection apps 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
 for the android world apps like these you 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.079
 examine the device for known 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.659
 offenders and warn one for apps the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.150
 you better not use some 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.670
 programs also actively protect the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.409
 device stored data is recommended 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.479
 try my tip 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.500
 Some protection apps are even available 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.119
 charge a very important tip for free 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.369
 apps only from the official google 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.320
 place gate down here 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.390
 at least some control 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.060
 While there are other Android apps 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.990
 but it should be offered for download 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 it is better not to use it 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.880
 At least the risk is greater here 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.050
 to capture a damage program 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.459
 app that could spy and rip off 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.140
 Yes, fraudulent apps are just one 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.790
 problem if a big wants that 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.250
 I admit an even bigger problem 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.349
 But almost apps are actually 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.599
 look serious and in the background too 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.970
 spying on data and for example 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.860
 load data to the server transferred from 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.720
 operator without asking the best 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.019
 example is the widespread 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.030
 very popular app whatsapp with the man 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.650
 can exchange messages for free 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.950
 Millions of people used whatsapp 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.180
 but in the background there are the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.269
 contact data read out of the device 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.400
 and on the server of the operator 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.980
 Transfer and without a demand 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.900
 very ugly thing about it 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.269
 very carefully control what 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.739
 their apps are allowed and allowed 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.299
 you can do that in the iphone 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.250
 example in the settings 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.980
 you can also control it 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.049
 what the individual apps are allowed to do that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.670
 you can turn it on and off like this one in here 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.239
 But this is not quite the case with other devices 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.920
 that's how easy it is in android phones 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.079
 harder here you can get an app 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.680
 either just allow everything or everything 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.709
 to forbid 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.079
 a completely inadequate protection therefore 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.820
 I do not recommend app for free 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.250
 Available app for android smartphones 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.170
 to control other apps 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.060
 can you have app there first 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.850
 can be installed very easily 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.500
 Check which apps are accessing 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.720
 sensitive areas or data 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.319
 want to get about to the contacts 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.930
 so every single app can be comfortable 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.780
 to be controlled 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.909
 whether iphone android blackberry or 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.890
 windows smartphone of smartphones 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.379
 used should be prudent today 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.159
 and no longer every app without hesitation 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.200
 to install 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.599
 It is becoming more and more important before 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.900
 Inform which apps you have installed 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.609
 and uses more info and also left 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.349
 directly to click you find under 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.639
 current hour worth a visit 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.639
 so as always
