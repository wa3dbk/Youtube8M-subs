00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.000 
for devices alright and eventually if it
doesn't<00:04:22.990> quite<00:04:23.080> work<00:04:23.349> out<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.590> first<00:04:23.830> time

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
doesn't quite work out the first time

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.740 
doesn't quite work out the first time
hold<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.760> button<00:04:25.150> turn<00:04:25.539> it

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
hold the button turn it

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.010 
hold the button turn it
off<00:04:25.980> and<00:04:26.980> hold<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.280> button<00:04:27.400> turn<00:04:27.670> it<00:04:27.700> back<00:04:27.940> on

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
off and hold the button turn it back on

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.630 
off and hold the button turn it back on
eventually<00:04:29.020> it's<00:04:29.230> going<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.410> pair<00:04:29.650> up<00:04:29.830> now<00:04:30.430> if

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
eventually it's going to pair up now if

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.160 
eventually it's going to pair up now if
you<00:04:30.790> have<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.090> paired<00:04:31.330> with<00:04:31.480> other<00:04:31.750> devices

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
you have it paired with other devices

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.630 
you have it paired with other devices
sometimes<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.950> might<00:04:33.100> take<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.340> little<00:04:33.520> bit

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
sometimes it might take a little bit

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.160 
sometimes it might take a little bit
before<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.000> connects<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.390> another<00:04:34.510> device<00:04:35.140> you

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
before it connects to another device you

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.780 
before it connects to another device you
just<00:04:35.350> got<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.740> work<00:04:35.860> with<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:36.220> turn<00:04:36.340> off<00:04:36.580> turn

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
just got to work with it turn off turn

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.790 
just got to work with it turn off turn
it<00:04:36.850> back<00:04:37.060> on<00:04:37.090> but<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.110> believe<00:04:38.410> it's<00:04:38.590> pretty

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
it back on but I believe it's pretty

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.820 
it back on but I believe it's pretty
typical<00:04:39.040> with<00:04:39.280> most<00:04:39.720> bluetooth<00:04:40.720> devices<00:04:41.050> then

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
typical with most bluetooth devices then

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.040 
typical with most bluetooth devices then
of<00:04:42.010> course<00:04:42.280> your<00:04:42.490> NFC<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:43.570> know<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.720> do<00:04:43.900> the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
of course your NFC you know you do the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.700 
of course your NFC you know you do the
tap<00:04:44.260> you<00:04:44.470> put<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.740> on<00:04:44.860> here<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.160> let<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:46.710> catch

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
tap you put it on here and let it catch

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.860 
tap you put it on here and let it catch
itself<00:04:48.070> but<00:04:48.340> I'm<00:04:48.580> not<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.880> big<00:04:49.120> fan<00:04:49.390> I<00:04:49.420> just<00:04:49.720> like

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
itself but I'm not a big fan I just like

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.170 
itself but I'm not a big fan I just like
to<00:04:49.990> bluetooth<00:04:50.410> everything<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.580> for<00:04:52.120> the

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
to bluetooth everything so for the

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.810 
to bluetooth everything so for the
moment<00:04:52.540> but<00:04:53.530> that's<00:04:53.680> pretty<00:04:53.980> much<00:04:54.190> how<00:04:54.430> that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
moment but that's pretty much how that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.610 
moment but that's pretty much how that
operates<00:04:55.000> I'm<00:04:55.840> going<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.140> go<00:04:56.230> ahead<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.500> pull

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
just enjoy it and so you go down to the

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.810 
just enjoy it and so you go down to the
link<00:06:30.669> below<00:06:30.820> and<00:06:31.180> get<00:06:31.419> yourself<00:06:31.900> one<00:06:32.080> of<00:06:32.140> these

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
link below and get yourself one of these
