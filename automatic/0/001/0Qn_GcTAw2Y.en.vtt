innovator I would see and what I didn't

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.560 
innovator I would see and what I didn't
realize<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:20.189> wave<00:00:20.490> riding<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.300> was

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
realize was the wave riding that I was

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.420 
realize was the wave riding that I was

surfing<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> best<00:00:29.939> wave<00:00:30.269> ride<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
surfing that was the best wave ride that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.830 
surfing that was the best wave ride that
was<00:00:31.619> taking<00:00:31.949> place<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> planet<00:00:32.969> debatably

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.479 
was taking place on the planet debatably
and<00:00:35.210> I'd<00:00:36.210> look<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.719> magazines<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.160> wouldn't

through<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.399> equipment<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:48.989> switch

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
through this equipment it would switch

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.160 
through this equipment it would switch
from<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:50.039> rail<00:00:50.250> over<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> other<00:00:51.300> board

from one rail over to the other board

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.490 
from one rail over to the other board
was<00:00:52.350> very<00:00:52.559> short<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:54.629> amount<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> area<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
was very short the amount of area it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.910 
was very short the amount of area it
could<00:00:55.829> cover<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.550> also<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> tight<00:00:58.649> radius

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
could cover but also the tight radius

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.970 
could cover but also the tight radius
and<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.809> proximity<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> board's

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

positioning and maneuvering within the
pocket<00:01:04.519> nobody<00:01:05.519> saw<00:01:05.729> me<00:01:05.760> surfing<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
pocket nobody saw me surfing like that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.420 
pocket nobody saw me surfing like that
it<00:01:06.630> didn't<00:01:06.810> exist<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.409> invented<00:01:08.010> through

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it didn't exist it was invented through

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.719 
it didn't exist it was invented through
this<00:01:08.760> list<00:01:09.060> fish<00:01:09.770> but<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> whole

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
this list fish but really that whole

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.460 
this list fish but really that whole
relationship<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.510> Stevie<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.080> came<00:01:13.260> from

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
relationship with Stevie just came from

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.870 
relationship with Stevie just came from
dream<00:01:14.630> at<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> same<00:01:15.930> time<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.610> same<00:01:17.640> place

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
dream at the same time in the same place

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.810 
dream at the same time in the same place
and<00:01:18.560> then<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> same<00:01:20.189> direction<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and then going in the same direction and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
and then going in the same direction and
that<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> same<00:01:22.049> direction<00:01:22.110> wasn't

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that going in the same direction wasn't

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
that going in the same direction wasn't
so<00:01:22.860> much<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> conscious<00:01:23.460> effort<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so much a conscious effort it was just a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.569 
so much a conscious effort it was just a
natural<00:01:24.570> job

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.830 

so<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.759> for<00:01:29.000> Finn<00:01:29.409> was<00:01:30.409> just<00:01:30.799> a<00:01:30.979> variation<00:01:31.840> not

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
so the for Finn was just a variation not

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.469 
so the for Finn was just a variation not
a<00:01:32.899> departure<00:01:33.320> born<00:01:34.189> out<00:01:34.369> of<00:01:34.399> this<00:01:34.670> keel<00:01:35.000> this

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
a departure born out of this keel this

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.679 
a departure born out of this keel this
low<00:01:35.719> aspect<00:01:36.079> ratio<00:01:36.320> fan<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.610> was<00:01:37.820> wondering

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
low aspect ratio fan and I was wondering

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.690 
low aspect ratio fan and I was wondering
what<00:01:38.929> might<00:01:39.170> be<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.350> way<00:01:39.850> that<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:41.270> could

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
what might be a way that you could

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.249 
what might be a way that you could
retain<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.149> positive<00:01:44.600> attributes<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.079> that

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
retain the positive attributes of that

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.029 
retain the positive attributes of that
low<00:01:45.409> aspect<00:01:45.679> ratio<00:01:45.890> keel<00:01:47.649> but<00:01:48.649> gain<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
low aspect ratio keel but gain the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.889 
low aspect ratio keel but gain the
advantage<00:01:49.549> of<00:01:49.819> those<00:01:50.149> high<00:01:50.420> aspect<00:01:50.750> ratio

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
advantage of those high aspect ratio

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.410 
advantage of those high aspect ratio
fins<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:52.759> took<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.350> keel<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.420> just

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
fins so I took this keel and just

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.620 
fins so I took this keel and just
plotted<00:01:56.929> out<00:01:58.599> down<00:01:59.599> along<00:01:59.929> the<00:02:00.140> fin<00:02:00.799> itself

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
plotted out down along the fin itself

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.830 
plotted out down along the fin itself
dividing<00:02:02.630> up<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.899> surface<00:02:03.110> area<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.189> just

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
dividing up the surface area and just

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.749 
dividing up the surface area and just
separated<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.899> fins<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.399> lot<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.579> the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
separated the fins and a lot of the

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.249 
separated the fins and a lot of the
encouragement<00:02:08.149> on<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.569> kind<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.810> thing<00:02:08.899> came

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
encouragement on that kind of thing came

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.100 
encouragement on that kind of thing came
from<00:02:09.289> green<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:11.360> was<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.599> was<00:02:11.690> like<00:02:11.720> being

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
from green and it was it was like being

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.780 
from green and it was it was like being
with<00:02:12.260> Skippy<00:02:12.530> today<00:02:12.769> you<00:02:12.829> know<00:02:13.099> he's<00:02:13.280> like<00:02:13.400> I

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
with Skippy today you know he's like I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.650 
with Skippy today you know he's like I
don't<00:02:14.209> know

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
don't know

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.110 
don't know
except<00:02:15.530> green<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.890> was<00:02:15.950> even<00:02:16.220> more<00:02:16.250> like<00:02:16.549> no

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
except green it was even more like no

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.550 
except green it was even more like no
you<00:02:17.180> should<00:02:17.450> try<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.959> should<00:02:18.140> pursue<00:02:18.319> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
you should try that you should pursue it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.170
