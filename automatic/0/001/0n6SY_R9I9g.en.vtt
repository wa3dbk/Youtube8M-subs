00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 I was looking until I was 6 years old 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 and lost sight. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 When I told people that I was dreaming of becoming a professional player, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 they laughed at me and said it was impossible, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 that a blind player play football. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 But I've always followed the World Cup 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 and I always wanted to play for her. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 So the FIFA World Cup Trophy means a lot to me. 9 00: 00: 37.00 -&gt; 00: 00: 40.00 Children see the captain of a squad that raises that cup 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 and dream that one day 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 they too can raise such an important trophy. 12 00: 00: 51.00 -&gt; 00: 00: 52.00 Difficulties of life 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 do not come out to stop you from doing things ... but to learn to overcome them. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 So I decided to train 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 and develop my soccer skills. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 I would try to all that I could do it 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 and I would turn my dream into reality. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 So when I discovered football for the blind 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 it seemed to me that they offered me a second chance 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 They are all blind, 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 but some may see a little. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 So eye covers are a way to make sure everyone does not see it at all. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Topi made this noise, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 so they can be guided and know where the ball is. 25 00: 01: 42.00 -&gt; 00: 1: 52.00 I was fortunate to be the champion of the national team 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 and the world's best player was announced. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 It was my dream that made me a reality. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 I have caught many friends in sports, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 to memories that will last forever 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 will be connected with the friendships I have made over the years. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 That's no price. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 The trophy is important to us all because 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 even though everyone has seen it 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 just the world champions 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 and heads of states can touch the trophy. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 So, when Coca-Cola confirmed it would bring us 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 the true trophy of the FIFA World Cup in our training center 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 we were not trusted. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 It was a big surprise to me, 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 but I knew it was the real trophy, 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 because he was so beautiful when I touched it. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 There is a surprise, put your hand here. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 What the hell is that? 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 It's the World Cup Trophy! 45 00: 02: 50,00 -&gt; 00: 2: 51,00 I can not believe it! 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Are you sure? 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Absolutely! 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Grasp!
