use<00:01:04.860> too<00:01:04.890> much<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.210> hair<00:01:06.420> will

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
use too much because then your hair will

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.929 
use too much because then your hair will
start<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.289> stiff<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.219> little<00:01:08.609> bit<00:01:08.759> goes

start to get stiff so a little bit goes

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.660 
start to get stiff so a little bit goes
a<00:01:09.149> very<00:01:09.179> long<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.799> something<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.310> use

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
a very long way this is something I use

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.539

to suggest using a really good

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.440 
to suggest using a really good
clarifying<00:01:16.710> shampoo<00:01:17.609> when<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.060> using<00:01:18.270> a

clarifying shampoo when you're using a
product<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.319> it<00:01:19.679> can<00:01:19.950> start

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
product like this because it can start

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.760 
product like this because it can start
to<00:01:20.490> build<00:01:20.789> up<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.659> only<00:01:21.810> see<00:01:22.079> buildup<00:01:22.560> if

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to build up you only see buildup if

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.819 
to build up you only see buildup if
you're<00:01:23.100> using<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.850> quite<00:01:24.149> excessively<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
you're using it quite excessively so

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.160 
you're using it quite excessively so
that's<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.579> happens<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:27.149> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.840> it's
