00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.550
 we go camping 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.670
 it was a lovely weekend and that I 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.269
 I was very excited because I was going to go 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.269
 camps 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.660
 sure you can not wait 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.110
 and fell 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.010
 or not 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:52.329
 what's the matter with rossi 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:57.699
 it's not true that I either 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:00.750
 here you are where is it fell to a 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.750
 technical paradita 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.190
 we are running again if there is 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 get back on the road though thinking it 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.100
 Well, what's the matter, darling, I think I'm going to 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.100
 take advantage of me 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.000
 and it 's a sign of elk crossing in 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.500
 these forests there are many moose and so the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 drivers know they have to have 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.950
 watch out 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.740
 no change 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.140
 well do not make many illusions that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.070
 me why not because elk are 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 very shy 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.780
 Here I find it a little weird that a 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.780
 so big animal could be so shy 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.900
 hello friends welcome to the camp 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.860
 joke 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.860
 I am pierre and your year here you will be able 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.099
 live a lot of adventures caio you can 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.410
 play also swim and even climb 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.800
 a mountain that you would like to do 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.800
 First 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.560
 I think it's going to be a bit 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.439
 complicated elk do not approach the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.400
 people unless we've seen one in 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.850
 the camp 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.010
 d 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.010
 what do you think if we lend a hand 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.879
 efe 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.190
 you 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.220
 or in work that I 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.930
 you're going to get in there can you see out and hand 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.720
 what's wrong, cielito? 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.830
 come, it's great 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.140
 swimming through the water are little fish that 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.200
 there are me they are more afraid they 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.900
 of you that you of them here I was not 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.819
 very sure of wanting to swim 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.140
 very deep 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.140
 it is not deep 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.110
 you will not want to splash me 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.270
 as soon as south kay got into the water 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.270
 he lost his fear 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.500
 and without realizing it came time to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:58.180
 dined they wanted to smell 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.180
 I could eat a horse 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.790
 pushups I would eat an elk 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.800
 cold 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.800
 not a squirrel outside school 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.010
 d 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.130
 do not feed the wild animals 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.060
 fell because they have to look for their 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.060
 food in the forest 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.860
 what are you going to do this afternoon we're going to 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.860
 go climbing 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.490
 that's what you're doing is still very 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.490
 all right 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.490
 and 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.590
 you are well fell he got scared a lot 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.590
 when he slipped but wanted to prove to 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.610
 dad how brave was we almost have 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.610
 come look 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.259
 and we got it 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.259
 I'm very proud of you 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.620
 I suppose climbing is exhausting 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:28.289
 come guys to bed 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:28.289
 in the caravan everything is ready 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.989
 It will be fun to sleep outdoors 

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:37.299
 good as you want here I was 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:40.259
 delighted to sleep in the hammock in the 

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:40.259
 arms of his father 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.480
 good night happy dreams 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:13.740
 Caius was impressed with the moose 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.740
 I've never seen such a big animal 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.289
 do not go 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:40.169
 and we have to be very quiet 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.169
 remember they are very shy 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.250
 good 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.310
 it's disgusting 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.310
 plus 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.280
 A) Yes 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.749
 it seemed very funny to him that a 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:04.939
 such a large animal could be scared of 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:04.939
 a girl as tiny as rossi
