00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.670
 colombia lives the psoe for the 'opt-out' comes doing I bring the one moved by 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.190
 about business in the region 1 point 1 point 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.519
 p in this version is going to be faster although it secured in new functions 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.769
 for 100 cinemas I recommend you always have and updated because it is the 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.880
 application of the gel boy that we will always occupy 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.839
 so the only thing I have to do is get into Syria 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.029
 wanted to wait for him to load 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.270
 the deployment golovín cat 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.050
 and all that 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.760
 let's see what this menu will appear 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.170
 who says that allen 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.400
 mckellen 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.850
 a new version 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.000
 or the one that is a story so it will veto this button that says buy it 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.930
 complicated of 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.269
 ccoo pv full could be said in Spanish 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.170
 tucupita update let's confirm 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 We were saying yesterday that it's going to start 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.810
 update everything without variants to the recital tired of being fed up again 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.660
 say as if well 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.180
 clay mud 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 good update better said 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.660
 tinos worse 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.420
 Kent is minimal 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420
 by the way 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.160
 lincoln 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.020
 with him 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.360
 never ends nacho canos will ask for a wall explained only state 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540
 it is practically ending 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.410
 maybe you and it will take them less seconds later 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.410
 at the moment the packages that have 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.400
 The mind is already running out, it is already installing and has downloaded everything 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.020
 logically they quote me internet to give you to do this 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250
 is very close 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.849
 is a couple of errors but they are not relevant 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.159
 that unites us 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.159
 let it finish I thought I was going to be so moronic 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.809
 I think it's over 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.529
 we are making progress 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.409
 béjar to make his the holding back 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.729
 as not to have not appeared a 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.019
 button that will tell us how is all this inc 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.659
 let's follow the steps 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.179
 we have a second 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.469
 that I know is our 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.139
 and we squeeze it 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.139
 2 did not start collecting reset our device 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.919
 it's already going 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.049
 and is that prove 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.930
 It continues like this is faster and seen many videos and does not make it faster 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.129
 percent and then 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.069
 recognize that these from version 1 point 1 point 1 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.719
 my wish our 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.829
 this though 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.839
 and it's loading 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.709
 and powers I hope it ends up loading domes tortilla we're in 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.299
 1 point 1 point yet 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.479
 they finished him 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.479
 until beginnings although 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:59.149
 As you can see, it is already in Spanish and another thing that comes in percent when installing 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:01.999
 These Syria Estepona automatically in Spanish 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:07.689
 so as you see now says Syria sections changes 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.749
 handle opus car 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.749
 in fact they appear to start though 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.569
 well here is updating the new 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.409
 perrando 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.409
 data 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.879
 I had only seen it myself 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.680
 with crudeness of boston florentín 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.400
 zuma some mistakes 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.090
 were 20 volodin data appears 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.719
 recharging incomplete data by price but I got over it 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.669
 and how can you see here below says 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.669
 Syria 1 point 1 point to 1 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.930
 so now he presides over Spanish and in the most recent version here I 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.159
 I recommend police received to have it 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.490
 in your language and in 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.970
 per cent the most recent version that is faster so I am for the 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.330
 'opt-out' to say in danger their offspring of the required part 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.749
 dem thumb up that down 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:07.019
 I see favorites comment i enjoy alex
