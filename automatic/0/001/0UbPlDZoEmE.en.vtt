00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
if you lift up these fingers it's almost

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.620 
if you lift up these fingers it's almost
as<00:01:53.650> if<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:54.009> thumb<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:55.000> pinky<00:01:55.450> are

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630

as if the thumb and the pinky are
looking<00:01:55.960> at<00:01:56.110> each<00:01:56.140> other<00:01:56.530> through<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.979> bow

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
looking at each other through the bow

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.469 
looking at each other through the bow
remember<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.250> middle<00:02:00.520> finger<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.060> covering

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
remember the middle finger is covering

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.199 
remember the middle finger is covering
the<00:02:01.630> thumb

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.089 

if<00:02:08.599> you<00:02:08.750> look<00:02:08.929> at<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.849> in<00:02:10.849> this<00:02:11.060> angle<00:02:12.099> you

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
if you look at it in this angle you

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.140 
if you look at it in this angle you
could<00:02:13.220> see<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> nice<00:02:13.760> round<00:02:14.269> opening<00:02:14.989> in<00:02:15.140> there

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
could see a nice round opening in there

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.839 
could see a nice round opening in there
and<00:02:17.150> remember<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.829> violin<00:02:19.250> holds<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
and remember that the violin holds the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.780 
and remember that the violin holds the
bow<00:02:20.000> up<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:21.799> you<00:02:21.890> don't<00:02:22.040> need<00:02:22.159> to<00:02:22.340> hold<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.640> bow

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
bow up so you don't need to hold the bow

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.550 
bow up so you don't need to hold the bow
very<00:02:23.150> hard<00:02:23.569> just<00:02:24.170> enough<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.709> give<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:26.560> some

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
very hard just enough to give it some

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:37.929 
very hard just enough to give it some
guidance<00:02:32.019> one<00:02:33.019> last<00:02:33.290> look<00:02:34.209> I'm<00:02:35.209> corner<00:02:36.939> lop
