00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello and a warm welcome here 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.370
 to this new guide to success 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.700
 Steering kite over the canton of Vaud 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.950
 bazaar of the four winds here rises 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.949
 news.de this you only have in the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.570
 go carton far and the jumping kassel 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.550
 make spex lab 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.800
 I actually have spex lab 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.900
 already written a little guide 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.640
 but is it also a little video 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.829
 guide made but I've got myself 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.960
 now hey thought of the celebration of the 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.030
 Bazaar of the four winds we do directly 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.969
 again a new run by this spex lab 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.670
 so that you see we come through it and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.800
 where do you have to go to finally this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.809
 to get success in 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.640
 principle, this coffee break is relative 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.019
 Simple one activates a control desk 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.600
 this spawn here 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.920
 transparent platforms and these 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.199
 disappear after a short time 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.969
 again that means the whole thing is here 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.280
 bit on speed 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.960
 it will be particularly interesting from station 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.339
 2 there we are right now 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 because here you have to this one 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.149
 jump down do something 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 is a bit more demanding and too 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.980
 you have two in between 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.930
 jumps where you are relatively fast 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.920
 would have to move through this 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.930
 platform here where i am right now 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.300
 So on top of that, I'm over it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 this solid piece of land and this 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.870
 Mainland costs a bit of time there 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.580
 you have to stick to it for that 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.990
 in a by creating currently 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.420
 However, the lab packs so well again 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.840
 visited that one also a short phase 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.300
 can omit it 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.560
 Did you want it once you down with 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.060
 a jump or do not be fast 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 enough and the platform disappear 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.040
 then you can just start over 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 start on the platform 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.490
 he wants to be last 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.430
 namely falls further and chooses this 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.150
 asked her where you revive yourselves 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.410
 volt on what level and so that there 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.700
 simply solved again that means she will 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.710
 always best the highest you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.120
 and then you have 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.980
 a good chance to get through 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.020
 and there are between by smaller ones 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.250
 sections there are larger again 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.910
 the one at the last 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.800
 you have to do a little bit of platform 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.570
 be careful there it is left around 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.370
 and they are a bit hard too 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 recognize 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.850
 if we are so easy 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.700
 that can be broken is a bit 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.740
 bad, that's because of the lava 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.900
 that you see them so bad 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.640
 and yes you are on top of that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.010
 platform arrived you still have to 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.600
 So small event enable virtually since 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.890
 her through with the kram fit in yet 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.140
 small event which is already done 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.330
 which one would have to do then 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.830
 finally to android to come to it 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.380
 I wanted to hold the switch as I did 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.360
 do that and activate the event 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.460
 at t williams and waiting at the very end 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.710
 then on you a reward is rest 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.340
 And last but not least, this successful steering kite 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.840
 over the cardon forest and yes that was it 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.410
 not so far here with this little one 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.850
 Video 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.540
 I hope it has helped you so far 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.220
 if you had problems and covers 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.380
