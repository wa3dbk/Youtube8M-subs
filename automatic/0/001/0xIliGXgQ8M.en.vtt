you're dining with Chinese stuff to kind
of<00:00:20.910> put<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.150> through<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.390> different<00:00:22.259> ranges<00:00:22.589> of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
of put you through a different ranges of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.790 
of put you through a different ranges of
motion<00:00:23.720> either<00:00:24.720> way<00:00:24.839> through<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.109> silk<00:00:25.349> pattern

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
motion either way through a silk pattern

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.169 
motion either way through a silk pattern
like<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.009> said<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.339> know<00:00:26.429> movement<00:00:27.119> of

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
like I said like you know movement of

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.550 
like I said like you know movement of
the<00:00:27.210> hips<00:00:28.339> arm<00:00:29.339> circles<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.449> nice<00:00:30.660> wings<00:00:30.960> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the hips arm circles like nice wings so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.010 
the hips arm circles like nice wings so
basically<00:00:32.400> kind<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.850> lot<00:00:33.030> running

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
basically kind of like a lot running

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:46.450 
basically kind of like a lot running
drills<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.739> anything<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.070> actually<00:00:35.250> evolved

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.680 

walking<00:00:47.460> lunges<00:00:47.789> local<00:00:48.059> into<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.359> twist

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
walking lunges local into the twist

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.069 
walking lunges local into the twist
though<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.559> Heidi<00:00:50.309> skips<00:00:50.780> lateral<00:00:51.780> skips

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
though I need Heidi skips lateral skips

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.220 
though I need Heidi skips lateral skips
it's<00:00:52.379> different<00:00:53.010> types<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.309> movement

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
it's different types of movement

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.990 
it's different types of movement
basically<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.679> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.000> greater

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
basically a little bit you know greater

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.569 
basically a little bit you know greater
of<00:00:57.120> intensity<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.340> flip<00:00:59.340> phone<00:00:59.519> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.790 
of intensity kind of a flip phone a
little<00:00:59.760> bit<00:00:59.850> faster<00:01:00.469> start<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:01.589> the<00:01:01.679> old

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
little bit faster start from the old

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.259 
little bit faster start from the old

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
kind of trigger nervous system what you

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.060 
kind of trigger nervous system what you
always<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.629> start<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.410> know<00:01:04.500> they're

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
always want to start you know they're

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.650 
always want to start you know they're
kind<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> cool<00:01:05.460> work<00:01:05.700> away<00:01:05.880> too<00:01:05.940> warm<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.330> hot

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
kind of cool work away too warm and hot

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.510 
kind of cool work away too warm and hot
and<00:01:06.870> then<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.080> say<00:01:07.230> and<00:01:07.380> hot<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.830> always<00:01:08.400> want

and then I say and hot you always want

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.350 
and then I say and hot you always want
to<00:01:08.580> tell<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> something<00:01:08.910> really<00:01:09.120> kind<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to tell you something really kind of

to tell you something really kind of
activates<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.870> nervous<00:01:10.110> system<00:01:10.440> kind<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.710> get

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
activates the nervous system kind of get

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.230 
activates the nervous system kind of get
the<00:01:10.920> impulse<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.030> brain<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the impulse is going from the brain to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.520 
the impulse is going from the brain to
the<00:01:12.330> muscles<00:01:12.390> muscles<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> brain

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the muscles muscles back to the brain

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.990 
the muscles muscles back to the brain
take<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
take you

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.070 
take you
baba<00:01:17.000> research<00:01:17.300> is<00:01:17.420> kind<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.660> shown<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:18.020> you

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
baba research is kind of shown if you

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.930 
baba research is kind of shown if you
kind<00:01:18.230> of<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.470> new<00:01:18.800> your<00:01:18.950> static<00:01:19.250> community

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
kind of a new your static community

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.890 
kind of a new your static community
actually<00:01:20.090> do<00:01:20.330> is<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.510> have<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.690> kind<00:01:20.870> of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
actually do is you have to kind of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.600 
actually do is you have to kind of
stretch<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.290> ligaments<00:01:21.650> out<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.490> actually

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
stretch the ligaments out and actually

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.250 
stretch the ligaments out and actually
don't<00:01:22.940> return<00:01:23.300> their<00:01:23.570> last<00:01:23.750> DC<00:01:23.990> doesn't

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
don't return their last DC doesn't

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.460 
don't return their last DC doesn't
return<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.830> don't<00:01:25.280> return<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:25.760> actually<00:01:26.470> who's

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
return I don't return you actually who's

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.380 
return I don't return you actually who's
exposed<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:27.980> you<00:01:28.130> lose<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.310> strength<00:01:28.880> and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
exposed to this you lose a strength and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.690 
exposed to this you lose a strength and
just<00:01:29.840> uh<00:01:30.130> increase<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.250> rate<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.400> injury

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
just uh increase the rate of injury

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.910 
just uh increase the rate of injury
usually<00:01:32.570> afterwards<00:01:33.410> you<00:01:33.620> know<00:01:33.650> when<00:01:33.830> you

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
usually afterwards you know when you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.010 
usually afterwards you know when you
have<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.370> know<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.610> long<00:01:34.940> time<00:01:35.390> period<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:35.870> like

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
have you know a long time period so like

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.390 
have you know a long time period so like
you<00:01:36.200> don't<00:01:36.230> stretch<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.950> Monday<00:01:37.190> next

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
you don't stretch it a Monday next

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.710 
you don't stretch it a Monday next
