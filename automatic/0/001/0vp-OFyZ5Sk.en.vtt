 I have mentioned our friends that 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.679
 Fresnillo has a rich history about 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.900
 all in many traditions and customs 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.900
 and then I come here with the historian 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.129

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.230

 Well, a rich history of fresnillo 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.410
 notice that it is something that makes us proud 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.760
 for everything that has bequeathed us 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.399
 act as of September 2, 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.269
 1,554 we have made the indication 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:42.499
 in a reiterative way that there are 450 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:45.740
 years of life but they are 450 years of 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:48.470
 history of a lot of history 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.780
 story that also goes hand in hand with 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.000
 what has been its main activity the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.170
 mining so it is that the hill of 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.180
 proaño was discovered in 1552 two years 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.550
 before this guy was named 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.560
 paraje precisely by diego hernández 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.080
 of proaño that although it was a question 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.750
 merely circumstantial of any 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.900
 way there is born what is mining 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.630
 for fresnillo and for the world 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.090
 the name fresnillo I imagine it is 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.200
 for the ash that is a next tree 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.460
 which is a very beautiful story very 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.400
 nice for all three kids is 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.979
 very symbolic it turns out that this expedition 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.810
 that came out of zacatecas the first of 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.280
 September of 1,554 heading north 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.020
 they came to this place he had no name 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.420
 had already discovered the hill of 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.619
 proaño and on September 2 in the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.160
 first hours when the 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.770
 expeditionaries have already been raised in 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.380
 start the march towards the north 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.360
 they found that there was a need to give 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.270
 a name to this place 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.570
 and they observed a swamp with great 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.040
 number of water eyes and his name 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.220
 comes from there water eyes of the fresnillo 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.479
 in an ash and that will be different to all 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.390
 that of the trees that existed here did not 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.850
 there were many fresh was the difference 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.459
