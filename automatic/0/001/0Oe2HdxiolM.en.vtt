tutorial this is to show you how to do a
wood<00:00:07.459> graining<00:00:07.759> technique<00:00:08.390> using<00:00:08.960> paint

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:09.259

wood graining technique using paint
glaze

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
glaze

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.459 
glaze
these<00:00:10.580> are<00:00:10.910> styrofoam<00:00:11.690> coolers<00:00:12.139> that<00:00:12.379> were

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
these are styrofoam coolers that were

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.190 
these are styrofoam coolers that were
cut<00:00:12.740> in<00:00:12.860> half<00:00:13.129> too<00:00:13.700> and<00:00:14.030> then<00:00:14.360> painted<00:00:14.990> using

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
cut in half too and then painted using

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.410 
cut in half too and then painted using
this<00:00:15.469> technique<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.550> hopefully<00:00:17.000> make<00:00:17.150> it<00:00:17.180> look

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
this technique to hopefully make it look

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.760 
this technique to hopefully make it look
like<00:00:17.540> it<00:00:17.660> was<00:00:17.780> upturned<00:00:18.050> graves<00:00:18.410> in<00:00:18.680> my

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
like it was upturned graves in my

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
like it was upturned graves in my
graveyard<00:00:19.510> but<00:00:20.510> it's<00:00:20.660> really<00:00:20.930> easy<00:00:21.080> and

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
graveyard but it's really easy and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:30.310 
graveyard but it's really easy and
actually<00:00:22.790> quite<00:00:23.180> realistic<00:00:28.990> first<00:00:29.990> thing<00:00:30.200> you

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
actually quite realistic first thing you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.799 
actually quite realistic first thing you
do<00:00:30.500> is<00:00:30.740> paint<00:00:31.070> whatever<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:31.820> need<00:00:32.119> with<00:00:32.660> this

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
do is paint whatever you need with this

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.569 
do is paint whatever you need with this
technique<00:00:33.289> a<00:00:33.620> good<00:00:34.550> medium<00:00:35.269> wood-based<00:00:36.109> tone

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
technique a good medium wood-based tone

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.979 
technique a good medium wood-based tone
wanted<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.730> have<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.149> would<00:00:38.420> look<00:00:38.629> like<00:00:38.839> very

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
wanted to have this would look like very

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.930 
wanted to have this would look like very
old<00:00:39.140> wood<00:00:39.679> that's<00:00:39.949> how<00:00:40.070> come<00:00:40.249> it's<00:00:40.429> got<00:00:40.820> that

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
old wood that's how come it's got that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.669 
old wood that's how come it's got that
dull<00:00:41.210> color<00:00:41.539> but<00:00:41.839> if<00:00:41.899> you<00:00:42.019> want<00:00:42.199> to<00:00:42.260> make<00:00:42.530> it

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
dull color but if you want to make it

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.310 
dull color but if you want to make it
look<00:00:42.800> like<00:00:42.980> new<00:00:43.219> wood<00:00:43.460> use<00:00:43.699> bright<00:00:44.030> color<00:00:44.320> but

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
look like new wood use bright color but

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.509 
look like new wood use bright color but
anyway<00:00:45.530> use<00:00:45.710> for<00:00:46.100> parts<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.850> glaze<00:00:47.690> -<00:00:48.649> one<00:00:48.949> part

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
anyway use for parts of glaze - one part

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.989 
anyway use for parts of glaze - one part
of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.999> same<00:00:50.269> paint<00:00:50.659> and<00:00:51.339> then<00:00:52.339> add<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.789> couple

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
of the same paint and then add a couple

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.720 
of the same paint and then add a couple
of<00:00:53.359> globs<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.899> black<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.679> darken<00:00:55.129> up<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.280> shade

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
of globs of black to darken up the shade

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.630 
of globs of black to darken up the shade
mix<00:00:56.719> it<00:00:56.870> up<00:00:56.960> pretty<00:00:57.170> good<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:57.769> then<00:00:58.039> check<00:00:58.460> to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
mix it up pretty good and then check to

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.059 
mix it up pretty good and then check to
see<00:00:58.909> that<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.569> that<00:00:59.929> is<00:01:00.079> indeed<00:01:00.260> dark<00:01:00.769> enough

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
see that that that is indeed dark enough

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:10.380 
see that that that is indeed dark enough
for<00:01:01.399> your<00:01:01.729> technique

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.120 

now<00:01:11.390> take<00:01:11.659> that<00:01:11.689> glaze<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.500> put<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.740> nice

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
now take that glaze and put a nice

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.730 
now take that glaze and put a nice
smooth<00:01:13.670> coat<00:01:14.000> on<00:01:14.240> there<00:01:14.539> and<00:01:14.780> then<00:01:15.200> using<00:01:15.619> a

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
smooth coat on there and then using a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.910 
smooth coat on there and then using a
stiff<00:01:16.219> brush<00:01:16.700> kind<00:01:17.359> of<00:01:17.509> scrape<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.380> down<00:01:18.409> so

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
stiff brush kind of scrape it down so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.609 
stiff brush kind of scrape it down so
you<00:01:18.979> leave<00:01:19.369> these<00:01:19.780> striations<00:01:20.780> behind<00:01:21.319> so<00:01:21.560> you

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
you leave these striations behind so you

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.260 
you leave these striations behind so you
can<00:01:21.740> see<00:01:21.859> the<00:01:21.979> base<00:01:22.250> color<00:01:22.670> showing<00:01:23.119> through

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
can see the base color showing through

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.630 
can see the base color showing through
and<00:01:23.840> let<00:01:24.380> dry

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.999 

make<00:01:28.640> another<00:01:28.969> glaze<00:01:29.390> even<00:01:29.990> darker<00:01:30.469> kind<00:01:30.799> of<00:01:30.920> a

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
make another glaze even darker kind of a

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.340 
make another glaze even darker kind of a
lot<00:01:31.189> darker<00:01:31.490> put<00:01:32.119> it<00:01:32.209> on<00:01:32.270> another<00:01:32.659> nice<00:01:32.959> even

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
lot darker put it on another nice even

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.990 
lot darker put it on another nice even
coat<00:01:33.560> now<00:01:34.189> you're<00:01:34.340> going<00:01:34.459> to<00:01:34.520> use<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.789> wood

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
coat now you're going to use the wood

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.959 
coat now you're going to use the wood
graining<00:01:35.270> tool<00:01:35.569> and<00:01:35.899> in<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.500> nice<00:01:36.740> slow<00:01:37.100> rocking

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
graining tool and in a nice slow rocking

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.870 
graining tool and in a nice slow rocking
back<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.270> forth<00:01:38.780> motion<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:40.340> leave<00:01:40.729> behind

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
back and forth motion you leave behind

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.690 
back and forth motion you leave behind
these<00:01:41.239> wood<00:01:41.450> grains<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.860> change<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:43.579> up

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
these wood grains and and change it up

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.949 
these wood grains and and change it up
you<00:01:43.819> don't<00:01:43.970> want<00:01:44.149> to<00:01:44.239> have<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.509> look<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.780> same

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
you don't want to have it look the same

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.050 
you don't want to have it look the same
so<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:45.259> go<00:01:45.709> really<00:01:46.009> far<00:01:46.310> with<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.579> brush<00:01:46.819> or

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
so I go really far with the brush or

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:57.010 
so I go really far with the brush or
really<00:01:47.360> subtle<00:01:54.789> if<00:01:55.789> you<00:01:56.060> want<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.420> separate

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
really subtle if you want to separate

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.949 
really subtle if you want to separate
that<00:01:57.739> wood<00:01:58.099> graining<00:01:58.429> into<00:01:58.819> planks<00:01:59.450> just<00:01:59.509> use

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
that wood graining into planks just use

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.229 
that wood graining into planks just use
flat<00:02:00.319> black<00:02:00.619> paint<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.099> a<00:02:01.340> really<00:02:01.670> thin<00:02:01.939> line

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
flat black paint and a really thin line

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:10.180 
flat black paint and a really thin line
and<00:02:07.209> you're<00:02:08.209> done<00:02:08.479> it's<00:02:08.869> quite<00:02:09.649> easy

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
and you're done it's quite easy

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.640 
and you're done it's quite easy
I<00:02:10.369> didn't<00:02:10.940> clarify<00:02:11.269> but<00:02:11.480> make<00:02:11.720> sure<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:12.290> you

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
I didn't clarify but make sure that you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.220 
I didn't clarify but make sure that you
let<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.730> dry<00:02:14.239> in<00:02:14.420> between<00:02:14.450> each<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.930> these

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
let this dry in between each of these

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.800 
let this dry in between each of these
steps<00:02:15.680> but<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.730> paint<00:02:17.000> your<00:02:17.120> base<00:02:17.239> color<00:02:17.540> and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
steps but you paint your base color and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.590 
steps but you paint your base color and
then<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.500> put<00:02:18.709> on<00:02:18.889> a<00:02:18.920> darker<00:02:19.489> glaze<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.359> just

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
then you put on a darker glaze and just

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.990 
then you put on a darker glaze and just
kind<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.049> make<00:02:21.200> striations<00:02:21.799> let<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.400> dry<00:02:22.730> and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
kind of make striations let that dry and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.960 
kind of make striations let that dry and
then<00:02:23.060> put<00:02:23.840> on<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.170> darker<00:02:24.680> glaze<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.400> then<00:02:25.819> use

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
then put on a darker glaze and then use

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.530 
then put on a darker glaze and then use
the<00:02:26.120> wood<00:02:26.299> graining<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.750> let<00:02:27.079> that<00:02:27.230> dry<00:02:27.400> it's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
the wood graining to let that dry it's

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.509 
the wood graining to let that dry it's
simple<00:02:29.540> as<00:02:29.630> pie<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.099> pretty<00:02:31.099> soon<00:02:31.310> you're

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
simple as pie and pretty soon you're

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.099 
simple as pie and pretty soon you're
going<00:02:31.609> to<00:02:31.670> be<00:02:31.730> doing<00:02:32.060> wood<00:02:32.269> graining<00:02:32.540> anything

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
going to be doing wood graining anything

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.710 
going to be doing wood graining anything
that's<00:02:33.260> not<00:02:33.410> moving

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.590 

for<00:02:38.530> example<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.160> box<00:02:39.460> wasn't<00:02:39.790> moving<00:02:40.090> and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
for example this box wasn't moving and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:49.800 
for example this box wasn't moving and
so<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.350> cardboard<00:02:41.650> box<00:02:48.570> before<00:02:49.570> I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
so this is a cardboard box before I

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.060 
so this is a cardboard box before I
leave<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.230> thought<00:02:50.470> I'd<00:02:50.650> show<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:50.890> how

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
leave you I thought I'd show you how

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.650 
leave you I thought I'd show you how
those<00:02:51.220> upturn<00:02:51.610> graves<00:02:52.030> looked<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.570> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
those upturn graves looked in the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.050 
those upturn graves looked in the
graveyard<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.950> demon<00:02:54.520> horse<00:02:54.760> was

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
graveyard like the demon horse was

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.420 
graveyard like the demon horse was
bouncing<00:02:55.960> up<00:02:56.140> through<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.680> ground<00:02:56.950> from<00:02:57.220> its

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
bouncing up through the ground from its

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.090 
bouncing up through the ground from its
hellhole<00:02:57.880> at<00:02:58.300> least<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.960> was<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.170> plan<00:02:59.200> well

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
hellhole at least that was the plan well

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.620 
hellhole at least that was the plan well
