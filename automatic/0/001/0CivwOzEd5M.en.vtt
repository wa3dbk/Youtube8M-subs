00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.759
 At first nobody knew that tim miller 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.490
 Romance does not even write his 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.860
 Parents , he had told them fell off them 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.809
 just to make him more and more time ago 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.360
 the screen was late 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.330
 flew his new hobby so the first one 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 I did not know that book 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.539
 written and clammy and secretly have 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.640
 the then publisher of various 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.769
 sent and only then the first letters 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.119
 of publishers come home are then 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.750
 my family with war that me 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.550
 wrote 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.439
 But then I do not have the book 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.780
 published and have the second book 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.540
 not much further told 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.620
 Nobody knew what it was and only then 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.239
 to go to the end 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.340
 When I became known to the girlfriend then 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.100
 the book proofreader needs it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.110
 had or should have so far 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.210
 tells and then points and he 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.210
 been standing there in my environment known 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.860
 the church of the pope the city of rome for 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.090
 These topics were tim 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.550
 m端ller always 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 So he chose this background for 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.359
 his books are especially important 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.090
 such historical novels is one 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.810
 careful research so mainly 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.820
 through books and specialist literature believe 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.990
 but through the internet 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.150
 to extract any information 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 and if you then the idea then have at 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.200
 the with information from the in books 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.909
 find the internet finds and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.040
 she adorned, I know then I start 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.600
 to write to and if that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.009
 then in hindsight it still thinks 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.100
 missing what or there could be something to it 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.689
 loop then of course continue to search 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 you could optimize that now 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.140
 and if I am sure of it then 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.759
 right then take that into book 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.259
 and then it stays the most in the book 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.060
 in it 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.729
 tim miller wrote one and a half years 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.350
 his new book de pol krupp stops and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.479
 Sch端uplatz are from his first novel 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 otherwise it is known 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.200
 independent history with the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.340
 writing captures the work of the boy 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.110
 authors first 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.700
 So I say write and theirs 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.979
 Chance is almost the small standing 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.960
 drive the greatest effort follows afterwards 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.479
 to rattle all the bookstores 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.729
 who the book ultimately in the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.670
 bookshop accepts this reading 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.500
 organize the marketing with the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.229
 press with newspapers radio or also 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.789
 Now with television are extreme 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.280
 time expenditure and there is actually 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.980
 write almost the smallest effort must 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.890
 had to 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.780
 tim m端ller not only writes he cares 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.540
 also be around all the things around 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.269
 For example, he organizes the book 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.849
 readings himself as arthur by the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.400
 thin glass late was nothing but 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.489
 raven black darkness which with 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.099
 traversed several fog it was 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.620
 had something disturbing the night in 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.290
 to see that condition and car was 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.849
 happy to be in the safe dormitory too 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.739
 knowledge 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.450
 he just wanted to get back to his 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.090
 straw upholstered the flatbed fall 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.160
 can he suddenly has a noise on 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.519
 heard the lower stone courtyard 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.500
 He later again through the glass and 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.150
 tried to figure out where that came from 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.730
 had to have come noise 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.769
 besides writing, tim m端ller opens up 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.379
 The gymnasium remains for other hobbies 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.370
 there is little time and in the next year 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.890
 the high school 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.760
 after the high school graduation , the first course was in 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.099
 go abroad 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.010
 for a year and then would like 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.629
 like to study in the same direction 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.250
 theology french 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.870
 Political science like that then 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.910
 what are you going to do with them 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.400
 Study subjects start because they are not 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.470
 it should be written exactly with the letter 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.359
 go on with a third one in any case 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.470
