00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
much honor her sister maybe because I

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.080 
much honor her sister maybe because I
know<00:00:49.140> sister's<00:00:49.829> name<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.100> Farley<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> know

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
know sister's name is Farley so you know

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
know sister's name is Farley so you know
similarities<00:00:51.960> whatever<00:00:52.289> was<00:00:52.410> named<00:00:52.680> whatnot

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
similarities whatever was named whatnot

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
similarities whatever was named whatnot
and<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.879> also<00:00:54.059> makes<00:00:54.420> sense<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.809> it

makes<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> sense<00:00:55.559> why<00:00:55.920> violet<00:00:56.460> would<00:00:56.579> go

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
makes a lot of sense why violet would go

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
makes a lot of sense why violet would go
back<00:00:57.120> there<00:00:57.420> even<00:00:57.629> after<00:00:57.750> she<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.109> leaving
