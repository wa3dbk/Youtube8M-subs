00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.940
 Hi, I'm Mariana Ferrari, so you're 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.769
 seeing how to change life dotcom the 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.750
 Where you should be if you want 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.930
 create a life in which you feel 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.330
 happy to participate a few weeks ago 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.099
 I received an email from beatriz that 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.869
 write from barcelona in which I 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.039
 he has a good job with a 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.630
 good salary 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.970
 her husband more of the same has 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.529
 stability both two but that already makes 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.110
 some years he realized that his 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.150
 work does not make you eyes shine more 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.910
 Beatriz still tells me in the email 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.379
 texts what I do then metrix me 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.960
 asks some questions that are good 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.030
 interesting and says well mariana is 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.610
 true that people give up the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.800
 stability and comfort in exchange for a 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.500
 I dream when there are small children of 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.320
 half what I'm missing is value question 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.989
 beatriz is security is information not 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.120
 identified that is the answer for 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.829
 beatriz and for you that probably 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.420
 do more or less the same kind of 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.149
 question is that yes it is true there 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.130
 many people who leave everything to pursue 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.890
 his dreams and he does it very successfully 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.020
 now you lack security you lack value 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.719
 you lack information 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.939
 What I do believe is that you have to discover 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.369
 your passion and once you discover it 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.740
 dare to play with her before 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.719
 throwing everything overboard may do 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.420
 many things that you like in life 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.369
 the thing is to find out which one is that 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.350
 you are able to give everything and it is not so 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.360
 easy many people get confused about this 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.789
 because discovering a passion is discovering 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 a feeling and the feelings are 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.719
 an abstract thing that is not so easy 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.149
 of realizing what is really 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.280
 there is in there then I am a 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.899
 teach a very easy method to give you 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 tell if what you found is 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.950
 really your purpose in life 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.869
 imagine that this exercise of 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.539
 discover what you want 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.959
 dedicate your life is like finding your 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.509
 couple forever you will go through many 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.539
 that you do not like at the beginning and 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.310
 then there will be other rule as you 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.470
 like at first with those who 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.060
 come out but immediately find some 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.250
 things that you do not like very much and stop 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.710
 leave then there will be others that you like 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.260
 More that you love maybe but 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.210
 You do not know why after a couple of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.920
 you start discovering things that 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.070
 you do not know very well why but you 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.380
 they end up holding back and one day at the moment 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.360
 and in the least expected place you go to 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.580
 discover that person who is going to make you 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.860
 shine your eyes you're going to start dating 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.720
 with her you will discover those 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.640
 things that maybe you would do different 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.250
 but it will not matter at all because 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.710
 you know deep inside yours that that's the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.450
 person of your life and that 's the person 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.850
 that is going to make the shine in your eyes 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.370
 as with couples in life 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.530
 There may be many things that you 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.930
 like play with them dare to play 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.820
 with them try the salt with them but 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.790
 do not marry any until you do not 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.800
 realize that really despite the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.390
 circumstances that idea 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.540
 it's going to be to throw everything ahead 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.370
 because in an irrational way you 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.080
 fascinates you love it and it will take you to 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.110
 move when you get to that point 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.420
 beatriz you will not have doubts nor will you have 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.250
 afraid you will leave that uncomfortable area of 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.320
 comfort where you find yourself today by

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.650

 when you have that concern that you have 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.730
 you today is because there is something out there that 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.620
