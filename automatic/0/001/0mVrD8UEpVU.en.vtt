after I watched this episode I was under
the<00:05:50.900> impression<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.470> this<00:05:51.710> was<00:05:51.920> the<00:05:52.100> season

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
the impression that this was the season

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.860 
the impression that this was the season
finale<00:05:52.490> because<00:05:53.000> there's<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.450> lot<00:05:53.690> that

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
finale because there's a lot that

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.450

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
becoming more of a threat and I feel

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.120 
becoming more of a threat and I feel
that<00:05:56.990> showing<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.350> Armada<00:05:57.650> approaching

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
that showing the Armada approaching

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.620 
that showing the Armada approaching
earth<00:05:58.250> would<00:05:58.490> be<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.640> good<00:05:58.910> cliffhanger<00:05:59.480> to

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
earth would be a good cliffhanger to

guess I can only judge this episode as a

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.520 
guess I can only judge this episode as a
lead-up<00:06:11.090> to<00:06:11.240> the<00:06:11.480> season<00:06:11.750> finale<00:06:11.870> and<00:06:12.230> I<00:06:12.410> have
