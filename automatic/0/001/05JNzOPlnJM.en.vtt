00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
travel theory the possible time travel

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.530 
travel theory the possible time travel
location<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.010> guys<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.610> haven't<00:00:38.730> seen<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
location so guys if you haven't seen the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
location so guys if you haven't seen the
video<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> time<00:00:40.530> travel<00:00:40.920> location<00:00:41.460> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
video on the time travel location I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.299 
video on the time travel location I
strongly<00:00:42.450> recommend<00:00:42.870> watching<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.860> before

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
strongly recommend watching it before

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.790 
strongly recommend watching it before
watching<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.270> else<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.110> won't<00:00:46.620> make

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
watching this one else it won't make

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.610 
watching this one else it won't make
sense<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.270> yeah<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.200> start<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
sense you at all so yeah the start of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.729 
sense you at all so yeah the start of
here<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.640> railroad<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.289> power

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
here at the railroad there is a power

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.100 
here at the railroad there is a power
station<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.270> power<00:00:54.480> station<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
station just a little power station and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770 
station just a little power station and
this<00:00:55.469> makes<00:00:55.739> sense<00:00:55.860> already<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.629> need

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
this makes sense already because we need

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.439 
this makes sense already because we need
power<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.620> time<00:00:59.129> travel<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.640> course<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.270> there

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
power to time travel of course but there

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.590 
power to time travel of course but there
is<00:01:00.570> also<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.050> sign<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.609> power<00:01:02.820> station

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
is also a sign here at the power station

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.640 
is also a sign here at the power station
what<00:01:03.899> says<00:01:04.549> 1.21<00:01:05.549> jigowatts<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> i<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:07.170> we

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
what says 1.21 jigowatts and i think we

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.899 
what says 1.21 jigowatts and i think we
all<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.460> means

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
all know what this means

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.590 
all know what this means
we<00:01:09.479> need<00:01:09.689> 1.21<00:01:10.680> jigowatts<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:12.119> need<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> go

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
we need 1.21 jigowatts and we need to go

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.620 
we need 1.21 jigowatts and we need to go
88<00:01:13.229> miles<00:01:13.680> per<00:01:13.920> hour<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.670> time-travel<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
88 miles per hour to time-travel and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.679 
88 miles per hour to time-travel and
this<00:01:16.470> info<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.189> from<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> movie<00:01:18.210> Back<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
this info is from the movie Back to the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.080 
this info is from the movie Back to the
Future<00:01:18.750> again<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.860> these<00:01:20.070> numbers<00:01:20.280> also

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
Future again but these numbers also

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
Future again but these numbers also
appear<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.750> GTA<00:01:22.350> 5<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:23.130> no<00:01:23.460> coincidence

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
appear in GTA 5 so it's no coincidence

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
appear in GTA 5 so it's no coincidence
if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.570> ask<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.070> points<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
if you ask me and all this points to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
that we can time-travel in GTA 5 we have

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.580 
that we can time-travel in GTA 5 we have
so<00:01:29.579> many<00:01:29.790> clues<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> hints<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> everything

this sign 1.21 jigowatts isn't only here
in<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.500> location<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.579> actually

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
in this location it's actually

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.870

everywhere<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.530> map<00:01:49.740> where<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
everywhere on the map where there is a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
everywhere on the map where there is a
little<00:01:51.149> power<00:01:51.390> station<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.380> sign<00:01:52.649> has

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
little power station so that sign has

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.090 
little power station so that sign has
nothing<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.720> location<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.890> I

didn't help
then<00:03:23.930> over<00:03:24.410> here<00:03:24.440> we<00:03:24.740> can<00:03:25.160> see<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.460> hoot<00:03:25.910> with<00:03:26.300> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
then over here we can see a hoot with a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.290 
then over here we can see a hoot with a
sign<00:03:26.870> on<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.740> thought<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.460> sign<00:03:29.030> was

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
sign on it and I thought this sign was

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.150 
sign on it and I thought this sign was
looking<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.960> sticky<00:03:30.470> bomb<00:03:30.680> as<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.040> can

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160

see here so now I thought perhaps went

it off and move it or do something with

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.260 
it off and move it or do something with
it<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:38.690> guys<00:03:39.020> nope<00:03:39.709> no<00:03:40.250> movement<00:03:40.820> as<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.120> can
