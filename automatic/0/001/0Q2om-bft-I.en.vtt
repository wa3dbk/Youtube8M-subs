all the cactuses and side which and are
you<00:02:15.250> probably<00:02:15.490> thinking<00:02:15.730> what<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.910> hell<00:02:16.180> but

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
you probably thinking what the hell but

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.690 
you probably thinking what the hell but
it's<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.350> little<00:02:17.590> ceramic<00:02:18.010> skull<00:02:18.430> here

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
it's just this little ceramic skull here

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.520 
it's just this little ceramic skull here
which<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.000> from<00:02:19.210> typo<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.900> think<00:02:20.290> it's<00:02:20.410> actually

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
which is from typo I think it's actually

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.830 
which is from typo I think it's actually
a<00:02:20.710> jar<00:02:21.160> or<00:02:21.190> something<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:21.970> but<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.600> just

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
a jar or something like that but I just

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.930 
a jar or something like that but I just
took<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.500> top<00:02:23.860> off<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.280> filled<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.610> with<00:02:24.640> soil

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
took the top off and filled it with soil

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.910 
took the top off and filled it with soil
and<00:02:25.270> cactuses<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.440> thought<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.770> was<00:02:26.890> a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
and cactuses so I thought it was a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.350 
and cactuses so I thought it was a
really<00:02:27.070> cool<00:02:27.280> idea<00:02:27.490> I've<00:02:27.760> always<00:02:27.910> wanted<00:02:28.150> to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
really cool idea I've always wanted to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.610 
really cool idea I've always wanted to
do<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.020> said<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.320> get<00:02:29.530> this

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
do it so like I said you can get this

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.200 
do it so like I said you can get this
from<00:02:29.800> type<00:02:30.040> o<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.430> about<00:02:30.580> thirty<00:02:30.820> dollars

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
from type o it's about thirty dollars

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.550 
from type o it's about thirty dollars
and<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.600> think<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:31.990> cool<00:02:32.230> how<00:02:32.470> it

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
and I just think it's so cool how it

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.050 
and I just think it's so cool how it
looks<00:02:32.710> like<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.860> sugar<00:02:33.040> skull<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.670> all<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
looks like a sugar skull and all the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.640 
looks like a sugar skull and all the
plants<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.600> inside<00:02:34.870> joke<00:02:35.140> bought<00:02:35.350> for<00:02:35.560> me

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
plants on the inside joke bought for me

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.040 
plants on the inside joke bought for me
so<00:02:35.830> I've<00:02:35.890> got<00:02:36.130> two<00:02:36.580> spiky<00:02:37.090> ones<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.750> don't<00:02:37.960> know

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
so I've got two spiky ones I don't know

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.750 
so I've got two spiky ones I don't know
what<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.350> one<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.100> this<00:02:39.220> one<00:02:39.280> Becky

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
what this one is and then this one Becky

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.910 
what this one is and then this one Becky
is<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:39.970> money<00:02:40.270> tree<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:40.840> hopefully<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.800> will

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
is a money tree so hopefully it will

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.620 
is a money tree so hopefully it will
make<00:02:42.100> me<00:02:42.280> rich<00:02:42.460> probably<00:02:43.120> won't<00:02:43.270> though<00:02:43.300> and

both<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:52.480> first<00:02:52.690> one<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.200> one

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
both to you this first one is the one

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.630 
both to you this first one is the one
that<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.500> asked<00:02:53.800> for<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.070> it's<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.310> sugar

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
that I asked for and it's this sugar

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.160 
that I asked for and it's this sugar
skull<00:02:54.910> pillow<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.420> looks<00:02:55.600> exactly<00:02:55.720> like

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
skull pillow so it looks exactly like

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.870 
skull pillow so it looks exactly like
the<00:02:56.590> bars<00:02:56.980> or<00:02:57.250> whatever<00:02:57.490> you<00:02:57.550> want<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.730> call<00:02:57.820> it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
the bars or whatever you want to call it

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.030 
the bars or whatever you want to call it
except<00:02:58.360> it's<00:02:58.570> in<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.840> cushion<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.380> it's<00:02:59.860> got

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
except it's in a cushion so it's got

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.410 
except it's in a cushion so it's got
little<00:03:00.130> blue<00:03:00.400> pom-poms<00:03:00.910> all<00:03:01.060> around<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
little blue pom-poms all around the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.820 
little blue pom-poms all around the
edges<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.930> think<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.200> looks<00:03:02.350> really<00:03:02.410> cute

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
edges and I think it looks really cute

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.590 
edges and I think it looks really cute
and<00:03:03.070> yeah<00:03:03.400> it's<00:03:03.580> just<00:03:03.790> pink<00:03:04.000> with<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> big<00:03:04.360> sugar

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
and yeah it's just pink with a big sugar

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.030 
and yeah it's just pink with a big sugar
skull<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.140> then<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.440> back<00:03:05.560> it's<00:03:05.890> what

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
skull and then on the back it's what

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.130 
skull and then on the back it's what
those<00:03:06.280> stripes<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.150> really<00:03:07.720> really<00:03:07.930> like

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
those stripes so I really really like

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.570 
those stripes so I really really like
the<00:03:08.290> colors<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.890> pattern<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.430> so

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
the colors and the pattern of it so

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.040 
the colors and the pattern of it so
that's<00:03:09.670> why<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:09.910> asked<00:03:10.150> for<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.600> then<00:03:10.840> my

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
that's why I asked for it and then my

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.780 
that's why I asked for it and then my
mom<00:03:11.230> also<00:03:11.470> saw<00:03:11.800> this<00:03:11.980> one<00:03:12.190> next<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.520> it<00:03:12.550> so<00:03:12.640> she

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
mom also saw this one next to it so she

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.790 
mom also saw this one next to it so she
figured<00:03:13.060> she'd<00:03:13.420> get<00:03:13.510> them<00:03:13.750> as<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.960> set<00:03:14.260> so

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
figured she'd get them as a set so

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.530 
figured she'd get them as a set so
that's<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.070> one<00:03:15.250> here<00:03:15.310> against<00:03:15.970> from<00:03:16.120> Typho

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
that's this one here against from Typho

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.449 
that's this one here against from Typho
it's<00:03:17.050> got<00:03:17.200> very<00:03:17.410> similar<00:03:17.770> colors<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.340> and

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
it's got very similar colors to it and

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.070 
it's got very similar colors to it and
it's<00:03:18.580> also<00:03:18.730> got<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.090> pom-poms<00:03:19.540> on<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.870> side

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
it's also got the pom-poms on the side

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.110 
it's also got the pom-poms on the side
and<00:03:20.320> then<00:03:20.560> it's<00:03:20.770> also<00:03:20.950> reversible<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.970> you've

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
and then it's also reversible so you've

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.550 
and then it's also reversible so you've
got<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.510> kind<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.870> patterns<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.410> can

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
got to kind of patterns that you can

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.680 
got to kind of patterns that you can
work<00:03:23.739> with<00:03:23.770> so<00:03:24.280> i<00:03:24.550> don't<00:03:25.060> know<00:03:25.120> i<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.330> really

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
I'm pretty much going to have to slice

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.790 
I'm pretty much going to have to slice
this<00:04:01.300> like<00:04:01.540> it's<00:04:01.720> an<00:04:01.810> apple<00:04:02.140> pie<00:04:02.290> or<00:04:02.350> something

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
this like it's an apple pie or something

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.949 
this like it's an apple pie or something
I<00:04:02.890> think<00:04:02.950> these<00:04:03.459> are<00:04:03.519> huge<00:04:04.060> another<00:04:04.750> thing

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
I think these are huge another thing

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.960 
I think these are huge another thing
that<00:04:04.989> I<00:04:05.140> got<00:04:05.380> is<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:05.769> candle<00:04:06.190> from<00:04:06.340> Jake<00:04:06.670> so

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
that I got is this candle from Jake so

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.820 
that I got is this candle from Jake so
it's<00:04:07.150> from<00:04:07.360> dusk<00:04:07.720> which<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.200> have<00:04:08.440> tried<00:04:08.620> their

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
it's from dusk which I have tried their

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.440 
it's from dusk which I have tried their
candles<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.459> past<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:10.000> other<00:04:10.150> problem<00:04:10.390> I

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
candles in the past the other problem I

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.180 
candles in the past the other problem I
have<00:04:10.630> with<00:04:10.660> dusk<00:04:10.989> is<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.380> their<00:04:11.530> prices<00:04:11.980> are

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
have with dusk is that their prices are

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.830 
have with dusk is that their prices are
outrageous<00:04:12.220> because<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.239> believe<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:13.630> was

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
outrageous because I believe this was

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.660 
outrageous because I believe this was
around<00:04:14.080> thirty<00:04:14.440> dollars<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.100> it's<00:04:15.250> like

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
around thirty dollars and it's like

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.340 
around thirty dollars and it's like
roughly<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.239> size<00:04:16.359> of<00:04:16.570> my<00:04:16.660> head<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.200> with

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
roughly the size of my head but with

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.449 
roughly the size of my head but with
that<00:04:17.440> being<00:04:17.620> said<00:04:17.739> it's<00:04:17.980> in<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.190> smell

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
that being said it's in the smell

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.539 
that being said it's in the smell
strawberry<00:04:18.910> shake

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
strawberry shake

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.240 
strawberry shake
smells<00:04:19.819> so<00:04:20.150> good<00:04:20.479> if<00:04:20.629> I<00:04:20.750> can<00:04:20.900> open<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.289> okay<00:04:22.009> but

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
smells so good if I can open it okay but

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.800 
smells so good if I can open it okay but
it<00:04:22.370> just<00:04:22.490> smells<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:22.940> good<00:04:23.150> it's<00:04:23.300> very<00:04:23.360> very

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
it just smells so good it's very very

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.869 
it just smells so good it's very very
strong<00:04:24.169> as<00:04:24.379> well<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:24.949> it<00:04:25.099> actually<00:04:25.250> feels<00:04:25.669> the

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:25.879 
strong as well so it actually feels the

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.610 
strong as well so it actually feels the
room<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.300> makes<00:04:26.509> your<00:04:26.690> room<00:04:26.900> smell<00:04:27.199> like<00:04:27.229> this

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
room and makes your room smell like this

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.379 
room and makes your room smell like this
so<00:04:27.919> for<00:04:28.190> thirty<00:04:28.370> dollars<00:04:28.699> you<00:04:28.819> definitely<00:04:29.240> are

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
so for thirty dollars you definitely are

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.059 
so for thirty dollars you definitely are
getting<00:04:29.780> what<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:29.960> candle<00:04:30.349> to<00:04:30.379> meant<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.740> do<00:04:30.889> is

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
getting what a candle to meant to do is

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.740 
getting what a candle to meant to do is
just<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.490> don't<00:04:31.879> think<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.210> could<00:04:32.360> ever<00:04:32.389> justify
