segments<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.580> weren't<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:30.119> team

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
segments and we weren't really a team

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.370 
but over the last few years they really
found<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.790> way<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.940> grow<00:01:33.180> together<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:34.259> know

found a way to grow together you know
the<00:01:34.560> seniors<00:01:34.979> kneel<00:01:35.310> being<00:01:35.580> one<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.820> those

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940

clue<00:01:58.679> fishers<00:01:59.069> there's<00:01:59.700> one<00:02:00.030> big<00:02:00.210> group<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
clue fishers there's one big group and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.070 
clue fishers there's one big group and
after<00:02:02.090> after<00:02:03.090> he<00:02:03.210> kind<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.450> challenged<00:02:03.929> this

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
after after he kind of challenged this

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.559 
after after he kind of challenged this
has<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.920> been<00:02:05.069> easy<00:02:05.310> there's<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.539> mean

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
has just it's been easy there's I mean

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.180 
has just it's been easy there's I mean
there's<00:02:06.720> not<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.289> having<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.860> about

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there's not really having to think about

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.859 
there's not really having to think about
it<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.179> day<00:02:09.360> I'm<00:02:09.540> hanging<00:02:09.810> out

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it it's it's one day I'm hanging out

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.810 
it it's it's one day I'm hanging out
with<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.079> guy<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:11.070> next<00:02:11.370> day<00:02:11.489> I'm<00:02:11.549> hanging

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
with this guy the next day I'm hanging

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.789 
with this guy the next day I'm hanging
out<00:02:11.880> this<00:02:12.120> guy<00:02:12.329> you<00:02:13.019> know<00:02:13.079> the<00:02:13.200> next<00:02:13.410> day<00:02:13.470> three

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
out this guy you know the next day three

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.020 
out this guy you know the next day three
or<00:02:13.890> four<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.160> us<00:02:14.250> are<00:02:14.430> going<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.850> something

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
or four of us are going to get something

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.120 
or four of us are going to get something
to<00:02:15.180> eat<00:02:15.299> I<00:02:15.690> think<00:02:15.780> team<00:02:16.200> chemistry<00:02:16.410> certainly

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
to eat I think team chemistry certainly

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.530 
to eat I think team chemistry certainly
is<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> big<00:02:17.549> part<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.880> where<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.209> are<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.670> you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
is a big part of where we are you you

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.979 
is a big part of where we are you you
don't<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.440> point<00:02:22.970> very<00:02:23.970> often<00:02:24.480> with

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
don't get to this point very often with

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.009 
don't get to this point very often with
the<00:02:25.140> team<00:02:25.380> unless<00:02:26.310> you're<00:02:26.579> just<00:02:27.019> unbelievably

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
the team unless you're just unbelievably

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.530 
the team unless you're just unbelievably
talented<00:02:28.670> without<00:02:29.670> having<00:02:30.120> some<00:02:30.329> of<00:02:30.420> that

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
talented without having some of that

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.910 
talented without having some of that
unity<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.049> some<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.620> special

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
unity and some of that special

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.890 
unity and some of that special
ingredient<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:33.120> sometimes<00:02:33.390> hard<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
ingredient that is sometimes hard to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.620 
ingredient that is sometimes hard to
quantify<00:02:34.489> but<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.150> think<00:02:36.450> there's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
quantify but I do think there's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.289 
quantify but I do think there's
something<00:02:36.870> special<00:02:37.859> about<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.489> team<00:02:38.549> in

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
something special about this team in

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.819 
something special about this team in
that<00:02:39.540> regard<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:40.380> there's<00:02:40.560> any<00:02:40.680> question

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
that regard I think there's any question

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.170 
that regard I think there's any question
this<00:02:41.130> team's<00:02:41.340> got<00:02:41.549> really<00:02:41.790> good<00:02:41.910> chemistry

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
this team's got really good chemistry

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.759 
this team's got really good chemistry
and<00:02:42.480> again<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.750> don't<00:02:42.900> know<00:02:43.019> how<00:02:43.079> you<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.650> I

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
and again I don't know how you get it I

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.370 
and again I don't know how you get it I
don't<00:02:44.010> know<00:02:44.070> why<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.000> get<00:02:45.329> it<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:46.019> feel

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
don't know why you get it I just feel

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.940 
don't know why you get it I just feel
like<00:02:47.750> some<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:48.989> developed<00:02:49.500> over<00:02:49.769> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
like some of it's developed over to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.229 
like some of it's developed over to
overtime<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:51.000> test<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.450> time<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.900> Trust<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
overtime the test of time and Trust and

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.990 
overtime the test of time and Trust and
the<00:02:54.239> different<00:02:54.799> scenarios<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:55.829> emotions<00:02:56.820> you

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
the different scenarios and emotions you

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.610 
the different scenarios and emotions you
go<00:02:57.180> through<00:02:57.510> throughout<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.109> year<00:02:58.350> we've

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
go through throughout the year we've

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.920 
go through throughout the year we've
been<00:02:58.650> about<00:02:59.070> through<00:03:00.000> about<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.390> gamut<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
been about through about the gamut of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.660 
been about through about the gamut of
everything<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.769> experience<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.519> think

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
everything you can experience so I think

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.849 
everything you can experience so I think
a<00:03:02.880> lot<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.239> has<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.720> contributed<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
a lot of that has really contributed the

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.590 
a lot of that has really contributed the
fact<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.430> know<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.910> team<00:03:06.090> chemistry's

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
fact that you know the team chemistry's

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.150 
fact that you know the team chemistry's
there

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
there

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.220 
there
you
