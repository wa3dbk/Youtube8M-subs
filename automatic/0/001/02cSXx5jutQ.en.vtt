like yeah yeah you know I was a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.400 
like yeah yeah you know I was a
volunteer<00:00:31.380> during<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.279> last<00:00:32.520> campaign<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
kind of in a limited way and so I really

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.610 
kind of in a limited way and so I really
wanted<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.899> more<00:00:37.020> involved<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.410> time

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
irresponsible so it was this election I

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.250 
irresponsible so it was this election I

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
think I really feel like as a nation and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.660 
think I really feel like as a nation and
it<00:03:43.410> was<00:03:43.500> definitive<00:03:43.950> he<00:03:44.100> won<00:03:44.280> he<00:03:44.459> won<00:03:44.580> the
