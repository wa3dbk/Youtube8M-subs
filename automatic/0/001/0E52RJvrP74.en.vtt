00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
called chroma so a little smaller head

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.260 
called chroma so a little smaller head
to<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:36.439> which<00:01:37.100> is<00:01:37.130> great<00:01:37.759> if<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:37.969> like<00:01:38.000> the

to this which is great if you like the
flowering<00:01:38.659> effect<00:01:38.930> of<00:01:39.079> these<00:01:39.170> these<00:01:39.380> all<00:01:39.590> do

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
flowering effect of these these all do

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.800 
flowering effect of these these all do
have<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.979> flowering<00:01:40.430> period<00:01:40.610> by<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:40.939> way<00:01:41.180> so

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
the more heads you get in a plant the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.539 
the more heads you get in a plant the
more<00:01:44.600> flowers<00:01:45.020> you'll<00:01:45.200> get<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.680> you'll<00:01:46.189> notice

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
as this part goes on there's going to be

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.109 
as this part goes on there's going to be
some<00:01:48.740> varieties<00:01:49.040> with<00:01:49.189> really<00:01:49.579> large<00:01:49.759> heads

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
some varieties with really large heads

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.240 
some varieties with really large heads
well<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:51.049> type<00:01:51.290> of<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.469> plant<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:52.070> won't

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
well and that type of a plant you won't

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.889 
well and that type of a plant you won't
get<00:01:52.430> quite<00:01:52.700> as<00:01:52.820> many<00:01:52.969> of<00:01:53.149> these<00:01:53.270> flowering

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
get quite as many of these flowering

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.380 
get quite as many of these flowering
stalks<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:54.740> this<00:01:54.920> again<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.340> called<00:01:55.700> chroma

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
stalks so this again is called chroma

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.630 
stalks so this again is called chroma
given<00:01:57.079> that<00:01:57.200> name<00:01:57.469> because<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.950> does<00:01:58.100> have<00:01:58.310> a

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
given that name because it does have a
