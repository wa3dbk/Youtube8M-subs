00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 LG is bringing two new models of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.029
 g3 family smartphones 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 but which are a more simplified version 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.150
 the top-of-the-line model they promise to be 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 more accessible 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.799
 You'll meet one of them now. 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.900
 brings a novelty to the pen then 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.900
 stay with review of lg three styles 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.770
 he is of the family of three because his 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.689
 design is pretty much the same but it 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.970
 do not have physical buttons on the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.309
 front and sides and the functions 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.360
 are centralized all button martin 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.820
 behind 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.040
 addition, both have a 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.199
 with plastic to bring the textured 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.220
 localized appearance but here is a 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.080
 difference 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.120
 the style is made with more plastic 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.760
 fragile it is almost the same size as 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.620
 g3 ie a large size but in the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.360
 edges continue to fund bringing the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.479
 curve that allows a good footprint 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.430
 up to even 5.5 inches and this is one of 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.190
 device highlights 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.890
 the resolution dropped a little are 540 per 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.710
 960 pixels which is also known as 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.240
 php you can see some pixels by eye 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.100
 naked but nothing to bother 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.659
 overall the visual experience was very 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.680
 good both for browsing and for 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.750
 watch videos 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.850
 the sound is of satisfactory quality for 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.680
 watch videos but leaves a little 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.640
 want to play music because 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.620
 there are some serious 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.650
 the Chinese have quadcore processor of 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.420
 1.3 ghz with 1 gb of ram and 8 gb of 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.700
 internal storage and only 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.440
 four are available for use is 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.390
 little but you can increase this 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.870
 space with a memory card up to 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.760
 128 tip or with 50 gb available 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.390
 by the box that comes pre-installed in the 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.290
 appliance 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.330
 the version of android to 4.4.2 qat in the 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.240
 everyday and the apparatus is in multitasking 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.760
 came out very well with quite fluency in 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.970
 some games were as well as those of 32 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.100
 more in others he gave a choke 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.810
 for example on the ionline I made a 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.090
 second test filling the space of 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.190
 storage and that's where the problem comes from. 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.200
 the smartphone was so slow 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.920
 in games as well as in the most 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 simple 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 so if you like to talk many 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.470
 applications on the memory card will be 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.349
 very welcome 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.480
 this model supports 3g wifi has option 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.250
 for two chips and you can also use 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.650
 like tv remote control 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.180
 it also has nfc but some 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.730
 applications are not yet available 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.790
 for this model as is the case with point 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.040
 Right from the sptrans 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.689
 In the description of the video you can 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.269
 check other models of 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.430
 also do not work with this app 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.129
 but for file sharing 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.079
 nfc function normally and now the 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.159
 stylus pen was taking time to 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.349
 talk about it right 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.099
 the little pen is the novelty of this model of 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.290
 lg 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.760
 It is made of metal and has a rubber 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.859
 at the end that touches the screen 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.349
 it is very light and touch-taking 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.629
 more like relative delay and also not 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.579
 you need to put a lot of pressure 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.920
 She looks like the pen in the galaxy. 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.010
 note and help when taking notes 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.090
 and doodles to draw however she 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.069
 falls short 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.409
 there are a variety of applications for 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.329
 that assist in these functions 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.310
 but the legend itself already provides the 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.799
 even more that allows you to 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.090
 make notes sketches open photos and 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.980
 make a note about them 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.049
 I even asked my friend Nayara who is 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.419
 designer do a simple drawing here 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.459
 screen and she confirmed that she had 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.590
 sense in some tests that the pen 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.290
 has a little delay is not so accurate 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.060
 is best for taking notes 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.129
 a detail worth noting is 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.079
 that the screen is a little fat nothing to 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.060
 pen will further aid your cage 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.739
 writing with it on the keyboard is also 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.629
 easy but you probably will 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.340
 prefer the fingers because it is much more 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.690
 fast and use both hands 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.180
 this device also comes with a 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.250
 known not on that allows you to connect the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.769
 with only two rings and thus 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.239
 you do not need to turn the phone lg 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.949
 also brought to this device a 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.769
 another feature that was already 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.750
 previous that is the noc code envy you 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.150
 enter number or letter codes 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.340
 drawings you enter up to eight touches 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:14.129
 on the screen and it works even when it 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.150
 off the unit is the 3 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.699
 megapixels 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.109
 which is not very common if smartphones 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.239
 intermediaries in general the photos in 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.430
 well-lit environments with good 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.300
 even the nocturnal ones can leave a little 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.039
 granulated 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.260
 with the help of flash you can improve 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.840
 this effect the videos in full resolution 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.580
 hd and also have good quality o 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.830
 which left unsatisfactory was the stabilization 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.539
 and the time it takes since the moment 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.940
 that you push the button until photos 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.010
 actually taken so some videos 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.110
 and photos can get a bit awful the 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.210
 camera application is well cleaned and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.890
 maria adjustments is the automatic 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.510
 Photographers on duty when not 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.920
 but this helps the user who does not want 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.690
 bothering to accept 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.210
 more advanced settings 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.490
 It is in picture taking between resources 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.430
 present are focus mode setting 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.100
 landscape beautification and mirroring 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.170
 front camera has 1.3 megapixels and is 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.210
 recommended for video calls and 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.010
 maximum to bet on social networks 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.860
 despite the low resolution it has a 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.810
 feature that helps take off self sohc self 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.910
 it recognizes the movement of your fingers 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.070
 and just open and close the hand he 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.900
 has three seconds and is shooting without 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.640
 the need to press a button 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.410
 another resource that does not require the use of 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.200
 buttons to voice trigger 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.720
 just say something like you's or is 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.660
 of which he already in English if the photo taken 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.310
 on here 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.290
 the front camera has no flash but the 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.360
 application provides an alternative 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.500
 which in my opinion is not much 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.000
 utility 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.790
 it features a clear and bright screen 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.080
 in an attempt to leave the front photos 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.180
 more illuminated 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.170
 but I did not see much difference to use 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.720
 this resource 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.760
 it only helps if you take the picture a lot 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.920
 near in the very dark place 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:57.870
 the camera application is the same as rg3 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.760
 but the style does not come with the collegiate if 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.710
 gives a positive point the battery of 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.420
 styles is the same as day 3 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.490
 it is two thousand nine hundred and forty thousand 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.290
 feet that support up to a day and a half of 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.780
 moderate use according to our test 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:14.550
 default is a smartphone that is 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.200
 users who want more comfort to 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.660
 surf the internet and watch videos 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.180
 with the advantage of having a good camera one 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.560
 pen but does not need the performance 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.240
 a top of the line 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.030
 I hope you did not like our 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.590
 rg3's review dress if you want to have 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.020
 more information 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.850
 here in our direct source video if 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.170
 you still have a question leaves 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.910
 here in the comments 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.800
 I like the video, it subscribes to the channel 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.900
 share with your friends do not know 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.900
 I do not know if this will fall until the next
