00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 and the world in the Ukrainian land are trying 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.660
 agree today in Minsk there 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.910
 a meeting of the heads of the customs union 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.679
 Ukraine, the EU representatives are the first 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.049
 statements have already been made by the presidents of Ukraine 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.030
 and Belarus in bilateral negotiations 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.859
 Poroshenko already made it clear 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.140
 last meeting but on agreement 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.910
 who will bring peace in his country and he 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.859
 hopes today and yet 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.539
 official agenda economic 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.439
 going to discuss relationships 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.720
 customs troika 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.730
 Belarus of Kazakhstan and Russia with Kiev and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.460
 also the consequences of the association of Ukraine with 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.750
 The EU works in the independence palace 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 political observer erin 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.399
 Kuzminskaya Irina Hello, what else 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.399
 statements have already been made in Minsk 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.940
 well, especially loud yet 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.180
 no statements yet to come 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.039
 a general meeting is about to take a tuple 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.559
 Vladimir Putin is now moving 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.660
 to the palace of independence where the ebu and where 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.699
 Ainu negotiations will take you right 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.890
 Said that the main topic stated 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.640
 economy but hardly by this 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.949
 confine 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.199
 today's agenda is a matter of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.600
 the fact that there are too many acute problems 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.820
 accumulated on the resolution of which 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 sides diametrically sometimes pride 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 opposite approaches so 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 today's meeting definitely won't be 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.479
 simple but good news is that it 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.549
 the thing is that literally 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.670
 until the last there were doubts whether 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.250
 down Peter Poroshenko Ukrainian 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.619
 political elite put pressure on their 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.509
 President dissuaded him from flying to 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.549
 this meeting is still here 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.380
 flew one of the first and as you already 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.079
 noticed held bilateral talks 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.630
 with his Belarusian colleague 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.340
 alexander lukashenko 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.649
 discussed including the situation 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.259
 difficult situation in the east and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.110
 surely this topic today will be in 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.759
 spotlight and general meeting in 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.220
 the sidelines are already talking that is possible 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.110
 even some kind of road will be developed 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.090
 map 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.130
 but it seems hardly worth it 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.090
 expect to be today 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.550
 some specific 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.420
 agreement on the process that is called 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.570
 went and 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.729
 this is already encouraging I think it is not 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.660
 just add up negotiations and questions 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.330
 trade and economic relations after 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.750
 Kiev has signed an association with 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.270
 EU between Ukraine and customs 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.090
 the three were contradictions and Astana 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.190
 Minsk and Moscow have repeatedly openly 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.730
 stated that they would protect interests 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.730
 of my common market but I want to point out 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.290
 what's actually happening today 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.640
 historical event the thing is that 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.489
 first 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.060
 what happens is what is called contact 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.010
 Between the Customs Union and the European Union 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.110
 and at such a high level 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.010
 and then you can this building represent 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.250
 presidents 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.370
 and with delegated the head of his diplomacy 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.980
 Catherine Ashton and High Commissioners for 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.000
 trade and energy but its by the way 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.739
 the person of the latter may suggest 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.890
 It may suggest that today but 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.330
 surely touched upon the question 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.760
 Russian-Ukrainian gas relations in 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.519
 which what is called spit found on 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.890
 stone and europe is certainly vital 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.950
 interested to have this dispute in 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.870
 as soon as possible because 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.150
 winter is not far off but no one is sure 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.160
 I want to freeze so that the meeting promises 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.690
 to be multifaceted and unconditionally 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.910
 interesting but certainly saved 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.959
 intrigue take place whether a personal meeting 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.410
 Petra Poroshenko and Vladimir Putin 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.120
 Kremlin press service 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.120
 this does not exclude but the question is 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.470
 open Ainu thank you Irina our 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.760
 political observer irina 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.660
 Kuzminskaya works in the palace 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.660
 independence in Minsk
