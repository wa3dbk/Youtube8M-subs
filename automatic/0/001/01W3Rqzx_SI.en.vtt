00:00:05.146 --> 00:00:05.687
 Wow 

00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:16.437
 If the two teams have Faros 

00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:19.437
 This is their Faros 

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.729
 This is our Faros 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.937
 Faros, you gave me a good listen. 

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:45.437
 Don't you die anymore? 

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:50.021
 Do we want to lose? 

00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:54.021
 You just need to stand behind me 

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:56.646
 Then harass them with arrows 

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:57.854
 Do you understand? 

00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:02.271
 Ok, step forward to victory! 

00:01:04.354 --> 00:01:06.562
 God, why... 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.562
 Poke~ 

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:14.312
 Ok... 

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:25.396
 Hazel Ize 

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:27.729
 I will send you a present. 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.354
 You want to play me again, right? 

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:33.937
 Of course not, I have changed myself. 

00:01:33.937 --> 00:01:36.104
 Ok... 

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:38.312
 It's a good one... 

00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:44.521
 I am doing a good job. 

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.187
 Give me a five. 

00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:47.771
 Don't thank you 

00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:48.271
 This side dish... 

00:01:57.562 --> 00:02:01.604
 Can you fall back today? 

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:03.604
