that front in fact in some ways because
the<00:03:19.620> weather<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.070> America<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.520> actually<00:03:20.760> get

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
the weather in America you actually get

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.010 
the weather in America you actually get
more<00:03:21.120> cup<00:03:21.330> with<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.480> testing<00:03:21.810> than<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
more cup with a testing than the

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.100 
more cup with a testing than the
Europeans<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:22.560> yeah<00:03:23.489> it's<00:03:23.790> um<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.840> kind<00:03:25.080> of

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
Europeans do yeah it's um it's kind of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.900 
Europeans do yeah it's um it's kind of
tough<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.410> only<00:03:25.800> do<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> few<00:03:26.040> races<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.610> year<00:03:26.790> in

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
tough we only do a few races a year in

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.490 
tough we only do a few races a year in
the<00:03:27.000> US<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.450> we<00:03:27.570> focus<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:27.989> much<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
the US and we focus so much on the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.620 
the US and we focus so much on the
carpet<00:03:28.860> season<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.910> sometimes<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.540> takes

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
carpet season that sometimes it takes

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.050 
carpet season that sometimes it takes
away<00:03:30.900> from<00:03:31.110> our<00:03:31.260> asphalt<00:03:31.470> effort<00:03:32.070> but<00:03:32.670> seems

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
away from our asphalt effort but seems

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.130 
away from our asphalt effort but seems
like<00:03:33.120> all<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.420> Americans<00:03:33.780> would<00:03:33.870> work<00:03:33.989> pretty

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
like all the Americans would work pretty

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.110 
like all the Americans would work pretty
hard<00:03:34.290> for<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.620> race<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.580> we'll<00:03:35.850> see<00:03:36.000> how<00:03:36.030> it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
hard for this race so we'll see how it

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.380 
hard for this race so we'll see how it
happens<00:03:36.530> certainly<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> x-ray<00:03:38.670> car<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.209> very

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
happens certainly the x-ray car is very

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.510 
happens certainly the x-ray car is very
much<00:03:39.660> set<00:03:39.930> up<00:03:40.050> for<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.320> carpet<00:03:41.070> or<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.190> rugged

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
much set up for the carpet or the rugged

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.130 
much set up for the carpet or the rugged
you<00:03:41.640> Americans<00:03:41.940> call<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.540> foam<00:03:42.840> tires

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
50 a funnel which is obvious but I get

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.820 
50 a funnel which is obvious but I get
interesting<00:05:23.840> really<00:05:23.960> apart<00:05:24.289> from<00:05:24.349> Paula<00:05:24.650> knew

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
interesting really apart from Paula knew

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.350 
interesting really apart from Paula knew
the<00:05:24.949> rest<00:05:25.099> Americans<00:05:25.550> have<00:05:25.639> not<00:05:25.820> done<00:05:25.970> so<00:05:26.030> well

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
the rest Americans have not done so well

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.140 
the rest Americans have not done so well
and<00:05:26.870> we<00:05:26.960> always<00:05:27.139> cut<00:05:27.380> a<00:05:27.409> wave<00:05:27.770> of<00:05:28.070> time<00:05:28.820> to<00:05:29.000> come

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
and we always cut a wave of time to come

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.870 
and we always cut a wave of time to come
over<00:05:29.419> any<00:05:29.630> ideas<00:05:29.930> why<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.289> think<00:05:31.280> a<00:05:31.550> lot<00:05:31.699> of<00:05:31.729> a

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
over any ideas why I think a lot of a

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.580 
over any ideas why I think a lot of a
lot<00:05:32.240> of<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.389> racing<00:05:32.659> in<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.780> US<00:05:33.020> is<00:05:33.229> done<00:05:33.440> on

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
lot of the racing in the US is done on

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.770 
lot of the racing in the US is done on
carpet<00:05:34.039> so<00:05:34.159> it's<00:05:34.310> a<00:05:34.370> different<00:05:34.849> surface<00:05:35.389> than

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
carpet so it's a different surface than

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.899 
carpet so it's a different surface than
what<00:05:35.930> we're<00:05:36.050> racing<00:05:36.380> on<00:05:36.500> here<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:37.070> a<00:05:37.370> lot<00:05:37.849> of

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
what we're racing on here so a lot of

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.300 
what we're racing on here so a lot of
the<00:05:38.030> specialists<00:05:38.690> for<00:05:38.810> carpet<00:05:39.289> struggle<00:05:40.190> on

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
the specialists for carpet struggle on

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.890 
the specialists for carpet struggle on
this<00:05:40.460> type<00:05:40.639> of<00:05:40.669> surface<00:05:41.180> I<00:05:41.300> don't<00:05:41.599> really<00:05:41.780> have

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
this type of surface I don't really have

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.170 
this type of surface I don't really have
a<00:05:42.080> specialty<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:42.949> I<00:05:43.039> typically<00:05:43.729> don't<00:05:43.940> raise

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
a specialty and I typically don't raise

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.120 
a specialty and I typically don't raise
carpet<00:05:44.659> so<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:45.169> don't<00:05:45.620> have<00:05:45.710> any<00:05:45.889> preconceived

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130
