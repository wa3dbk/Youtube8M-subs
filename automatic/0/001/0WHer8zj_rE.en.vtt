hi my name is Nick Tam and I'm going to
show<00:00:02.399> you<00:00:02.429> my<00:00:03.000> plectrum<00:00:03.600> picking<00:00:04.020> style<00:00:04.350> for

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
show you my plectrum picking style for

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.909 
show you my plectrum picking style for
my<00:00:05.190> 12<00:00:05.490> string<00:00:06.049> I'll<00:00:07.049> just<00:00:07.290> angle<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.649> camera

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
my 12 string I'll just angle a camera

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.570 
my 12 string I'll just angle a camera
down<00:00:08.040> here<00:00:08.900> I'm<00:00:09.900> going<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.170> use<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.710> couple<00:00:11.460> of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
down here I'm going to use a couple of

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.209 
down here I'm going to use a couple of
different<00:00:12.000> techniques<00:00:12.410> I'll<00:00:13.410> take<00:00:14.130> you

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
different techniques I'll take you

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.289 
different techniques I'll take you
through<00:00:14.280> them<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.670> left<00:00:14.910> hand<00:00:15.120> technique

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
through them of my left hand technique

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.450 
through them of my left hand technique
lumineer<00:00:15.900> my<00:00:16.350> right<00:00:16.560> hand<00:00:16.830> technique

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
lumineer my right hand technique

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.490 
lumineer my right hand technique
it's<00:00:17.670> basically<00:00:18.029> striking<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
it's basically striking the one of the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.200 
it's basically striking the one of the
base<00:00:19.680> strings<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:23.240> individually<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:25.019> then

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
base strings here individually and then

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.720 
base strings here individually and then
kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.359> strum<00:00:27.720> they're<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.170> there<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
kind of a strum they're on there on the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.870 
kind of a strum they're on there on the
higher<00:00:30.090> strings<00:00:30.420> there<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.189> to<00:00:32.189> practice<00:00:32.399> this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
higher strings there so to practice this

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.190 
higher strings there so to practice this
kind<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.210> technique<00:00:33.540> without<00:00:33.870> using<00:00:34.170> your

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
kind of technique without using your

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.660 
kind of technique without using your
left<00:00:34.410> hand<00:00:34.500> excited<00:00:35.040> voice<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.460> want<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
left hand excited voice if you want to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.180 
left hand excited voice if you want to
if<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.239> want<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.450> improve<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.500> right<00:00:37.950> hand

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
if you want to improve your right hand

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.560 
if you want to improve your right hand
technique<00:00:38.370> then<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.000> need<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> leave

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
technique then you really need to leave

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.410 
technique then you really need to leave
your<00:00:39.780> left<00:00:39.930> hand<00:00:40.170> alone<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> while<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.610> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
your left hand alone for a while just so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:56.389 
your left hand alone for a while just so
you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.719> their<00:00:42.870> young<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.890> basics

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.590 

okay<00:00:57.399> so<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.670> practice<00:00:58.059> it<00:00:58.210> sounds<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.480> little

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
okay so the practice it sounds a little

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.849 
okay so the practice it sounds a little
bit<00:00:58.809> awkward<00:00:58.989> because<00:00:59.320> I'm<00:00:59.530> not<00:00:59.649> actually

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
bit awkward because I'm not actually

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
bit awkward because I'm not actually
playing<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.370> court

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
playing in court

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:21.180 
playing in court
but<00:01:01.239> I'm<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.840> all<00:01:19.960> you're<00:01:20.140> doing<00:01:20.190> you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
but I'm just so all you're doing you

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.350 
but I'm just so all you're doing you
just<00:01:21.399> got<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.610> kind<00:01:21.729> of<00:01:21.820> keep<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.180> rhythm

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
just got to kind of keep the rhythm

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.690 
just got to kind of keep the rhythm
going<00:01:22.509> but<00:01:23.229> it's<00:01:23.350> just<00:01:23.470> kissing<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.399> string

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
going but it's just kissing a string

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.370 
going but it's just kissing a string
here<00:01:24.940> an<00:01:25.210> individual<00:01:25.659> string<00:01:25.899> here<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.170> then

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
here an individual string here and then

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.219 
here an individual string here and then
some<00:01:27.310> kind<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.640> strum<00:01:28.000> here<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.420> make<00:01:28.960> your<00:01:29.110> own

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
some kind of strum here so make your own

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.690 
some kind of strum here so make your own
up<00:01:29.409> if<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.649> like<00:01:29.830> it's<00:01:30.069> not<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.399> can<00:01:30.550> follow

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
up if you like it's not you can follow

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:54.590 
up if you like it's not you can follow
this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.360 

okay<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> second<00:01:56.560> part<00:01:56.740> once<00:01:57.100> you've<00:01:57.250> got

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
okay so the second part once you've got

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.500 
okay so the second part once you've got
the<00:01:57.460> kind<00:01:57.550> of<00:01:57.670> got<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.850> hang<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.270> which

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
the kind of got the hang of that which

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.650 
the kind of got the hang of that which
depending<00:01:59.440> on<00:01:59.500> how<00:01:59.590> much<00:01:59.740> practice<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.190> do

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
depending on how much practice you do

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.840 
depending on how much practice you do
well<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:02.500> amount<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.740> practice<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.190> do<00:02:03.370> will

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
well the amount of practice you do will

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.630 
well the amount of practice you do will
show<00:02:04.230> how<00:02:05.230> far<00:02:05.590> I'm<00:02:06.040> not<00:02:06.070> putting<00:02:06.370> this<00:02:06.430> very

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
show how far I'm not putting this very

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.609 
show how far I'm not putting this very
well<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.210> more<00:02:07.360> practice<00:02:07.690> you<00:02:07.720> do<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.320> easier

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
well the more practice you do the easier

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.030 
well the more practice you do the easier
it<00:02:08.740> gets

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
it gets

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.889 
it gets
that's<00:02:09.310> what<00:02:09.460> I'm<00:02:09.520> trying<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.729> say<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.810> I'm

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
that's what I'm trying to say so I'm

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.780 
that's what I'm trying to say so I'm
going<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.080> use<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.350> chord<00:02:11.650> here<00:02:11.970> which<00:02:12.970> is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
going to use this chord here which is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.430 
going to use this chord here which is
like<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.820> classic<00:02:16.120> Jimi<00:02:16.600> Hendrix<00:02:16.990> chord<00:02:19.440> it's

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
like a classic Jimi Hendrix chord it's

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.380 
like a classic Jimi Hendrix chord it's
kind<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.040> learnt<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.610> as<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> be<00:02:21.970> seven

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
kind of like I learnt it as a be seven

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.260 
kind of like I learnt it as a be seven
years<00:02:22.420> ago<00:02:22.840> yeah

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.150 

a<00:02:27.280> b7<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.670> can<00:02:28.910> put<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.150> anywhere<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.620> do

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.890 

you<00:02:34.160> have<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.430> make<00:02:34.580> sure<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:35.420> if<00:02:35.660> you're

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
you have to make sure that if you're

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.750 
you have to make sure that if you're
playing<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.440> here<00:02:37.030> yeah<00:02:39.520> but<00:02:40.520> you're<00:02:40.640> not

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
playing it here yeah but you're not

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.520 
playing it here yeah but you're not
playing<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.180> equal<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.840> ain't<00:02:42.080> no<00:02:42.230> here

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
playing this equal this ain't no here

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.709 
playing this equal this ain't no here
yeah<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.430> you've<00:02:43.700> got<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.880> start<00:02:44.090> with<00:02:44.180> that

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:46.719 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.129 

yeah<00:02:47.719> it<00:02:47.989> sounds<00:02:48.379> a<00:02:48.409> bit<00:02:48.439> dis<00:02:48.709> cooler<00:02:49.870> yeah<00:02:50.870> but

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
yeah it sounds a bit dis cooler yeah but

00:02:51.139 --> 00:03:07.600 
yeah it sounds a bit dis cooler yeah but
if<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.260> put

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.100 

yeah<00:03:08.610> doesn't<00:03:09.450> sound<00:03:09.629> too<00:03:09.780> bad

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
yeah doesn't sound too bad

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.220 
yeah doesn't sound too bad
right<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.730> there's<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.150> little<00:03:12.360> subtle

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
right so this there's a little subtle

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.740 
right so this there's a little subtle
difference<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.830> do<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> lot<00:03:15.599> of<00:03:15.629> other

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
difference I do to a lot of other

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.330 
difference I do to a lot of other
guitarists<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.739> might<00:03:16.920> not<00:03:17.069> notice

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
guitarists that you might not notice

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.190 
guitarists that you might not notice
straightaway<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.390> basically<00:03:18.840> I'm<00:03:19.050> just

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
straightaway but basically I'm just

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.180 
straightaway but basically I'm just
going<00:03:19.319> to<00:03:19.349> show<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.709> little<00:03:19.769> technique

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
going to show you this little technique

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:39.410 
going to show you this little technique
so<00:03:20.849> you're<00:03:20.970> going<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> go<00:03:21.300> from<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.569> here<00:03:38.420> yeah

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
so you're going to go from the here yeah

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.600 
so you're going to go from the here yeah
okay<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:40.170> run<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.739> through<00:03:41.069> a<00:03:41.190> few<00:03:41.430> times

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
okay so run that through a few times

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.539 
okay so run that through a few times
when<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:41.849> get<00:03:42.060> confident<00:03:42.599> with<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:43.549> then

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
when you get confident with that then

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.400 
when you get confident with that then
you<00:03:44.730> can<00:03:44.880> try<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.180> thing<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.690> started

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
you can try the thing that I started

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.160 
you can try the thing that I started
doing<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.739> few<00:03:46.769> years<00:03:47.099> ago<00:03:47.220> by<00:03:47.849> accident<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.989> as

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
doing a few years ago by accident and as

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.380 
doing a few years ago by accident and as
I<00:03:49.260> said<00:03:49.470> before<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:50.010> other<00:03:50.220> lessons<00:03:50.459> if<00:03:51.209> you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
I said before in other lessons if you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.759 
I said before in other lessons if you
make<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.569> mistake<00:03:51.750> when<00:03:52.319> you're<00:03:52.440> doing<00:03:52.650> on

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
make a mistake when you're doing on

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.530 
make a mistake when you're doing on
these<00:03:52.920> exercises<00:03:53.130> don't<00:03:53.819> stop<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.299> start

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
these exercises don't stop and start

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.420 
these exercises don't stop and start
again<00:03:54.599> remember<00:03:55.349> that<00:03:55.470> mistake<00:03:55.799> maybe<00:03:55.980> play<00:03:56.400> a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
again remember that mistake maybe play a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.789 
again remember that mistake maybe play a
games<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.910> might<00:03:57.120> find<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.480> useful<00:03:57.799> when

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
games you might find it useful when

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.190 
games you might find it useful when
you're<00:03:58.920> playing<00:03:59.160> this<00:03:59.310> chord<00:04:03.200> I'm

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
you're playing this chord I'm

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.259 
you're playing this chord I'm
exaggerating<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.069> hear<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.610> player<00:04:05.880> don't

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
exaggerating you hear the player don't

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:23.760 
exaggerating you hear the player don't
be<00:04:06.420> afraid<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.290> playing<00:04:07.530> okay

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.870 

and<00:04:24.770> if<00:04:24.890> you<00:04:25.010> find<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.340> can<00:04:25.460> pick<00:04:25.580> up<00:04:25.670> some

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
and if you find you can pick up some

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.760 
and if you find you can pick up some
special<00:04:26.150> little<00:04:26.450> nuances<00:04:27.080> sometimes<00:04:27.530> and

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
special little nuances sometimes and

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.370 
special little nuances sometimes and
some<00:04:28.100> bits<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.460> pieces<00:04:28.640> that<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:29.260> can<00:04:30.260> often

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
some bits and pieces that I can often

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.600 
some bits and pieces that I can often
make<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.740> sound<00:04:30.920> a<00:04:31.070> little<00:04:31.220> bit<00:04:31.490> better

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
make it sound a little bit better

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.460 
make it sound a little bit better
especially<00:04:32.240> if<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.720> speed<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.080> up

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
especially if you speed it up

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.320 
especially if you speed it up
with<00:04:33.740> all<00:04:33.860> these<00:04:34.010> things<00:04:34.210> all<00:04:35.210> these

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
exercises that you do start off fast and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:05:17.500 
exercises that you do start off fast and
slow<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.600> then<00:04:38.660> speed<00:04:38.870> them<00:04:39.350> up

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.720
