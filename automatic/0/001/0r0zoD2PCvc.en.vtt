00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.130
 good these kids twitters again 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.689
 here in gt in the new gta 5 guide in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 which I will show you how to buy 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.380
 properties totally free I'm going to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.360
 make a distinction between the two types 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.640
 of our types of qualities there 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.140
 one are those that give us benefits like 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.000
 the sport sport where I attack the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 heliport boats a decree after what 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.530
 which park the helicopters and so on 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 then there are the others who are the ones 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 give money then start with the most 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 simple ones that are the ones that give us money 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.470
 those that are directly to park 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.240
 things 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.070
 in this case I'm going to take the porte 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.680
 sporty and this trick is the easiest 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.720
 all we need to get ahead 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.080
 of the poster where the property is purchased 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.380
 go running all the time by pressing x on 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.870
 play 3 does the conversion to xbox and 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.040
 at the same time we feel give the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.290
 pad address to the city of all the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 time with point without stopping or 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 We are buying while we are 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.479
 running vale 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.189
 As you can see I get the pasta 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.890
 you have already seen the pasta that I have 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.289
 is specific milk which I do not I 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.990
 the trick goes well and now if they run 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:27.479
 all the time they use others to the right and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.890
 we can see and I do not leave to buy it 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.799
 anchor biopsy as if there 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.869
 bought and now it can be like 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.929
 you will understand then we do not have anything left 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.640
 pasta or tennessee up the right and it's 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.460
 super simple they do not have any kind of 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 science and the only thing that is needed is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.200
 have the pasta to buy it is to say 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.720
 that if it costs a million and you have 500 thousand 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 we do not always go with the next guy 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.360
 of properties that are the ones that cost 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.009
 pasta and they give us pasta worth every week 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.270
 this trick also very simple that is 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.490
 a little takes a little more time 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.189
 doing it is not very simple we have to 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.750
 give it to buy and once it makes us 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.580
 the kinematics that we bought it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.580
 we press be quickly 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.960
 and we're going to start 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.060
 and once we played games we're going to 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.290
 repeat mission and we go to the pet that 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.640
 there is that of masks is worth 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.770
 only buy three masks already 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.790
 took off from the mission then once 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.410
 we have repeated when we go out to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.300
 main menu 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.510
 head the game where we were 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.390
 before we will see that we have bought the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.580
 property without spending any money worth 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.430
 in this case because if the property that 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.890
 was 750 thousand I think I remember and I have not 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.510
 spent not a hard ticket you can look at the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.790
 video again at the moment I pulse 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.920
 be to know the pasta that I have to 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.410
 I had before and the one I have now is worth 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.020
 very simple this trick does not entail 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.760
 No risk is not going to hog us 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.530
 the trophies for using the unit for the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.330
 style and it's a good trick to buy 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.310
 small cities are worth taking away 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.020
 pasta and they do not help us much to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.330
 be able to buy the ones that cost 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.800
 they cost them a million more so nothing 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.660
 more I hope you liked this 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.050
 trick and see you in the next life of 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.050
 Card 5 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.700
 yes
