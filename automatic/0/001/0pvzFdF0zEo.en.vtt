done whoever made the longest word gets
one<00:02:36.070> chip<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.210> so<00:02:37.390> let's<00:02:37.690> say<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.930> longest

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
one chip so so let's say the longest

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.710 
one chip so so let's say the longest
word<00:02:38.470> was<00:02:38.650> over<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.460> then<00:02:40.210> whoever<00:02:40.510> has

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
word was over here and then whoever has

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.040 
word was over here and then whoever has
the<00:02:40.960> word<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.830> gets<00:02:41.950> voted<00:02:42.340> as<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.700> best<00:02:43.050> buy

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050

that<00:02:44.350> player<00:02:44.760> gets<00:02:45.760> three<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.680> let's<00:02:47.860> say

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
that player gets three and so let's say

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.420 
that player gets three and so let's say
tide<00:02:48.310> was<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.700> best<00:02:48.940> word<00:02:49.740> i'll<00:02:50.740> get<00:02:51.130> three

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.890 
people who did not enjoy the game as
much<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.729> I<00:04:37.240> can<00:04:37.419> understand

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
much and I can understand

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.020 
much and I can understand
why<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.560> know<00:04:38.620> there<00:04:38.949> were<00:04:39.040> some<00:04:39.759> people

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
why and I know there were some people

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.659 
why and I know there were some people
thought<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:41.680> fact<00:04:41.919> that<00:04:42.009> someone

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
thought that the the fact that someone

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.960 
thought that the the fact that someone
the<00:04:42.910> slowest<00:04:43.389> player<00:04:43.600> basically<00:04:44.380> each<00:04:44.530> round

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
the slowest player basically each round

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.060 
the slowest player basically each round
picks<00:04:45.970> who<00:04:46.150> they<00:04:46.300> get<00:04:46.479> chips<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.990> could<00:04:47.770> turn

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
picks who they get chips to could turn

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.820 
picks who they get chips to could turn
into<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.759> kingmaker<00:04:49.449> scenario<00:04:50.380> where<00:04:50.650> if

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
into a kingmaker scenario where if

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.260 
into a kingmaker scenario where if
someone<00:04:51.070> else's<00:04:51.490> more<00:04:51.699> chips<00:04:52.000> than<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.210> do

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
someone else's more chips than I do

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.420 
someone else's more chips than I do
right<00:04:52.449> now<00:04:52.810> well<00:04:53.080> guess<00:04:53.289> what<00:04:53.470> your<00:04:53.860> word<00:04:54.190> was

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
right now well guess what your word was

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.629 
right now well guess what your word was
not<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.789> best<00:04:55.000> word<00:04:55.330> but<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.370> agree<00:04:57.610> with

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
not the best word but and I agree with

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.390 
not the best word but and I agree with
that<00:04:57.729> that's<00:04:58.060> true<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.419> could<00:04:58.600> do<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:59.400> but

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
that that's true you could do that but

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.960 
that that's true you could do that but
ultimately<00:05:00.970> that<00:05:01.240> is<00:05:01.500> against<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:03.400> spirit<00:05:03.430> of

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
ultimately that is against the spirit of

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.790 
ultimately that is against the spirit of
the<00:05:04.030> game<00:05:04.330> in<00:05:04.570> my<00:05:04.750> opinion<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.410> think<00:05:05.710> you

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
the game in my opinion and I think you

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.129 
the game in my opinion and I think you
simply<00:05:06.160> just<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:07.090> don't<00:05:07.300> do<00:05:07.539> that<00:05:07.750> you<00:05:08.020> know

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
simply just just don't do that you know

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.670 
simply just just don't do that you know
just<00:05:08.800> play<00:05:09.100> the<00:05:09.310> game<00:05:09.340> have<00:05:09.910> fun<00:05:10.210> with<00:05:10.389> it

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680
