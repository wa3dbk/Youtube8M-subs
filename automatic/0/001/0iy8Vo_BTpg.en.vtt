 satellite and cable the words of them are added to a string of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.910
 ideas and saw accentuated issue that is discussed since the year 2000 however 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.500

 stiff legislative bodies the government has been working we are practically

 to send to the national congress to Sweden its legislative 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.930
 who are neither necessary for digital television to develop 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.140
 the main beneficiaries of digital television 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 only local and regional media that with this modality will be able to compete 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.290
 equal to the same with the country's large service stations 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.070
 it's essential 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.650
 - Strengthen kit protect development of regional media development 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.979
 the local media to make democracy our country effectively 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.510
 can be strengthened and for citizens to peron space for 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.420
 your own daily concerns juan have of response is why you 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.220
 We have been working on what this bill is contemplating 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.840
 one or a suitable space to develop regional television of the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.830
 prison community mission site in this way the efforts 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.220
 of the telecommunications subsecretary aim to carry out the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.400
 best choice regarding Mexican film standards 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.729
 that will be taken to implement in the country 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.729
 In this regard veiga affirms that several South American countries study 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.310
 possibility of imputation for a signal altogether Chile can not be that a country 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.490
 isolated in latin america good as we do not suit us from any 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.429
 but it is not any point of view 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.939
 and that's why we've taken a little more time to be able to be a 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.299
 combination stanzas country of the region that are 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.319
 in the same process as Chile 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.719
 and to start with them if you then finally choose a joint solution 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.519
 a common criminal because that would allow us to have lower prices of 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.819
 equipment that makes the transition easier 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.989
 the former mayor as inn shared technology that effort those 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.339
 investors do not put it worth the forum so much 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:49.259
 We maintain our commitment that digital television in Chile be 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.469

 bandaged in the past year 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.849
 all three are slight rises today 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.529
 currently a quarter sets the Chinese standard 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.609

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.599
 very important technology none of the three schools analyzed until the 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.149
 date have an advantage that they do not 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:17.019
 obviously the preferred one for ohl better for chile and part of the 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.420
 difficulty that we have is that 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.500
 to this technical elements there are economic elements of social elements 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.770
 in which Carlos Andres Perez for 3 and 10 hits strengths and weaknesses of 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.940
 which will depend on the future of the Brazilian national team in his career 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.790
