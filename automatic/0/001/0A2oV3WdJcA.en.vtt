00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 painful hold 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.490
 smooth transition from one reception to 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.440
 another forming a continuous circuit 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.450
 attacking and defensive actions 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.180
 provides practically steel 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.350
 contact with opponents not giving him no 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.890
 instant respite blow alternates 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.260
 capture capture goes into the cast 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.260
 again a pang infringement and so on 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.910
 actions subordinate to this principle 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.520
 must be strictly rational and 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.470
 cost-effective otherwise continuous work 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.820
 will lead the ninja to premature 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.130
 fatigue and defeat should not be too 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.890
 delay the fight should strive 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.750
 reduce it to the minimum time not 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.460
 should also try to complete 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.310
 each reception if for example the opponent 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.290
 grabbed your hand and for freeing you 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.960
 used to turn the opponent's hand 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.120
 out emoto clerks but before you 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.950
 managed to hold his opponent let go 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.680
 capture should not try to continue 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.780
 reception because your goal was 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.880
 release from capture they are working out 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.440
 basic motion one of the following 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.240
 action may be hit 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.940
 a free hand with a sequel 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.640
 depending on opponents successful 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.470
 use of this principle is achieved 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.600
 wide variety of equipment 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.700
 used ninja in combat as well 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.190
 mental and physical looseness 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.510
 this can be achieved only long 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.600
 hard practice 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.070
 principle on the mountains as well as others
