because of all the rice but I'm kind of

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.699 
because of all the rice but I'm kind of
curious<00:03:12.850> if<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.270> one<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.660> 49<00:03:14.200> percent<00:03:14.530> rice

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709

curious if this one is 49 percent rice
like<00:03:15.010> regular<00:03:15.459> bud<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:16.150> would<00:03:16.750> actually<00:03:16.900> be

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
like regular bud I would actually be

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.759 
like regular bud I would actually be
very<00:03:17.350> curious<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.770> know<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.160> let's<00:03:19.000> try<00:03:19.209> it

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.020 

it's<00:03:23.769> very<00:03:24.040> much<00:03:24.250> lighter<00:03:24.519> than<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.820> normal

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030

it's very much lighter than the normal
beer<00:03:25.239> yeah<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.400> would<00:03:27.519> say<00:03:27.790> there's<00:03:28.000> at

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
beer yeah so I would say there's at

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.030 
beer yeah so I would say there's at
least<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:28.900> thirty<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.350> forty<00:03:29.590> percent<00:03:29.709> rice

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040
