so this is the map here's just a little

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.229 
so this is the map here's just a little
overview<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> map<00:01:01.829> let<00:01:02.460> me<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:03.030> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
overview of the map let me just go like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.410 
overview of the map let me just go like
a<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.539> 360<00:01:04.080> right<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:06.119> are<00:01:06.390> the

something I don't know I thought that
was<00:03:04.219> kind<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.430> clever<00:03:06.219> this<00:03:07.219> is<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.459> drive-thru

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
was kind of clever this is a drive-thru

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.629 
was kind of clever this is a drive-thru
area<00:03:08.359> actually<00:03:08.629> so<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.799> is<00:03:09.950> like<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
area actually so this is like the the

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.550 
area actually so this is like the the
first<00:03:10.909> stop<00:03:11.180> where<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.599> pay<00:03:11.959> for<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.439> then

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
first stop where you pay for it and then

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.179 
first stop where you pay for it and then
this<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.769> where<00:03:12.919> you<00:03:13.040> get<00:03:13.159> your<00:03:13.280> food<00:03:15.010> into<00:03:16.010> the

we're gonna get out of here and we're
gonna<00:03:49.959> just<00:03:50.470> take<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.069> look<00:03:51.689> these<00:03:52.689> are<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
gonna just take a look these are the

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.259 
gonna just take a look these are the
three<00:03:53.260> main<00:03:53.470> towers<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.430> where<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> guess

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
three main towers this is where I guess

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.990 
three main towers this is where I guess
most<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.200> hiding<00:03:56.560> will<00:03:56.680> take<00:03:56.890> place<00:03:57.159> on<00:03:57.519> I

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
most of the hiding will take place on I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.610 
most of the hiding will take place on I
think<00:03:59.670> here<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.849> think<00:04:01.269> more<00:04:01.900> hiding<00:04:02.140> will<00:04:02.409> take

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
think here I think more hiding will take

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.979 
think here I think more hiding will take
place<00:04:02.829> I<00:04:03.220> don't<00:04:03.940> want<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.120> give<00:04:04.299> away<00:04:04.329> really

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
place I don't want to give away really

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.500 
place I don't want to give away really
any<00:04:05.170> hiding<00:04:05.590> spots<00:04:05.890> but<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:07.150> can<00:04:07.299> see<00:04:07.480> that

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
any hiding spots but you can see that

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
single-shot DMR would do best against

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.900 
single-shot DMR would do best against
the<00:04:31.350> flood<00:04:32.350> as<00:04:32.590> they<00:04:32.949> come<00:04:33.490> out<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.669> their

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
the flood as they come out of their

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.320 
spawn you know here's the spawn
now<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:38.219> Alpha<00:04:39.219> zombie<00:04:39.639> i<00:04:39.849> don't<00:04:40.089> think<00:04:40.240> i

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
now the Alpha zombie i don't think i

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.149 
now the Alpha zombie i don't think i
actually<00:04:40.479> have<00:04:40.779> alpha<00:04:41.110> zombies<00:04:41.439> on<00:04:41.620> but<00:04:41.949> the

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
actually have alpha zombies on but the

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.070 
actually have alpha zombies on but the
zombies<00:04:42.520> spawn<00:04:42.849> in<00:04:42.999> here<00:04:43.270> there's<00:04:43.479> one<00:04:43.809> per

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
zombies spawn in here there's one per

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.459 
zombies spawn in here there's one per
game<00:04:44.580> starts<00:04:45.580> off<00:04:45.669> with<00:04:45.879> one<00:04:46.089> and<00:04:46.409> here's<00:04:47.409> a

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:47.469 
game starts off with one and here's a

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.519 
game starts off with one and here's a
man<00:04:47.740> cannon<00:04:48.189> and<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.909> spawns<00:04:49.479> 30<00:04:50.020> seconds

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:50.529 
man cannon and this spawns 30 seconds

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.219 
man cannon and this spawns 30 seconds
into<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.860> game<00:04:50.889> so<00:04:51.819> it<00:04:52.210> gives<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:53.080> people

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
into the game so it gives the people

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.850 
into the game so it gives the people
down<00:04:53.650> here<00:04:53.979> time<00:04:54.309> to<00:04:54.490> go<00:04:54.669> find<00:04:55.089> a<00:04:55.960> spot<00:04:56.529> and<00:04:56.559> a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
down here time to go find a spot and a

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.149 
down here time to go find a spot and a
weapon<00:04:57.249> or<00:04:57.610> something<00:04:58.059> that<00:04:58.180> they<00:04:58.300> can<00:04:58.479> use<00:04:58.509> to

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
weapon or something that they can use to

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.379 
weapon or something that they can use to
defend<00:05:00.159> themselves<00:05:00.370> against<00:05:00.819> the<00:05:00.939> flood<00:05:01.150> and

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
defend themselves against the flood and

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.450 
defend themselves against the flood and
then<00:05:01.900> 30<00:05:02.139> seconds<00:05:02.529> passes<00:05:02.949> and<00:05:03.129> this<00:05:03.279> thing

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
then 30 seconds passes and this thing

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.959 
then 30 seconds passes and this thing
spawns<00:05:03.789> and<00:05:04.059> then<00:05:04.719> you<00:05:04.930> can<00:05:05.080> see<00:05:05.409> that<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:06.550> made

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
spawns and then you can see that I made

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.230 
spawns and then you can see that I made
it<00:05:07.120> so<00:05:07.300> that<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:08.319> will<00:05:08.559> just<00:05:09.069> barely<00:05:09.610> shoot<00:05:10.089> you

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
it so that it will just barely shoot you

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.269 
it so that it will just barely shoot you
over<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.599> glass<00:05:10.809> okay<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.469> was<00:05:11.559> a<00:05:11.589> bad<00:05:11.830> that

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:12.279 
over the glass okay that was a bad that

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.929 
over the glass okay that was a bad that
was<00:05:12.370> bad<00:05:12.399> one<00:05:13.229> just<00:05:14.229> like<00:05:14.349> that<00:05:14.409> and<00:05:14.939> then

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
was bad one just like that and then

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.600 
was bad one just like that and then
you'll<00:05:16.089> be<00:05:16.120> shot<00:05:16.419> down<00:05:16.629> here<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:17.460> then<00:05:18.460> the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
you'll be shot down here and then the

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.869 
you'll be shot down here and then the
fighting<00:05:18.999> begins<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.629> then<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:21.460> zombies

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
fighting begins and then the zombies

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.739 
fighting begins and then the zombies
have<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.539> think<00:05:23.159> 150<00:05:24.159> movement<00:05:25.149> or<00:05:25.330> two<00:05:25.539> hundred

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:25.749 
have I think 150 movement or two hundred

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.189 
have I think 150 movement or two hundred
percent<00:05:26.259> movement<00:05:26.649> and<00:05:27.719> they<00:05:28.719> can<00:05:28.899> jump<00:05:29.110> very

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
percent movement and they can jump very

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.829 
percent movement and they can jump very
high<00:05:29.499> and<00:05:29.949> they're<00:05:30.099> also<00:05:30.279> invisible<00:05:30.839> which

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:31.839 
high and they're also invisible which

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:34.019 
high and they're also invisible which
makes<00:05:32.559> for<00:05:32.649> a<00:05:32.800> great<00:05:33.009> game<00:05:33.399> and<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.849> could<00:05:33.999> be

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
makes for a great game and that could be

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.299 
makes for a great game and that could be
a<00:05:34.120> lot<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.360> fun<00:05:34.449> to<00:05:35.199> get<00:05:35.319> snuck<00:05:35.589> up<00:05:35.740> behind<00:05:35.770> by<00:05:36.279> a
