for<00:01:54.450> me<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.750> thought<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:58.310> think<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.850> fire<00:02:00.149> can

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
for me you thought I think your fire can

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
for me you thought I think your fire can
deflect<00:02:00.840> theirs<00:02:03.800> but<00:02:04.800> I<00:02:04.860> might<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.159> wrong

gotcha

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
gotcha

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.020 
gotcha
I<00:02:50.530> like<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> graphics<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.459> mean<00:02:52.820> they're

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
I like the graphics I mean they're

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.220 
I like the graphics I mean they're
they're<00:02:53.480> quite<00:02:53.750> simple<00:02:54.320> but<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:56.690> animated

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
they're quite simple but the animated

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.660 
they're quite simple but the animated
background<00:02:57.739> makes<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.069> change<00:02:58.370> because

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
background makes the change because

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.310 
background makes the change because
quite<00:02:58.820> often<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.239> games<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.720> background<00:03:00.140> is

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
quite often on games the background is

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.210 
quite often on games the background is
just<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.680> static<00:03:01.220> well<00:03:02.590> image<00:03:03.590> with<00:03:04.190> no

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
just a static well image with no

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.540 
just a static well image with no
movement<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.959> scaling<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.739> these<00:03:06.920> pillars<00:03:07.250> is

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
movement the scaling on these pillars is

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.610 
movement the scaling on these pillars is
good<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:08.060> don't<00:03:08.300> know<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.810> for<00:03:09.019> sprite<00:03:09.440> or

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
good I don't know if that for sprite or

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.490 
good I don't know if that for sprite or
a<00:03:09.880> polygon<00:03:10.880> but<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.900> works<00:03:12.170> really<00:03:12.410> well

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
a polygon but it it works really well

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.110 
a polygon but it it works really well
and<00:03:12.739> if<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> polygon<00:03:13.640> well<00:03:13.850> it's<00:03:13.970> good

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
and if it is a polygon well it's good

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.310 
and if it is a polygon well it's good
because<00:03:14.269> it's<00:03:14.540> shaded<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:17.239> is<00:03:17.450> impressive<00:03:17.900> and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
because it's shaded it is impressive and

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.880 
because it's shaded it is impressive and
the<00:03:19.160> framerate<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.910> excellent<00:03:23.080> yeah<00:03:24.080> I'm<00:03:24.709> over

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
the framerate is excellent yeah I'm over

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.670 
the framerate is excellent yeah I'm over
here

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.810 

yeah<00:03:32.970> there<00:03:33.970> are<00:03:34.000> levels<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:35.170> can<00:03:35.640> get<00:03:36.640> off

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
yeah there are levels you can get off

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.220 
yeah there are levels you can get off
this<00:03:37.060> level<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:39.030> when<00:03:40.030> these<00:03:40.300> enemy<00:03:40.960> ships

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
this level you when these enemy ships

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.360 
this level you when these enemy ships
appear<00:03:41.650> they<00:03:41.890> come<00:03:42.130> out<00:03:42.160> Oh<00:03:42.610> God<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.980> reminds

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
me of battle zone very much here we go

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.700 
me of battle zone very much here we go
there<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.710> white<00:03:47.980> portal<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.850> is<00:03:49.180> an<00:03:49.710> enemy

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
there that white portal that is an enemy

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.890 
there that white portal that is an enemy
appearing<00:03:51.310> from<00:03:51.670> wherever<00:03:52.510> they're

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
appearing from wherever they're

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.250 
appearing from wherever they're
appearing<00:03:53.410> from<00:03:54.270> another<00:03:55.270> dimension<00:03:55.570> or<00:03:56.110> is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
appearing from another dimension or is

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.860 
appearing from another dimension or is
it<00:03:56.380> like<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:58.560> warp<00:03:59.560> gate<00:03:59.920> who<00:04:00.190> knows<00:04:00.690> but<00:04:01.690> that's

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
it like a warp gate who knows but that's

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.390 
it like a warp gate who knows but that's
where<00:04:02.020> they<00:04:02.140> come<00:04:02.320> from<00:04:02.380> so<00:04:02.950> if<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.130> see<00:04:03.280> one

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
where they come from so if you see one

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.430 
where they come from so if you see one
of<00:04:03.490> those<00:04:03.580> white<00:04:04.270> before<00:04:04.540> all<00:04:04.930> this<00:04:05.170> worth

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
of those white before all this worth

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.380 
of those white before all this worth
like<00:04:05.770> aiming<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.370> its<00:04:06.490> general<00:04:06.820> direction<00:04:06.970> and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
like aiming in its general direction and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.900 
like aiming in its general direction and
firing<00:04:07.810> but<00:04:08.590> equally<00:04:08.950> at<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.520> end<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.820> the

firing but equally at the end of the

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.550 
firing but equally at the end of the
round<00:04:10.710> you'll<00:04:11.710> get<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.890> black<00:04:12.220> portal<00:04:13.230> turns<00:04:14.230> up

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
round you'll get a black portal turns up

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.070 
round you'll get a black portal turns up
and<00:04:14.800> you<00:04:15.010> go<00:04:15.190> through<00:04:15.490> that<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.030> then<00:04:16.080> there's

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
and you go through that and then there's

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.140 
and you go through that and then there's
a<00:04:17.140> bit<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:17.440> like<00:04:17.760> traveling<00:04:18.760> through<00:04:18.970> space

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
a bit of like traveling through space

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.250 
a bit of like traveling through space
avoiding<00:04:19.810> asteroids<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.500> crap<00:04:22.050> not<00:04:23.050> quite

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
avoiding asteroids in the crap not quite

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.210 
avoiding asteroids in the crap not quite
sure<00:04:23.290> how<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.620> crap<00:04:23.890> got<00:04:24.160> there

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
sure how the crap got there

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.560 
sure how the crap got there
spaceships<00:04:27.220> flushing<00:04:27.820> their<00:04:28.000> toilets<00:04:28.420> out

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
spaceships flushing their toilets out

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.550 
spaceships flushing their toilets out
into<00:04:28.900> space<00:04:29.020> kind<00:04:29.470> of<00:04:29.620> like<00:04:29.770> our<00:04:31.560> trains

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
into space kind of like our trains

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.530 
into space kind of like our trains
flushing<00:04:33.010> onto<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.340> line<00:04:33.580> do<00:04:33.940> they<00:04:34.060> still<00:04:34.360> do

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
flushing onto the line do they still do

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.439 
flushing onto the line do they still do
that

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:52.019 

there<00:04:41.110> we<00:04:41.199> go<00:04:49.409> yeah<00:04:50.409> this<00:04:51.099> is<00:04:51.309> impressive<00:04:51.490> as

there we go yeah this is impressive as

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.830 
there we go yeah this is impressive as
well<00:04:52.210> as<00:04:52.599> visually<00:04:53.139> very<00:04:53.710> effective

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
well as visually very effective

well as visually very effective
Oh<00:04:56.250> bollocks<00:04:57.760> ah<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:58.930> didn't<00:04:59.230> make<00:04:59.320> it<00:04:59.380> through

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
Oh bollocks ah I didn't make it through

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.129 
Oh bollocks ah I didn't make it through
to<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.830> next<00:04:59.950> level<00:05:00.510> we're<00:05:01.510> gonna<00:05:01.660> kill<00:05:01.900> alert

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
to the next level we're gonna kill alert

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:14.480 
to the next level we're gonna kill alert
more<00:05:03.660> of<00:05:04.660> these<00:05:04.870> geezers<00:05:05.200> now<00:05:10.889> dogs<00:05:11.889> right<00:05:12.340> off

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
more of these geezers now dogs right off

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.290 
more of these geezers now dogs right off
oh<00:05:15.110> it's<00:05:16.110> kind<00:05:16.289> of<00:05:16.349> nice<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:16.979> can<00:05:17.160> outrun

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.909 

you<00:05:21.300> stand<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.630> chance<00:05:21.660> of<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.110> old<00:05:22.349> girl<00:05:22.620> all

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
you stand the chance of the old girl all

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.159 
you stand the chance of the old girl all
ballers<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:24.210> sold<00:05:24.479> us<00:05:24.569> down<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.810> chance<00:05:25.080> of

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
ballers you sold us down the chance of

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.870 
ballers you sold us down the chance of
evading<00:05:25.650> their<00:05:25.800> fire<00:05:26.099> because<00:05:26.490> you're<00:05:26.639> quite

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
evading their fire because you're quite

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:36.939 
evading their fire because you're quite
fast<00:05:28.430> yeah

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.980 

target<00:05:37.949> -<00:05:38.280> I'm<00:05:38.669> guessing<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.300> tells<00:05:39.630> me<00:05:39.840> how

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
target - I'm guessing that tells me how

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.420 
target - I'm guessing that tells me how
many<00:05:40.169> I've<00:05:40.289> gotta<00:05:40.470> kill<00:05:40.650> before<00:05:40.830> I<00:05:41.039> go<00:05:41.220> to<00:05:41.280> the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
many I've gotta kill before I go to the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.920 
many I've gotta kill before I go to the
next<00:05:41.610> level<00:05:41.819> probably<00:05:42.810> where<00:05:43.530> are<00:05:43.710> you<00:05:44.930> when

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
next level probably where are you when

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:53.809 
next level probably where are you when
you<00:05:46.020> go<00:05:46.139> where<00:05:46.440> you<00:05:46.560> know<00:05:46.680> what

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.159 

because<00:05:54.819> you<00:05:54.909> can<00:05:55.090> see<00:05:55.270> them<00:05:55.449> on<00:05:55.509> your<00:05:55.720> radar

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
because you can see them on your radar

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.159 
because you can see them on your radar
you<00:05:56.439> can<00:05:57.659> get<00:05:58.659> into<00:05:58.870> a<00:05:58.900> bit<00:05:59.020> of<00:05:59.080> a

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
you can get into a bit of a

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.459 
you can get into a bit of a
cat-and-mouse<00:05:59.379> thing<00:06:00.960> does<00:06:01.960> they're<00:06:02.139> firing

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
cat-and-mouse thing does they're firing
