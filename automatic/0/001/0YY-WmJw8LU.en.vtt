00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to make a cover page and then the rest

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.300 
to make a cover page and then the rest
of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> deck<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> cards<00:01:14.040> face<00:01:14.280> up

our<00:01:16.530> reasons<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.790> templates

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
our reasons on now there are templates

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.060 
our reasons on now there are templates
for<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.630> online<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> I've<00:01:19.380> linked<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.860> down

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
for this online and I've linked one down

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.710 
for this online and I've linked one down
below<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.540> nice<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
below but I think it's really nice to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.179 
below but I think it's really nice to
write<00:01:21.990> them<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.290> hand<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.950> makes<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
write them by hand and it just makes it

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.920 
write them by hand and it just makes it
a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.549> personal<00:01:23.759> I've<00:01:24.390> chosen<00:01:24.750> some

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
a little more personal I've chosen some

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
a little more personal I've chosen some
gold<00:01:25.530> cardstock<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.460> really<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
gold cardstock that I really like and

think it's a more personal touch to have

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:51.990 
think it's a more personal touch to have
them<00:02:50.830> handwritten<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.430> then<00:02:51.549> print<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.820> out

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
