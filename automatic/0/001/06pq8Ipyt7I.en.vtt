00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it's a bit thicker and heavier than the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.810 
it's a bit thicker and heavier than the
associate<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.350> party<00:01:22.830> well<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> should<00:01:23.790> be

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
associate a party well it should be
