a plectrum most people pick these open
naturally<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:13.469> they<00:00:13.650> hold<00:00:13.860> them<00:00:14.360> just<00:00:15.360> fine

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
naturally that they hold them just fine

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.470 
naturally that they hold them just fine
but<00:00:16.230> there's<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> few<00:00:16.590> things<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:17.490> people<00:00:18.150> do

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that you don't want to do so one of them

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.240 
that you don't want to do so one of them
is<00:00:20.910> putting<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.810> first<00:00:22.230> finger<00:00:22.650> over<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
edge of the pig if you do that then

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.320 
edge of the pig if you do that then
you're<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.109> lose<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.550> control<00:00:30.060> over

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
you're going to lose some control over

the pig that's not what we're looking

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.510 
the pig that's not what we're looking
for<00:00:32.750> holding<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.440> again<00:00:34.860> that's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
for holding it like that again that's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.150 
for holding it like that again that's
not<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.059> too<00:00:36.540> stiff<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.950> what

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
not right is too stiff so really what

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.220 
not right is too stiff so really what
you<00:00:38.280> want<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.760> hook<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.840> finger

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you want to do hook the first finger

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.860 
you want to do hook the first finger
round<00:00:40.670> put<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> pick<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.510> back<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
round put the pick on the back of the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.680 
round put the pick on the back of the
finger<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.530> thumb<00:00:44.010> over<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.850> top<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
finger and then thumb over the top so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.940 
finger and then thumb over the top so
we've<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.640> type<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:48.620> shape<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
we've got this type of shape with the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670 
we've got this type of shape with the
fingers<00:00:50.340> okay<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.329> allows<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.989> pig<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
fingers okay and that allows the pig to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.000 
fingers okay and that allows the pig to
flex<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.170> can<00:00:55.170> move<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.710> down<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
flex and you can move up and down the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.760 
flex and you can move up and down the
pig<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.460> different<00:00:57.090> type<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.260> grip<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
pig for different type of grip on the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.380 
pig for different type of grip on the
pig<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> different<00:01:00.059> sound<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
pig and you can get a different sound of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.049 
pig and you can get a different sound of
your<00:01:00.480> guitar<00:01:00.600> which<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.730> bigger<00:01:02.940> than

assign the thumb to the e a and D

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
assign the thumb to the e a and D
strings<00:01:18.960> these<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> base<00:01:20.369> notes<00:01:20.700> of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
of a thumb down to the a string and keep

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.060 
of a thumb down to the a string and keep
you<00:02:19.150> first<00:02:19.390> second<00:02:19.780> third<00:02:19.990> finger<00:02:20.440> doing

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
you first second third finger doing

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.640 

and<00:02:28.480> then<00:02:28.600> we<00:02:28.660> can<00:02:28.810> do<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.990> same<00:02:29.170> thing<00:02:29.440> drop

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650

and you can keep practicing that and
grow<00:02:38.050> through<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.379> like<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.770> drill<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.790> all

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
grow through it like a drill and all

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.790 
grow through it like a drill and all
this<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.300> it's<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.810> texting<00:02:41.500> somebody

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800

or putting phone number into a phone an
hour<00:02:45.099> playing<00:02:45.340> xbox<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.420> more<00:02:46.629> you<00:02:46.780> do<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.019> the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
hour playing xbox the more you do it the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.530 
hour playing xbox the more you do it the
quicker<00:02:47.830> you'll<00:02:48.190> get<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.670> it's<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.090> muscle

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
quicker you'll get it it's just muscle

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.119 
quicker you'll get it it's just muscle
memory<00:02:49.569> so<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.500> good<00:02:50.650> way<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.890> practice

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
memory so it's a good way to practice

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.400 
memory so it's a good way to practice
and<00:02:51.519> if<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.730> use<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.180> pattern<00:02:52.480> using<00:02:53.349> the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
and if you use that pattern using the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.630 
and if you use that pattern using the
thumb<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> bear<00:02:53.950> strings<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.459> first

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
thumb on the bear strings and first

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.570 
thumb on the bear strings and first
second<00:02:54.940> or<00:02:55.000> third<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.390> G<00:02:55.599> B<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.080> E<00:02:56.260> then<00:02:57.069> for

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
second or third on G B and E then for

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.190 
second or third on G B and E then for
most<00:02:57.849> songs<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.450> come<00:02:58.599> across<00:02:58.750> you're

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
most songs that you come across you're

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.140 
most songs that you come across you're
not<00:02:59.349> going<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.560> be<00:02:59.620> too<00:02:59.860> far<00:03:00.160> off<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:01.660> actual

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
not going to be too far off the actual

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.190 
not going to be too far off the actual
technique<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.360> picking<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.930> you're<00:03:05.049> going

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200
