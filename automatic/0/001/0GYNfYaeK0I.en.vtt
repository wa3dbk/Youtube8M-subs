bottom so this is called the carbon
black<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:36.520> really<00:00:37.520> believe<00:00:37.850> like<00:00:38.030> this<00:00:38.300> it's

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
black I really believe like this it's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.529 
black I really believe like this it's
super<00:00:39.530> pigmented<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.399> glides<00:00:40.699> on<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.300> easily

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
super pigmented it glides on so easily

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.160 
super pigmented it glides on so easily
the<00:00:42.530> price<00:00:42.829> is<00:00:43.100> great<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:45.699> unlike<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:47.170> liquid

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
the price is great and unlike the liquid

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.799 
the price is great and unlike the liquid
liners<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:48.739> doesn't<00:00:49.129> peel<00:00:49.550> or<00:00:50.030> start<00:00:50.270> cracking

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
liners it doesn't peel or start cracking

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.910 
liners it doesn't peel or start cracking
so<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:51.680> really<00:00:52.070> like<00:00:52.280> this<00:00:53.620> after<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.649> few
