00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.019 
factorization on the GMAT math section
there's<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.410> lot<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.039> questions<00:00:17.490> having<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.820> do

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
there's a lot of questions having to do

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.080 
there's a lot of questions having to do
with<00:00:18.240> properties<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.080> numbers<00:00:19.230> primes<00:00:20.189> even

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
with properties of numbers primes even

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.830 
with properties of numbers primes even
aw<00:00:21.270> evens<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.960> odds<00:00:22.699> multiples<00:00:23.699> factors<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
aw evens and odds multiples factors and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.230 
aw evens and odds multiples factors and
so<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.189> has<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.609> do<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
so on what all of this has to do with is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
so on what all of this has to do with is
how<00:00:27.810> numbers<00:00:28.289> relate<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.830> each<00:00:28.949> other<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.460> how

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
how numbers relate to each other and how

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.540 
how numbers relate to each other and how
numbers<00:00:30.210> relate<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:31.080> prime<00:00:31.380> numbers<00:00:31.830> now<00:00:32.279> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
numbers relate to prime numbers now I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.910 
numbers relate to prime numbers now I
recorded<00:00:33.059> another<00:00:33.300> video<00:00:33.660> about<00:00:34.050> identifying

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
recorded another video about identifying

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.950 
recorded another video about identifying
prime<00:00:35.309> numbers<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.480> difference<00:00:36.809> between

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
prime numbers and the difference between

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.110 
prime numbers and the difference between
primes<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.559> composites<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.399> I'm<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
primes and composites so I'm going to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
primes and composites so I'm going to
assume<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> decent<00:00:40.320> rounding

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
assume that you have a decent rounding

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.910 
assume that you have a decent rounding
in<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.610> prime<00:00:41.940> numbers<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:43.230> prime

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
in just what prime numbers are but prime

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
in just what prime numbers are but prime
factorization<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> next<00:00:45.180> step<00:00:45.360> beyond

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
factorization is the next step beyond

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.260 
factorization is the next step beyond
that<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.770> prime<00:00:47.039> factorization<00:00:47.879> what

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that so with prime factorization what

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.450 
that so with prime factorization what
we're<00:00:48.420> doing<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.989> we're<00:00:49.200> taking<00:00:49.230> any<00:00:49.860> number

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we're doing is we're taking any number

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
we're doing is we're taking any number
and<00:00:50.670> we're<00:00:51.180> identifying<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> prime

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and we're identifying what the prime

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.580 
and we're identifying what the prime
factors<00:00:53.039> are<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:54.690> role<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.320> prime

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
factors are and what role the prime

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
factors are and what role the prime
factors<00:00:56.010> play<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.030> number<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.989> for

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
factors play in that number so for

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.910 
factors play in that number so for
instance<00:00:58.559> let's<00:00:59.039> take<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.250> number<00:00:59.489> like<00:01:00.210> 12<00:01:00.989> 12

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
instance let's take a number like 12 12

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.579 
instance let's take a number like 12 12
is<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.340> prime<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.750> instance<00:01:04.140> it's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
is not prime because for instance it's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.109 
is not prime because for instance it's
even<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.220> divisible<00:01:05.489> by<00:01:05.729> 2

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
even it's divisible by 2

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.550 
even it's divisible by 2
and<00:01:06.390> since<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.720> divisible<00:01:07.170> by<00:01:07.229> something

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and since it's divisible by something

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.179 
and since it's divisible by something
other<00:01:07.860> than<00:01:08.070> 1<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.460> itself<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.570> prime<00:01:10.189> 12

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
other than 1 in itself it's not prime 12

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.440 
other than 1 in itself it's not prime 12
we<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.299> by<00:01:12.450> multiplying<00:01:12.990> 2<00:01:13.680> times

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
we can get there by multiplying 2 times

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.800 
we can get there by multiplying 2 times
2<00:01:15.450> times<00:01:15.479> 3<00:01:16.290> choose<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> prime<00:01:17.280> 2<00:01:18.210> again<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
2 times 3 choose a prime 2 again is a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.469 
2 times 3 choose a prime 2 again is a
prime<00:01:19.140> 3<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> prime<00:01:20.340> multiply<00:01:21.299> these

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
prime 3 is a prime multiply these

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.260 
prime 3 is a prime multiply these
together<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:22.860> 12<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> prime

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
together you get 12 so the prime

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.410 
together you get 12 so the prime
factorization<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:25.380> 12<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.180> 2<00:01:27.180> 2<00:01:27.680> &amp;<00:01:28.680> 3<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.420> often

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
factorization of 12 is 2 2 &amp; 3 and often

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.719 
factorization of 12 is 2 2 &amp; 3 and often
we'll<00:01:30.570> write<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.259> exponent<00:01:31.650> form<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.579> we

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
we'll write this in exponent form so we

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.929 
we'll write this in exponent form so we
have<00:01:32.970> twos<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.380> threes<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:35.579> know<00:01:35.729> how

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
have twos we have threes we know how

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.410 
have twos we have threes we know how
many<00:01:36.150> twos<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.280> we<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.400> how<00:01:38.549> many<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.119> how

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
many twos and we know how many want how

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.990 
many twos and we know how many want how
many<00:01:39.600> threes<00:01:39.990> there's<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.650> 1<00:01:40.860> 3<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.939> do

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
many threes there's just a 1 3 we can do

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.190 
many threes there's just a 1 3 we can do
that<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.390> any<00:01:42.600> number

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that for any number

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.780 
that for any number
now<00:01:43.439> some<00:01:43.740> numbers<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.130> more<00:01:44.280> difficult<00:01:44.460> than

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
now some numbers are more difficult than

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.249 
now some numbers are more difficult than
others<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.329> that's<00:01:45.750> where<00:01:46.020> prime

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
others and that's where prime

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.649 
others and that's where prime
factorization<00:01:46.979> comes<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.579> number<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.299> 12

you're<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> need<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> identify<00:02:02.520> what

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you're going to need to identify what

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.760 
you're going to need to identify what
the<00:02:03.240> product

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the product

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.789 
the product
there's<00:02:03.920> our<00:02:04.039> and<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:04.850> some<00:02:05.060> cases<00:02:05.649> what<00:02:06.649> this

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
there's our and in some cases what this

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.859 
there's our and in some cases what this
exponent<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.520> how<00:02:07.820> many<00:02:07.969> times<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:08.479> prime

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
exponent is how many times that prime

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.530 
exponent is how many times that prime
factor<00:02:09.289> shows<00:02:09.920> up<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.700> factorization<00:02:11.450> of

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
factor shows up in the factorization of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.530 
factor shows up in the factorization of
a<00:02:11.660> number<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.940> what<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.000> want<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.239> show<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.390> how

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
a number so what I want to show you how

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.570 
a number so what I want to show you how
to<00:02:14.569> do<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:14.989> method<00:02:15.379> called<00:02:15.560> factor<00:02:16.069> tree<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
to do is a method called factor tree and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.640 
to do is a method called factor tree and
that's<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.940> way<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.209> breaking<00:02:17.420> down<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:18.170> prime

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
that's a way of breaking down a prime

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.309 
that's a way of breaking down a prime
factorization<00:02:19.040> into<00:02:19.700> individual<00:02:20.330> steps<00:02:20.750> that

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
factorization into individual steps that

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.949 
factorization into individual steps that
make<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.799> a<00:02:21.890> lot<00:02:22.040> easier<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.760> get<00:02:22.940> from<00:02:23.299> a<00:02:23.540> big

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
make it a lot easier to get from a big

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.130 
make it a lot easier to get from a big
number<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.430> smaller<00:02:25.760> prime<00:02:26.060> factors<00:02:26.540> so

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
number to the smaller prime factors so

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.900 
number to the smaller prime factors so
let's<00:02:27.319> take<00:02:27.470> an<00:02:27.590> example<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.069> I've<00:02:28.580> seen<00:02:28.790> on

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
let's take an example that I've seen on

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.059 
let's take an example that I've seen on
the<00:02:28.970> GMAT<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.299> few<00:02:29.510> times<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:30.049> number<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.989> 225

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
the GMAT a few times a number like 225

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.130 
the GMAT a few times a number like 225
now<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.129> might<00:02:34.580> know<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.790> 225<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.750> 15

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
now you might know that 225 is 15

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.470 
now you might know that 225 is 15
squared<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.010> don't<00:02:37.250> that's<00:02:37.610> totally<00:02:38.060> fine

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
squared if you don't that's totally fine

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.910 
squared if you don't that's totally fine
is<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.569> common<00:02:39.019> number<00:02:39.230> for<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.440> reason

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
is a common number for that reason

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.890 
is a common number for that reason
because<00:02:40.370> it's<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.790> perfect<00:02:40.940> square<00:02:41.390> because<00:02:41.750> it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
because it's a perfect square because it

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.960 
because it's a perfect square because it
has<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.170> lot<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.470> small<00:02:42.829> prime<00:02:43.280> factors<00:02:43.730> as

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
has a lot of small prime factors as

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.589 
has a lot of small prime factors as
we'll<00:02:44.209> see

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
we'll see

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.930 
we'll see
so<00:02:45.140> what<00:02:45.230> we're<00:02:45.380> going<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.530> do<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.400> first<00:02:46.610> step

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
so what we're going to do the first step

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.559 
so what we're going to do the first step
is<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.480> identify<00:02:48.410> any<00:02:48.769> prime<00:02:49.579> really<00:02:50.390> any

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
is just identify any prime really any

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.910 
is just identify any prime really any
number<00:02:50.900> doesn't<00:02:51.170> even<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> prime

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
number doesn't even have to be a prime

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.660 
number doesn't even have to be a prime
that

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
that

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.140 
that
225<00:02:53.569> is<00:02:53.840> divisible<00:02:54.530> by<00:02:54.769> I'm<00:02:55.489> just<00:02:55.730> looking<00:02:56.060> at

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
225 is divisible by I'm just looking at

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.870 
225 is divisible by I'm just looking at
225<00:02:56.720> we<00:02:56.959> can<00:02:57.110> see<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.950> last<00:02:58.160> digit<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.549> of<00:02:58.670> 5

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
225 we can see the last digit is of 5

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.900 
225 we can see the last digit is of 5
since<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.780> last<00:02:59.959> digit<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.470> 5<00:03:00.799> it's<00:03:01.579> gotta

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
since the last digit is a 5 it's gotta

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.850 
since the last digit is a 5 it's gotta
be<00:03:02.060> divisible<00:03:02.329> by<00:03:02.569> 5<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.470> what<00:03:03.590> we're<00:03:03.709> going<00:03:03.799> to

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
be divisible by 5 so what we're going to

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.339 
be divisible by 5 so what we're going to
do<00:03:04.069> this<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:04.730> where<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.599> tree<00:03:05.900> metaphor

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
do this is where the the tree metaphor

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.309 
do this is where the the tree metaphor
comes<00:03:06.620> in<00:03:06.829> put<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.519> couple<00:03:07.819> lines<00:03:08.000> there<00:03:08.329> we're

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
comes in put a couple lines there we're

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.300 
comes in put a couple lines there we're
gonna<00:03:09.380> factor<00:03:09.829> out<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> 5<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.799> just<00:03:12.799> skipping<00:03:13.100> a

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
gonna factor out a 5 so just skipping a

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.759 
gonna factor out a 5 so just skipping a
step<00:03:13.549> here<00:03:13.880> since<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:15.019> can<00:03:15.170> do<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.440> division

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
step here since you can do the division

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.349 
step here since you can do the division
on<00:03:15.889> your<00:03:16.069> own<00:03:16.190> time<00:03:16.630> 225<00:03:17.630> divided<00:03:18.410> by<00:03:18.650> 5<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:21.340> 45

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
on your own time 225 divided by 5 is 45

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.120 
on your own time 225 divided by 5 is 45
so<00:03:23.359> what<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.630> true<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.230> tree<00:03:24.650> metaphor

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
so what this true this tree metaphor

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.920 
so what this true this tree metaphor
means<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.670> 225<00:03:26.420> is<00:03:26.660> made<00:03:26.870> up<00:03:27.049> of<00:03:27.230> 5<00:03:27.670> times<00:03:28.670> 45<00:03:29.359> 5

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
means is 225 is made up of 5 times 45 5

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.490 
means is 225 is made up of 5 times 45 5
times<00:03:30.139> 45<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.620> 225<00:03:31.340> now<00:03:31.639> 5<00:03:32.389> as<00:03:32.959> I<00:03:33.200> mentioned

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
times 45 is 225 now 5 as I mentioned

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.039 
times 45 is 225 now 5 as I mentioned
before<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:34.340> prime<00:03:34.730> we<00:03:35.450> know<00:03:35.540> it's<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.750> factor

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
before is a prime we know it's a factor

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.500 
before is a prime we know it's a factor
225<00:03:36.680> we've<00:03:36.980> got<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.280> in<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.459> tree<00:03:37.760> because

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
225 we've got it in the tree because

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.509 
225 we've got it in the tree because
it's<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.720> prime<00:03:38.989> we're<00:03:39.349> gonna<00:03:39.470> circle<00:03:39.889> it<00:03:40.040> we're

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
it's a prime we're gonna circle it we're

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.039 
it's a prime we're gonna circle it we're
not<00:03:40.639> going<00:03:40.819> to<00:03:40.880> break<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.299> down<00:03:41.359> any<00:03:41.810> further

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
not going to break that down any further

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.530 
not going to break that down any further
because<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:42.889> crime<00:03:43.099> we<00:03:43.940> can't<00:03:44.209> break<00:03:44.359> it

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
because it to crime we can't break it

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.080 
because it to crime we can't break it
down<00:03:44.630> any<00:03:44.840> further<00:03:45.049> 5<00:03:45.650> is<00:03:45.859> just<00:03:46.130> 1<00:03:46.549> times<00:03:46.760> 5

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
down any further 5 is just 1 times 5

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.640 
down any further 5 is just 1 times 5
that's<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.599> only<00:03:47.870> way<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.049> can<00:03:48.260> get<00:03:48.410> fitter

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
that's the only way you can get fitter

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.640 
that's the only way you can get fitter
with<00:03:48.859> integers<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:50.120> 45<00:03:50.750> on<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:50.989> other<00:03:51.109> hand<00:03:51.380> is

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
with integers so 45 on the other hand is

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.569 
with integers so 45 on the other hand is
not<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.639> prime<00:03:52.970> number<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.569> what<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.680> 45<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.549> the

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
not a prime number so what is 45 to the

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.030 
not a prime number so what is 45 to the
divisible<00:03:56.209> by<00:03:56.269> again<00:03:57.260> you're<00:03:57.620> ending<00:03:57.889> with<00:03:58.010> a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
divisible by again you're ending with a

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.000 
divisible by again you're ending with a
5<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:59.269> we<00:03:59.389> can<00:03:59.540> break<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.750> down<00:03:59.900> into<00:04:00.400> 5<00:04:01.400> &amp;<00:04:01.970> 9<00:04:03.010> 5

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
5 so we can break it down into 5 &amp; 9 5

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.839 
5 so we can break it down into 5 &amp; 9 5
as<00:04:04.340> we<00:04:04.519> know<00:04:04.669> is<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.450> prime<00:04:05.780> 9<00:04:06.680> is<00:04:07.099> not<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.519> prime

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
as we know is a prime 9 is not a prime

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.170 
as we know is a prime 9 is not a prime
and<00:04:08.419> you<00:04:08.599> probably<00:04:08.840> know<00:04:09.230> what<00:04:09.410> 9<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:09.829> it<00:04:09.950> is

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
and you probably know what 9 is it is

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.539 
and you probably know what 9 is it is
by<00:04:10.390> 9:00<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.500> made<00:04:11.709> up<00:04:11.890> of<00:04:12.099> three<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:13.299> thorine

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
by 9:00 is made up of three and thorine

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.580 
by 9:00 is made up of three and thorine
three<00:04:15.549> is<00:04:16.180> prime<00:04:16.539> so<00:04:16.870> we<00:04:16.989> can<00:04:17.109> circle<00:04:17.440> those

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
three is prime so we can circle those

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.909 
three is prime so we can circle those
two<00:04:17.949> we've<00:04:18.609> got<00:04:18.820> two<00:04:19.060> threes<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:19.780> two<00:04:20.620> fives

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
two we've got two threes and two fives

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.279 
two we've got two threes and two fives
so<00:04:21.669> if<00:04:21.759> we<00:04:21.880> write<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.330> in<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.630> format<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:23.080> showed

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
so if we write it in the format I showed

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.450 
so if we write it in the format I showed

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
smaller numbers so it's more likely that

GMAT like I said they know you don't
have<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:42.909> calculator<00:05:43.180> so<00:05:44.020> they<00:05:44.110> don't<00:05:44.289> think

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560

you're<00:05:44.710> going<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:44.919> just<00:05:45.099> automatically<00:05:45.729> see

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
you're going to just automatically see

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.540 
you're going to just automatically see
that<00:05:46.360> some<00:05:46.570> number<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:47.020> divisible<00:05:47.320> by<00:05:47.560> 23<00:05:48.280> and

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
that some number is divisible by 23 and

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.300 
that some number is divisible by 23 and
also<00:05:48.909> divisible<00:05:49.150> by<00:05:49.389> 19<00:05:49.960> so<00:05:50.650> as<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:51.039> get<00:05:51.159> to

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
also divisible by 19 so as you get to

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.790

bigger<00:05:51.490> numbers<00:05:51.909> you<00:05:52.389> can<00:05:52.630> usually<00:05:52.930> count<00:05:53.560> on
