00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 These miracle corps shoot on these two 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.880
 super mega giant in which you can 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.389
 assemble super-duper computers 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.260
 This is the first supergiant. This is a cooler master. 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.689
 cosmos 2 2 supergiant went completely 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:26.250
 recently called obsidian corsair 900d 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:31.590
 1 at the beginning of October 2013 117 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.500
 800 store expert this costs 12200 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 that is the difference between them 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.110
 about 5000 at first glance 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.300
 Carson looks a little simpler he doesn't have 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.390
 such fashionable chips as the lid coincided 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.340
 touch screen or aluminum 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.239
 walls but due to this in principle 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.280
 it turns out savings but experienced collectors 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.620
 say that for example in this case 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.640
 collect supersystems with water 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.609
 cooler cooler is much more convenient 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.309
 since supposedly this building is not quite 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.030
 designed badly designed for 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.010
 showdown super superdin their systems 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.200
 cooling 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.140
 so in this case we have a lateral 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.619
 the window you can see here now 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 unfold yes you can see me 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.140
 Special has become to compare the size 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.900
 shells my height meter eighty 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.820
 You can estimate the dimensions here next to it 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.079
 so here usually looks at least 5 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.790
 corps or the usual midi-tower which 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:43.399
 this size consist almost by the way yet 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.320
 one little brother cooler master storm 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.200
 This is how flamenco looks compared to 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.610
 Salon is the same too 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.990
 small compared to these giants 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.409

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.660
 corsairs 100 for example here you can 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.599
 she's a doggy completely radiator 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.599

 huge installation space 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.180
 multiple video cards i.e. cooling 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.599
 everything will be fine in this building 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:22.019
 two three video cards will be fine here 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:24.780
 feel yourself in an important steel scene 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.269

 here you can see how it looks 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.269
 near brushed aluminum 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.500

 brushed aluminum as he assembles 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:52.380
 prints very cool like that god 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.200
