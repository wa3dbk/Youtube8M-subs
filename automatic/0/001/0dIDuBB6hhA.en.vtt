00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
so the Rocky Mountains are created by

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.569 
so the Rocky Mountains are created by
some<00:00:36.899> earthquakes<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.160> things<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
some earthquakes and things like that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.260 
some earthquakes and things like that
where<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.329> thrust<00:00:40.290> fault

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
where a thrust fault

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
where a thrust fault
yeah<00:00:42.899> push<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.440> Rocky<00:00:43.710> Mountains<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
air over 70 million years and then the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.500 
air over 70 million years and then the
gorges<00:00:47.219> were<00:00:47.340> formed<00:00:47.700> 20<00:00:48.120> million<00:00:48.360> years

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
gorges were formed 20 million years

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.900 
gorges were formed 20 million years
later<00:00:48.690> through<00:00:49.050> erosion<00:00:49.370> from<00:00:50.370> water<00:00:50.640> off<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
later through erosion from water off the
