00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
most of the plant kayaks so I've shifted

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.140 
most of the plant kayaks so I've shifted

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
because we don't have sand around here

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
because we don't have sand around here
we<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.590> rock<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:22.890> other<00:01:23.189> nasties<00:01:23.700> little

we have rock and other nasties little
bit<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.830> I've<00:01:25.920> shifted<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.369> own

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490

swinging the foil you'll notice that the
foil<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.139> atypical<00:02:26.099> this<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.299> crude<00:02:28.340> model<00:02:29.340> I

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
foil is atypical this is a crude model I

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.309 
foil is atypical this is a crude model I
did<00:02:29.819> all<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.329> by<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.569> way<00:02:30.689> in<00:02:30.870> about<00:02:30.959> six

not gonna bother with the ropes and

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.809 
not gonna bother with the ropes and
stuff<00:03:54.629> at<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.870> moment<00:03:55.250> we're<00:03:56.250> gonna<00:03:56.310> intend

to<00:03:56.909> have<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> live<00:03:57.329> demo<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.719> this<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.139> a

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
to have a live demo of this and a

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.939 
to have a live demo of this and a
probably<00:03:59.250> tomorrow<00:03:59.810> as<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.019> can<00:04:01.169> see<00:04:01.409> once<00:04:01.709> in

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
probably tomorrow as you can see once in

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.209 
probably tomorrow as you can see once in
place<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.780> have<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.989> couple<00:04:04.319> of<00:04:04.439> control<00:04:04.889> ropes

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:05.219 
place you have a couple of control ropes

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.319 
place you have a couple of control ropes
to<00:04:06.139> effectively<00:04:07.139> use<00:04:07.349> it<00:04:07.560> like<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.739> sail<00:04:08.329> it's

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
to effectively use it like a sail it's

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.270 
to effectively use it like a sail it's
very<00:04:09.540> lightweight<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.379> control<00:04:10.769> ropes<00:04:11.039> run

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
very lightweight the control ropes run

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.670 
very lightweight the control ropes run
forward<00:04:11.819> doesn't<00:04:12.359> obscure<00:04:12.930> your<00:04:13.109> view<00:04:13.409> in<00:04:13.560> any

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
forward doesn't obscure your view in any

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.129 
forward doesn't obscure your view in any
way<00:04:13.979> so<00:04:14.729> hopefully<00:04:15.299> it'll<00:04:15.479> be<00:04:15.659> an<00:04:15.780> improvement

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
way so hopefully it'll be an improvement

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.529 
way so hopefully it'll be an improvement
on<00:04:16.469> a<00:04:16.579> sail<00:04:17.579> structure<00:04:18.150> for<00:04:18.769> kayaks<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.449> as<00:04:21.449> I

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
on a sail structure for kayaks and as I

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.269 
on a sail structure for kayaks and as I
say<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:21.840> very<00:04:21.930> lightweight<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.590> also<00:04:23.099> since

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
say it's very lightweight and also since

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.159 
say it's very lightweight and also since
it's<00:04:23.460> made<00:04:23.610> on<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.760> foam<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.210> it's<00:04:24.330> rigid<00:04:24.539> you

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
it's made on a foam and it's rigid you

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.209 
it's made on a foam and it's rigid you
can<00:04:25.289> use<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.529> for<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.710> number<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.979> different

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 
can use it for a number of different

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.780 
can use it for a number of different
purposes<00:04:26.550> even<00:04:26.729> when<00:04:26.969> it's<00:04:27.090> lying

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
purposes even when it's lying

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.330 
purposes even when it's lying
and<00:04:28.200> if<00:04:29.200> you<00:04:29.350> ever<00:04:29.470> go<00:04:29.680> over<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.160> thing

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
and if you ever go over and the thing

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.000 
and if you ever go over and the thing
your<00:04:30.520> kayak<00:04:30.820> breaks<00:04:31.120> up<00:04:31.330> there<00:04:31.690> you<00:04:31.810> go<00:04:32.010> float

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
your kayak breaks up there you go float

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.310 
your kayak breaks up there you go float
on<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.340> bugger<00:04:33.550> for<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.880> while<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.840> just<00:04:34.870> a

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
on that bugger for a while so just a

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.930 
on that bugger for a while so just a
