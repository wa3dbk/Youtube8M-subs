there caused by the compression on the
right<00:06:54.700> side<00:06:54.970> remember<00:06:55.870> the<00:06:56.110> concept<00:06:56.620> of

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
right side remember the concept of

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.370 
right side remember the concept of
stretching<00:06:57.400> on<00:06:57.520> one<00:06:57.700> side<00:06:58.000> and<00:06:58.480> compressing

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
on the other that we learned from the

on the other that we learned from the
beam<00:07:01.630> and<00:07:01.930> rubble<00:07:02.320> beam<00:07:02.470> these<00:07:03.220> concepts<00:07:03.760> are

beam and rubble beam these concepts are

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.110 
beam and rubble beam these concepts are
so<00:07:04.270> fundamental<00:07:05.020> that<00:07:05.230> they<00:07:05.890> apply<00:07:06.310> at<00:07:06.580> every

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
so fundamental that they apply at every

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.390 
so fundamental that they apply at every
stage<00:07:07.420> even<00:07:07.900> when<00:07:08.260> designing<00:07:08.650> the<00:07:08.950> anatomy

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 
stage even when designing the anatomy

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.420 
stage even when designing the anatomy
also<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.480> angularity<00:07:10.840> of<00:07:11.350> the<00:07:11.500> shape<00:07:11.770> helps

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 
also the angularity of the shape helps

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.360 
also the angularity of the shape helps
to<00:07:12.640> show<00:07:12.820> the<00:07:13.030> tension<00:07:13.480> on<00:07:13.630> the<00:07:13.780> right<00:07:13.960> side

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
to show the tension on the right side

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.560 
to show the tension on the right side
remember<00:07:15.370> that<00:07:15.460> metaphor<00:07:16.000> with<00:07:16.210> the<00:07:16.300> water

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
remember that metaphor with the water

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.260 
remember that metaphor with the water
and<00:07:17.290> there's<00:07:17.560> a<00:07:17.620> lot<00:07:17.860> of<00:07:18.010> energy<00:07:18.190> and<00:07:18.730> tension

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
and there's a lot of energy and tension

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.140 
and there's a lot of energy and tension
the<00:07:19.810> waves<00:07:19.990> get<00:07:20.290> angular<00:07:20.710> but<00:07:21.610> when<00:07:21.820> the<00:07:21.910> water

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
the waves get angular but when the water

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.070 
the waves get angular but when the water
is<00:07:22.360> calm<00:07:22.690> the<00:07:23.020> waves<00:07:23.710> flow<00:07:24.190> very<00:07:25.000> subtle<00:07:25.420> so

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
is calm the waves flow very subtle so

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.200 
is calm the waves flow very subtle so
sharp<00:07:26.530> angular<00:07:26.950> shapes<00:07:27.370> on<00:07:27.610> the<00:07:27.730> right<00:07:27.910> and
