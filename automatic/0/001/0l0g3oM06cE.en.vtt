00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:11.959 
first look at the flop to see what your

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.259 
first look at the flop to see what your
chances<00:00:12.379> are<00:00:12.530> by<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:12.829> river<00:00:13.099> I<00:00:13.369> know<00:00:14.059> you

chances are by the river I know you

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.390 
chances are by the river I know you
remember<00:00:14.539> with<00:00:15.139> two<00:00:15.320> cards<00:00:15.650> to<00:00:15.769> come<00:00:15.980> to

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
remember with two cards to come to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.550 
remember with two cards to come to
multiply<00:00:16.939> the<00:00:17.000> number<00:00:17.359> of<00:00:17.449> outs<00:00:17.599> you<00:00:17.810> have<00:00:18.019> by

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
multiply the number of outs you have by

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.650 
multiply the number of outs you have by
four<00:00:18.890> percent<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:19.519> that<00:00:20.119> gives<00:00:20.359> you<00:00:20.509> the

four percent and that gives you the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.630 
four percent and that gives you the
approximate<00:00:21.009> probability<00:00:22.009> you'll<00:00:22.189> catch<00:00:22.429> by

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
you got a four flush on the turn what's

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.259 
you got a four flush on the turn what's
the<00:04:00.560> probability<00:04:01.099> of<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.489> flush<00:04:01.730> card<00:04:02.060> on<00:04:02.209> the
