hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.599
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.420
You know we make various kinds of dal
but there is one leaf that is considered

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.850
to be very very potent and nutritious
and doctors in Ayurveda recommend

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.430
this leaf that is that drumstick leaf

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.289
you know we all love the flavor of drumstick in sambar but i'm telling you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.360
this is very very nutritious and in Ayurveda they claim that if you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.440
eat this leaf regularly you will be disease free; Dear friends

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.930
this is so fantastic so let's go ahead
and learn how to make this dal, for this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.940
all I have done is here is the dal that
is of tuvar dal boiled it till it is nice

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.870
and soft

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.410
now we're going to do the tempering by
adding oil in a pan in this add red

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.400
chilli and add mustard seeds when the mustard seed sizzles, add some cumin,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.320
garlic

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.460
I love garlic specially in this dal you know do not chop the garlic just the whole

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.450
garlic and just let this garlic slightly saute haaa wow garlic garlic garlic

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.759
my favorite, in this

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.320
add some chopped onion and we're not
going to brown this onion we're just going

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.619
to sweat this onion till they're nice and
transparent, add pinch of salt, add pinch

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.000
of turmeric

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.770
now look at these, these onions have
sweated this is when we're going to add

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.540
the leaves of drumstick, in this also
add some water

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.759
wow this leaf will cook in no time because they're so tender, you know

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.060
even from the drumstick plant just pick
the leaves which are nice and tender;

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.340
in this we're going to add some chili
powder and you know pour in some

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.500
tamarind juice just one tablespoon of
tamarind juice will do

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.149
wow and just let this come to a boil so that the tamarind juice

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.450
loses all the raw flavor, dilute the dal
little bit and just add the dal in this

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.379
wow and this our fantastic

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.319

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.800

medicinal values and the nutrient values

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.800

I'm telling you they will have more
respect and they will make more often

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.830
you know just let it boil and cook till you get the consistency you desire

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.819
some people like it thin I like it you
know little bit thick when I'm making

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.019
these kind of thing so you can put it on
a hot rice and enjoy just switch off

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:52.800
