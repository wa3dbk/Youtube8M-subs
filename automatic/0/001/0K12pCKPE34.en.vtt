00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
to it cuz everything that I enjoyed

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.110 
to it cuz everything that I enjoyed
musically<00:01:28.770> all<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> bands<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.520> enjoyed<00:01:29.880> and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
musically all the bands I enjoyed and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.910 
musically all the bands I enjoyed and
everything<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.510> that<00:01:30.570> everyone<00:01:31.320> played<00:01:31.590> six

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
everything like that everyone played six

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.470 
everything like that everyone played six
strings<00:01:32.190> so<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.370> didn't<00:01:32.580> even<00:01:32.700> consider<00:01:33.060> seven

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
strings so I didn't even consider seven

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.730 
strings so I didn't even consider seven
string<00:01:33.660> I<00:01:33.780> thought<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.470> what

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
string I thought that was like what

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560 
string I thought that was like what
guitar<00:01:35.070> players<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.400> Steve<00:01:35.730> I<00:01:35.880> did<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.390> had

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
guitar players like Steve I did they had

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.180 
guitar players like Steve I did they had
seven<00:01:36.840> strings<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.620> wanted<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.980> throw

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
seven strings and if you wanted to throw

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.590 
seven strings and if you wanted to throw
some<00:01:38.400> pounding<00:01:38.790> riff<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.330> don't<00:01:39.420> need

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
some pounding riff down you don't need

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.810 
some pounding riff down you don't need
seven<00:01:40.050> so<00:01:40.260> I<00:01:40.320> ignored<00:01:40.500> seven<00:01:41.160> for<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> long<00:01:41.520> time

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
