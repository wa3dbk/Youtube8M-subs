baby then some hydrogen peroxide a safe
hydrogen<00:01:48.810> peroxide<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.880> save<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.180> high<00:01:51.300> as<00:01:51.360> my

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
hydrogen peroxide to save as high as my

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.500

fish toughness and then I got this ridic
stuff<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.530> probably<00:01:55.680> gonna<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.010> some

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
I already had so I'm gonna show you guys

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
I already had so I'm gonna show you guys
that<00:02:21.910> tank<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.990> is<00:02:23.170> three<00:02:23.620> gallons<00:02:24.450> looks<00:02:25.450> like

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
that tank it is three gallons looks like

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.840 
that tank it is three gallons looks like
that<00:02:25.810> it's<00:02:26.050> by<00:02:26.230> eclipse<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.340> reason<00:02:27.700> I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
that it's by eclipse and the reason I

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.940 
that it's by eclipse and the reason I
have<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.270> backing<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.870> for<00:02:29.140> decoration<00:02:29.440> and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
have a backing is for decoration and

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.230 
have a backing is for decoration and
because<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.490> front<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.850> mirror<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.150> I

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
because it's in front of a mirror and I

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.030 
because it's in front of a mirror and I
don't<00:02:31.300> want<00:02:31.510> flaring<00:02:31.960> all<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.200> time<00:02:32.380> every

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
don't want flaring all the time every

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.040 
don't want flaring all the time every
now<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.310> then<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.550> good<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:33.970> not<00:02:34.150> all<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
now and then is good but not all the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.590 
now and then is good but not all the
time<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.400> there's<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.700> blue<00:02:36.940> multi-coloured

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
time so there's a blue multi-coloured

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.560 
time so there's a blue multi-coloured
gravel<00:02:38.050> in<00:02:38.140> there<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:39.060> background<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.390> it's

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
then they had like a little frozen

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.890 
then they had like a little frozen
section<00:03:24.040> stuff<00:03:24.340> for<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.390> they<00:03:25.630> had<00:03:25.750> like

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
really want that because I thought I'd

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.140
