00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.089
 how about you guys welcome once again to 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.980
 My channel is read and today I bring you a 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.859
 small tutorial on how to create a server 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.320
 from minecraft 1.3 points 2 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.199
 it would be the latest version since good 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.179
 any type of servers are the same 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.339
 the way to create but I'm going to bring 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.609
 this since it is the last patch so 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.590
 saying the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.480
 direct us to download and download the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.640
 client so to speak that everyone 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.980
 I should have updated to the last 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:47.180
 version and the multiplayer server 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:49.280
 the excel downloaded pri faster 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.350
 it's just going to be an ulna you know 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.899
 It's very simple 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.010
 you download this file that is a folder 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.760
 I think it's called pop pop pop funk 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.049
 good pop we put minecraft inside the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.360
 folder and we execute it this will take a 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.690
 little will create us some files that will 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.690
 is loading 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.560
 a terrarium 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.360
 will be a little bit I repeat create a 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.380
 server of any version is 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.149
 practically the same simply 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.940
 you need the minecraft server of 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.240
 customer so to speak 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.540
 of that version 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.970
 after the 1.3 points since the page 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.850
 the last one I had downloaded for 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.850
 download this voucher 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.290
 right now our server this area 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 active resist has already created our 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.710
 our folder in 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.010
 we close here it does not happen anything is worth it then you 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.900
 real server 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.260
 we go to the server folder if 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.000
 you see is this file is not 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.890
 you can open it means you have to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.100
 put a document mode that would be 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.189
 Right button open with the document 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.180
 of good notes bring us to the little 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.030
 list 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.280
 that will be mini kraft 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.310
 well I 'll tell you a series of 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.670
 properties if you want to be that by 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.860
 example when offline means if people 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.130
 I could fly or not just if you want 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.230
 what if you should put true and if it is 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.060
 you do not just put a fault if you cancel 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.890
 that option 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.490
 I'm going to say the basics that would be world 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.090
 lane world name 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.150
 they would sell would be the name of your map to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.069
 what do you want to put on your server 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.069
 or such I'm going to put for example 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.850
 OK 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.209
 then on the by we leave the one that is 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.209
 in 255 servet and p ok we have 2 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.270
 us to fort or use the hamchi 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.820
 vale is more 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.790
 if we have a we never take our ip 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.500
 by a right to purchase four 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.300
 we could be freedom and this would be the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.730
 server ip just simply max me later 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.610
 pvp true difficulties such so who 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.810
 modest you can if you have a couturier 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.540
 on the server that fails to explain 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.230
 this tutorial can you 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.260
 you can 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.230
 then modify it from within 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.330
 file we keep a folder we close 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.330
 here and we run the server again 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.770
 very well while running I'm going to stop 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.770
 the recording and I come to follow files 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.500
 how about you guys egg be here 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.460
 server is already executed is in 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.680
 perfect functioning as 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.020
 the chats has loaded everything perfectly 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.750
 27 percent you can see the version of the 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.910
 game would simply be like final 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.590
 and enter minecraft run it 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.180
 with our password I saw it in the series 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.510
 if we are premium if we are not prizes 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.290
 equally 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.290
 the run 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.410
 of multiplayer and here we would have for 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.259
 example opened several times our 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.669
 minecraft server notice if it is for 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.289
 Hamas and people have to be 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.110
 connected to your network if you can not sell 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:38.030
 the server and sipe can be any 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.030
 just be careful 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.570
 once before finishing this tutorial 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.790
 know how to close the server if I do not 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.970
 let's modify the notes themselves always 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.970
 forever 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.970
 for 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.320
 that can enter those that are not premium 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.600
 so to speak, you do not have the game 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.700
 bought where you put online mode you have 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.770

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.630
 you just keep and everyone that 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.990
 do not have premium could enter your 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.800
 server even yourselves 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.950
