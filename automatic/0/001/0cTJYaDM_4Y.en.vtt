arguing<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.900> his<00:00:16.080> deposition<00:00:16.859> Cosby's

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
arguing that his deposition Cosby's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.340 
arguing that his deposition Cosby's
deposition<00:00:17.910> contains<00:00:18.420> info<00:00:18.930> about<00:00:19.199> his

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
drug use which should remain

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
drug use which should remain
confidential<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.840> guess<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> idea<00:00:25.320> is

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
confidential and I guess the idea is

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.109 
confidential and I guess the idea is
that<00:00:25.650> hopefully<00:00:26.340> these<00:00:26.460> lawsuits<00:00:26.699> will<00:00:27.029> be

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that hopefully these lawsuits will be

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.810 
that hopefully these lawsuits will be
dismissed<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> Cosby's<00:00:28.380> lawyers<00:00:28.820> before

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
dismissed this is Cosby's lawyers before

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.510 
dismissed this is Cosby's lawyers before
this<00:00:30.179> information<00:00:30.929> becomes<00:00:31.529> public<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.340> if

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
this information becomes public and if

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.950 
this information becomes public and if
this<00:00:32.610> information<00:00:32.790> becomes<00:00:33.300> public<00:00:33.540> then

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this information becomes public then

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.720 
this information becomes public then
maybe<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.350> lawsuits<00:00:34.800> will<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.100> dismissed<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
maybe the lawsuits will be dismissed and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.760 
maybe the lawsuits will be dismissed and
it<00:00:35.850> will<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.329> disclosed<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.200> no<00:00:37.320> reason

so if the documents are unsealed my

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.420 
so if the documents are unsealed my
question<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.059> does<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.420> undermine

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
question for you is does that undermine

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
question for you is does that undermine
confidential<00:00:44.430> settlements<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> see

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
confidential settlements or do you see

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080 
confidential settlements or do you see
this<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.870> distinct<00:00:46.469> from<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:47.610> normal

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this as distinct from your normal

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.639 
this as distinct from your normal
confidential<00:00:48.629> settlements<00:00:49.020> because<00:00:49.140> Cosby

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
confidential settlements because Cosby

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
confidential settlements because Cosby
lawyers<00:00:50.160> make<00:00:50.640> comments<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> women

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
lawyers make comments about the women

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.420 
lawyers make comments about the women
who<00:00:51.840> had<00:00:51.930> engaged<00:00:52.199> that's<00:00:52.469> exactly<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
who had engaged that's exactly the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.920 
who had engaged that's exactly the
critical<00:00:53.820> point<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> difference

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
critical point here in the difference

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.779 
critical point here in the difference
and<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.649> exactly<00:00:55.920> why<00:00:56.489> Bill

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and I think this is exactly why Bill

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.430 
and I think this is exactly why Bill
Cosby<00:00:57.239> has<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.570> made<00:00:57.780> any<00:00:57.840> public<00:00:58.199> statements

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
Cosby has not made any public statements

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.830 
Cosby has not made any public statements
to<00:00:59.010> try<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> avoid<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.850> lawsuits<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.600> i

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
to try to avoid these lawsuits and i

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
to try to avoid these lawsuits and i
think<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> lawyers<00:01:02.160> were<00:01:02.340> trying<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> be

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
think that the lawyers were trying to be

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.299 
think that the lawyers were trying to be
slick<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.420> doing<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.189> know

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
slick in doing that but as we all know

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.940 
slick in doing that but as we all know
as<00:01:05.729> lawyers<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.810> make<00:01:07.049> those<00:01:07.350> allegations

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
as lawyers if you make those allegations

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730 
as lawyers if you make those allegations
in<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.790> pleading<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.840> legal<00:01:10.170> document<00:01:10.350> that's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
in a pleading in a legal document that's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
in a pleading in a legal document that's
fine<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.280> once<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.670> start<00:01:11.729> talking<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.360> the

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
of a crime allegedly right well we don't

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.060 
of a crime allegedly right well we don't
know<00:04:39.890> that<00:04:39.920> there<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.520> victim<00:04:41.150> until

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
know that there is a victim until

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.580 
know that there is a victim until
there's<00:04:43.070> actually<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.520> trial<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:45.050> alleged

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
there's actually a trial so so alleged

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.140 
there's actually a trial so so alleged
how<00:04:45.710> could<00:04:46.010> how<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.580> process<00:04:46.940> move

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
how could how can the process move

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.300 
how could how can the process move
forward<00:04:47.180> without<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.110> very<00:04:48.500> information

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
forward without the very information

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.820 
forward without the very information
upon<00:04:49.790> which<00:04:49.850> this<00:04:50.390> case<00:04:50.720> will<00:04:51.230> be<00:04:51.260> proven<00:04:51.740> or

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
upon which this case will be proven or

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.500 
upon which this case will be proven or
disproven<00:04:51.890> I<00:04:52.370> think<00:04:52.610> there's<00:04:52.820> quite<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.180> bit<00:04:53.330> of

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
disproven I think there's quite a bit of

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.800 
disproven I think there's quite a bit of
information<00:04:53.870> out<00:04:54.470> in<00:04:55.220> terms<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.790> what<00:04:56.540> they

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
information out in terms of what they

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.320 
information out in terms of what they
have<00:04:56.930> said<00:04:57.230> in<00:04:57.830> terms<00:04:58.040> of<00:04:58.190> him<00:04:58.460> saying<00:04:58.730> that

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
have said in terms of him saying that

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330 
have said in terms of him saying that
his<00:04:59.600> attorney<00:05:00.050> saying<00:05:00.410> that<00:05:00.590> he<00:05:00.710> these<00:05:01.040> people

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
his attorney saying that he these people

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.430 
his attorney saying that he these people
are<00:05:01.460> liars<00:05:01.730> but<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.420> isn't<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.170> crux

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
are liars but it isn't that the crux

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.680 
are liars but it isn't that the crux
data<00:05:03.740> but<00:05:03.950> think<00:05:04.190> about<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.580> when<00:05:04.730> you're<00:05:05.120> when

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
data but think about it when you're when

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.580 
data but think about it when you're when
he<00:05:06.470> obviously<00:05:06.860> knows<00:05:07.570> bill<00:05:08.570> obviously<00:05:08.960> knows

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
he obviously knows bill obviously knows

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.820 
he obviously knows bill obviously knows
whether<00:05:10.580> or<00:05:10.760> not<00:05:10.850> this<00:05:11.390> victim<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.900> lying<00:05:12.140> and

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
whether or not this victim is lying and

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.430 
whether or not this victim is lying and
and<00:05:13.130> so<00:05:13.850> what<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.420> give<00:05:14.630> him<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.930> benefit<00:05:15.380> of

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.770 
and so what to give him the benefit of
protecting<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.460> information<00:05:17.090> knowing<00:05:17.330> that

protecting that information knowing that

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.870 
protecting that information knowing that

he had to disclose certain things during
this<00:05:20.060> lawsuit<00:05:20.360> that<00:05:21.020> he<00:05:21.140> probably<00:05:21.320> didn't

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
this lawsuit that he probably didn't

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.190 
this lawsuit that he probably didn't
want<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:21.920> disclose<00:05:22.600> knowing<00:05:23.600> that<00:05:23.780> he<00:05:23.930> still

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
gets the protections of that agreement

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.340 
gets the protections of that agreement
when<00:05:28.310> his<00:05:28.640> lawyers<00:05:29.090> may<00:05:29.780> very<00:05:30.020> well<00:05:30.170> have

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
when his lawyers may very well have

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.980 
when his lawyers may very well have
violated<00:05:30.860> it<00:05:31.160> yet<00:05:31.370> I<00:05:31.520> just<00:05:31.760> I<00:05:31.880> totally<00:05:32.360> under

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
violated it yet I just I totally under

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.630 
violated it yet I just I totally under
balance<00:05:33.320> there<00:05:33.530> I<00:05:33.680> totally<00:05:34.070> understand<00:05:34.520> but

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
balance there I totally understand but

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.790 
balance there I totally understand but
the<00:05:34.820> point<00:05:35.060> is<00:05:35.240> they<00:05:35.390> may<00:05:35.630> have<00:05:35.840> violated<00:05:36.050> it<00:05:36.620> I

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
the point is they may have violated it I

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.080 
the point is they may have violated it I
kind<00:05:37.010> of<00:05:37.130> think<00:05:37.310> that<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.520> judge<00:05:37.760> has<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:37.970> make

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
kind of think that the judge has to make

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.050 
kind of think that the judge has to make
some<00:05:38.420> determination<00:05:39.200> based<00:05:39.800> on<00:05:40.100> what<00:05:40.790> they've

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
some determination based on what they've

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.860 
some determination based on what they've
