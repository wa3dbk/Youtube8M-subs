00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.099 

there's<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:04.040> gap<00:00:05.040> right<00:00:05.370> here<00:00:05.779> where<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.990> can

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
there's a gap right here where you can

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.360 
there's a gap right here where you can
tell<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.319> doors<00:00:07.620> not<00:00:07.859> going<00:00:08.130> all<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.340> way

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
tell the doors not going all the way

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.549 
tell the doors not going all the way
shut<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:09.059> lot<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.719> people<00:00:09.929> put<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> surgical

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
shut a lot of people put the surgical

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.730 
shut a lot of people put the surgical
tubing<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.490> between<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.170> or<00:00:13.170> they<00:00:13.290> fill<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
tubing in between the or they fill the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.980 
tubing in between the or they fill the
the<00:00:14.070> stock<00:00:17.210> weatherstripping<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.539> surgical

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the stock weatherstripping with surgical

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.990 
the stock weatherstripping with surgical
tubing<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.920> make<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> stiffer<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.789> make<00:00:20.880> it

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
tubing to make it stiffer and make it

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000 
tubing to make it stiffer and make it
stick<00:00:21.210> out<00:00:21.330> more<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.439> holds<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> door

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
stick out more and that holds the door

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.590 
stick out more and that holds the door
out<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.490> that's<00:00:23.580> really<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:23.910> kind<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
out but that's really just kind of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.170 
out but that's really just kind of
putting<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.900> bandaid<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> fix<00:00:26.180> what's

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
putting a bandaid on the fix what's

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.800 
putting a bandaid on the fix what's
happening<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.750> there's<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.650> much<00:00:28.769> gap<00:00:29.810> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
happening is there's so much gap that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.420 
happening is there's so much gap that
the<00:00:32.600> latch<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.290> what's<00:00:35.010> making<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the latch is actually what's making the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
the latch is actually what's making the
rattle<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:36.930> whenever<00:00:37.350> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
rattle and when you can see whenever you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
rattle and when you can see whenever you
hold<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.160> go<00:00:38.309> over<00:00:38.399> bumps<00:00:38.989> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
hold it in and you go over bumps it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.830 
hold it in and you go over bumps it
doesn't<00:00:40.379> make<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.620> much<00:00:40.649> noise<00:00:41.210> as<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.690> right

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
doesn't make as much noise as that right

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.840 
doesn't make as much noise as that right
there<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.280> change<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.550> out

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
there so I'm going to change this out

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.290 
there so I'm going to change this out
with<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.110> modified<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.950> cut<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> here

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
with one that I modified I cut it here

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.319 
with one that I modified I cut it here
and<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.379> ground<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> down<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:54.149> make<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and here and ground it down to make it

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.910 
and here and ground it down to make it
shorter<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.199> moved<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> back<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
shorter and then just moved it back and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.529 
shorter and then just moved it back and
then<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.100> welded<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.550> back<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.149> ground<00:00:57.390> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
then we welded it back on and ground it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.049 
then we welded it back on and ground it
back<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.230> repainted<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:00:59.940> going

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
back down and repainted it so I'm going

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.240 
back down and repainted it so I'm going
to<00:01:00.090> change<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.840> show<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> difference

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
to change it out and show the difference

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.380 
to change it out and show the difference
you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.549> there's<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:05.939> much<00:01:06.150> difference

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you can see there's not much difference

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
you can see there's not much difference
it's<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.380> enough<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.780> just<00:01:09.780> barely<00:01:10.250> suck<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it's just enough to just barely suck it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
it's just enough to just barely suck it
in<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.060> make<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> little

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
in just a little bit make a little

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.859 
in just a little bit make a little
tighter<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:15.770> there's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> new<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.189> installed

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.570 

it's<00:01:21.869> how<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.439> flat<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:22.799> we're<00:01:23.369> almost

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it's how this is flat now we're almost

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.130 
it's how this is flat now we're almost
flat<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> probably<00:01:24.360> could<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.600> gone<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> little

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
flat I probably could have gone a little

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.090 
flat I probably could have gone a little
bit<00:01:25.259> more<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.720> make<00:01:27.930> anywhere<00:01:28.530> near<00:01:28.950> as

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
bit more and that make anywhere near as

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.910 
bit more and that make anywhere near as
much<00:01:29.310> noise<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> did<00:01:30.740> but<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.799> also

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
much noise is what it did but I also

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.120 
much noise is what it did but I also
think<00:01:32.250> part<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> problem<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.860> if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> look

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
think part of the problem is if you look

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.649 
think part of the problem is if you look
on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> latch<00:01:37.640> right<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:39.420> it's

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
on the latch right here there it's

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.219 
on the latch right here there it's
actually<00:01:39.960> coated<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> has<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
actually coated in something or it has a

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.289 
actually coated in something or it has a
the<00:01:43.229> plastic<00:01:43.860> there's<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> plastic

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the plastic there's like a plastic

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020 
the plastic there's like a plastic
lining<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.280> monnel<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.430> latches<00:01:47.670> all

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
lining on it and monnel my latches all

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.149 
lining on it and monnel my latches all
the<00:01:48.149> way<00:01:48.299> worn<00:01:49.049> off<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.890> where<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.130> just

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the way worn off to where it's just

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
the way worn off to where it's just
metal<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.960> straight<00:01:52.200> metal<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.710> on

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
metal it's just straight metal down on

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
metal it's just straight metal down on
there<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.729> plastic<00:01:53.970> coating<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.720> has

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
there and that plastic coating is has

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.630 
there and that plastic coating is has
come<00:01:55.409> off<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.710> still<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> end

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
come off you can still see it on the end

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.030 
come off you can still see it on the end
but<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.689> an<00:01:57.840> actual<00:01:58.079> part<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.530> rides<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
but I'm an actual part that rides on the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.670 
but I'm an actual part that rides on the
post<00:01:59.340> it's<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.780> nothing<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.229> metal<00:02:01.560> on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
post it's it's nothing but metal on

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.130 
post it's it's nothing but metal on
metal<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> make<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
metal so that's going to make it have a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.420 
metal so that's going to make it have a
little<00:02:04.409> bit<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> noise<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.979> guess<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.250> only<00:02:05.369> way

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
little bit of noise I guess the only way

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.950 
little bit of noise I guess the only way
to<00:02:05.579> fix<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.000> would<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> actually<00:02:06.600> change

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
to fix that would be to actually change

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.600 
to fix that would be to actually change
out<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.290> latch<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.349> guarantee

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
out this latch but I can guarantee

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.880 
out this latch but I can guarantee
you<00:02:10.789> it's<00:02:11.480> going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> whole<00:02:12.320> lot<00:02:12.350> quieter

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
you it's going to be a whole lot quieter

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.360 
you it's going to be a whole lot quieter
going<00:02:13.280> down<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.520> road<00:02:13.640> now<00:02:13.820> than<00:02:14.000> what<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.210> was
