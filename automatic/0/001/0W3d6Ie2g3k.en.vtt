00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.559
 the young moderately new recipes from people who then put pictures on her blog 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.849
 she is already at the 230 dishes and that attracts a lot of people 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.209
 30 and 396,000 visitors for years 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.439
 unique visitors 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.339
 i find her 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.630
 fantastic 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 when of course enormous pleasure lived up to the velvet to be able to operate on 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.439
 a woman 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.470
 satisfactorily yesterday 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.470
 that people come to watch 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.390
 who did not start her blog a year and a half ago 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.730
 she can also give her children some tips, but she can leave everyone with her blog 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 enjoy her simple dishes 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080
 i said yes i could come get tickets 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.130
 and daughter 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.500
 fine but then you may not have been able to buy from customers that has been around for a while 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.570
 now the internet is this blockade 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.380
 is that all state on the site can always activate much more like 4s on one 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.240
 interpret it differently 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.230
 and a column by year 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.940
 you write that down 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 and that is then 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.910
 Yes 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.860
 you don't know just nice and positive reactions with ten thousand 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.020
 visitors per month 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.899
 they also thought in third place in the top 100 blog of senior citizen network 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.220
 beh since a few days a year and then you are busy cocquyt more 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.710
 It is an incentive to be allowed to land on people themselves turning the Sint Truiden 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.630
 footprint 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.110
 very good figures about pedestals 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.210
 and I think I could not even make it exist to contribute to the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.600
 People here in the vending machine is an idea of ​​which unfortunately seems made easier 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 is a little nicer than his opponent 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.500
 because if i want you then i want a banana country then wait at the table 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.350
 to testify but once the shooter is ready I first take a picture 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.129
 and then I already had the third day a week earlier, because a bit old later 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.059
 iron 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:17.199
 then this year should already be a photo that people should be able to see what 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.439
 he got to know him closely 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.569
 4 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.500
 yes 4 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.499
 while others but then 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.189
 nobody is bothered by it 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.609
 both countries are connected to a record
