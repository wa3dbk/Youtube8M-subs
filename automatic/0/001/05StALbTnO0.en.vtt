00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.860 

so<00:00:04.380> our<00:00:05.069> project<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.790> on<00:00:05.970> hydrogen<00:00:06.420> powered

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
so our project is on hydrogen powered

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.570 
so our project is on hydrogen powered
cars<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.799> just<00:00:07.980> want<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.250> show<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.460> a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
cars and we just want to show you a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.499 
cars and we just want to show you a
little<00:00:08.760> example<00:00:09.170> um<00:00:10.639> one<00:00:11.639> third<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.210> North

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
little example um one third of North

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.350 
little example um one third of North
America's<00:00:13.049> carbon<00:00:13.650> dioxide<00:00:14.309> emissions<00:00:14.700> come

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
America's carbon dioxide emissions come

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.060 
America's carbon dioxide emissions come
from<00:00:15.389> Ottawa<00:00:16.139> yes<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.449> just<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.410> see

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
from Ottawa yes so just want you to see

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.429 
from Ottawa yes so just want you to see
this<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.760> imagine<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.869> paintball<00:00:22.230> gun

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
this so imagine that this paintball gun

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.970 
this so imagine that this paintball gun
here<00:00:22.650> there's<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.340> gasoline-powered<00:00:24.060> car<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
here there's a gasoline-powered car and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.509 
here there's a gasoline-powered car and
imagine<00:00:25.980> each<00:00:26.189> paintball<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:28.099> 1,000<00:00:29.099> pounds

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
imagine each paintball is 1,000 pounds

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.630 
imagine each paintball is 1,000 pounds
of<00:00:29.640> co2<00:00:30.109> carbon<00:00:31.109> dioxide<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:34.489> Louis<00:00:35.489> over

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
of co2 carbon dioxide so Louis over

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:58.910 
of co2 carbon dioxide so Louis over
there<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.410> environment<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:40.700> yeah<00:00:57.649> I'm<00:00:58.649> not

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
there is the environment so yeah I'm not

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
there is the environment so yeah I'm not
removing<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.660> vest<00:01:00.870> ago

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
I'm feeling right go go Bernice training

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:20.700 
I'm feeling right go go Bernice training
support

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.910 

ok

it<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> hydrogen<00:01:29.789> powered<00:01:30.030> car<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:31.289> what

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it was a hydrogen powered car is what

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:53.180 
it was a hydrogen powered car is what
would<00:01:31.619> happen

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.070 

so<00:01:54.190> yeah<00:01:54.430> hydrogen<00:01:55.030> powered<00:01:55.270> cars<00:01:55.570> really

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
so yeah hydrogen powered cars really

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.140 
so yeah hydrogen powered cars really
help<00:01:56.410> our<00:01:56.530> environment<00:01:57.990> thanks<00:01:58.990> for<00:01:59.110> watching
