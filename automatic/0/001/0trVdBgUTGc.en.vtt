immersed in an electrolyte which is

immersed in an electrolyte which is
either<00:00:52.140> an<00:00:52.379> acid<00:00:52.559> or<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> base<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:54.719> acid<00:00:55.170> or

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
base reacts with the metals now because

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
base reacts with the metals now because
the<00:00:58.379> two<00:00:58.559> metals<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.160> different<00:00:59.609> the

the two metals are different the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.240 
the two metals are different the

there's<00:01:02.910> movement<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.899> ions<00:01:04.140> well<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.830> you

there's movement of ions well if you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.310 
there's movement of ions well if you
remember<00:01:05.100> ions<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:06.030> electrically<00:01:06.900> charged

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
remember ions are electrically charged

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.830 
remember ions are electrically charged
atoms<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.360> because<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> metals<00:01:09.750> are

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
atoms and because the metals are

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.810 
atoms and because the metals are
different<00:01:10.140> there's<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> different<00:01:10.799> amount<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
different there's a different amount of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.050 
different there's a different amount of
charge<00:01:12.330> transfer<00:01:12.650> occurring<00:01:13.850> between<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
charge transfer occurring between the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
charge transfer occurring between the
two<00:01:15.270> metals<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.259> creates<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.740> voltage

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
two metals and that creates a voltage

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
two metals and that creates a voltage
difference<00:01:17.549> or<00:01:17.759> potential<00:01:18.299> difference<00:01:18.689> which

cathode is the name
side<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.849> anode<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.420> positive<00:02:15.540> side

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
side and the anode is the positive side

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.080 
side and the anode is the positive side
now<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.159> may<00:02:17.340> say<00:02:17.519> well<00:02:17.670> that's<00:02:17.700> rather

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
now you may say well that's rather

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.380 
now you may say well that's rather
confusing<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:20.489> this<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.209> is

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
confusing but the this is this is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.210 
confusing but the this is this is
because<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> source<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.769> electricity

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
because this is a source of electricity

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.979 
because this is a source of electricity
and<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.879> in<00:02:24.030> there<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.420> operating<00:02:24.900> in

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
and so it's in there it's operating in

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.300 
and so it's in there it's operating in
reverse<00:02:25.489> polarity<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:27.120> reverse<00:02:27.450> direction<00:02:28.310> so

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
reverse polarity in reverse direction so

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.259 
reverse polarity in reverse direction so
in<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.549> battery<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.180> opposite<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.090> can

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
in a battery is the opposite now you can

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.289 
in a battery is the opposite now you can
make<00:02:33.420> electricity<00:02:33.840> from<00:02:34.730> anything<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:35.879> acid

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
make electricity from anything with acid

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.009 
make electricity from anything with acid
for<00:02:37.049> base<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.450> lemon<00:02:39.450> works<00:02:39.629> great

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
for base in it a lemon works great

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.080 
for base in it a lemon works great
putting<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.680> piece<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.069> zinc<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.549> copper<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.089 
putting a piece of zinc and copper in a
