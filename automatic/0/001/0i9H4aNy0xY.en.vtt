other<00:00:15.809> one<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.199> turned<00:00:16.500> out<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.830> bit

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
other one it turned out with a bit

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.920 
other one it turned out with a bit
blurry<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.820> i'm<00:00:17.910> trying<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.570> something

blurry so i'm trying to little something
different<00:00:19.140> i<00:00:19.529> got<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:20.070> camera<00:00:20.369> sitting<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:21.000> one

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
different i got my camera sitting on one

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.109 
different i got my camera sitting on one
of<00:00:21.750> my<00:00:21.930> speakers<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:23.570> here<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:25.609> the<00:00:26.609> compass

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
of my speakers so here is the compass

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.490 
of my speakers so here is the compass
and<00:00:27.390> they'll<00:00:28.140> try<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:30.619> get<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> close<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:33.500> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and they'll try to get it close up you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.380 
and they'll try to get it close up you
can<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> numbers<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.850> dial<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
can see the numbers on the dial that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
can see the numbers on the dial that
around<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> frame<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.250> girl<00:00:45.770> it<00:00:46.770> might<00:00:46.950> be

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
around the frame that girl it might be

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.150 
around the frame that girl it might be
hard<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> numbers<00:00:48.410> which<00:00:49.410> one

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
hard to see that the numbers which one

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.920 
hard to see that the numbers which one
it's<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.140> numbers<00:00:52.500> correspond<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's like the numbers correspond to the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.260 
it's like the numbers correspond to the
to<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.199> direction<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:56.010> circumference<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:57.059> to

know whatever up to 360 is a full circle

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.810 
know whatever up to 360 is a full circle
and<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:08.580> moving<00:01:09.540> pointer<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.220> magnetic

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and the moving pointer is the magnetic

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.600 
and the moving pointer is the magnetic
one<00:01:12.710> as<00:01:13.710> i<00:01:14.610> turn<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.619> know<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:16.979> kind<00:01:17.490> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
one as i turn it you know it all kind of

one as i turn it you know it all kind of
shift<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:19.100> then<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.490> stationary<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.210> that's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
shift and then the stationary one that's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.730 
shift and then the stationary one that's
actually<00:01:21.930> drawn<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.770> dial<00:01:23.009> itself<00:01:24.740> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
actually drawn on the dial itself that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.270 
actually drawn on the dial itself that
is<00:01:26.040> how<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.310> align<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> qibla<00:01:29.250> direction

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
is how you align on the qibla direction

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.560 
is how you align on the qibla direction
or<00:01:29.970> facing<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> kaabah<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.850> determine

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
or facing the kaabah and you determine

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.429 
or facing the kaabah and you determine
your<00:01:34.439> qibla<00:01:35.369> direction<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:36.210> either<00:01:36.840> using<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
your qibla direction by either using a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
your qibla direction by either using a
booklet<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.250> might<00:01:38.490> come<00:01:38.790> with<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.119> compass

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
booklet that might come with the compass

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.960 
booklet that might come with the compass
if<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> buy<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.250> did<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> was

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
if you buy one this one did but it was

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.170 
if you buy one this one did but it was
old<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.659> didn't<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.110> very<00:01:43.259> many<00:01:43.909> towns<00:01:44.909> on

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
old and didn't have very many towns on

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.710 
old and didn't have very many towns on
it<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.750> use<00:01:45.930> Islamic<00:01:46.500> finder<00:01:47.009> net<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.909> there

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it so I use Islamic finder net and there

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.870 
it so I use Islamic finder net and there
are<00:01:48.840> other<00:01:49.049> sources<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> your

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
are other sources or you can go to your

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.010 
are other sources or you can go to your
must<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.909> I'll<00:01:53.909> use<00:01:53.939> Des<00:01:54.420> Moines<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.810> an

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
must it and I'll use Des Moines as an

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.959 
must it and I'll use Des Moines as an
example<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:57.200> forty<00:01:58.200> four<00:01:58.700> point<00:01:59.700> one

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
example it's a forty four point one

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.639 
example it's a forty four point one
degrees<00:02:01.430> from<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.820> north<00:02:03.509> clockwise<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
degrees from in north clockwise so that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.609 
degrees from in north clockwise so that
would<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.130> sifting<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.180> East<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
would be like sifting at East and so you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.309 
would be like sifting at East and so you
you<00:02:10.890> lay<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> compass<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:11.849> on

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
you lay the compass down on

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.160 
you lay the compass down on
the<00:02:13.620> surface<00:02:14.159> either<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.730> floor<00:02:15.209> or<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.540> table

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
the surface either a floor or a table

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.059 
the surface either a floor or a table
and<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:17.819> have<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:19.290> little<00:02:19.590> pouch<00:02:19.799> as

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and I have it on the little pouch as

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.710 
and I have it on the little pouch as
kind<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> background<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.269> shows<00:02:21.510> up

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
kind of a background just so it shows up

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:31.339 
kind of a background just so it shows up
better<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.959> hold<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> camera

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
better and I have to hold the camera

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.500 
better and I have to hold the camera
with<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.069> another<00:02:32.370> was<00:02:32.579> not<00:02:32.819> fall<00:02:33.090> off<00:02:33.120> my

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
with one another was not fall off my

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.899 
with one another was not fall off my
speaker<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:35.390> anyway<00:02:36.390> what<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:37.110> do<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.909> what

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
speaker so anyway what you do is what

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.800 
speaker so anyway what you do is what
you<00:02:39.120> determine<00:02:39.659> your<00:02:39.810> did<00:02:41.090> what<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.329> degrees

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
you determine your did what the degrees

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.880 
you determine your did what the degrees
is<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.709> as<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.730> said<00:02:46.220> 44.1<00:02:48.560> clockwise<00:02:49.560> from

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
is like as I said 44.1 clockwise from

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.250 
is like as I said 44.1 clockwise from
north<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:51.030> take<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.659> arrow<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:55.049> let

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
north you take the arrow then you let

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.149 
north you take the arrow then you let
the<00:02:55.409> compass<00:02:55.829> go<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.209> let<00:02:57.389> it<00:02:57.510> settle

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
the compass go and you let it settle

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.170 
the compass go and you let it settle
till<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.400> needle<00:02:59.760> points<00:03:00.180> north<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:02.180> then

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
till the needle points north and then

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.259 
till the needle points north and then
you<00:03:03.480> turn<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:06.780> turn<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.139> slowly<00:03:08.209> until<00:03:09.209> you

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
you turn you turn it slowly until you

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:17.030 
you turn you turn it slowly until you
get<00:03:09.659> to<00:03:10.579> what<00:03:11.579> would<00:03:11.849> be<00:03:12.090> your<00:03:12.420> direction<00:03:16.040> so

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
get to what would be your direction so

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.880 
get to what would be your direction so
like

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.210 

like<00:03:22.550> this<00:03:22.910> or<00:03:23.330> it<00:03:23.960> could<00:03:24.260> be<00:03:24.470> if<00:03:24.860> you're<00:03:25.160> in

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
like this or it could be if you're in

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.790 
like this or it could be if you're in
another<00:03:25.700> location<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.270> could<00:03:26.450> be<00:03:26.630> like<00:03:26.840> that

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:41.010 

or<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:33.650> get<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.280> back<00:03:34.750> camera<00:03:35.750> view

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.330 

next<00:03:42.020> I'll<00:03:42.230> just<00:03:42.470> go<00:03:42.650> ahead<00:03:42.740> and<00:03:42.950> turn<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.160> to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
next I'll just go ahead and turn it to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:54.680 
next I'll just go ahead and turn it to
what<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:44.420> would<00:03:44.540> be<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.440> like

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.280 

and<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:55.710> would<00:03:56.330> approximately<00:03:57.330> be<00:03:57.690> that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
and that would approximately be that

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:06.710 
and that would approximately be that
significant<00:03:59.130> slide<00:03:59.610> it<00:04:01.310> better<00:04:02.310> view<00:04:05.720> there

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
significant slide it better view there

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.460 
significant slide it better view there
you<00:04:06.900> should<00:04:07.140> be<00:04:07.230> able<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.440> see<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:08.690> that<00:04:09.690> is

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.039 

approximately<00:04:13.700> let's<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.940> call<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.180> 44

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
approximately let's just call it 44

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.289 
approximately let's just call it 44
because<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.739> can't<00:04:16.980> get<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.370> perspex<00:04:17.970> with

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
because you can't get that perspex with

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.610 
because you can't get that perspex with
with<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> little<00:04:19.290> compass<00:04:19.680> like<00:04:19.860> this<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:21.620> then

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
with a little compass like this but then

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.200 
with a little compass like this but then
once<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.250> then<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.760> know<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.030> are

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
once that so then you know you are

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.640 
once that so then you know you are
facing<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:26.070> kaabah<00:04:27.500> for<00:04:28.500> your<00:04:28.620> prayer<00:04:28.920> and

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
facing the kaabah for your prayer and

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.500 
facing the kaabah for your prayer and
you<00:04:31.650> can<00:04:31.890> do<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.100> anywhere<00:04:32.670> as<00:04:32.940> long<00:04:33.000> as<00:04:33.300> you

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
you can do it anywhere as long as you

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.350 
you can do it anywhere as long as you
know<00:04:33.810> which<00:04:34.050> what<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.100> good<00:04:35.310> what<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.120> degree

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
know which what the good what the degree

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.070 
know which what the good what the degree
direction<00:04:36.750> is<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.940> know<00:04:39.000> from<00:04:39.300> like<00:04:39.570> from

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
direction is you know from like from

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.980 
direction is you know from like from
north<00:04:40.440> or<00:04:40.770> whatever<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.880> know<00:04:41.970> if<00:04:42.150> you're<00:04:42.840> in

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
north or whatever you know if you're in

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.680 
north or whatever you know if you're in
that<00:04:43.460> if<00:04:44.460> you're<00:04:45.080> west<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:47.060> Mecca<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.360> would<00:04:48.510> be

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
that if you're west of Mecca it would be

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.130 
that if you're west of Mecca it would be
from<00:04:49.140> north<00:04:50.100> or<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.760> might<00:04:51.030> be<00:04:51.210> from<00:04:51.450> itself<00:04:51.780> it

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
from north or it might be from itself it

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.860 
from north or it might be from itself it
it<00:04:52.500> all<00:04:52.650> depends<00:04:53.040> on<00:04:53.160> your<00:04:53.310> location<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:54.750> know

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
it all depends on your location you know

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.790 
it all depends on your location you know
if<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.110> was<00:04:55.320> in<00:04:56.660> Rio<00:04:57.660> de<00:04:57.870> Janeiro<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:58.470> would<00:04:58.650> have

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
if I was in Rio de Janeiro I would have

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.670 
if I was in Rio de Janeiro I would have
a<00:04:58.830> different<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.640> different<00:05:00.230> direction<00:05:01.230> to<00:05:01.560> go

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
a different a different direction to go

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.300 
a different a different direction to go
by<00:05:02.030> but<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.060> just<00:05:03.360> chose<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.230> put<00:05:04.500> it<00:05:04.620> out<00:05:04.980> it

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
by but I just chose to put it out it

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.340 
by but I just chose to put it out it
would<00:05:05.460> be<00:05:05.610> for<00:05:05.850> Des<00:05:06.000> Moines<00:05:06.210> I<00:05:06.480> will<00:05:07.050> here<00:05:07.260> in

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
would be for Des Moines I will here in

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.490 
would be for Des Moines I will here in
the<00:05:07.440> US<00:05:07.710> so<00:05:08.040> I<00:05:08.450> hope<00:05:09.450> this<00:05:09.630> helps<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.110> hope<00:05:10.290> this

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
the US so I hope this helps I hope this

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.970 
the US so I hope this helps I hope this
is<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.710> little<00:05:11.010> clearer<00:05:11.310> for<00:05:11.640> you<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:12.980> then

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
is a little clearer for you and then

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.130 
is a little clearer for you and then
that's<00:05:14.220> basically<00:05:14.910> how<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.210> use<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.780> Qibla

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
that's basically how you use a Qibla

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.600 
that's basically how you use a Qibla
compass<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:17.419> then<00:05:18.830> so<00:05:19.830> it's<00:05:20.100> helpful<00:05:20.460> for

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
compass and then so it's helpful for

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.909 
compass and then so it's helpful for
travel<00:05:21.360> for<00:05:21.690> instance<00:05:22.020> if<00:05:22.620> I'm<00:05:23.120> going<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.630> find

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
travel for instance if I'm going to find

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.409 
travel for instance if I'm going to find
doing<00:05:25.919> an<00:05:26.040> all-day<00:05:26.370> shopping<00:05:26.970> and<00:05:27.180> I<00:05:27.240> don't

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
doing an all-day shopping and I don't

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.940 
doing an all-day shopping and I don't
have<00:05:27.570> time<00:05:27.780> to<00:05:27.960> go<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.260> mosque<00:05:28.500> it<00:05:28.740> oh<00:05:28.770> I'm

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
have time to go to the mosque it oh I'm

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.220 
have time to go to the mosque it oh I'm
too<00:05:29.160> far<00:05:29.460> away<00:05:29.610> or<00:05:29.970> I<00:05:30.060> just<00:05:30.270> don't<00:05:30.960> want<00:05:31.169> to

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
too far away or I just don't want to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.200 
too far away or I just don't want to
bother<00:05:31.410> with<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:31.919> want<00:05:32.220> if<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.790> want<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.060> pray

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
bother with it I want if I want to pray

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.650 
bother with it I want if I want to pray
right<00:05:33.240> there<00:05:33.690> in<00:05:33.900> where<00:05:34.560> I'm<00:05:34.800> shopping<00:05:35.430> then<00:05:36.360> I

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
right there in where I'm shopping then I

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.960 
right there in where I'm shopping then I
just<00:05:37.080> put<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.530> down<00:05:37.800> on<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.520> table<00:05:38.850> or<00:05:38.880> on

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
just put that down on the table or on

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.520 
just put that down on the table or on
our<00:05:39.030> floor<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:41.280> I<00:05:41.820> turn<00:05:42.570> it<00:05:42.600> to<00:05:42.750> art<00:05:43.050> needs<00:05:43.350> a

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
our floor and I turn it to art needs a

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.360 
our floor and I turn it to art needs a
beat<00:05:43.770> down<00:05:43.950> let<00:05:44.160> it<00:05:44.280> settle<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:44.820> then<00:05:45.480> I<00:05:45.600> pray

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
beat down let it settle and then I pray

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.920 
beat down let it settle and then I pray
and<00:05:47.370> then<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.610> can<00:05:47.760> take<00:05:48.120> it<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.419> school<00:05:48.750> you

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
and then you can take it to school you

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.860 
and then you can take it to school you
can<00:05:49.110> take<00:05:49.290> it<00:05:49.440> to<00:05:49.470> work<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.540> can<00:05:51.540> take<00:05:51.720> it<00:05:51.810> on
