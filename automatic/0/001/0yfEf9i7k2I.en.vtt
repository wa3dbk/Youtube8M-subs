00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 Look 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.699
 without peña dosa does not mark the lack of 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:19.079
 Engage the nobel who is not 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:22.980
 blame for this fast a match the 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:26.329
 america goltz kite is missing goal 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.329
 America then the ball 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:40.879
 the arbitration but what do you say no 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.980
 persons in a pantheon, the triumph is 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.719
 victory is like pumas because it 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.989
 long 90 minutes was a team 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.140
 who risked more attempt more so 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.930
 best saints had its 23 arrivals from 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.300
 crossbar generated a lot of football and then 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.179
 I believe that he within those controversies 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.199
 that arise is the wind is just put 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.199
 for the action 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.930
 I do not say the defense over the goalkeeper 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.810
 of the cougars 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:19.960
 a body part of the body the same 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.130
 goalkeeper is playing the top totally 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.710
 the three of you may see it is 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.229
 impossible good no there was inside 11 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.229
 ended but not at 401 no but no 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.729
 rest must no longer get worse 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.009
 and I do not want to go into other 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.899
 comments but what has been the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.149
 performance of our team what is the 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.920
 analysis the ball entered or center and if not 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.530
 entered it was criminal because he will remove with 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.899
 the hand the ball that is the goal 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.179
 there is a recargon on mill that already 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.820
 our task is your task 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.250
 of these analyzes that you do well you have to 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.350
 do it also in depth because in 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.319
 the court when many teams leave 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.390
 They will also play two I think there 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.209
 three teams on the court and soccer 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.670
 goes through what is the good of all 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.709
 those three teams that can add to the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.180
 show I would like you to tell me 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.670
 that third team 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.790
 who is that third team to you not 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.269
 you know a soccer game there are not three 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.599
 teams on the court there are no three teams 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.599
 on the court 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.010
 and I'm the one who has to tell you who 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.970
 is the 3rd team someone to help me 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.319
 please is this sports reporter 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.540
 then what do you say in front of 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.670
 all or you want me to jesse I say 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.770
 of the arbitration team is not a team 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.620
 it's not a referee team four 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.739
 elements is not a team that is what 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.270
 you wanted to hear thank you very much 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.440
 if you do not have you can you tell me what 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.720
 I have is clear I do not know if this word 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.720
 you can say it or not but I do not care 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.540
 we are the ones in this tournament and we deserve 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.940
 respect then we are for what 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.950
 be in the last three games against 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.080
 who is also in the last three 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.030
 matches because what interests me is 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.370
 that play with this attitude play with 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.140
 this quality because that's how it can be 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.390
 win our lost 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.269
 then to organize a team that 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.250
 you know where it's going to get clear that there 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.650
 than to give the time, they do not show us 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.560
 with this taking responsibility for 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.560
 nothing I do not have ghosts I have no misgivings 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.110
 I am not afraid of my work, my homework 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.040
 then it is not enough for me to take the 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.920
 decisions 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.319
 surely he also has where to go 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.299
 it's going badly, I do not have problems with that 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.670
 it does not take away my sleep anymore, you do not want to continue 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.859
 doing my job as it is here and I continue 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.109
 my life with super conscience 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.230
 quiet because I have roofs of 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:02.680
 glass I do not owe anything 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.870
 it is me who come this 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.610
 team is going to be a seasonal team and 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.590
 that you will be after 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.340
 evaluate 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.360
 Thank you 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.680
 very well the truth is very well expressed 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.870
 He really is very right 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.340
 three teams in the field then twelve 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.350
 teams that face and the four 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.479
 referees that you decide on the match 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.050
 They decide today that China is upset to 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.050
 we 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:46.130
 it's part of the game in mistakes like 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.130
 of the players 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.979
 of course but he maybe what 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:01.970
 it was not express is that it has been worked 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.970
 but play the matches 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.440
 they are going to repeat and they are violating and being 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.350
 ears and that center ball came in 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.590
 deciding 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.790
 but jose ramón that play to us 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.290
 among all of us many 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.180
 from the press until now many 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.890
 they say that the center and those that do not enter 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.750
 perfect and the referee can be wrong 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:33.570
 if he is alive with others he is wrong but 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:36.000
 you're wrong that's why we agree 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.580
 We are fat but I josé what was 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.730
 saying is that a reporter asks 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.130
 there are two teams there is no 323 I'm going to 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:50.150
 tell 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:50.150
 but not that he does not play one of the 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.400
 time spent the habit to decide without 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.580
 barely 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.680
 goodbye to heaven 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.360
 those years are for the arbitrators not 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.520
 we will enter beautiful before you wait outside 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.680
 on the line is not for the referees 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.410
 I understand there I like it formally 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.680
 honey, I like them very well 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.900
 very good is a great technician but not for 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.490
 hold everyone responsible for the week 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.620
 of what the cougars have generated 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.729
 So now they got one day 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.599
 security is loving 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:29.879
 the mother country for not Brazil is because 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:33.990
 that's why but it has nothing to do 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:43.949
 so you can not blame 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:49.099
 always to others with his commandments 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:49.099
 in america they do not bring it in the crosshairs
