00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.460
 hi there, elephants with you, it's 11 like him 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.009
 on the balcony and in it I will tell about the team 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.170
 game room this command to change 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.900
 game rules I will not show how 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 it works just show itself who 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.109
 the team looks very simple game ru 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.650
 space rule itself pro take true or 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.810
 false that is true or false first 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.210
 the rule is the kalpa command 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 will something be displayed in the chat when 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.469
 using command block 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
 that is, if I had true 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.780
 this is written to grumble as the costs 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.480
 Falls it in an hour are not written at 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.969
 using command block i 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.930
 I show exactly the settings that I 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.590
 usually use the next one is dudayeva and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.870
 the cycle will pour and time as you see y 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.690
 me the sun is still there 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.170
 thanks to this team need again 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.240
 there is a question next do fair type will be 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.340
 will the fire spread 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.040
 really the background is worth if we have something 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.610
 set fire then you won't spread 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.580
 mount 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.270
 apples and also it will not go out 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.000
 no matter on what hangar 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 Further I think I will turn off the rogue 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.450
 will be able to keep in mind firewood on experience this 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.630
 no effect but if you put the canvas 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.350
 quite a while does not fall next it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.320
 thinking about spawning whether spawning could 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.640
 would I always immediately put a fall in order not to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.200
 burned if annoying bats 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.070
 it goes on until time drops 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.020
 will something fall out when destroyed 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.360
 blocks further keep an eye on 3 very 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.780
 useful feature when creating like this 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.410
 will it persist and the moment i put 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.090
 true 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.479
 that is, if we take nothing 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.259
 will evaporate will continue the next it could 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.200
 vulture wink 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.450
 could they be able to take over that is 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.830
 destroy blocks or steal like 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.860
 ok and last is on the grass 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.440
 my regeneration is true 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.410
 it is originally its meaning that is 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.480
 whether will be generated automatically 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.720
 a sufficient number of health 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 satiety if you put the background can be 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.370
 there will be leads only if we drank 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.200
 potion health or all plant apple 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.150
 well then if you liked put 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.320
 like subscribe to the channel wait 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.320
