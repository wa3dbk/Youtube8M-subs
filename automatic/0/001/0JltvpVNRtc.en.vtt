00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.140
hey guys!
Today's trick is the Gyro Spin!

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.140
What is that? 
It's a trick in which you spin to your back
grabbing the line from buttbounce to buttbounce

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.000
So it's like a backwards Sick Nasty!
Like the 'macaquinho' from the capoeira!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.030
so, one of the first things you must do is
meanwhile the buttbounce...

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.000
Your front hand is the hand that should be grabbing the line
You will grab the line behind you in this position

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.549
Your grab should have your thumb facing the outer side of the line

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:07.710
if you put it to the inner side, facing your
body you won't be able to spin

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.000
so after you do this position here,
your head will guide you through the move

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so: grab the line
throw your head a lot to your back

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.050
your head will push your body ...
If you throw your head backwards

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:35.070
your legs will come automatically...
about your shoulders... the shoulder in which you hold the line

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.040
goes backwards and the other on, in my case, the left one goes forward

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.020
your body will twist in the air ... 
You should be looking to the other side of the line ...

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.059
so you won't look to this side of the
line

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:56.060
you will look to this side
the buttbounce's side

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.520
you will throw your legs really high tucking your move, why ?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.020
Because like this you can spin faster
The more you extend your leg, slower
your spin will be

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.020
So you should tuck it and spin it easier
Let's check it out!!!
