00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 ten euros for a gaming mouse but can 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.610
 which are good I tested it 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.340
 with the gaming mouse sm 620 from 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.110
 csl and if I am satisfied or rather 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.089
 not that you will learn in this video 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.310
 from the 107th 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.020
 because of the low price I am 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.270
 with quite low expectations of the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.189
 mouse went to the start after the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.590
 For Amazon typical speed too 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.869
 arrived home is the first 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.119
 impression not bad ergonomic 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.929
 design led lighting and a good one 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.120
 processing 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.590
 but what was missing was a bill 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.570
 let alone a decent one 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.850
 packaging because the mouse came only 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
 in a white cardboard box and me 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.360
 I am glad that you have the transport 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.950
 hardly survived the pc 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.239
 However, she was already connected 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.430
 usable and no need 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.890
 additional drivers are installed 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.719
 any movement will be carried out and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.610
 There is no discernible delay 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.860
 but sometimes it seems 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.390
 Mauszeiger develops his own life 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.120
 have and slips over unchecked 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.949
 the screen was only for desktop 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.090
 Applications do not play anymore 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.949
 so far was noticeable 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.439
 But this can also be on the ground 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.630
 leading back to his concerns 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.119
 it is the mouse, however, relatively no matter 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.310
 what she stands for, whether on wood one 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.140
 mousepad or on plastic everywhere 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.210
 you can use them, which of course also 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.420
 to be expected from an optical mouse 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.220
 Should have additional storage space 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.930
 But you can not do it for the fingers 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.430
 expect the mouse and you build 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.920
 complies with the standard 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.020
 but without a cable of course would never 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 a signal will be transmitted but despite 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 the sufficient cable length comes 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.140
 not too annoying knot the laborious 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.360
 take apart as the cable with 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.939
 a material is moved to me very much 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.409
 I like it a lot and sometimes in front of cable 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.079
 should protect fractions 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.790
 though the usb plug is pretty big 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.310
 and robust at the first moment not 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.500
 bad sounds but in lack of space 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.460
 or behind your pc quickly to the problem 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.219
 can be 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.659
 but now back to the operation under 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.939
 extended by another function 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.399
 Will I be playing a 10 euro gaming 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.860
 mouse absolutely did not expect the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.270
 dpi number can be set and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
 though by simply pressing a 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.890
 button at the top of the device of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.010
 Condition will also be different with us 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.530
 colors red blue and green 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.420
 displayed except for a back and forth 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.909
 There are no other buttons 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.650
 freely assignable operating elements except 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.900
 of course the two mouse buttons as well 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.430
 The furniture here may still have me 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.319
 two more freely assignable 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.920
 Controls on the other side 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.560
 pleased 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.629
 for me as rather annoying but felt 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.879
 For many of you, surely one must 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.739
 mouse lights blue and that does not 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.200
 little the lighting gives the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.720
 design a further appreciation and 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.489
 last high quality effect is positive 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.859
 that this blue light is about 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.750
 seven minutes of non-use in the 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.609
 rest and adopted 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.269
 Temporarily disabled for energy 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.760
 save up 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.170
 however, given the price 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.819
 one about the small problems of 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.829
 optical gaming mouse by csl 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.750
 overlook and summarize 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.370
 say that they are very well as 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.230
 gaming mouse has proven and one 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.450
 functionality offers you as 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.310
 standard players need who his 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.409
 However, ask a bit more mouse 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.159
 would like to advise more money in the 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.440
 to take hand 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.760
 for me, the ten euro but have 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.769
 worth it in every case 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.959
 there are other important data to give out 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.549
 also on the product side we 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.739
 get together in the video description 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.199
 linked with some alternatives 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.750
 who is interested in the microphone 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:28.370
 is well advised with the red t 1 1 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.709
 which we have in this video here 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.599
 have tested and all our tests and 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.579
 There are also reviews directly below 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.230
 the linked playlist now only stays 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.849
 still to say you're welcome on 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.620
 our social networks and so on 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.419
 sprinter facebook program and of course 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.010
 our time when you seven point de 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.660
 drop by and say goodbye 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.730
 However, from this video, hope that 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.910
 you liked it and shoot 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.910
 then
