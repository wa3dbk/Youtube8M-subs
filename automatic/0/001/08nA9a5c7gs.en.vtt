00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.259
 the higher- level training cycles 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.000
 at the European University of Balenciaga 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.550
 was born with the aim of covering 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.770
 labor demand forming the best 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.630
 technicians and taking into account our 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.910
 educational quality our approach 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.110
 international and the content contact 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.110
 with the labor market 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.260
 I decided to study in this center because of 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.730
 the offer cycle and also could be 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.150
 linked to the European University of 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.150
 Valencia 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.850
 This center demands a lot from you 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:56.030
 Punctuality attend class 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.829
 that you do your work and also of 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.600
 that the continuity to see study in 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.309
 do not really feel that they are in a 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.909
 cycle you always feel like you have the 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.909
 college 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.490
 one of the advantages we have in the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.190
 professional center or I think of valència 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.050
 are our guys reduced the deal 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.210
 customized to the student through our 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.760
 mentor program that accompanies you during 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.620
 the two years of the training cycle and 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.450
 our international focus since they have 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.310
 to intensive language training 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.210
 to be able to join both the market 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 national as international 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.200
 European professional center of València 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.330
 from the 1 time since before 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.160
 start the studies offered me the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.200
 possibility of signing an agreement 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.570
 international with any company that 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.920
 from the first moment my mentor and the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 center people worry about using 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.070
 agreements with international companies 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.070
 that meet the requirements that I seek 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.960
 the academic model is based on a 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.479
 practical approach firstly the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.960
 professors are active professionals and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.610
 they try to put it into practice in the classroom 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.380
 those issues that go against the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.380
 student in the labor market 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.080
 what I like most about this cycle that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm studying is the practical load 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.610
 that you have both in the lab and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.960
 in class we give real cases and I think 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.960
 that prepares you a lot and I really like it 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.420
 I hope that and better I be a 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.220
 very analytical businessman who 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.500
 know see opportunities that you know 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.940
 organize and run a business well to 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.930
 me the most important thing in this cycle and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.770
 I think that is what they most 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.770
 they will try to start
