that the debate was held on website

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:39.959 
that the debate was held on website
eight<00:06:35.439> years<00:06:35.469> later<00:06:36.120> so<00:06:38.610> we<00:06:39.610> thought<00:06:39.789> it<00:06:39.909> was

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
eight years later so we thought it was

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:43.740 
eight years later so we thought it was
work<00:06:40.210> and<00:06:41.080> we<00:06:41.259> still<00:06:41.529> do
