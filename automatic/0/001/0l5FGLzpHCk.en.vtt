if<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.250> want<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:23.790> big<00:01:23.820> bump<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
if you want a really big bump you can

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.660 
if you want a really big bump you can
make<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.630> fun<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.259> big<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.310> know

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
make this fun really big and you know

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
make this fun really big and you know
effectively<00:01:27.540> makes<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.930> hair<00:01:28.049> into<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> bun

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
effectively makes your hair into a bun

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
effectively makes your hair into a bun
fit<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.250> go<00:01:29.369> ahead<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.670> release<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
fit so then go ahead and release that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.700 
fit so then go ahead and release that
top<00:01:30.240> section<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.780> separated<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.409> give

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
top section that we separated and give

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
top section that we separated and give
it<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.040> teasing<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> kind<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.909> net<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it a little teasing to kind of net the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
it a little teasing to kind of net the
hair<00:01:33.720> together<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.470> will<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:34.740> nicely

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
hair together so that it will go nicely

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.890 
hair together so that it will go nicely
over<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:35.939> bump<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.450> made<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
over it the little bump that we made and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
over it the little bump that we made and
then<00:01:36.930> smooth<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> hair<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.759> a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
then smooth the hair back so that it's a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.999 
then smooth the hair back so that it's a
nice<00:01:39.000> smooth<00:01:39.600> bump<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
nice smooth bump now you can see on the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.469 
nice smooth bump now you can see on the
left<00:01:41.220> side<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.490> how<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.759> supposed<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> look<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
left side is how it's supposed to look I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.760 
left side is how it's supposed to look I
do<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.780> without<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.079> mirror<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.560> right

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
do this without a mirror so the right

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
do this without a mirror so the right
side<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> had<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> fix<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.759> little<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:45.119> later<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
side I had to fix a little bit later it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
side I had to fix a little bit later it
looks<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.810> funny<00:01:46.079> right<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:47.130> then

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
looks a little funny right now but then

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.609 
looks a little funny right now but then
just<00:01:47.460> crisscross<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:47.880> pins<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:49.470> actually

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
just crisscross your pins and I actually

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
just crisscross your pins and I actually
end<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:49.890> using<00:01:49.979> three<00:01:50.399> pins<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.840> I

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
end up using three pins to do this and I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.270 
end up using three pins to do this and I
just<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> push<00:01:52.380> my<00:01:52.530> hair<00:01:52.649> back<00:01:52.829> up<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
just kind of push my hair back up and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.429 
just kind of push my hair back up and
that<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> got<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> nice<00:01:54.720> big<00:01:54.960> bump<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.380> then

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that way I got a nice big bump and then

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
that way I got a nice big bump and then
stuck<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.100> bobby<00:01:56.280> pin<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> after<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
stuck one more bobby pin in it after I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.639 
stuck one more bobby pin in it after I
had<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> look<00:01:57.420> everywhere<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.320> apparently

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
had to look everywhere for it apparently

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
had to look everywhere for it apparently
then<00:01:59.369> go<00:01:59.490> ahead<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.729> pick<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.090> hair

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
then go ahead and pick up the hair

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.060 
then go ahead and pick up the hair
that's<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.140> underneath<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> would<00:02:01.950> say

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
that's just underneath that I would say

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800 
that's just underneath that I would say
the<00:02:02.159> two<00:02:02.280> inches<00:02:02.549> underneath<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.360> they

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the two inches underneath that and they

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.080 
the two inches underneath that and they
heard<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.350> pinned

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
heard that we just pinned

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.179 
heard that we just pinned
twist<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.689> all<00:02:05.780> together<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.409> turn<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.829> into<00:02:06.979> a

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
twist it all together and turn it into a

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.419 
twist it all together and turn it into a
bun<00:02:07.579> so<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.360> wrap<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.569> around<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.800> twist<00:02:10.099> and

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
bun so just wrap it around and twist and

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.350 
bun so just wrap it around and twist and
then<00:02:10.610> pin<00:02:10.819> it<00:02:10.910> into<00:02:11.030> place

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
then pin it into place

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.570 
then pin it into place
now<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.110> can<00:02:12.380> interlock<00:02:12.739> these<00:02:12.920> pens<00:02:13.160> really

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
now you can interlock these pens really

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.800 
now you can interlock these pens really
nicely<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.030> here<00:02:14.150> especially<00:02:14.239> because<00:02:14.540> it's

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
nicely in here especially because it's

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.990 
nicely in here especially because it's
such<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:14.959> small<00:02:15.290> bun<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.770> also<00:02:16.520> pendants<00:02:16.880> with

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
such a small bun and also pendants with

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.550 
such a small bun and also pendants with
those<00:02:17.090> pins<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.660> use<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.050> make<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.349> bump

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
those pins that we use to make the bump

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.380 
those pins that we use to make the bump
that<00:02:18.890> way<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.310> really<00:02:19.819> really<00:02:20.090> secure

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
that way this is a really really secure

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.000 
that way this is a really really secure
style<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.020> not<00:02:21.230> going<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.530> go<00:02:21.620> anywhere

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
style like it's not going to go anywhere

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.350 
style like it's not going to go anywhere
so<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:22.730> make<00:02:23.000> sure<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.150> you're

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
so just make sure that you're

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.880 
so just make sure that you're
interlocking<00:02:24.080> your<00:02:24.200> pens<00:02:24.380> as<00:02:24.500> you're<00:02:24.620> doing

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
interlocking your pens as you're doing

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.860 
interlocking your pens as you're doing
them<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:25.310> take<00:02:25.910> another<00:02:26.209> section<00:02:26.510> all

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
them and then take another section all

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.210 
them and then take another section all
the<00:02:26.989> hair<00:02:27.140> from<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.349> top<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.739> your<00:02:27.860> ears<00:02:28.069> up

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
the hair from the top of your ears up

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.190 
the hair from the top of your ears up
should<00:02:28.400> be<00:02:28.459> incorporated<00:02:29.000> by<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.330> wrap<00:02:30.019> it

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
should be incorporated by now wrap it

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.220 
should be incorporated by now wrap it
into<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.530> bun<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.220> pin<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.670> place<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.239> then

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
into a bun and pin it in place and then

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.449 
into a bun and pin it in place and then
the<00:02:33.410> last<00:02:33.650> thing<00:02:33.769> we're<00:02:33.920> gonna<00:02:34.010> do<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.340> just

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
the last thing we're gonna do is just

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.800 
the last thing we're gonna do is just
take<00:02:34.580> all<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.000> rest<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.360> hair<00:02:35.569> that's

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
take all the rest of the hair that's

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.390 
take all the rest of the hair that's
left<00:02:36.110> down<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.620> nape<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:36.980> neck<00:02:37.069> and

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
left down to the nape of the neck and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.809 
left down to the nape of the neck and
put<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.239> into<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.630> button<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:40.130> just<00:02:40.400> twisting

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
put that into a button so just twisting

even style now on this one we are gonna

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.009

still<00:03:47.060> be<00:03:47.090> Dutch<00:03:47.299> braiding<00:03:47.569> but<00:03:47.840> you're<00:03:47.930> gonna

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
still be Dutch braiding but you're gonna

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.020 
still be Dutch braiding but you're gonna
bring<00:03:48.290> hair<00:03:48.470> from<00:03:48.590> under<00:03:49.069> instead<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:49.880> hair

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
bring hair from under instead of hair

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.300 
bring hair from under instead of hair
from<00:03:50.120> on<00:03:50.299> top<00:03:50.540> just<00:03:51.139> because<00:03:51.470> your<00:03:51.920> braid<00:03:52.130> is<00:03:52.280> a

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
from on top just because your braid is a

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.949 
from on top just because your braid is a
little<00:03:52.549> bit<00:03:52.639> farther<00:03:52.850> up<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.359> instead<00:03:53.900> of

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
little bit farther up and instead of

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.110 
little bit farther up and instead of
being<00:03:54.260> down<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:55.370> just<00:03:55.400> makes<00:03:55.760> sense<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.090> just

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
being down it just makes sense so just

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.789 
being down it just makes sense so just
pull<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.480> hair<00:03:56.630> from<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.230> bottom<00:03:57.500> up<00:03:57.650> and

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
pull the hair from the bottom up and

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:58.960 
pull the hair from the bottom up and
then<00:03:58.040> braid<00:03:58.280> down<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.549> rest<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.850> hair

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
then braid down the rest of the hair

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.180 
then braid down the rest of the hair
normally<00:03:59.389> next<00:04:00.290> you're<00:04:00.380> gonna<00:04:00.440> pull<00:04:00.769> both<00:04:01.160> of

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190

a<00:04:18.709> couple<00:04:19.100> times<00:04:19.340> through<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.930> middle<00:04:21.350> of<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
a couple times through the middle of the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.900 
a couple times through the middle of the

braid and then at the end of the race

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.370 
braid and then at the end of the race
that<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.180> get<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.330> nice<00:04:23.540> secure<00:04:23.750> hold<00:04:24.140> there

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
that you get a nice secure hold there

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.230 
that you get a nice secure hold there
then<00:04:25.070> bring<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.340> second<00:04:25.640> braid<00:04:25.790> up<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.120> use

then bring the second braid up and use

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.610 
then bring the second braid up and use
that<00:04:26.270> braid<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.690> cover<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.050> end<00:04:27.200> of<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.410> first

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.590 
that braid to cover the end of the first
braid<00:04:27.890> so<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.580> don't<00:04:28.850> see<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.090> at<00:04:29.210> all

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
braid so you don't see it at all

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.480 
braid so you don't see it at all
and<00:04:30.020> just<00:04:30.230> pin<00:04:30.380> nicely<00:04:30.710> into<00:04:30.920> that<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.340> then

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
and just pin nicely into that and then

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.980 
and just pin nicely into that and then
you<00:04:31.580> can<00:04:31.730> tuck<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.150> end<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.540> second<00:04:32.870> braid

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
you can tuck the end of the second braid

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.330 
you can tuck the end of the second braid
under<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.380> first<00:04:33.590> braid<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:33.920> it's<00:04:34.070> hidden

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
under the first braid and it's hidden

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.370 
under the first braid and it's hidden
for<00:04:34.970> any<00:04:35.090> flyaways<00:04:35.360> just<00:04:35.870> stick<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.170> through<00:04:36.200> a

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
for any flyaways just stick it through a

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.810 
for any flyaways just stick it through a
bobby<00:04:36.590> pin<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:36.980> it<00:04:37.070> will<00:04:37.190> go<00:04:37.310> wherever<00:04:37.520> the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
bobby pin and it will go wherever the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.670 
bobby pin and it will go wherever the
bobby<00:04:37.970> pin<00:04:38.240> goes<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.750> then<00:04:39.260> just<00:04:39.470> pin<00:04:39.650> it

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
bobby pin goes and then just pin it

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.410 
bobby pin goes and then just pin it
wherever<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.430> want<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.120> will<00:04:41.240> hide

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
wherever you want it and that will hide

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.000 
wherever you want it and that will hide
them<00:04:41.630> very<00:04:41.840> effectively<00:04:42.290> so<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.650> don't<00:04:42.830> have

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
them very effectively so you don't have

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.470 
them very effectively so you don't have
any<00:04:43.160> little<00:04:43.490> antenna<00:04:43.730> sticking<00:04:44.060> out<00:04:44.330> of<00:04:44.450> your

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
any little antenna sticking out of your

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.730 
any little antenna sticking out of your
head<00:04:44.750> while<00:04:44.960> you're<00:04:45.080> wearing<00:04:45.200> this<00:04:45.470> hairstyle
