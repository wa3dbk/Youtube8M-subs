00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
that's 100 servings in one tub so it's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.510 
that's 100 servings in one tub so it's
going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> last<00:00:40.829> year<00:00:41.100> fair<00:00:41.309> while<00:00:43.250> cost<00:00:44.250> for

protein<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> isolates<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.260> there

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
protein you got the isolates in there

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.080 
protein you got the isolates in there
are<00:01:01.620> some<00:01:01.800> main<00:01:01.980> ingredients<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> isolates

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
are some main ingredients the isolates

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.179 
are some main ingredients the isolates
that's<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.780> makes<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.320> better<00:01:04.739> muscle

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that's what makes it a better muscle

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.800 
that's what makes it a better muscle
builder<00:01:05.960> for<00:01:06.960> me<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.159> new<00:01:08.880> peptide<00:01:09.570> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
builder for me then the new peptide so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
builder for me then the new peptide so
they<00:01:09.960> brought<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.650> find<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> peptides<00:01:11.640> are

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
they brought out I find the peptides are

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
they brought out I find the peptides are
better<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> cut<00:01:12.570> inside<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
better for the cut inside but this is

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
better for the cut inside but this is
good<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> pitting<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> muscle<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:16.140> got

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
whey protein concentrate the caffeine so

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.870 
whey protein concentrate the caffeine so
it's<00:01:20.070> good<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.430> before<00:01:20.970> bed<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.420> well<00:01:21.450> and

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
start on that low on cash this is what I

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.000 
start on that low on cash this is what I
go<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.799> I<00:02:13.239> just<00:02:14.239> tide<00:02:14.480> me<00:02:14.660> over<00:02:14.690> for<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.590> muscle
