00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.099
 the renato pilot helicopter 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.250
 since 1990 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.630
 I had an uncle of mine who was from the road 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 so I have my first photo of 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.880
 side of an airplane a single engine was more 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.880
 low that the wing so too brat of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.010
 2010 at 16 maybe not even for 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 Family stimulus this reason then the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 People end up living in the middle of it. 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.190
 gave the opportunity I 'm here, I have to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.739
 to look for a school to vote normally 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.610
 in the field of mars where the majority 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.460
 of schools are two pilot leprosy courses 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.789
 private and commercial pilot in private 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.620
 will take a theoretical course 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:54.270
 then will make the flight hours 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.160
 around 35 40 hours is a flight with the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.920
 examiner us a flight check 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.609
 being enabled with the private pilot 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.159
 It is that this first step goes to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.119
 the commercial pilot created a new course 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 a new medical examination and supplements 100 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.250
 hours of flight to be able to make a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 new check for his commercial pilot 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.840
 Today the market is good 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.090
 basin of fields to offshore operation 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.830
 generally have had enough 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.390
 difficulty in meeting the needs 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.270
 because executive aviation in a way 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.890
 General is picking up the staff a bit 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.100
 more experience in a way to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.689
 other is missing pilots understood 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.670
 Qualified with luggage I do not know 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.310
 nobody who paid 500 hours the guy is going 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.380
 giving much paid ladies and starts to 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.509
 battle both in the middle makes the flight here 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.210
 Other, I'll finally get there. 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.310
 this baggage of 500 hours and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.240
 basically the idea of ​​experience is the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.610
 life right 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.290
 with any other profession is is the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.020
 luggage that has thing that an instructor 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.719
 can teach can speak but is the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.240
 experience each flight is a flight if you have one 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.830
 different atmosphere a different place 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.690
 different operation and each region has 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.960
 your 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.720
 particularities and generate of metrology 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.430
 operating area in the control area . 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.610
 chances we never get 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.380
 It will be fully because a machine but 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.050
 in general we always have 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.860
 beware is always before the problem 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.260
 huh 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.810
 a pre flight when it's going to go to the machine 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.990
 to make a flight to a maintenance 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.270
 whether periodic or calendar here 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.710
 flower flight hours the operator who flies there 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.000
 little gave x months to a year will have to 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.190
 do a maintenance anyway 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.190
 It is flown for now this guy enough and there 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.720
 do you have the hourly flight maintenance 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.820
 in this line it is obligatory to make and 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.370
 people know that so the resources to 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.960
 you fly in the previous region is more 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.880
 calm if you have an emergency if you 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.100
 it was a clue in a pasture 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.600
 many times you will not have this 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.670
 availability mainly in 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.860
 operation inside the city, right? 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.540
 So we have to be before the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.880
 safety bridge both in maintenance 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.780
 in the operation, what concerns 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.900
 respect limits are you talking about your pro the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.900
 owner of the machine your passenger 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.600
 that is, your customer is ultimately not 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.970
 Okay, the time is bad or this 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.070
 operation ensures this location is 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.810
 bring you to make a flight 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.550
 It is safe for you to carry a passenger 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.650
 that he does not feel afraid many times 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.110
 happens sometimes to pick up a woman a 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.989
 older passenger who are persons 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.519
 that not so with prejudice but so 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.590
 in my experience I say with 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.780
 own reality of situations in which 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.880
 the person does not have a flight condition and 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.920
 She ends up looking at the flight. 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.800
 illegal immigrant made a difficult mission but 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.620
 with the sense of a flight not the time 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.110
 beautiful but if you go there and solve it 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.190
 mission, then it is also 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.100
 visual a beautiful day by the beach in a 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.040
 beautiful place is wonderful we think 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.840
 in several pilots with the holiness the guy 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.080
 Can not stop a thing too much. 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.820
 pleasurable 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.570
 like any other profession has pros and 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.210
 cons and often requires that you 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.120
 since long in life to 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.120
 achieve this point
