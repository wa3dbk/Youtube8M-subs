which is this one that I've got right

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.200 
which is this one that I've got right

but<00:00:35.559> let's<00:00:36.160> zoom<00:00:36.399> in<00:00:36.579> closer<00:00:36.850> although<00:00:37.360> you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
but let's zoom in closer although you

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.790 
but let's zoom in closer although you
don't<00:00:37.539> need<00:00:37.629> to<00:00:37.780> zoom<00:00:37.960> in<00:00:38.079> too<00:00:38.260> far<00:00:38.469> with<00:00:38.680> this

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
don't need to zoom in too far with this

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.890 
don't need to zoom in too far with this
watch<00:00:39.039> and<00:00:39.370> take<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:39.970> look<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.550> what<00:00:43.300> makes<00:00:43.690> this

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
watch and take a look so what makes this

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.510 
watch and take a look so what makes this
watch<00:00:44.110> unique<00:00:44.470> aside<00:00:44.829> from<00:00:45.100> its<00:00:45.280> overall

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
watch unique aside from its overall

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.729 
watch unique aside from its overall
appearance<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.510> size<00:00:46.690> is<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.260> fact<00:00:47.470> that<00:00:47.650> it

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
appearance and size is the fact that it

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.220 
appearance and size is the fact that it
is<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:47.890> four<00:00:48.430> time<00:00:48.820> zone<00:00:49.120> watch<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:49.989> there<00:00:50.140> are

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
is a four time zone watch so there are

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.110 
is a four time zone watch so there are
four<00:00:50.560> different<00:00:50.829> ways<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.220> view<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.910> time

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
four different ways to view the time

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.250 
four different ways to view the time
Time<00:00:53.020> one<00:00:53.410> is<00:00:53.770> this<00:00:54.070> sub<00:00:54.700> dial<00:00:55.000> here<00:00:55.450> at<00:00:56.140> the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
Time one is this sub dial here at the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.080 
Time one is this sub dial here at the
three<00:00:56.440> o'clock<00:00:56.530> position<00:00:56.850> which<00:00:57.850> also

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
three o'clock position which also

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.060 
three o'clock position which also
features<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.600> chronograph<00:00:58.989> which<00:00:59.410> is<00:00:59.559> operated

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
features a chronograph which is operated

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.389 
features a chronograph which is operated
by<00:01:00.100> these<00:01:00.750> start/stop<00:01:01.750> buttons<00:01:02.170> here<00:01:02.559> so

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
by these start/stop buttons here so

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.639 
by these start/stop buttons here so
that's<00:01:03.640> starting<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.119> chronograph<00:01:04.689> stopping

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
that's starting the chronograph stopping

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.440 
that's starting the chronograph stopping
and<00:01:06.689> resetting<00:01:08.520> time<00:01:09.520> 2<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:10.060> actually<00:01:10.270> a

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
and resetting time 2 is actually a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.570 
and resetting time 2 is actually a
digital<00:01:10.810> time<00:01:11.380> display<00:01:11.860> down<00:01:12.220> at<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.430> bottom

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
digital time display down at the bottom

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.350 
digital time display down at the bottom
at<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.970> 6<00:01:13.180> o'clock<00:01:13.299> position<00:01:13.950> time<00:01:14.950> 3<00:01:15.490> &amp;<00:01:15.760> 4<00:01:16.030> are

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
at the 6 o'clock position time 3 &amp; 4 are

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.740 
at the 6 o'clock position time 3 &amp; 4 are
both<00:01:16.390> traditional<00:01:17.229> analog<00:01:18.540> windows<00:01:19.540> we've

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
both traditional analog windows we've

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.920 
both traditional analog windows we've
got<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.140> time<00:01:20.440> 3<00:01:20.740> at<00:01:20.860> 6<00:01:21.130> o'clock<00:01:21.280> here<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:21.970> up

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
got the time 3 at 6 o'clock here and up

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.200 
got the time 3 at 6 o'clock here and up
at<00:01:23.110> 12<00:01:23.350> o'clock<00:01:23.650> is<00:01:23.680> time<00:01:24.130> for<00:01:24.549> and<00:01:24.729> time<00:01:24.909> for

at 12 o'clock is time for and time for
also<00:01:25.600> features<00:01:26.049> an<00:01:26.260> outer<00:01:26.440> ring<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:27.010> has<00:01:27.100> a

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
also features an outer ring that has a

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.219 
also features an outer ring that has a
24-hour<00:01:27.670> clock<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:30.369> military<00:01:30.760> time<00:01:31.000> so<00:01:31.810> those

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
24-hour clock for military time so those

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.230 
24-hour clock for military time so those
are<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.470> four<00:01:32.740> time<00:01:33.250> windows<00:01:33.670> now<00:01:33.880> each<00:01:34.060> is

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
are the four time windows now each is

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.810 
are the four time windows now each is
controlled<00:01:34.690> by<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.900> separate<00:01:35.470> mechanism<00:01:36.159> so

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
controlled by a separate mechanism so

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.899 
controlled by a separate mechanism so
time<00:01:37.330> 1<00:01:37.659> is<00:01:37.930> set<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:38.710> as<00:01:39.100> well<00:01:39.280> as<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.490> date<00:01:39.670> by

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
time 1 is set and as well as the date by

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.130 
time 1 is set and as well as the date by
this<00:01:40.080> main<00:01:41.080> crown<00:01:41.439> here<00:01:41.890> at<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.549> 3<00:01:42.760> o'clock

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this main crown here at the 3 o'clock

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.870 
this main crown here at the 3 o'clock
time<00:01:44.140> 2<00:01:44.470> is<00:01:44.500> actually<00:01:44.830> set<00:01:45.250> by<00:01:45.400> these<00:01:45.610> little

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
time 2 is actually set by these little

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.570 
time 2 is actually set by these little
push<00:01:46.299> buttons<00:01:46.750> which<00:01:47.500> almost<00:01:47.799> look<00:01:48.070> like<00:01:48.280> part

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
push buttons which almost look like part

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.450 
push buttons which almost look like part
of<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.729> hardware<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.890> watch<00:01:51.070> but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
of the hardware of the of the watch but

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.149 
of the hardware of the of the watch but
in<00:01:51.700> fact<00:01:51.880> they're<00:01:52.180> buttons<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:54.130> can

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
in fact they're buttons and you can

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.359 
in fact they're buttons and you can
control<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.290> set<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.439> date<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.650> time<00:01:56.860> there

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
control and set the date and time there

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.050 
control and set the date and time there
and<00:01:57.549> then<00:01:58.619> time<00:01:59.619> 3<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.130> controlled<00:02:00.580> here<00:02:00.909> and

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
and then time 3 is controlled here and

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.749 
and then time 3 is controlled here and
then<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:01.689> teeny<00:02:02.110> tiny<00:02:02.590> little<00:02:02.830> crown<00:02:03.250> up<00:02:03.640> in

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
then this teeny tiny little crown up in

other two watches just so you can take a

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.659 
other two watches just so you can take a
look<00:04:01.540> at<00:04:01.720> them<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.980> next<00:04:03.519> one<00:04:03.699> is<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:04.650> DZ

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669
