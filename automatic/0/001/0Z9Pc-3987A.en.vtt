00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hi to all this the room in this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.700
 video i will give you my 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.049
 impressions on gta 5 ps4 xbox one then 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.340
 I could have given them to you the next day 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.389
 of the game's release but I find that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.000
 it's not cool to give one's impressions 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.530
 when we discovered there's almost nothing 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.880
 I have rather advanced so I'm going 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.830
 to be able to go into more detail 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.600
 so let's start with the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.070
 launch of the game I find it less 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 catastrophic that last year on 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.460
 ps3 as bugs 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.840
 there have been people who can not 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.529
 buy some other vehicles that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.029
 have too much money 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.260
 most who can not play in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 line or at least not very long 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.230
 before being disconnected while 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.030
 last year it was still good 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.290
 worse than that our characters are doing 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.910
 delete automatically 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.680
 I do not know you but I had to 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.360
 repeat 5 people and each time 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.829
 I reached a good level with a lot 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.510
 money and I had to start all over again 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.219
 it was just horrible and I know 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.379
 even who will have abandoned gta 5 because of 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.750
 this year it's already better 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.649
 the bugs are not that bad and they 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.020
 will soon be settled 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.160
 rockstar has already released patches and is going 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.270
 still we get out patches for 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 improve the situation 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.600
 so there was a lot of to play in the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.680
 story mode and I would say that the fact 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.489
 that they have bugs online it's a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.199
 bad for a good 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.460
 so I do not endorse the bugs well 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.510
 obviously but it allows us to move 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.489
 more time in story mode 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.840
 while if everything went well online 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.310
 there are many people who would not go 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.380
 in story mode just for 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.790
 discover all the new things on 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.439
 love to play online first me 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.490
 spend all my time online merckx 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.350
 late made the effort to add us 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.549
 things in the story mode 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.470
 so it's up to us to do 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.820
 the effort to do it is for us 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.159
 that they did it so much in 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.689
 enjoy then nice first concept to 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.860
 the creation of a character we had 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.810
 huge possibilities 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.549
 so yes for sure we could not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.020
 example make you fat or slim down our 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.700
 character mii had to change her size 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 but in my opinion it's a question of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.270
 stability of the game for not that some 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.340
 have a character too big or too 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.240
 tall and can not hide while 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.250
 others are walking with 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.810
 characters too small or too thin me 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.460
 I understand the fear of rock star by 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.899
 report to that they do not want them 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.369
 have inequality between the players and 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.200
 me it does not bother me more than that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.540
 so here we are in things that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.399
 do not bother too much and that I liked 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.840
 but we will come to things that 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.700
 disturb you will see later 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.619
 so we have the first-person view 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.479
 great idea bravo rockstar is a 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.229
 major change whether on foot or 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.299
 in vehicles 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.380
 the view is simply breathtaking 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.509
 plus we have three thousand news 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.649
 animations like for example how to 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.599
 cardiac and a vehicle 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.950
 we also have details like trevor in 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.700
 tapping on his phone at the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.640
 first person 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.319
 it adds 2 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 life in the game by cons what I find 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.250
 shame is that I really thought 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.990
 that the way to walk to the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.330
 first person was going to be as 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.400
 fluid only in the fps as call of 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.740
 duty for example that's what I thought 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.450
 really while there in gta 5 I 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.810
 find that it is very jerky when we 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.490
 short 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.260
 there are jerks every time we 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.730
 wants to shoot and that I think it's due 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.230
 to the fact that at the base it's a game at the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.580
 third person and that instead of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.750
 completely change the way of 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.670
 move in first person 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.500
 they just changed the view they have 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.030
 kept the displacement codes it's 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.590
 damage is mainly because of 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.239
 that I do not often put the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.860
 first person I think that we 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.390
 completely disadvantageous compared to 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.870
 others at the level of how 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.300
 move 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.650
 on the other hand in confrontation it's great 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.150
 since we can configure the parts 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.500
 so that we are all at the first 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.510
 person and suddenly no one is 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.280
 disadvantage is therefore at the limit there 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.690
 it's really a good addition so when 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.610
 you take out a weapon and you aim 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.230
 a place everything becomes a little bit more 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.300
 fuzzy around and the place that 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.100
 you aim becomes very clear even if he has 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.540
 a bit far so that allows us to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.860
 better visualize our target is to 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.250
 less and disturbed by what's going on 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.380
 around 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.400
 and I like first person 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.320
 in a vehicle 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.579
 there is the speedometer that reacts 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.350
 well depending on the speed at 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.610
 which one you go when you accelerate 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.930
 when you slow down when you 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.519
 turn on your lights there are the lights that 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.840
 light up on the meter but there are 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.329
 two things that bother me there 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.489
 the first is that vehicles 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.760
 block between 100 and 120 miles per 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.500
 hour 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.090
 they are blocking just about all in these 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.829
 waters there whereas in reality there should be 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.310
 to have a huge difference according to the 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.260
 vehicles 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.480
 but the worst is not that it's the 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.970
 mirrors so let go of agree 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.590
 at all how can we create such a game 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.690
 and at the moment of creating the reflection in the 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.640
 mirrors say themselves good ball and retro 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.810
 we loved it in blur so that people do not 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.239
 do not see what's going on behind them 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.680
 no, that's not possible sometimes 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.090
 I would like to talk to the developers of 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.190
 at rockstar pass who has things 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.930
 like that I can not understand 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.820
 the little addition of the wallpaper on the 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.320
 phone with our logos etc 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.560
 it's really nice when you press 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.630
 r3 there is also the map that turns there 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.010
 I agree and the rockstar did 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.810
 a good job there is some detail 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.519
 negligible as for example also 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.290
 when you tap on a tile it falls 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.910
 not crumble as usual at 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.919
 first shot but they break well at 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.810
 the place where you type and the more you type 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.489
 rain falls when we have on board a 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.380
 vehicle and that makes the player believe 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.520
 he lowers his head and 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.340
 it's all good for the online mode 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.889
 because 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.419
 online we have no option when we 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.680
 gets shot apart from doing some 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.360
 zigzags with the vehicle 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.820
 at least there would be protection in 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.720
 plus the submarine the famous underwater 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.490
 they have improved 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.840
 there too I do not understand it's a 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.479
 improvement so that's part of 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.400
 things that rockstar test in priority and 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.870
 yet the submarine is buggy when 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.180
 we go underwater with the submarine the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.680
 submarine cabin fills with water from 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.699
 we have more apnea when we decide 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.560
 to get out of the submarine 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.790
 luckily we do not die when we 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.919
 is inside because that would be 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.720
 really the rockstar pompom created 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.550
 novelties and tests half there 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.950
 on it too I have trouble understanding 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.600
 I really need to be explained when 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.130
 we have an accident at high speed 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.840
 there is a visual effect that I do not appreciate 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.510
 wrong is that there is a zoom on the place 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.919
 pet with a blurred effect outside the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.169
 fart which allows us to better 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.880
 visualize the scene when it's raining too 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.040
 the effects of rain on the ground are 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.630
 gorgeous even on the water on anything 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.919
 which vehicle besides they are they 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.450
 are beautiful the only thing I 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.220
 could blame rockstar over there 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.930
 is that the wipers do put 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.330
 not on the way when it's raining 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.360
 it's just a detail the leaves that 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.830
 move when we go in there so that it 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.210
 there is even a slowing effect of 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.060
 character when the leaves are too 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.680
 big or compass in a bush and I 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.630
 must admit that I love this realism 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.370
 must see also the stars in the sky 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.200
 we finally have a sky that approaches a 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.150
 little more than reality 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.380
 the gun rail is there buys the two 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.190
 famous weapons the two famous 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.479
 new weapons 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.550
 I made videos to show you 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.590
 a little their power and two pretty 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.760
 age where cheat codes in mode 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.580
 story are always present and 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.590
 luckily we love these famous code on 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.240
 the joystick ps4 so there it concerns 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.680
 only the players ps4 the color 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.539
 changes according to the player on which 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.400
 you are if you have the police or not 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.280
 and you can also change the radio 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.770
 for example where the weapons with the pad at 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.510
 middle one can find dlc vehicles 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.680
 in the street sometimes even customize 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.510
 besides the radio in the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.490
 vehicles exactly indicates the radio 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.620
 on which you are and even the 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.520
 music that you are listening to 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.599
 so in first person if you 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.099
 buy glasses with hues 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.479
 different you will have a vision of the game 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.520
 totally different at the level of 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.289
 colors it also works with the 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.820
 helmets in helicos for example and 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.229
 you can go out and watch them 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.690
 facial expressions of people who have 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.289
 changed with hues totally 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.090
 different 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.469
 we have neon lights but what I have 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.560
 still need to present them 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.720
 see everywhere 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.010
 this game I like the distinguished additions 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.320
 like the murder that must be solved 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.950
 with michael the hen where the penis on the 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.900
 iliad sleeve 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.419
 the 50 pictures of monkeys to take for 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.220
 to have the world who bista etc etc 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.450
 it has not yet finished the game 100% it 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.840
 there are surely other surprises that we 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.730
 wait 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.200
 all that I really like there are some 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.389
 details that I quoted you that remains 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.980
 without explanation whether it's bugs or 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.470
 of the feignise rockstar share 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.270
 whatever happens it does not bother me anymore 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.620
 that I really like I was at 5 and the 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.690
 turn he took on next gen 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.040
 I do not get tired I discover all the 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.260
 new things while waiting for them 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.400
 robberies and future dlc this game for 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.650
 I have a lot of future 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.180
 rockstar hits hard so that's for sure I 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.010
 you have not talked about sessions at 30 and 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.690
 it's because there are still bugs to 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.669
 settle and so we could not enjoy 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.889
 full of all the novelties but 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.360
 all that it will come is not despair that 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.010
 can go that by improving any 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.479
 way now I could talk about it 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.250
 of this game for hours the 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:31.050
 graphics are pretty the details are 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.889
 worked well there are a lot of 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.320
 new sensations 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:36.060
 Anyway, it's really a huge game 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.400
 I can talk about for 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.780
 hours played for hours and I 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.190
 know that I will not tire of it anytime soon 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.510

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.280

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:47.479
