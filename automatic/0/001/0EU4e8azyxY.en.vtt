the legs kind of meat do wings fold
those<00:02:30.019> out<00:02:30.370> flip<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.579> feet<00:02:32.980> hold<00:02:33.980> down<00:02:34.189> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
the wrong way so you rotate them along

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.509 
the wrong way so you rotate them along
with<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.260> whole<00:02:48.379> body<00:02:50.950> actually<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.340> flip

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
with the whole body actually just flip

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
around the whole body but you actually

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.159 
around the whole body but you actually
rotate<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.500> feet<00:02:54.680> under<00:02:55.159> an<00:02:55.220> 80<00:02:55.370> degrees<00:02:59.169> yeah

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
rotate the feet under an 80 degrees yeah

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:07.319 
rotate the feet under an 80 degrees yeah
that's<00:03:00.829> a<00:03:01.629> legs<00:03:03.790> stents<00:03:04.790> moderately<00:03:05.540> well

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
that's a legs stents moderately well

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.159 
that's a legs stents moderately well
after<00:03:08.329> that<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:08.900> can<00:03:09.079> take<00:03:10.090> cockpit<00:03:11.090> flip<00:03:12.019> it

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
after that you can take cockpit flip it

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:16.809 
after that you can take cockpit flip it
up<00:03:12.290> rotate<00:03:13.219> it<00:03:14.680> kind<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.769> sticks<00:03:16.099> out<00:03:16.250> like

doesn't<00:04:56.430> actually<00:04:56.520> have<00:04:56.729> that<00:04:56.880> on<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.120> Tory

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
doesn't actually have that on the Tory

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.790 
doesn't actually have that on the Tory
but<00:04:57.509> I<00:04:57.690> thought<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.020> would<00:04:58.110> be<00:04:58.229> cool<00:04:58.560> little

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
but I thought it would be cool little

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.740 
but I thought it would be cool little
addition<00:04:59.280> because<00:04:59.940> he<00:05:00.210> kind<00:05:00.419> of<00:05:00.479> needs<00:05:00.660> a

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
addition because he kind of needs a

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.120 
addition because he kind of needs a
weapon<00:05:00.870> whole<00:05:01.199> actually<00:05:01.470> not<00:05:01.740> really<00:05:01.770> because

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
weapon whole actually not really because

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.820 
weapon whole actually not really because
he<00:05:02.370> can<00:05:02.520> just<00:05:02.669> like<00:05:03.440> punch<00:05:04.440> people<00:05:04.740> or

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
he can just like punch people or

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.710 
he can just like punch people or
something<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.280> don't<00:05:05.490> really<00:05:05.669> know<00:05:05.789> but<00:05:06.000> I

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
something I don't really know but I

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.839 
something I don't really know but I
thought<00:05:07.289> it'd<00:05:07.410> be<00:05:07.440> cool<00:05:07.590> dad<00:05:08.039> a<00:05:08.070> sword<00:05:08.370> that

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
thought it'd be cool dad a sword that

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.339 
thought it'd be cool dad a sword that
you<00:05:08.970> can't<00:05:09.210> really<00:05:09.360> take<00:05:09.599> out<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.870> sand<00:05:10.139> that

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
you can't really take out of sand that

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.980 
you can't really take out of sand that
easily<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.699> I<00:05:11.910> just<00:05:11.940> killed<00:05:12.300> him<00:05:13.160> um<00:05:14.990> yeah

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
easily and I just killed him um yeah

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.860 
easily and I just killed him um yeah

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
he's very poseable two points of next

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.960 
he's very poseable two points of next
rotate<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.070> all<00:05:20.669> that<00:05:21.240> uh<00:05:22.430> rotate<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.520> arms

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
rotate and all that uh rotate the arms

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.490

go<00:05:24.930> out<00:05:25.139> and<00:05:25.650> elbow<00:05:26.280> rotate<00:05:27.270> 360<00:05:27.960> degrees<00:05:27.990> at

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
go out and elbow rotate 360 degrees at

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.850 
go out and elbow rotate 360 degrees at
the<00:05:28.710> wrist<00:05:29.490> bend<00:05:30.000> at<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.150> wrist<00:05:30.500> so<00:05:31.500> I<00:05:31.560> can<00:05:31.740> go

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
as most bionicle toys are so you can put

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:53.500

making instructions for him because he's

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.810
