the F to E and the M in da and I wanted

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.089 
the F to E and the M in da and I wanted
to<00:00:27.630> put<00:00:27.779> those<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.529> because<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to put those in there just because you

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.260 
to put those in there just because you
know<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:30.920> it<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.340> product<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
know it is it is a product of the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.740 
know it is it is a product of the
Federal<00:00:33.719> Emergency<00:00:34.020> Management<00:00:34.640> Agency<00:00:35.750> you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
Federal Emergency Management Agency you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.270 
Federal Emergency Management Agency you
know<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.230> built<00:00:37.440> directly<00:00:37.710> off<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
know this was built directly off the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.930 
know this was built directly off the
FEMA<00:00:38.520> plans<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.480> thought<00:00:40.260> I'd<00:00:40.410> leave<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
FEMA plans so I thought I'd leave the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.330 
FEMA plans so I thought I'd leave the
periods<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.090> between<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.870> FEMA<00:00:43.710> letters<00:00:44.190> just

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
periods in between the FEMA letters just

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.920 
periods in between the FEMA letters just
because<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:47.930> so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
because you know it is what it is so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.500 
because you know it is what it is so
what<00:00:49.050> I'll<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.320> uh<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.980> kicked<00:00:50.940> off<00:00:51.059> my<00:00:51.270> ball

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
what I'll do is uh I kicked off my ball

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.139 
what I'll do is uh I kicked off my ball
valves<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.110> taped<00:00:53.070> off<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.309> blower<00:00:53.730> motor

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
valves I taped off the blower motor

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
valves I taped off the blower motor
itself<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.020> kicked<00:00:55.980> off<00:00:56.160> some<00:00:56.399> miscellaneous

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
itself I kicked off some miscellaneous

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.819 
itself I kicked off some miscellaneous
nuts<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.480> bolts<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> kind<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.620> give<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
nuts and bolts just to kind of give it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.670 
nuts and bolts just to kind of give it
some<00:00:59.039> contrast<00:01:00.170> something<00:01:01.170> else<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.410> did<00:01:01.590> on

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
some contrast something else I did on

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.929 
some contrast something else I did on
the<00:01:01.770> backside<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:03.559> taped<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.850> my

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the backside here I taped off all of my

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210 
the backside here I taped off all of my
piping<00:01:06.330> system<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> exception<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
piping system with the exception of the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.530 
piping system with the exception of the
short<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.640> pipe<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.119> runs<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
short little pipe that runs from the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
short little pipe that runs from the
gasifier<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> cyclone<00:01:10.830> filter<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
gasifier to the cyclone filter the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.609 
gasifier to the cyclone filter the
reason<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.420> taped<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.080> off<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
reason I taped all of this off is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.190 
reason I taped all of this off is
because<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:16.380> raw<00:01:16.619> steel<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
because it's raw steel and this is a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
because it's raw steel and this is a
piping<00:01:19.619> system<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:20.100> I've<00:01:20.220> talked<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:20.610> my

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
piping system like I've talked about my

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
piping system like I've talked about my
previous<00:01:21.299> videos<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:21.900> all<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> surface

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
previous videos but all of this surface

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
previous videos but all of this surface
area<00:01:24.360> also<00:01:24.780> helps<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> cool<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> gas<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.460> it's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
area also helps to cool the gas so it's

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.760 
area also helps to cool the gas so it's
also<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.150> know

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
also you know

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.340 
also you know
li<00:01:27.920> system<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.700> if<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:29.479> was<00:01:29.840> afraid<00:01:30.020> if<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.259> were

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
li system and if I was afraid if I were

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.880 
li system and if I was afraid if I were
to<00:01:30.439> coat<00:01:30.649> that<00:01:30.679> with<00:01:31.039> paint<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:33.380> would<00:01:33.619> hinder

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
to coat that with paint it would hinder

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.130 
to coat that with paint it would hinder
its<00:01:34.310> ability<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.880> dissipate<00:01:35.450> heat<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:35.990> I

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
its ability to dissipate heat and I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.919 
its ability to dissipate heat and I
didn't<00:01:36.380> want<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.490> again<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:38.240> left<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.689> I

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
didn't want that so again I left it I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.350 
didn't want that so again I left it I
left<00:01:39.469> it<00:01:39.619> raw<00:01:39.799> steel<00:01:40.130> because<00:01:40.579> that<00:01:40.789> helps

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
left it raw steel because that helps

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.270 
left it raw steel because that helps
cool<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.659> gas<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.319> I'm<00:01:42.380> afraid<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.770> any<00:01:42.920> any

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
cool the gas and I'm afraid that any any

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.300 
cool the gas and I'm afraid that any any
kind<00:01:43.909> of<00:01:44.060> covering<00:01:44.479> I<00:01:44.600> put<00:01:44.810> on<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.310> whatsoever

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
kind of covering I put on it whatsoever

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.980 
kind of covering I put on it whatsoever
would<00:01:46.789> hinder<00:01:47.030> its<00:01:47.240> ability<00:01:47.659> again<00:01:47.959> to

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
would hinder its ability again to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.719 
would hinder its ability again to
dissipate<00:01:48.560> heat<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.100> left<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.429> wrong<00:01:49.729> I

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
dissipate heat so I left that wrong I

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.020 
dissipate heat so I left that wrong I
have<00:01:52.729> yet<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:52.909> fire<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:53.509> sent<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.840> paint<00:01:54.110> job<00:01:54.350> I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
have yet to fire it sent the paint job I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.699 
have yet to fire it sent the paint job I
don't<00:01:56.030> believe<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.869> paint<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.350> going<00:01:57.590> to

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
don't believe that the paint is going to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.669 
don't believe that the paint is going to
change<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:59.509> performance<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.200> gas<00:02:00.349> fire

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
change the performance of the gas fire

gasifier I would say is right around
this<00:03:35.800> Ram<00:03:36.160> at<00:03:36.460> about<00:03:37.410> 270<00:03:38.410> degrees<00:03:38.740> so<00:03:39.010> it's

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
this Ram at about 270 degrees so it's

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.540 
this Ram at about 270 degrees so it's

threshold on the paint temperature so

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.350
