00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:08.570
 The video of Seto Koji will turn on now 

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:11.660
 I put it in i 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.830
 8 This clock came out please come out 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.830
 Do not you have to watch set 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:26.910
 I put on this lens right now and tried various test shooting 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.090
 It is very good to say clearly bed 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.780
 I am this gh 3 for the first time 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.739
 Since the Olympus of the lens is also the first time a little can that be compared with others 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:43.199
 That though I do not have my you doing the Toka by Stella 10 d are taking now comparison 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.900
 Although the cad you of the video Toka photograph I made in comparison with it because they see me everyday 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:50.620
 I can use enough micro Four Thirds of Canon 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.520
 For example, it is more than the sensor size of 70 d and this aps c size 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:59.650
 It's small but it's not enough 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:04.330
 Well photo nor I video but I was also taken video does not sound also auto-4 and sound to automatic DeKikuko 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.870
 And that the tooth something where I am to see that not First sound Sample images say really is nice 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.920
 Let's go 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.630
 Well we are now taking it this loses 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 I also read Inter so I have a bad reputation so I have read it 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 It does not looks beautiful laden's not that I do not appear at all 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.140
 I will go 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.300
 Yes cheese 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.930
 This video is a video that has taken a video and a video that has taken a video 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.600
 It is video now It has become 8 video mode 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.860
 This is a video I 'm taking now 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.659
 Well the way pins or the like 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.860
 Please try to focus on the face of Gian 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.870
 Yes 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.710
 Doo Now this voice also of the'll also lens in g 13 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.220
 I can not hear you at all 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.220
 More 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.500
 I will not do anything 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:00.200
 Suddenly I got an allure from the movie but yes 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.040
 Please see Bokeh Mitaka in the back I can see that there is a Canon that I am using now 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.730
 In this 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.510
 And say how far Yareru 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.340
 Here is this Ema Yoon 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.560
 I'm great 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:19.840
 It's amazing, I do n't know why but if I take Shizue this 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.900
 This is the place where Yoreru the best because you're doing with a spear you this up to now manual up to here 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.600
 is 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.500
 To hear 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:31.530
 Such 5th place 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:37.560
 Yes, there is a clearly a great saying great as seen from here I here 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:40.590
 I put the lens of Olympus on gh 3 and I usually take it and the meeting of the side canon 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.370
 How much does not change so much 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.269
 It is perfectly acceptable if it is this 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.709
 Often I Hey complain in unexpectedly 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:56.129
 Video The video camera was expensive so far but it has become a picture of a video camera &amp; video camera 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.030
 But there was a softening complain N Is the I Toka This is beautiful 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.950
 U 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.940
 It's amazing how much I will take myself a little 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.940
 I can get my home 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.530
 Pekkone yes this 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.400
 wonderful 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.530
 I almost think about it as a canon 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.770
 It since has this auto-focus 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:25.820
 You do not have to talk this way to put Toka microphone external to this because I do not become sound 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.910
 This says to Tsu's is convenient did not use catapult to protect up to what now 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.110
 I from the video that does not go by that whether Hiroshi Seto of 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.820
 Had taken example residents now but I have taken is the piece ended after the completion of mp 4 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:41.760
 The bit rate is the lightest class with 20 mbps 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:46.319
 It is already avchd mov mp 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.860
 Spear in about a little difficult to handle in you is but mc treatment is also a personal computer are as in the way 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.970
 No is I'd say even if taken at mov mov is a little bit rate 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.260
 As it becomes at least 50 mbps, as a little bit of me 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.329
 I can not use it because the data is compressed, and compare mov with mp 4 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.750
 As a little do another video 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.760
 Well I just say the conclusion 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.120
 mp 4 in tried to take direct photo at any time there as long as they look at a sufficiently clean youtube 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.780
 Let's go 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.740
 I say or make a mistake Well Ne daddy Migakusumi and I g 1 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.480
 3 pattern of the beginning but I did not know because the manual model this I I'm always also take 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.549
 There are two in the manual 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:25.270
 There is a video ego called creative video mode and a photo mt 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:30.460
 You can not take a picture if you do not do it to m of the person in the picture 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.229
 Just take a video with this ordinary manual ball and the exposure drops a little at the moment of recording 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.289
 Kore videos with Toka or have become dark 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:39.280
 It's not correct, so when shooting videos manually, 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.180
 Then first it is by that Tteyuu we must make Creative Video mode 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.540
 But I know grinded medium 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.820
 Easy to get used to 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.820
 I 'm going to take a picture a little finder 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.490
 Like this 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.350
 I wonder if you would take Asian elephant is an elephant's it sir 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.409
 Quickly's 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.470
 After the restart in the visor Well then 5 I Thats was feather Chan 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.550
 Yes 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:08.230
 But I feel that say do not look at all'm beautiful is not at all 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:11.530
 i Nursery is it is amazing blur is the liner looks like it rough 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.860
 In order to have a little voice and then let me know 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.629
 I'm great 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.629
 The woman like this 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.060
 With this 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.320
 It is not so different 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:30.669
 It's amazing now f 2.8 shutter speed 1/60 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.720
 I'm fixed with iso 200 and I can touch and change the point of control 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.129
 Since it is easy 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.619
 Yeah cedar 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:41.309
 Nice and there you'll I monitor other organic el in a great smooth do this gh 3 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:42.840
 you know 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:46.370
 But it is beautiful 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.370
 I 'll take a little bit too 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:58.740
 This taste like this up retort 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.740
 Totcha also hair it's cool I'm would take about such 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.030
 Such 1 j 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:09.740
 It's ok, it's beautiful 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.690
 It was the first because it was different from the arrangement of the camera up button door of Canon and so on 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.500
 But I will do it for a while 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:19.340
 I can take a beautiful shot I also said this is a macro but I also said macro 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.420
 It is a lens that I can get close to about 0.6 times 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.390
 I would like Iwase to the maximum 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:30.260
 yeah 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:31.880
 Realized is maximum shooting than the fish-eye lens that such a little bitty Sato-chan is using this now 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.490
 Because the magnification is large 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.240
 Guess c production but the 35 mm equivalent of say large 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:44.009
 I'm here 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:51.259
 The last week is so good that the camera lens hood will be in shadow 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:51.259
 The degree at which you can get the most at it is at the time of telephoto . 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:07:00.450
 This is great 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:01.260
 All because to play in this one at the time of introduction of the goods Datte is amazing to than another Kondake 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.100
 I can get it 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:09.930
 This is also bright through f 2.8 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:13.420
 No Kore Sticky but I played the Zees system but at the button school of white balance 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.510
 Because it can be adjusted immediately after the white balance, it also pen year 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:21.160
 Hey 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:21.160
 I think this is wonderful that you Gashakiri-chan went near 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.960
 re
