motorized retractable license plate and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.280 
motorized retractable license plate and
this<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.730> mock-up<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.630> first

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
this is just a mock-up of it and first

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.880 
this is just a mock-up of it and first
test<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.389> really<00:00:15.890> different

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
test this this is just really different

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.320 
test this this is just really different
mock<00:00:17.190> up<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.490> obviously<00:00:17.910> he's<00:00:18.029> not<00:00:18.119> gonna<00:00:18.240> be

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
mock up this obviously he's not gonna be

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.779 
mock up this obviously he's not gonna be
in<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> car<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.500> hinge<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.310> gonna<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.550> bolted

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
in the car this hinge is gonna be bolted

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.490 
in the car this hinge is gonna be bolted
or<00:00:21.000> welded<00:00:21.029> onto<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> bumper<00:00:22.080> or

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
or welded onto like the bumper or

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.859 
or welded onto like the bumper or
I<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> splitter<00:00:24.180> or<00:00:24.480> something<00:00:24.750> like

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
I like the splitter or something like

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.160 
I like the splitter or something like
that<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.310> um<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.429> a

that on it um so I got as I got a

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.389 
that on it um so I got as I got a
quarter<00:00:31.170> inch<00:00:32.030> steel<00:00:33.030> frame<00:00:34.010> I'll<00:00:35.010> weld<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
quarter inch steel frame I'll weld it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.150 
quarter inch steel frame I'll weld it
together<00:00:35.520> weld<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> hinge<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.920> going

together weld it on the hinge and going

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
together weld it on the hinge and going
back<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> metal<00:00:38.910> tube<00:00:41.270> as<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.390> rod<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.899> there

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
back to a metal tube as a rod in there

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
back to a metal tube as a rod in there
and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.190> reddit<00:00:44.520> rod<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and then this is the reddit rod that

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.080 
and then this is the reddit rod that
goes<00:00:45.210> into<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.289> nut<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:47.430> welded<00:00:47.820> onto<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
goes into a nut that's welded onto a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.319 
goes into a nut that's welded onto a
tube<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.890> tube<00:00:50.430> was<00:00:50.670> welded<00:00:51.000> onto<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
tube and then the tube was welded onto a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.340 
tube and then the tube was welded onto a
socket<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.500> had<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.969> crappy<00:00:54.199> socket<00:00:55.199> laying

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
socket I just had a crappy socket laying

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.660 
socket I just had a crappy socket laying
around<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.750> fit<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> exact<00:00:58.289> bore<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:59.399> this

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
around the fit the exact bore of this

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.310 
around the fit the exact bore of this
windshield<00:00:59.940> wiper<00:01:00.210> motor<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.570> had<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.199> drove

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
windshield wiper motor I had so I drove

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200 
windshield wiper motor I had so I drove
the<00:01:01.440> whole<00:01:01.469> two<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> cotter<00:01:02.879> pin<00:01:03.090> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the whole two that put a cotter pin in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.750 
the whole two that put a cotter pin in
it<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.809> pop<00:01:04.229> out<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.640> also

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it so it's not gonna pop out so I also

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.130 
it so it's not gonna pop out so I also
caught<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.479> holding<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.020> it's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
caught up in on that holding on but it's

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
caught up in on that holding on but it's
a<00:01:07.170> little<00:01:07.290> bit<00:01:07.439> sloppy<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.119> kind<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
a little bit sloppy and this is kind of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.630 
a little bit sloppy and this is kind of
getting<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> way<00:01:09.689> right<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.640> having

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
getting in the way right now so having

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.039 
getting in the way right now so having
some<00:01:11.850> problems<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.810> would<00:01:12.930> be

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
some problems with this so this would be

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.399 
some problems with this so this would be
like<00:01:13.200> we're<00:01:13.350> tracking<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.159> way<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
like we're tracking it all the way up I

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
like we're tracking it all the way up I
did<00:01:16.409> another<00:01:16.590> video<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.100> kind<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.670> messed<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
did another video and kind of messed it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.109 
did another video and kind of messed it
up<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.560> down<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> reverse<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
up so and I go down so if you reverse a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
up so and I go down so if you reverse a
flare<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> those<00:01:22.130> motors

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
flare to you on one of those motors

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.670 
flare to you on one of those motors
it'll<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.700> turn<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.600> opposite<00:01:24.900> way<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.110> all

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it'll go up turn the opposite way so all

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560 
it'll go up turn the opposite way so all
I<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I have to do is that but it's kind of a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
I have to do is that but it's kind of a
slow<00:01:27.780> motor<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.470> I'll<00:01:28.560> probably<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:29.009> getting

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
slow motor so I'll probably be getting

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.740 
slow motor so I'll probably be getting
something<00:01:29.369> else

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
something else

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.270 
something else
faster<00:01:30.750> finding<00:01:31.079> something<00:01:31.200> else<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.560> use<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
faster finding something else just use a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.609 
faster finding something else just use a
mess<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.700> garage

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:58.740 

Oh

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:10.469 

so<00:01:59.320> you<00:01:59.440> can<00:01:59.740> really<00:01:59.920> see<00:02:00.190> how<00:02:00.430> slow<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.330> is

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.710 

see<00:02:11.050> thread<00:02:11.500> blood<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.349> there<00:02:14.590> and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
see thread blood going in there and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.479 
see thread blood going in there and
isn't<00:02:16.720> gonna<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.930> shaken<00:02:17.319> apart<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:18.010> on

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
isn't gonna be shaken apart like this on

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.949 
isn't gonna be shaken apart like this on
the<00:02:18.640> car<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.410> perfected<00:02:21.190> better

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
the car you have a perfected better

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.020 
the car you have a perfected better
hopefully<00:02:22.959> steel<00:02:23.470> rods<00:02:23.739> long<00:02:24.010> enough<00:02:24.310> then

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
hopefully steel rods long enough then

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.809 
hopefully steel rods long enough then
you<00:02:25.120> cut<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.450> short<00:02:25.690> but<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.680> then<00:02:26.890> boom<00:02:27.190> we

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
you cut it short but and then boom we

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:28.830 
you cut it short but and then boom we
shut<00:02:28.360> off

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
shut off

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.920 
shut off
did<00:02:29.800> we<00:02:29.950> license<00:02:30.370> plate<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.819> bit<00:02:31.480> farther<00:02:31.780> out

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
did we license plate a bit farther out

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:42.180 
did we license plate a bit farther out
but<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:33.670> like<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.739> I'll<00:02:41.830> weld<00:02:42.040> it

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
but just like that so I'll weld it

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.390 
but just like that so I'll weld it
together<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.110> only<00:02:44.230> thing<00:02:44.470> probably

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
together but the only thing probably

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.070 
together but the only thing probably
need<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.580> do<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> faster<00:02:46.300> motor<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.750> because

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
need to do a faster motor on it because

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.990 
need to do a faster motor on it because
it's<00:02:47.830> taking<00:02:48.190> forever

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
it's taking forever

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.759 
it's taking forever
which<00:02:49.180> means<00:02:49.420> if<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.870> out<00:02:49.959> into<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.290> back<00:02:50.500> real

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
which means if it out into the back real

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.240 
which means if it out into the back real
quick<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:53.489> or<00:02:54.489> maybe<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:54.940> sudden<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.920> need

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
quick and or maybe just sudden just need

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.530 
quick and or maybe just sudden just need
your<00:02:57.370> rod<00:02:57.700> or<00:02:57.940> something<00:03:00.209> anyway<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:01.390> is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
your rod or something anyway this is

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.860 
your rod or something anyway this is
really<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.900> first<00:03:02.080> first<00:03:02.890> test<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.870> nothing

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
really the first first test so nothing

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.150 
really the first first test so nothing
crazy<00:03:04.989> like<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.500> said<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.799> reverse<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
crazy like I said you reverse the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.640
