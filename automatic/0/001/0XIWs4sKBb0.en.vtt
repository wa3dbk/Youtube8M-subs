you'll<00:02:28.150> see<00:02:28.420> here<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.959> did<00:02:29.230> test<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.770> too<00:02:30.270> ok

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
you'll see here I did test that too ok

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
different angles that I chose while

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.979 
different angles that I chose while
covering<00:02:36.099> up<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> target<00:02:36.670> with<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.819> box<00:02:37.090> it's

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
surface in the background that I was

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.130 
surface in the background that I was
using<00:03:08.230> as<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.470> drop<00:03:08.769> so<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:09.580> removed<00:03:09.819> it<00:03:10.030> but<00:03:10.959> then

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
using as a drop so I removed it but then

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.160 
using as a drop so I removed it but then
found<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:11.530> was<00:03:11.650> pretty<00:03:11.950> much<00:03:12.160> just<00:03:13.170> as

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
found it was pretty much just as

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.780 
found it was pretty much just as

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
effective yeah even when I tried to kill

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.449
