00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
going to show you how to make TNT very

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.610 
going to show you how to make TNT very
simple<00:00:07.529> well<00:00:08.370> how<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.639> make<00:00:08.849> TNT<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.630> how<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
simple well how to make TNT and how to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.600 
simple well how to make TNT and how to
set<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.250> off<00:00:11.460> using<00:00:11.730> redstone<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.230> switch

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
set it off using redstone and a switch

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.930 
set it off using redstone and a switch
all<00:00:14.610> very<00:00:15.030> simple<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.780> make<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> TNT<00:00:16.820> make<00:00:17.820> an

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
all very simple to make the TNT make an

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.070 
all very simple to make the TNT make an
X<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:20.150> fill<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> other<00:00:21.480> foreign<00:00:21.900> with

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
X like so fill the other foreign with

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.570 
X like so fill the other foreign with
sand<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.769> bam<00:00:23.220> there<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.580> go

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
sand and bam there you go

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.109 
sand and bam there you go
gunpowder

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
gunpowder

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.849 
gunpowder
I<00:00:27.150> guess<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.720> gunpowder<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.349> that's<00:00:28.619> all

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
I guess it's gunpowder now that's all

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.840 
I guess it's gunpowder now that's all
fair<00:00:29.359> all<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> same<00:00:30.689> whatever<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> an<00:00:32.460> X<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
fair all the same whatever so an X of

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.709 
fair all the same whatever so an X of
gunpowder<00:00:33.500> than<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> others<00:00:34.980> sand<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
gunpowder than the others sand and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.889 
gunpowder than the others sand and
you've<00:00:37.079> made<00:00:37.350> TNT<00:00:38.360> very<00:00:39.360> simple<00:00:39.780> right<00:00:40.790> for

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
you've made TNT very simple right for

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.510 
you've made TNT very simple right for
demonstration<00:00:42.899> purposes<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.309> already

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
demonstration purposes I have already

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.779 
demonstration purposes I have already
laid<00:00:44.820> some<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.710> let's<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.829> set<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.219> off<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
laid some out let's go set it off and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
laid some out let's go set it off and
have<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> big<00:00:48.660> boom<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:51.379> was<00:00:52.379> actually<00:00:52.649> just

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
hour ago I was gonna blow up a 64 stack

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.219 
hour ago I was gonna blow up a 64 stack
of<00:01:01.289> TNT<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.520> video<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.149> while<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> was

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of TNT for this video and while I was

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
of TNT for this video and while I was
laying<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.100> accidentally<00:01:05.790> set<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.270> off

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

I survived but this is the hole it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.810 
I survived but this is the hole it
created<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.340> I'll<00:01:14.580> show<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.030> mega<00:01:15.299> fail

created and I'll show you that mega fail

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.649 
created and I'll show you that mega fail
yeah<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:18.869> soon<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.710> set<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.070> off<00:01:20.659> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
yeah just as soon as we set this off so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.740 
yeah just as soon as we set this off so
this<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.100> 70<00:01:23.100> blocks<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.850> TNT<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.540> set

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
this now is 70 blocks of TNT and to set

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.880 
this now is 70 blocks of TNT and to set
it<00:01:27.840> off<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.680> simple

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
it off is very simple

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.109 
it off is very simple
I've<00:01:31.890> already<00:01:32.159> laid<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:32.460> some<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> my

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I've already laid down some of my

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.130 
I've already laid down some of my
redstone<00:01:34.130> here's<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> switch<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> anyway<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
redstone here's the switch so anyway you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.760 
redstone here's the switch so anyway you
just<00:01:37.229> want<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> run<00:01:37.770> redstone<00:01:39.079> right<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
just want to run redstone right up to a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.100 
just want to run redstone right up to a
block<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.430> TNT<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.960> got

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
block of TNT just like that so we got

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.090 
block of TNT just like that so we got
the<00:01:46.229> redstone<00:01:46.680> coming<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> switch

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the redstone coming up here to a switch

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
the redstone coming up here to a switch
when<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> flip<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> switch<00:01:50.820> I'll<00:01:51.299> bake<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.810> boom

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
when I flip that switch I'll bake a boom

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:05.139 
when I flip that switch I'll bake a boom
so<00:01:52.680> you're<00:01:52.829> ready<00:01:52.979> here<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.399> go
