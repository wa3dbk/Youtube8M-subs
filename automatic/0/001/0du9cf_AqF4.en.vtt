but<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.690> went<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> grocery<00:00:13.200> store<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.950> think

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
but I went to a grocery store I think

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.750 
but I went to a grocery store I think
was<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.120> looks<00:00:15.389> like<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.540> donut<00:00:15.839> shop<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.760> gave

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
was it looks like a donut shop I gave

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.330 
was it looks like a donut shop I gave
the<00:00:18.000> guy<00:00:18.240> about<00:00:19.170> 20<00:00:19.529> bucks<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.990> ain't<00:00:22.140> no

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
the guy about 20 bucks and I ain't no

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.279 
the guy about 20 bucks and I ain't no
scratching<00:00:23.340> some<00:00:23.550> there<00:00:23.869> that<00:00:24.869> were<00:00:25.019> winners

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
scratching some there that were winners

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.200 
scratching some there that were winners
so<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> ended<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.250> getting<00:00:26.400> more<00:00:26.640> scratchers

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so I ended up getting more scratchers

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.180 
so I ended up getting more scratchers
with<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.930> winnings<00:00:28.849> right<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.960> think

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.209 

these<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.460> mostly<00:00:35.760> winners<00:00:36.770> that<00:00:37.770> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
these are mostly winners that I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.670 
these are mostly winners that I
scratched<00:00:39.090> off<00:00:39.420> obviously<00:00:40.050> some<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.230> losers

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
scratched off obviously some are losers

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.959 
scratched off obviously some are losers
so<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.460> came<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.790> money<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.969> scratchers

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
so I came up money on these scratchers

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.920 
so I came up money on these scratchers
