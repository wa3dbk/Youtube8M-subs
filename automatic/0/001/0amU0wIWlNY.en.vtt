the effectiveness of turbo boost feature

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.039 
the effectiveness of turbo boost feature
of<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.009> laptop<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:15.000> reducing<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> GPU

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
of the laptop in reducing the GPU

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.019 
of the laptop in reducing the GPU
temperature<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.949> cost<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.369> hung<00:00:17.730> boys

the first part of the video is without

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.550 
the first part of the video is without
using<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.300> turbo<00:00:21.539> boost<00:00:21.750> feature<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
using a turbo boost feature and the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.740 
using a turbo boost feature and the
temperature<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.189> see<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.640> your<00:00:23.880> top<00:00:24.180> left

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
temperature will see in your top left

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.990 
temperature will see in your top left
corner<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> screen<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.830> after<00:00:26.580> half<00:00:26.849> an

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
corner of the screen is after half an

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
corner of the screen is after half an
hour<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> gameplay<00:00:27.449> during<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.470> half<00:00:28.710> you

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
hour of gameplay during this half you

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.099 
hour of gameplay during this half you
will<00:00:29.130> notice<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.730> fan<00:00:29.939> noise<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.929> no

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
will notice the fan noise is really no

00:00:31.109 --> 00:01:34.649 
will notice the fan noise is really no
so<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.099> watch<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.910> listen

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.960 

now<00:01:35.659> I'm<00:01:36.470> gonna<00:01:36.710> turn<00:01:37.040> off<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.310> turbo<00:01:37.759> boost

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
now I'm gonna turn off the turbo boost

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.550 
now I'm gonna turn off the turbo boost
feature<00:01:40.210> I'm<00:01:41.210> gonna<00:01:41.390> turn<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.049> in<00:01:42.409> that

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
feature I'm gonna turn on and in that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.170 
feature I'm gonna turn on and in that
rest<00:01:42.799> of<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.070> video<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.430> will<00:01:43.670> observe<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
rest of the video you will observe the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.389 
rest of the video you will observe the
temperature<00:01:44.810> GPU<00:01:45.380> temperature<00:01:45.830> decrease<00:01:46.130> in

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
temperature GPU temperature decrease in

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.370 
temperature GPU temperature decrease in
a<00:01:46.610> running<00:01:46.909> jet<00:01:47.149> engine<00:01:47.630> noise<00:01:49.630> but<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:51.020> really

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
a running jet engine noise but it really

00:01:51.380 --> 00:03:00.730 
a running jet engine noise but it really
does<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.860> tricks<00:01:52.190> in<00:01:52.399> reducing<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:53.000> temperature

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.490 

and<00:03:01.400> as<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.360> see<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.750> temperature<00:03:03.350> is

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
and as you can see the temperature is

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.530 
and as you can see the temperature is
really<00:03:03.890> Camuto

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.979 

well<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.349> was<00:03:12.590> reading<00:03:12.980> about<00:03:13.189> the<00:03:14.090> optimal<00:03:14.750> or

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
well I was reading about the optimal or

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.500 
well I was reading about the optimal or
the<00:03:15.379> best<00:03:15.920> temperature<00:03:16.370> for<00:03:16.969> the<00:03:17.000> laptops

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
the best temperature for the laptops

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.000 
the best temperature for the laptops
with<00:03:18.290> extensive<00:03:18.890> with<00:03:19.280> extensive<00:03:20.030> gaming<00:03:20.420> and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
with extensive with extensive gaming and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.300 
with extensive with extensive gaming and
it's<00:03:22.010> about<00:03:22.129> is<00:03:22.549> around<00:03:23.120> seventies<00:03:24.159> so<00:03:25.159> as

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
it's about is around seventies so as

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.729 
it's about is around seventies so as
long<00:03:25.549> as<00:03:25.760> your<00:03:25.939> temperature<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.390> in<00:03:26.659> is<00:03:26.930> in<00:03:26.989> 70s

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
long as your temperature is in is in 70s

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:47.680 
long as your temperature is in is in 70s
70<00:03:28.730> degree<00:03:29.000> Celsius<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:30.799> are<00:03:30.890> okay

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.290 

as<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:49.040> can<00:03:49.130> see<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.520> temperature<00:03:50.030> has

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
as you can see the temperature has

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.540 
as you can see the temperature has
really<00:03:50.540> come<00:03:50.810> down<00:03:51.050> to<00:03:51.320> 68<00:03:51.770> 67<00:03:52.520> 69<00:03:53.210> and<00:03:54.550> on

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
really come down to 68 67 69 and on

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.700 
really come down to 68 67 69 and on

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.590 
average over all in all other games the
temperature<00:03:58.190> stays<00:03:58.520> around<00:03:58.880> 70<00:03:59.570> degrees

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
it stays within few minutes so in the

it stays within few minutes so in the
end<00:04:15.500> for<00:04:15.680> every<00:04:15.950> gamer<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:16.250> would<00:04:16.489> suggest

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
end for every gamer I would suggest

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.210 
end for every gamer I would suggest
buying<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:17.299> decent<00:04:17.720> cooling<00:04:17.989> pad<00:04:18.230> this<00:04:19.040> will

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
buying a decent cooling pad this will

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.590 
buying a decent cooling pad this will
prolong<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.760> duration<00:04:20.239> in<00:04:20.330> which<00:04:20.359> the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
prolong the duration in which the

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.060 
prolong the duration in which the
temperature<00:04:21.049> rises<00:04:21.260> during<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.859> intense

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
temperature rises during the intense

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.160 
temperature rises during the intense
gaming<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.790> when<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.270> see<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.690> temperature

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
gaming and when you see the temperature

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.160 
gaming and when you see the temperature
is<00:04:24.230> high<00:04:24.410> enough<00:04:24.610> turn<00:04:25.610> on<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.940> feature<00:04:26.170> after

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
is high enough turn on the feature after

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.810 
is high enough turn on the feature after
deduction<00:04:28.070> turn<00:04:28.730> of<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.060> future<00:04:29.710> well<00:04:30.820> is

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
deduction turn of the future well is

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.110 
deduction turn of the future well is
simple<00:04:32.330> so<00:04:32.540> thanks<00:04:33.080> for<00:04:33.170> watching<00:04:33.470> this<00:04:33.560> video

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
simple so thanks for watching this video

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.780 
simple so thanks for watching this video
