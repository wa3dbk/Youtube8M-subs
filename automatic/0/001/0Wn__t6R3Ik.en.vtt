Stanford<00:00:05.430> University

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.539 

probably<00:00:12.320> many<00:00:12.500> of<00:00:12.650> you<00:00:12.769> think<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.160> Stanford

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
probably many of you think the Stanford

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.810 
probably many of you think the Stanford
challenge<00:00:13.910> began<00:00:14.330> in<00:00:15.129> 2006<00:00:16.129> but<00:00:16.490> it<00:00:16.610> actually

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
challenge began in 2006 but it actually

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.900 
challenge began in 2006 but it actually
began<00:00:17.449> just<00:00:18.170> about<00:00:18.470> 10<00:00:18.890> years<00:00:19.130> ago<00:00:19.279> we

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
began just about 10 years ago we

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.690 
began just about 10 years ago we
realized<00:00:20.450> that<00:00:20.840> we<00:00:20.990> could<00:00:21.470> build<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:22.070> set<00:00:22.520> of

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
realized that we could build a set of

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.790 
realized that we could build a set of
initiatives<00:00:23.119> that<00:00:23.930> would<00:00:24.169> enable<00:00:24.439> this

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
initiatives that would enable this

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.490 
initiatives that would enable this
university<00:00:25.579> to<00:00:26.270> go<00:00:26.450> into<00:00:26.660> territory<00:00:27.230> that<00:00:27.289> it

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
university to go into territory that it

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.320 
university to go into territory that it
hadn't<00:00:27.800> been<00:00:27.830> before<00:00:28.099> to<00:00:28.310> really<00:00:28.699> focus<00:00:28.910> its

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
hadn't been before to really focus its

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.229 
hadn't been before to really focus its
attention<00:00:29.420> on<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:31.099> big<00:00:31.310> problems<00:00:31.759> around<00:00:32.059> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
attention on the big problems around the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.750 
attention on the big problems around the
world<00:00:32.449> and<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.199> bring<00:00:33.379> our<00:00:33.530> faculty<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.430> their

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
world and to bring our faculty and their

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.060 
world and to bring our faculty and their
capability<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:36.080> incredible<00:00:36.470> students

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
capability and the incredible students

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.850 
capability and the incredible students
we<00:00:37.220> have<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:38.030> focus<00:00:38.210> on<00:00:38.510> those<00:00:38.660> problems<00:00:39.140> so

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
we have to focus on those problems so

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.130 
we have to focus on those problems so
how<00:00:40.100> are<00:00:40.250> we<00:00:40.370> doing<00:00:40.670> well<00:00:41.449> I<00:00:41.480> think<00:00:41.629> we<00:00:41.960> have

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
how are we doing well I think we have

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.619 
how are we doing well I think we have
some<00:00:42.320> wonderful<00:00:42.620> stories<00:00:42.949> to<00:00:43.610> tell<00:00:43.850> about<00:00:44.149> the

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
some wonderful stories to tell about the

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.590 
some wonderful stories to tell about the
advances<00:00:45.200> we've<00:00:46.100> made<00:00:46.239> one<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.390> most

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
advances we've made one of the most

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.260 
advances we've made one of the most
exciting<00:00:47.960> I<00:00:48.500> think<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:49.550> whole<00:00:49.820> new<00:00:50.030> area

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
exciting I think is this whole new area

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.689 
exciting I think is this whole new area

the<00:01:07.729> bio<00:01:07.880> engineering<00:01:08.119> department<00:01:08.780> was<00:01:08.869> just

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
the bio engineering department was just

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.020 
the bio engineering department was just
started<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:09.890> new<00:01:10.100> department<00:01:10.670> is

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
started so this new department is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.100 
started so this new department is
already<00:01:11.390> making<00:01:11.539> the<00:01:11.780> kinds<00:01:12.050> of

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
already making the kinds of

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.200 
already making the kinds of
groundbreaking<00:01:12.649> appointments<00:01:13.520> that<00:01:14.000> we

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
groundbreaking appointments that we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.840 
groundbreaking appointments that we
really<00:01:14.509> hoped<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.929> would<00:01:15.310> Karl's<00:01:16.310> working<00:01:16.700> on

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
really hoped it would Karl's working on

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.719 
really hoped it would Karl's working on
a<00:01:16.880> whole<00:01:17.240> new<00:01:17.479> area<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.890> one<00:01:19.189> of<00:01:19.340> our<00:01:19.460> highest

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
a whole new area and one of our highest

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.120 
a whole new area and one of our highest
priorities<00:01:20.570> which<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.080> understand<00:01:21.770> how

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
priorities which is to understand how

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.060 
priorities which is to understand how
the<00:01:22.700> human<00:01:23.180> brain<00:01:23.299> really<00:01:23.420> functions<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.040> that

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
the human brain really functions so that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.460 
the human brain really functions so that
we<00:01:25.340> can<00:01:25.520> design<00:01:25.670> therapies<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.840> people<00:01:27.320> who

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
we can design therapies for people who

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.469 
we can design therapies for people who
are<00:01:27.560> victims<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.040> injury<00:01:28.579> or<00:01:28.729> brain<00:01:29.090> disease

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
are victims of injury or brain disease

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.090 
are victims of injury or brain disease
that<00:01:29.990> are<00:01:30.200> based<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> fundamental

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
that are based on a fundamental

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.130 
that are based on a fundamental
understanding<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.119> brain<00:01:32.240> it's<00:01:33.020> a

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
understanding of the brain it's a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.410 
understanding of the brain it's a
completely<00:01:33.530> open<00:01:33.680> territory<00:01:34.250> one<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.299> the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
completely open territory one of the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.210 
completely open territory one of the
projects<00:01:36.049> I'm<00:01:36.200> really<00:01:36.470> excited<00:01:36.740> about<00:01:36.950> is

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
projects I'm really excited about is

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.100 
projects I'm really excited about is
some<00:01:37.430> work<00:01:37.579> that<00:01:37.640> Sarah<00:01:38.210> Billington's<00:01:38.750> doing

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
some work that Sarah Billington's doing

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.399 
some work that Sarah Billington's doing
on<00:01:39.290> creating<00:01:40.220> faux<00:01:40.729> wood<00:01:41.030> that's<00:01:41.659> right<00:01:41.990> faux

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
on creating faux wood that's right faux

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.639 
on creating faux wood that's right faux
wood<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.860> ultimate<00:01:43.369> renewable<00:01:44.000> would<00:01:44.210> source

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.280 
wood the ultimate renewable would source
would<00:01:45.649> made<00:01:46.399> from<00:01:46.729> low-cost<00:01:47.290> bioplastics

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
would made from low-cost bioplastics

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.260 
would made from low-cost bioplastics
things<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.829> we<00:01:48.920> would<00:01:49.070> otherwise<00:01:49.399> throw

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
things that we would otherwise throw

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.780 
things that we would otherwise throw
into<00:01:50.990> trash<00:01:51.470> shapes<00:01:51.740> hemp<00:01:52.100> fibers<00:01:52.579> are

into trash shapes hemp fibers are

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.510 
into trash shapes hemp fibers are
actually<00:01:52.820> fused<00:01:53.540> with<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.810> biodegradable

plastic<00:01:55.520> resin<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.420> make<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.079> it's

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
plastic resin to make this and it's

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.280 
plastic resin to make this and it's
incredible<00:01:58.130> stuff<00:01:58.570> once<00:01:59.570> it's<00:01:59.750> exposed<00:01:59.990> to

incredible stuff once it's exposed to
air<00:02:00.380> it's<00:02:01.189> actually<00:02:01.430> stable<00:02:02.180> but<00:02:02.780> in<00:02:02.990> an

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
actually does read the case

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.790 
actually does read the case
you<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.520> bury<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.060> underground<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.990> actually

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
you can bury it underground and actually
