 I have other movies but they 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.360
 They speak English because it was my uncle who 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.360
 brought from the United States and this is mine. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.310
 It was good that you speak Portuguese and I'm 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.650
 very happy and now I'm going to take it out of 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.540

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.819
 it has a super beautiful color and 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.610

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:43.330
 out of the box and put the batteries not 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.330

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.100

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.350
 which is that key that looks like a 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.580
 little cross points to get you 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.580
 take it out of the box 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.100
 if you have a little difficulty 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.400
 ask your father or mother for help or who 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:15.799

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:19.670
 this lid gives off cardboard and furb 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:23.030
 works with four batteries of type a 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.170
 the type of it in reference to the size 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:31.220
 is larger than the 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.989
 stick is aaa this is stack 2 to 1 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.799

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.799
 in this size 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.049
 Now I'll put the batteries in my pocket. 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.459
 tablet that will show you some of the 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.560
 what you can do with the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.320

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.299

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.760
 joking will start the first time 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.810
 what do you do 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.630
 is the first time you scan your 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.910
 it was good by the application he will ask 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.280
 for you to choose a name in the 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.440
 application and that name was good 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.140
 really learned and always when he 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.930
 to refer to himself he will say 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.770
 will repeat the name and will say what he 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.990
 would you like 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:32.490

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:35.100

 cool and with the application the joke 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.930

 You can feed him he can bathe. 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.880
