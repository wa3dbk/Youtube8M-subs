little flap of the microfiber so that

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.870 
little flap of the microfiber so that

before most of the hardware has the LV
logos<00:04:23.820> on<00:04:24.060> too<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:24.960> that's<00:04:25.139> really<00:04:25.380> nice<00:04:25.590> and

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
really good size so it's about that

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.589
