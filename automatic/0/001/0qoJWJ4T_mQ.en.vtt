that we wanted to make this video

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.740 
that we wanted to make this video
together<00:03:16.260> because<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.310> thought<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:18.420> might<00:03:18.630> be

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
together because we thought it might be

useful to other moms and dads who are

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.960 
useful to other moms and dads who are
considering<00:03:22.260> trying<00:03:22.890> this<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.400> their<00:03:23.489> family
