with<00:00:58.530> splinters<00:00:59.100> rune<00:00:59.460> which<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> actually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
with splinters rune which is actually

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.970 
with splinters rune which is actually
probably<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> highest<00:01:00.960> DPS<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.800> can

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
probably the highest DPS thing you can

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.529 
probably the highest DPS thing you can
use<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.910> funny<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
use and it's funny because it's the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.939 
use and it's funny because it's the
first<00:01:03.660> skills<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> game<00:01:04.650> but

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
first skills you get in the game but

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.740 
first skills you get in the game but
it's<00:01:05.159> very<00:01:05.400> very<00:01:05.610> useful<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> have

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it's very very useful and then I have

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.380 
it's very very useful and then I have
the<00:01:06.990> fire<00:01:07.560> bats<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.729> set<00:01:09.360> as

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the fire bats which I have as set as

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.179 
the fire bats which I have as set as
dire<00:01:09.840> bats<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.409> rune<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.040> see<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
dire bats on the rune so you can see I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.679 
dire bats on the rune so you can see I
got<00:01:11.340> my<00:01:11.430> zombie<00:01:11.760> dogs<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.270> fighting<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
first iteration of Belial which is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
first iteration of Belial which is
actually<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> easy<00:01:14.760> part<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.780> waste<00:01:16.020> your

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
because you can easily get through this

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.219 
because you can easily get through this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
found in this fight I don't thought to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.149 
found in this fight I don't thought to
go<00:01:30.900> into<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> actual<00:01:31.500> real<00:01:31.740> fight<00:01:31.979> but

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
go into the actual real fight but

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
go into the actual real fight but
quickly<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.450> about<00:01:33.689> gear<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> went

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
quickly just it's all about gear I went

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
quickly just it's all about gear I went
and<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> casual<00:01:35.670> gamer<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> fan

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and as a casual gamer I'm not a fan

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.030 
and as a casual gamer I'm not a fan
really<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.020> using<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.320> auction<00:01:37.590> house<00:01:37.710> nor<00:01:37.950> do

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
really of using the auction house nor do

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
really of using the auction house nor do
I<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> lot<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.060> research<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> but

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I really do a lot of research on it but

two stats and I found them very very
cheaply<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.030> think<00:05:11.270> under<00:05:11.450> 5k<00:05:11.960> for<00:05:12.020> each<00:05:12.380> weapon

which<00:05:12.980> is<00:05:13.810> ridiculously<00:05:14.810> cheap<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.860> can<00:05:16.010> see

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160
