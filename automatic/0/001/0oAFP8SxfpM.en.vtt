timeout
I<00:00:41.160> was<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.329> about<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> tell<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.500> six

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
I was just about to tell you the six

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
I was just about to tell you the six
mics<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.190> we're<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> compare<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.570> I
