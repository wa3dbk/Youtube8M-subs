00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
for running basically any application

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.890 
for running basically any application
which<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.350> would<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> normal<00:01:38.310> course<00:01:38.549> of

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
which you would in the normal course of

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.260 
which you would in the normal course of
an<00:01:39.900> average<00:01:40.290> day<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:41.430> any<00:01:41.549> computer<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
an average day with any computer the the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.569 
an average day with any computer the the
MacBook<00:01:45.270> Air<00:01:45.420> handles<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.049> quite<00:01:46.530> quite<00:01:47.340> well

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
MacBook Air handles it quite quite well

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.710 
MacBook Air handles it quite quite well
and<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.689> say<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:51.119> given<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> fact

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and I say this you know given the fact

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
and I say this you know given the fact
that<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> only<00:01:52.020> got<00:01:52.229> 2<00:01:52.409> GB<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.799> RAM<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that it's only got 2 GB of RAM you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
that it's only got 2 GB of RAM you
really<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:54.960> feel<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> sluggishness<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
really don't feel the sluggishness and I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.639 
really don't feel the sluggishness and I
guess<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> solid-state<00:01:56.729> drive<00:01:57.119> makes<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
guess the solid-state drive makes up a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.200 
guess the solid-state drive makes up a
lot<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:01.590> any<00:02:02.070> slackness<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.060> would

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
lot for any slackness which there would

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.039 
lot for any slackness which there would
have<00:02:03.329> been<00:02:03.680> but<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:05.329> I've<00:02:06.329> had<00:02:06.630> SSD

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
have been but you know I've had SSD

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.469 
have been but you know I've had SSD
drives<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.500> my<00:02:07.619> other<00:02:07.680> machines<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.250> well

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
drives on my other machines as well

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.550 
drives on my other machines as well
they've<00:02:09.479> done<00:02:09.690> something<00:02:10.050> over<00:02:10.289> here<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
they've done something over here and I

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.869 
they've done something over here and I
don't<00:02:10.770> know<00:02:10.830> what<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.370> not<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
don't know what it is it's not just the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.850 
don't know what it is it's not just the
fact<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> governess's<00:02:12.690> T<00:02:12.930> Drive

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
fact that the governess's T Drive

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.360 
fact that the governess's T Drive
they<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.760> engineered<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.390> bit<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.860> magic<00:02:16.860> into

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
they have engineered a bit of magic into

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.690 
they have engineered a bit of magic into
the<00:02:17.610> way<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> drive<00:02:19.190> probably<00:02:20.190> interfaces

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the way the drive probably interfaces

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.420 
the way the drive probably interfaces
with<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.940> motherboard<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:23.220> know<00:02:23.340> it's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
with the motherboard so you know it's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.980 
with the motherboard so you know it's
fractionally<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> bit<00:02:24.210> more<00:02:24.390> zippier<00:02:24.750> then

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
fractionally a bit more zippier then

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.460 
fractionally a bit more zippier then
then<00:02:25.710> what<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.010> would<00:02:26.130> normally<00:02:26.280> get

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
then what you would normally get

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.330 
then what you would normally get
so<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:30.120> 2gb<00:02:30.540> enough<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.200> think<00:02:32.010> so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
so it's 2gb enough I think so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.400 
so it's 2gb enough I think so
I<00:02:32.370> think<00:02:32.850> there's<00:02:33.540> no<00:02:33.660> point<00:02:33.840> spending<00:02:34.230> money

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
I think there's no point spending money

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.670 
I think there's no point spending money
on<00:02:34.620> 11<00:02:35.430> inch<00:02:35.550> model<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.630> upgrade<00:02:37.050> your<00:02:37.230> CP<00:02:37.590> to

on 11 inch model to upgrade your CP to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.449 
on 11 inch model to upgrade your CP to
1.6<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.870> at<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.930> same<00:02:40.110> time<00:02:40.320> upgrading<00:02:41.010> your

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
1.6 and at the same time upgrading your

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.470 
1.6 and at the same time upgrading your
RAM<00:02:41.670> 4gb<00:02:42.650> for<00:02:43.650> what<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.090> gonna<00:02:45.090> use<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
RAM 4gb for what you gonna use the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.480 
RAM 4gb for what you gonna use the
MacBook<00:02:45.870> for<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> 2<00:02:46.800> GB<00:02:46.950> model<00:02:47.370> is

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
MacBook for I think the 2 GB model is

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.050 
MacBook for I think the 2 GB model is
fine<00:02:47.840> all<00:02:48.840> you're<00:02:49.080> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.320> do<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:50.730> possibly

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
fine all you're going to do is possibly

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.030 
fine all you're going to do is possibly
for<00:02:51.450> one<00:02:51.570> more<00:02:51.780> space<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.830> bump

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
for one more space you know you can bump

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.960 
for one more space you know you can bump
it<00:02:53.160> up<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.400> 128<00:02:53.970> gigs<00:02:54.270> that's<00:02:54.540> what<00:02:54.690> I've<00:02:54.810> done

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
it up to 128 gigs that's what I've done

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.920 
it up to 128 gigs that's what I've done
but<00:02:56.970> really<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.420> don't<00:02:57.450> if<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.900> don't

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.280 
but really if you don't if you don't
need<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.290> space<00:02:58.500> 64<00:02:59.220> GB<00:02:59.580> this<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.690> fine<00:03:00.959> hey

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
need the space 64 GB this is fine hey

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.690 
need the space 64 GB this is fine hey
look<00:03:01.440> you've<00:03:01.620> got<00:03:01.770> two<00:03:01.890> USB<00:03:02.100> drives<00:03:02.489> over

quite true I've seen a massive drop in

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
battery consumption I don't think I felt

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.479 
battery consumption I don't think I felt
the<00:03:48.480> same<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.959> was<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.110> Vimeo<00:03:49.470> comm<00:03:50.190> know<00:03:50.459> I

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
the same but I was a Vimeo comm know I

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.080 
the same but I was a Vimeo comm know I
don't<00:03:51.000> know<00:03:51.090> maybe<00:03:51.209> z'n<00:03:51.570> because<00:03:53.000> videos<00:03:54.000> in

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
don't know maybe z'n because videos in

html5<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.860> look<00:03:55.860> i<00:03:56.040> inner<00:03:56.370> beats<00:03:56.610> me<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:56.850> anyway

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
html5 I look i inner beats me but anyway

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.100 
html5 I look i inner beats me but anyway
streaming<00:03:58.110> from<00:03:58.230> Vimeo<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.860> obviously<00:03:59.370> a<00:04:00.110> lot

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
streaming from Vimeo is obviously a lot

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.140 
streaming from Vimeo is obviously a lot
smoother<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:02.250> obviously<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.850> much<00:04:03.000> higher

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
smoother and obviously a much higher

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150 
smoother and obviously a much higher
quality<00:04:03.330> well<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.230> guess<00:04:04.739> depends<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.100> the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
quality well I guess depends on the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.370 
quality well I guess depends on the
source<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.549> video<00:04:05.700> but<00:04:06.030> anyway<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.989> think

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
source of the video but anyway I think

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.900 
source of the video but anyway I think
you<00:04:07.530> get<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.650> picture<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:08.209> think<00:04:09.209> about<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.600> if

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
you get the picture so think about it if

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.520 
you get the picture so think about it if
you<00:04:11.910> got<00:04:12.030> money<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.360> burn<00:04:12.390> macbook<00:04:13.350> air

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
you got money to burn macbook air

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.060 
you got money to burn macbook air
no-brainer

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
no-brainer

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.319 
no-brainer
it's<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.160> cautious<00:04:17.579> about<00:04:18.570> spinning<00:04:20.120> your<00:04:21.120> -

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329
