00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.790
 He arrives at his house and Dona Florinda appears 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.610

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.610

 the next day kiko goes to school 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.960
 with a knife that he grabbed from the kitchen 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.110
 When it's time for recess, it says 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.470

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.250

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.790
 he survives then kiko comes to his senses and 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.129
 he realizes his mistake then grabbed 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.250
 a rope and it hangs on the tree more 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.680

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.909
 funeral song that with that we pissed 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.489

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.280
 he said go to the page and then 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.200
