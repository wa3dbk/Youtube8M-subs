00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
say that this one is an exception

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.080

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
phone somewhat this is a great option

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.160 
phone somewhat this is a great option
because<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.590> cheap<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:39.060> works<00:02:39.390> good<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.990> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
because it's cheap it works good and it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.870 
because it's cheap it works good and it
looks<00:02:40.290> good

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
looks good

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.390 
looks good
this<00:02:41.880> one<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.720> actually<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.650> scratch

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
this one it actually is scratch

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.190 
this one it actually is scratch
resistant<00:02:44.970> on<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.090> back<00:02:45.330> because<00:02:45.510> plenty<00:02:46.050> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
resistant on the back because plenty of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.970 
resistant on the back because plenty of
cases<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.930> manufacturers<00:02:48.930> say<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.410> all<00:02:49.620> our

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
cases and manufacturers say that all our

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.980 
cases and manufacturers say that all our
cases<00:02:50.400> scratch<00:02:51.180> proof<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.720> scratched

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
cases scratch proof it scratched

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.280 
cases scratch proof it scratched
resistant<00:02:52.880> but<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.030> really<00:02:54.150> not<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:55.050> one

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
resistant but it's really not this one

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.730 
resistant but it's really not this one
it<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.830> actually<00:02:56.160> because<00:02:57.030> I've<00:02:57.360> had<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:58.710> a

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
it is actually because I've had it for a

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.580 
it is actually because I've had it for a
few<00:02:58.830> weeks<00:02:59.190> now<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.870> like<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.080> because<00:03:01.260> it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
few weeks now I like it because it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.800 
few weeks now I like it because it
hasn't<00:03:01.710> really<00:03:01.920> scratched<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.570> think

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
hasn't really scratched up and I think

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.650 
hasn't really scratched up and I think
part<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.800> because<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:06.150> has<00:03:06.480> these

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
part of that is because it has these

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.390 
part of that is because it has these
raised<00:03:06.960> up<00:03:07.170> edges<00:03:07.410> on<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.800> sides<00:03:08.040> right<00:03:08.190> here

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
raised up edges on the sides right here

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.740 
raised up edges on the sides right here
on<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.760> back<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.090> me<00:03:09.260> on<00:03:10.260> each<00:03:10.710> edge<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.280> so

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
on the back of me on each edge of it so

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.450 
on the back of me on each edge of it so
that<00:03:12.750> when<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:12.930> lay<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.290> down<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.070> flat

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
that when you lay it down on a flat

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.390 
that when you lay it down on a flat
surface<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:16.560> not<00:03:16.830> going<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.040> be<00:03:17.160> touching

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
surface it's not going to be touching

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.780 
surface it's not going to be touching
the<00:03:17.790> actual<00:03:17.970> surface<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.140> case<00:03:19.790> because

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
the actual surface of the case because

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.820 
the actual surface of the case because
it<00:03:20.940> won't<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.180> scratching<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:22.320> raised<00:03:22.620> up

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
it won't be scratching it it's raised up

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.980 
it won't be scratching it it's raised up
above<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:24.030> flat<00:03:24.270> surface<00:03:24.660> they're<00:03:24.810> going

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
above the the flat surface they're going

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.240 
above the the flat surface they're going
to<00:03:25.050> put<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.400> really<00:03:26.550> nice<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:29.070> yeah
