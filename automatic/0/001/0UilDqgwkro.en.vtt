this has been a huge commitment for the
hairy<00:00:25.700> force<00:00:26.000> but<00:00:26.330> we<00:00:26.750> came<00:00:26.930> in<00:00:27.050> Pakistan<00:00:28.010> last

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.340 
hairy force but we came in Pakistan last
summer<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.660> now<00:00:29.810> we've<00:00:29.900> got<00:00:30.020> a<00:00:30.050> bit<00:00:30.200> more

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
summer so now we've got a bit more

we're here this year we've got about ten
shows<00:00:34.580> ten<00:00:35.540> meetings<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:37.010> it's<00:00:37.220> great<00:00:37.430> just

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580

great<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:37.910> be<00:00:37.970> back<00:00:38.090> in<00:00:38.150> front<00:00:38.450> of<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:38.600> public

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
great to be back in front of the public

great to be back in front of the public
with<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:39.140> issues

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.450 

the<00:00:56.600> reason<00:00:56.840> we're<00:00:56.930> doing<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:57.199> royal<00:00:58.129> demo<00:00:58.340> this

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
the reason we're doing a royal demo this

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.790 
the reason we're doing a royal demo this
year<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:58.789> because<00:00:59.539> we<00:00:59.690> were<00:01:00.289> only<00:01:00.440> just<00:01:00.589> back

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
year it's because we were only just back

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.310 
year it's because we were only just back
from<00:01:00.890> Afghanistan<00:01:01.269> we<00:01:02.269> need<00:01:02.449> we're<00:01:03.170> spending

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
from Afghanistan we need we're spending

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.049 
from Afghanistan we need we're spending
a<00:01:03.440> lot<00:01:03.469> of<00:01:03.559> time<00:01:03.699> recovering<00:01:04.699> some<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:05.000> the

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
a lot of time recovering some of the

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.609 
a lot of time recovering some of the
skills<00:01:05.330> that<00:01:05.420> we<00:01:05.570> lost<00:01:05.810> because<00:01:06.110> we<00:01:06.259> spent<00:01:06.530> all

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
skills that we lost because we spent all

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.889 
skills that we lost because we spent all
that<00:01:06.650> time<00:01:06.799> in<00:01:07.040> Afghanistan<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.880> doing<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:08.720> full

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
that time in Afghanistan so doing a full

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.030 
that time in Afghanistan so doing a full
display<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.259> a<00:01:09.320> big<00:01:09.500> commitment<00:01:09.860> for<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
display is a big commitment for the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.249 
display is a big commitment for the
squadron<00:01:10.250> geraldo<00:01:11.119> know<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> bit<00:01:11.659> less<00:01:12.049> of<00:01:12.080> a

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
squadron geraldo know is a bit less of a

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.800 
squadron geraldo know is a bit less of a
commitment<00:01:12.880> it's<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:14.030> non<00:01:14.210> aerobatic<00:01:14.720> display

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
commitment it's a non aerobatic display

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.399 
commitment it's a non aerobatic display
really<00:01:15.289> so<00:01:15.770> it's<00:01:15.920> less<00:01:16.240> currency

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
really so it's less currency

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.320 
really so it's less currency
requirements<00:01:18.409> lexical<00:01:18.950> worker<00:01:19.130> for<00:01:19.729> me<00:01:19.909> as

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
requirements lexical worker for me as

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.730 
requirements lexical worker for me as
the<00:01:20.479> pilot<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.049> it's<00:01:21.320> less<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.710> burden

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
the pilot so it's less of a burden

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.940 
the pilot so it's less of a burden
overall<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.490> squadron

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:44.800 

I<00:01:42.280> hope<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.429> whole<00:01:43.520> visto<00:01:43.909> side<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.569> the<00:01:44.630> show

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
I hope the whole visto side of the show

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.660 
I hope the whole visto side of the show
is<00:01:44.929> quite<00:01:45.140> challenging<00:01:45.319> the<00:01:45.740> wind<00:01:45.920> on<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.520> day

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
is quite challenging the wind on the day

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.950 
is quite challenging the wind on the day
makes<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:47.030> massive<00:01:47.179> difference<00:01:47.329> no<00:01:47.899> two

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
makes a massive difference no two

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.450 
makes a massive difference no two
displays<00:01:48.530> are<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.740> same<00:01:48.950> because<00:01:49.069> the<00:01:49.280> wind

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
displays are the same because the wind

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.899 
displays are the same because the wind
is<00:01:49.579> is<00:01:50.090> different<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.689> unlike<00:01:51.789> when<00:01:52.789> you're

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
is is different and unlike when you're

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.700 
is is different and unlike when you're
flying<00:01:53.090> at<00:01:53.299> 300<00:01:53.630> knots<00:01:53.659> or<00:01:53.899> 400<00:01:54.289> knots<00:01:54.409> and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
flying at 300 knots or 400 knots and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.870 
flying at 300 knots or 400 knots and
you've<00:01:54.829> got<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.009> tend<00:01:55.189> not<00:01:55.219> wind<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.610> doesn't

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
you've got to tend not wind that doesn't

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.949 
you've got to tend not wind that doesn't
make<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:56.000> great<00:01:56.149> deal<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.390> difference<00:01:56.600> when

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
make a great deal of difference when

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.770 
make a great deal of difference when
you're<00:01:57.020> hovering<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:58.390> 0:10<00:01:59.390> lots<00:01:59.569> of<00:01:59.630> wind

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
you're hovering it 0:10 lots of wind

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.419 
you're hovering it 0:10 lots of wind
makes<00:01:59.929> quite<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.170> big<00:02:00.470> difference<00:02:00.649> in<00:02:01.069> the

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
makes quite a big difference in the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.029 
makes quite a big difference in the
direction<00:02:01.880> changes<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.599> lot<00:02:02.840> as<00:02:02.990> well<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.439> it's

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
direction changes a lot as well so it's

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.160 
direction changes a lot as well so it's
a<00:02:04.099> very<00:02:04.280> challenging<00:02:04.450> thing<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.479> fly<00:02:05.840> I

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
a very challenging thing to fly I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.199 
a very challenging thing to fly I
particularly<00:02:07.159> enjoy<00:02:07.429> doing<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.759> bow<00:02:07.939> because

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
particularly enjoy doing the bow because

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.080 
particularly enjoy doing the bow because
that's<00:02:08.539> what<00:02:08.750> everyone<00:02:09.200> likes<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.940> whole

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
that's what everyone likes but the whole

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.970 
that's what everyone likes but the whole
v/stol<00:02:11.450> side<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.750> things<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.079> it's<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.590> it's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
v/stol side of things is it's just it's

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.530 
v/stol side of things is it's just it's
hard<00:02:13.190> work<00:02:13.400> but<00:02:13.549> it's<00:02:13.700> good<00:02:13.849> fun<00:02:13.970> too

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
hard work but it's good fun too

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:26.380 
hard work but it's good fun too
it's<00:02:15.110> great<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.470> gravity

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.940 

it's<00:02:27.390> great<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:27.989> bring<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.349> team<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.560> six<00:02:28.830> or

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
it's great that I bring a team of six or

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.369 
it's great that I bring a team of six or
seven<00:02:29.190> engineers<00:02:29.519> away<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:29.879> me<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.290> a

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.020 
seven engineers away with me it's it's a
very<00:02:31.590> much<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.739> team<00:02:31.980> effort<00:02:32.129> they<00:02:32.400> they're

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
very much a team effort they they're

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.400 
very much a team effort they they're
part<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.450> team<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:33.900> also<00:02:34.080> have<00:02:34.319> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
part of the team they also have the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.790 
part of the team they also have the
black<00:02:34.560> suits<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:36.599> look<00:02:37.170> relying<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.590> them

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
black suits and I look relying on them

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.460 
black suits and I look relying on them
as<00:02:37.920> well<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.280> great<00:02:38.459> for<00:02:38.670> me<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.470> fly

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
as well it's great for me that I can fly

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.050 
as well it's great for me that I can fly
the<00:02:40.530> airplane<00:02:40.890> what<00:02:41.220> students<00:02:41.459> are<00:02:41.489> landed<00:02:41.879> I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the airplane what students are landed I

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.150 
the airplane what students are landed I
can<00:02:42.299> then<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:42.810> before<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.319> flying<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.920> can

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
can then or before going flying I can

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
can then or before going flying I can
just<00:02:44.340> worry<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.000> don't<00:02:45.299> have<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.540> worry

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
just worry that I don't have to worry

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
just worry that I don't have to worry
that<00:02:45.780> someone<00:02:46.049> else<00:02:46.730> because<00:02:47.730> someone<00:02:47.940> else

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that someone else because someone else

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.160 
that someone else because someone else
is<00:02:48.150> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.540> actually<00:02:48.780> servicing

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
is going to be actually servicing

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.630 
is going to be actually servicing
airplane<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.680> me<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:50.160> not<00:02:50.340> my

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
airplane for me it's not my

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.270 
airplane for me it's not my
responsibility<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.599> whereas<00:02:52.410> other<00:02:52.980> teams

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
responsibility and whereas other teams

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.430 
responsibility and whereas other teams
not<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.180> fortunate<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.780> engineers<00:02:55.290> with

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
not so fortunate to have engineers with

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.350 
not so fortunate to have engineers with
them<00:02:55.620> after<00:02:56.220> service<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> jet<00:02:56.880> themselves

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
them after service the jet themselves

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.910 
them after service the jet themselves
and<00:02:57.569> then<00:02:57.750> go<00:02:57.870> flying<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.620> takes<00:02:58.799> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
and then go flying so it just takes a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.470 
and then go flying so it just takes a
bit<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.130> pressure<00:02:59.250> off<00:02:59.400> me<00:02:59.610> which<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.970> which<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
bit of pressure off me which is which is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.509 
bit of pressure off me which is which is
good<00:03:00.769> but<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:01.829> very<00:03:02.040> much<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> team<00:03:02.280> effort

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
good but it's very much a team effort

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.289 
good but it's very much a team effort
and<00:03:03.290> as<00:03:04.290> Steve<00:03:04.769> capably<00:03:05.400> demonstrates<00:03:06.030> these

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
and as Steve capably demonstrates these

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.240 
and as Steve capably demonstrates these
aircraft<00:03:06.780> are<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.140> course<00:03:07.319> able<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> operate

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
aircraft are of course able to operate

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:19.640 
aircraft are of course able to operate
in<00:03:08.670> virtually<00:03:09.239> any<00:03:09.390> weather<00:03:09.780> conditions

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.790 

and<00:03:20.650> very<00:03:21.370> wonderful<00:03:22.330> area<00:03:22.989> fact<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
and very wonderful area fact on the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.160 
and very wonderful area fact on the
displays<00:03:24.280> I've<00:03:24.640> been<00:03:24.819> again<00:03:25.090> are<00:03:25.630> wonderful

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
displays I've been again are wonderful

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.260

the theme and also became were these

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.650 
the theme and also became were these
feedbacks<00:03:32.110> for<00:03:32.580> keeping<00:03:33.580> on<00:03:33.730> flight<00:03:34.330> a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
feedbacks for keeping on flight a

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.800 
feedbacks for keeping on flight a
treatable<00:03:35.530> condition
