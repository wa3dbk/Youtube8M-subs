have to either walk or you have to take
a<00:01:02.129> car<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:03.210> can't<00:01:03.510> die<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:05.030> yeah<00:01:06.030> that's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
a car you can't die and yeah that's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.700 
a car you can't die and yeah that's
that's<00:01:06.479> pretty<00:01:06.720> much<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.530> do

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that's pretty much all you have to do

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710 
that's pretty much all you have to do
and<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> got<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and what you got to do is get up to this

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.890 
and what you got to do is get up to this
go<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.439> theory<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.360> he<00:01:12.360> will<00:01:12.510> punch

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
go up a good theory and he will punch

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
go up a good theory and he will punch
you<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.590> hopefully<00:01:13.770> he<00:01:14.159> would<00:01:14.280> dive

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you and then hopefully he would dive

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.539 
you and then hopefully he would dive
into<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> lava<00:01:15.450> which<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.710> triggers<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> scene

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
into a lava which then triggers a scene

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.690 
into a lava which then triggers a scene
where<00:01:18.030> three<00:01:18.590> racks<00:01:19.590> should<00:01:19.950> appear<00:01:20.310> over<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
where three racks should appear over the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.570 
where three racks should appear over the
horizon<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.600> deliver<00:01:22.070> three<00:01:23.070> fairly<00:01:23.310> high

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
horizon and deliver three fairly high

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120 
horizon and deliver three fairly high
level<00:01:23.909> chests<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.950> said

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
level chests to you but like I said

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
level chests to you but like I said
we've<00:01:26.310> tried<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.580> couple<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.000> times<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
we've tried a couple of times and I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.520 
we've tried a couple of times and I
cannot<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.530> work<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:30.049> gonna<00:01:31.049> try<00:01:31.380> again

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
cannot get it to work so gonna try again

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980 
cannot get it to work so gonna try again
near<00:01:31.979> solo<00:01:32.400> hopefully<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.810> work

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
near solo hopefully I can get it to work

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
near solo hopefully I can get it to work
I've<00:01:34.259> got<00:01:34.320> no<00:01:34.590> idea<00:01:34.619> whether<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:35.579> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
I've got no idea whether it's because I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.420 
I've got no idea whether it's because I
have<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.210> mission<00:01:36.479> active<00:01:37.170> or<00:01:37.560> there's<00:01:38.369> just

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
have that mission active or there's just

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.899 
have that mission active or there's just
there's<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.060> enough<00:01:39.299> information<00:01:39.659> about

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
there's not enough information about

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.969 
there's not enough information about
what<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.479> could<00:01:42.720> actually<00:01:42.869> stop<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.619> from

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
what what could actually stop it from

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
what what could actually stop it from
from<00:01:44.880> happening<00:01:45.299> or<00:01:45.450> whether<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.840> need<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
from happening or whether you need to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.039 
from happening or whether you need to
have<00:01:46.350> certain<00:01:46.680> missions<00:01:47.159> bleeded<00:01:47.930> for<00:01:48.930> this

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
have certain missions bleeded for this

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.440 
have certain missions bleeded for this
quest<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.680> active<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> where<00:01:51.180> he

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
quest to be active but this is where he

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719
