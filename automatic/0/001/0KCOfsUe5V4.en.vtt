checkpoint you won't try and take these
guys<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.229> fast<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.560> humanly<00:01:10.710> possible<00:01:11.430> now

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
guys out as fast as humanly possible now

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.719 
guys out as fast as humanly possible now
I've<00:01:13.140> experimented<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.950> couple<00:01:14.070> ways<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
I've experimented with a couple ways to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.570 
I've experimented with a couple ways to
do<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.360> part<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
do this part and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.930 
do this part and
I<00:01:18.170> found<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.260> best<00:01:19.440> thing<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.730> to

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
I found the best thing to do is to

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.180 
I found the best thing to do is to
actually<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.630> stay<00:01:21.840> back<00:01:22.050> here

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
actually kind of stay back here

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.550 
actually kind of stay back here
I<00:01:23.250> had<00:01:23.940> experimented<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:24.840> running<00:01:25.230> down<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I had experimented with running down to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.110 
I had experimented with running down to
the<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:25.980> you<00:01:26.190> can<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.520> where<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:27.000> in

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
the right you can see where I'm going in

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.310 
the right you can see where I'm going in
a<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.300> bit<00:01:27.510> but<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.750> didn't<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.110> work

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
a little bit but it didn't really work

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.230 
a little bit but it didn't really work
out<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.010> I<00:01:29.130> had<00:01:29.220> hoped

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
out as well as I had hoped

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.150 
out as well as I had hoped
my<00:01:31.020> initial<00:01:31.320> playthrough<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> did<00:01:32.010> work

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
my initial playthrough is it did work

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.680 
my initial playthrough is it did work
but<00:01:32.190> for<00:01:32.730> some<00:01:32.850> reason<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.180> recording<00:01:33.630> I

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
but for some reason this recording I

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.690 
but for some reason this recording I
couldn't<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.260> work<00:01:34.620> as<00:01:34.830> well<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.580> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
couldn't get it to work as well as I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.210 
couldn't get it to work as well as I
wanted<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:37.680> second<00:01:38.010> group<00:01:38.160> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
wanted it to and the second group of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.410 
wanted it to and the second group of
guys<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.550> comes<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.060> didn't

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
guys that comes out of here didn't

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
guys that comes out of here didn't
really<00:01:39.680> behave<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.010> way<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.160> they<00:01:41.370> usually

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
really behave the way that they usually

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.350 
really behave the way that they usually
do<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.620> those<00:01:43.620> big<00:01:43.890> troop<00:01:44.250> transports<00:01:45.000> those

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
do so those big troop transports those

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.680 
do so those big troop transports those
animal<00:01:45.840> looking<00:01:46.320> mech<00:01:46.710> things<00:01:47.300> they<00:01:48.300> can<00:01:48.540> be

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
animal looking mech things they can be

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.360 
animal looking mech things they can be
taken<00:01:48.990> out<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.290> enough<00:01:49.500> gunfire<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
taken out with enough gunfire so that

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.950 
taken out with enough gunfire so that
