00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
cloth so that then afterwards we can

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.960 
cloth so that then afterwards we can
squeeze<00:00:51.890> some<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.250> water<00:00:52.280> out<00:00:52.520> on<00:00:52.850> the

of<00:01:32.630> potato<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:35.350> they<00:01:36.350> turn<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> little<00:01:36.740> Brown

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
of potato and they turn a little Brown

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.310 
of potato and they turn a little Brown
because<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.640> oxidation<00:01:38.270> but<00:01:38.720> you're<00:01:39.229> gonna

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
because of oxidation but you're gonna

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.600 
because of oxidation but you're gonna
fry<00:01:39.679> it<00:01:39.740> anyway<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.509> it's<00:01:41.509> gonna<00:01:41.659> be<00:01:41.900> browner

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
fry it anyway so it's gonna be browner

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.460 
fry it anyway so it's gonna be browner
all<00:01:43.610> right<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:44.509> yeah<00:01:44.900> I<00:01:44.930> would<00:01:45.080> say<00:01:45.200> that's

all right so yeah I would say that's

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.530 
all right so yeah I would say that's
probably<00:01:45.740> closer<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.490> three<00:01:46.880> cups<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.299> grated

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
of some of the liquid the starch will

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.630 
of some of the liquid the starch will
help<00:02:07.159> hold<00:02:07.340> everything<00:02:07.700> together<00:02:12.160> okay<00:02:13.160> it's

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
with this fork and I've got this a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.810 
with this fork and I've got this a
little<00:03:05.260> bit<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.470> flour<00:03:05.710> here<00:03:06.070> in<00:03:06.280> case<00:03:06.460> we<00:03:06.670> need

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
little bit of flour here in case we need

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.400 
little bit of flour here in case we need
it<00:03:06.850> if<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.180> seems<00:03:07.420> kind<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.720> watering<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.260> can

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
it if it seems kind of watering it can

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.700 
it if it seems kind of watering it can
add<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.560> little<00:03:08.770> bit<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:08.980> flour<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:10.710> pressing

add a little bit of flour but pressing
the<00:03:11.920> moisture<00:03:12.280> out<00:03:12.310> should<00:03:13.470> alleviate<00:03:14.470> that

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
the moisture out should alleviate that

issue okay

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.820 
issue okay
and<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.880> looks<00:03:22.180> well<00:03:22.480> mixed<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.680> I'm<00:03:23.740> gonna

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
and this looks well mixed so I'm gonna

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.470 
and this looks well mixed so I'm gonna
let<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.160> just<00:03:24.520> sit<00:03:24.790> there<00:03:25.000> while<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.210> heat<00:03:25.450> up

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
let that just sit there while I heat up

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.840 
let that just sit there while I heat up
the<00:03:25.570> skillet<00:03:25.870> I'm<00:03:26.830> gonna<00:03:26.950> get<00:03:27.100> pretty<00:03:27.370> hot<00:03:27.550> and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
the skillet I'm gonna get pretty hot and

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.880 
the skillet I'm gonna get pretty hot and
I'm<00:03:27.940> gonna<00:03:28.060> use<00:03:28.300> kind<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.930> lot<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.140> oil<00:03:29.410> more

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
I'm gonna use kind of a lot of oil more

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.440 
I'm gonna use kind of a lot of oil more
than<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.070> usually<00:03:30.430> used<00:03:30.820> when<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:30.970> cook<00:03:31.210> things

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
than I usually used when I cook things

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.790 
than I usually used when I cook things
because<00:03:31.980> that's<00:03:32.980> part<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.460> deal<00:03:34.200> okay<00:03:35.230> so

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
because that's part of the deal okay so

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:45.180 
because that's part of the deal okay so
about<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:37.300> quarter<00:03:38.080> cup<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.440> oil<00:03:38.740> maybe<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:44.190> set

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
about a quarter cup of oil maybe and set

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.790 
about a quarter cup of oil maybe and set
them<00:03:45.340> down<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:46.500> flatten<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.560> out<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.680> little

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
them down and flatten it out a little

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.420 
them down and flatten it out a little
bit<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.750> thicker<00:03:50.050> they<00:03:50.260> are<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.890> mean<00:03:51.340> you

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
bit and the thicker they are I mean you

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.770 
bit and the thicker they are I mean you
want<00:03:51.610> them<00:03:51.670> thicker<00:03:51.940> rather<00:03:52.270> than<00:03:52.480> thinner<00:03:52.690> I

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
want them thicker rather than thinner I

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.830 
want them thicker rather than thinner I
think<00:03:54.120> they<00:03:55.120> hold<00:03:55.210> together<00:03:55.420> better

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.060 

although<00:04:00.840> he<00:04:00.930> had<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.110> set<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.440> fire<00:04:01.710> oh<00:04:01.740> I'm

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
although he had to set the fire oh I'm

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:21.789 
although he had to set the fire oh I'm
off<00:04:02.220> again<00:04:02.250> today<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.850> think

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.059 

all<00:04:22.340> right<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.810> I've<00:04:23.900> got<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.199> on<00:04:24.379> high<00:04:24.620> but

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:25.069 
all right so I've got this on high but

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.029 
all right so I've got this on high but
I'm<00:04:25.190> going<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.699> actually<00:04:26.470> turn<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.620> down<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
I'm going to actually turn it down to

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.740 
I'm going to actually turn it down to
like<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.220> medium<00:04:28.580> high<00:04:28.759> because<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.240> don't<00:04:29.569> want

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
like a medium high because I don't want

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.110 
like a medium high because I don't want
the<00:04:29.900> bottom<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.229> get<00:04:30.560> too<00:04:30.979> Brown<00:04:31.159> before<00:04:31.849> the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
the bottom to get too Brown before the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.020 
the bottom to get too Brown before the
potatoes<00:04:32.509> are<00:04:32.690> actually<00:04:32.960> cooked<00:04:33.169> through<00:04:33.440> so

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
potatoes are actually cooked through so

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.050 
potatoes are actually cooked through so
I<00:04:35.030> guess<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.330> deal<00:04:35.479> with<00:04:36.289> Hanukkah<00:04:37.159> according

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
I guess the deal with Hanukkah according

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.189 
I guess the deal with Hanukkah according
to<00:04:38.150> my<00:04:38.270> internet<00:04:38.539> research<00:04:38.900> which<00:04:39.169> is

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
to my internet research which is

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.730 
to my internet research which is
infallible<00:04:40.159> as<00:04:40.340> we<00:04:40.520> all<00:04:40.610> know<00:04:41.080> like<00:04:42.080> something

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
infallible as we all know like something

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.860 
infallible as we all know like something
about<00:04:42.949> magical<00:04:43.699> oil<00:04:43.879> lasted<00:04:44.509> eight<00:04:44.659> nights

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
about magical oil lasted eight nights

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.850 
about magical oil lasted eight nights
instead<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.259> one<00:04:45.409> and<00:04:45.740> in<00:04:46.729> honor<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.120> that<00:04:47.300> oil

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
instead of one and in honor of that oil

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.230 
instead of one and in honor of that oil
you're<00:04:48.860> kind<00:04:49.340> of<00:04:49.370> sanctioned<00:04:49.970> by<00:04:50.210> the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
you're kind of sanctioned by the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.420 
you're kind of sanctioned by the
religion<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.990> eat<00:04:51.110> fried<00:04:51.440> foods<00:04:51.770> for<00:04:52.190> eight

religion to eat fried foods for eight

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.200 
religion to eat fried foods for eight
days<00:04:52.639> which<00:04:53.319> my<00:04:54.319> book<00:04:54.560> pretty<00:04:55.430> cool<00:04:55.699> so<00:04:56.030> like

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
days which my book pretty cool so like

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.899 
days which my book pretty cool so like
donuts<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:57.199> fried<00:04:57.530> potato<00:04:58.039> cakes<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.639> stuff

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
donuts and fried potato cakes and stuff

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.279 
donuts and fried potato cakes and stuff
like<00:04:59.030> that<00:04:59.270> there's<00:04:59.690> probably<00:04:59.930> other<00:05:00.050> stuff

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
like that there's probably other stuff

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.490 
like that there's probably other stuff
too<00:05:00.500> but<00:05:01.370> that's<00:05:01.909> like<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.630> guess<00:05:03.259> the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
too but that's like I guess the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.649 
too but that's like I guess the
traditional<00:05:04.099> reasoning<00:05:04.610> behind<00:05:04.759> using<00:05:05.240> so

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
traditional reasoning behind using so

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.809 
traditional reasoning behind using so
much<00:05:05.840> oil<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.409> probably<00:05:07.159> could<00:05:07.310> do<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:07.550> with

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
much oil you probably could do this with

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.909 
much oil you probably could do this with
some<00:05:08.539> spray<00:05:08.840> oil<00:05:09.020> or<00:05:09.319> something<00:05:09.650> if<00:05:09.800> you're

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
some spray oil or something if you're

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
them so I'm just making sure they're not

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.399 
them so I'm just making sure they're not
sticking<00:05:33.340> everything's<00:05:34.449> moving<00:05:35.449> so<00:05:36.080> I<00:05:36.110> don't

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
sticking everything's moving so I don't

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.700 
sticking everything's moving so I don't
know<00:05:36.469> if<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:36.650> can<00:05:36.800> see<00:05:37.099> like<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:38.449> the<00:05:39.319> cooking

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
know if you can see like the the cooking

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.610 
know if you can see like the the cooking
different<00:05:40.630> differentiation<00:05:41.630> here<00:05:41.840> like<00:05:42.469> this

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
different differentiation here like this

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.149 
different differentiation here like this
outer<00:05:42.860> edge<00:05:43.159> starting<00:05:43.759> to<00:05:44.029> look<00:05:44.240> more<00:05:45.159> yellow

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
outer edge starting to look more yellow

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.800 
outer edge starting to look more yellow
instead<00:05:46.669> of<00:05:46.759> white<00:05:47.000> and<00:05:47.270> a<00:05:47.389> little<00:05:47.630> bit

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
instead of white and a little bit

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.749 
instead of white and a little bit
translucent<00:05:48.440> instead<00:05:48.949> of<00:05:49.039> opaque<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:49.610> that's

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
translucent instead of opaque and that's

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.939 
translucent instead of opaque and that's
like<00:05:50.060> that's<00:05:50.900> what<00:05:51.050> potatoes<00:05:51.409> do<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:51.800> they

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
like that's what potatoes do and they

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.740 
like that's what potatoes do and they
cook<00:05:52.520> so<00:05:52.789> that's<00:05:53.330> what<00:05:53.479> you're<00:05:53.569> kind<00:05:53.719> of

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
cook so that's what you're kind of

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.820 
cook so that's what you're kind of
looking<00:05:53.840> forward<00:05:54.169> to<00:05:54.259> know<00:05:54.409> when<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.590> flip

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
looking forward to know when to flip

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.309 
looking forward to know when to flip
them<00:05:55.009> it's<00:05:55.669> when<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:56.150> edges<00:05:56.539> all<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.080> way<00:05:57.169> up

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
them it's when the edges all the way up

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.559 
them it's when the edges all the way up
are<00:05:57.560> starting<00:05:57.949> to<00:05:58.190> be<00:05:58.370> soft<00:05:59.620> so<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:01.069> think<00:06:01.569> some
