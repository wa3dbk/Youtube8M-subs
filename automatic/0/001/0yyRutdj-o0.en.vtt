00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello the otters hello then 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.210
 today I come to make a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:13.259
 video review on a mark so of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 perfume that I discovered and with 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.090
 which I was really surprised I 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.250
 actually wanted to research a little bit about 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.660
 internet what we said and there is 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.949
 few there are one or two girls who 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.289
 had done reviews that were 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.000
 super content too 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.789
 and frankly so that's me I was 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.180
 contacted by the ats the company actually 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.890
 who create these fragrances there so for 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.510
 ability to test and able to judge 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.010
 less per month even in fact the quality 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.649
 perfumes then the concept of there the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.690
 society concept so ds is a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.719
 French company very long time she 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.059
 exists and therefore it is located in roubaix 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.219
 and it's a society that actually creates 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.250
 perfumes 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.350
 so in fact with the same the same 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 note that luxury fragrances are at 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 to say all the perfumes dior chanel armani 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.799
 finally etc etc which sometimes creates a crisis 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.049
 and even perfume except that in fact they 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.760
 are not so that in the same 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.470
 packaging that so brand scents 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.409
 ie you will find by 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.720
 example the game is not me the channel 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.240
 for example example a number 5 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.380
 so the same smell next number 5 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.820
 but it will not be in the same 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 bottle will have sold in a bottle 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.640
 so in a good bottle too one is 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.080
 a bottle too 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.560
 quality because it is manufactured in 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.610
 italy cdu-greens done in italy and the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.070
 perfume is created in France 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.770
 so frankly it's really a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.880
 super super alternative to very fragrance 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.030
 expensive that we can find and 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.320
 unfortunately big in the surface 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.400
 beauty ie sephora or 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.890
 nocturnal etc 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.560
 and here we are now and again 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.920
 want to hate this perfume of this perfume 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.090
 the year we do not often have the means 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.610
 to buy his bafana 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.390
 and there you can honestly go 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.700
 eyes closed 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.160
 I have asked them to be able 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.590
 test the flower bomb at home 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.060
 viktor and rolf and saw that I had it I 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.679
 I said good bath like that I'm going 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.540
 try to test both I tested 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.709
 both on the world and on the other and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.350
 I left it all day 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.120
 to see what that was doing then 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.130
 frankly when we invite them all 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.100
 two in the hand that's exactly the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.110
 same smell what's more about the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.140
 perfumes so this company there that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.350
 is called his father was so here it is 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.150
 accompanied his father was and what is 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.340
 well it's actually the product holds 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.760
 even longer than the real one 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.700
 product 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.340
 I had that impression , so in 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.640
 perfuming with so I was I 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.500
 wanted to test two perfumes so here's the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.940
 first perfume that presents itself as 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.350
 this so I already find that the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.090
 bottle is very pretty she is 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:56.030
 really in class she arrives in a 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.890
 box like this one so here I am you 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.940
 quickly shows the packaging in front of 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.120
 product presents itself 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.160
 here with his father was marked here you 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.950
 so have all the inside 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.260
 ingredients then for girls who 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.880
 are afraid to find alcohol 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.410
 in perfumes and who does not smell 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.299
 because there is alcohol in the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.670
 fragrances know that in this one it is 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.350
 a denatured alcohol and it's an alcohol to 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.610
 beet base so that you can 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.310
 frankly there is the the urns the rosie 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.710
 and so the twin brother of the flower bomb 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.390
 of viktor and rolf and of which it is a 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.430
 other scent plus it's not a 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.980
 other canvas is another perfume and of which 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.960
 you have 105 milliliters and guess 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.260
 how much are the 105 thousand liters 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.200
 only 29 euros 90 for all this 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.900
 quantity imagined it from de flower bomb 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.050
 so frankly I advise you 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.280
 perfectly and that's it I'm you know 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.360
 very well that I give all the time my 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.240
 this is very rare I have 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.770
 partnerships and when I have them 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.540
 I really like them 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.310
 I had some partnerships that me 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.700
 did not like where some requests for 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.070
 two sending products so that I have 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.090
 did not know how to please you or not 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.459
 may not have been products of 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.750
 quality and that I refused 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.739
 so here I really wanted to test because 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.250
 that's when it comes to making 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.370
 savings 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.840
 of course I'm always on the lookout 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.230
 good tips and good 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.600
 finds 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.940
 So frankly I recommend you 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.400
 anyway I will put you all the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.900
 site links are taking place smoke on the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.919
 video then I have this one if it's the 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.169
 of one of dolce and gabbana and 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.210
 frankly he feels he seems 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.440
 wonderfully good then this one me 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.270
 I plan to offer my mom because 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.840
 good I have all alone and already my the 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.390
 flower bomb 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.660
 but this one the elegance it is it is 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.250
 super fresh it smells super good and 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.130
 Frankly the same smell I left 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.590
 so test the back one in perfume seen 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.990
 I'm not, and it's maddening 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.360
 how does it feel the same 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.370
 frankly try that nothing to try 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.500
 you paid to go to break everything 29 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.820
 90 euros even if you're disappointed and you 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.770
 will not be disappointed 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.229
 frankly because I 'm not 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.690
 and here are jean perfumes and I have some 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.140
 tons and that's I tested a lot of 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.340
 I have known many brands 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.979
 different from perfume be it from 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.300
 chaleix du dior you're schengen 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.040
 annex of mont blanc etc 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.000
 and I can tell you that it's really 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.000
 perfumes of quality here is so here 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.599
 for perfumes what I wanted so 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.280
 you 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:30.610
 also say so then right then to 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.740
 from I think so of the video you 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.060
 so have less 15% for your 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.800
 first order on the site 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.319
 so it's really not insignificant on 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.030
 to say 30 euros you will have less 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.379
 15% on 30 euros if you buy two 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.240
 perfumes you are going to have fewer exhibitors 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.560
 on 60 euros for example and if you 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.530
 prefer you have more models 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.550
 small which cost had 19 euros 90 which 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.539
 you do not have to buy the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.629
 big bottle if you really want 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.960
 test a small format you have some 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:57.419
 small formats that are I believe 53 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.300
 milliliters a thing like that 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.020
 so here's for home fragrances 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.690
 father smokes 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.940
 so here are the pretty ones for this trick 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.979
 have rather this find we'll say 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.979
 so it's really a site I think 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.169
 I will continue to follow because they 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.550
 have the site is really well done then 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.180
 you go you have each time we 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:22.000
 so does the name of the perfume whatsoever 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.729
 So rosie elegance and it's next to you 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.789
 actually have the scent to which he 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.130
 so looks like that is sold so on the 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.050
 market for example whether it's for the 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.909
 dolce gabbana for example put you 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.710
 so elegance and next to put you so 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:38.530
 which looks like other channels 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.650
 what we are going to say the equivalent 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.639
 one of dolce and gabbana 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.440
 so it's not at all 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.620
 counterfeit the girls it's really 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:52.449
 so long as we do not have so much as the brand 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:56.139
 do not take the name or the way of 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:58.990
 packaging ni and united I mean the 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.759
 the same advertisement etc finally they have 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.080
 quite right to resume in 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:04.779
 makes the same scent notes the 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.979
 same ingredients perfumes etc and so 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:07.930
 exchange their packaging 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.539
 here are the looks so enjoy -15% 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.400
 so on the site with the assmann code 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.749
 make up 15 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.009
 so from today I do not know 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:17.289
 how long will it last 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.539
 way I put all the info under the 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:21.219
 video discover the beard is a fake I 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:24.689
 you make big kisses and I tell you 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:24.689
 see you next video beautiful goodbye
