identify with that and I think you know
in<00:03:28.870> Austria<00:03:29.290> across<00:03:29.860> roller<00:03:30.099> and<00:03:30.340> ice<00:03:30.459> we<00:03:30.730> are

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
in Austria across roller and ice we are

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.880 
in Austria across roller and ice we are
very<00:03:31.060> small<00:03:31.360> boss<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.260> think<00:03:32.530> that's<00:03:32.680> part

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
very small boss and I think that's part

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.619 
very small boss and I think that's part
of<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.069> consideration<00:03:33.849> that<00:03:33.879> needs<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.540> be

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
of the consideration that needs to be

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:35.970 
of the consideration that needs to be
brought<00:03:34.810> forward<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.319> try<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.620> build<00:03:35.709> things

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
brought forward to try and build things

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.830 
brought forward to try and build things
