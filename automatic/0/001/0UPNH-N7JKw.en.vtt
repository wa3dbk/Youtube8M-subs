00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
screen for a second as it does this but

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.260 
screen for a second as it does this but
this<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.550> editing<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> code

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
this is because it's editing the code

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.490 
this is because it's editing the code
and<00:00:36.510> jaggers's<00:00:38.149> client<00:00:39.149> side<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.690> therefore

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and jaggers's client side and therefore

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.020 
and jaggers's client side and therefore
enables<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.219> another<00:00:41.430> two<00:00:41.640> spins

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
enables you to get another two spins

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
side and I don't think this will be

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.340 
side and I don't think this will be
around<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.360> long<00:00:48.480> because<00:00:48.600> they'll<00:00:48.960> patch<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
around for long because they'll patch it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.720 
around for long because they'll patch it
pretty<00:00:49.829> soon<00:00:50.010> enough<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.610> this

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
pretty soon enough so they see this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.760

Squealer<00:02:54.599> forward<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.079> bypass<00:02:55.470> I'm<00:02:55.769> doing

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
Squealer forward to in bypass I'm doing

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.170 
Squealer forward to in bypass I'm doing
this<00:02:56.129> live<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.849> that<00:02:56.909> there's<00:02:57.150> no

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
you can see I've already analyzed it

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.339 
you can see I've already analyzed it
about<00:03:05.010> 20<00:03:05.849> minutes<00:03:05.970> ago<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.659> recording

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
and here you go squeal of fortune bypass

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.289 
and here you go squeal of fortune bypass
and<00:03:16.340> it's<00:03:17.340> just<00:03:18.500> putting<00:03:19.500> me<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.739> position<00:03:20.299> so

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
and it's just putting me in position so

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.059 
and it's just putting me in position so
we'll<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.959> wait<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:22.410> one<00:03:22.560> way<00:03:22.769> I'll<00:03:22.919> give

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
we'll just wait and one way I'll give

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.680 
we'll just wait and one way I'll give
you<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> description<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.699> what<00:03:23.849> virustotal<00:03:24.359> is

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
you a description of what virustotal is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.360 
you a description of what virustotal is
so<00:03:25.560> basically<00:03:26.160> if<00:03:26.430> you're<00:03:26.790> unsure<00:03:26.909> of<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.329> file

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
so basically if you're unsure of a file

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.449 
so basically if you're unsure of a file
you<00:03:29.370> uploaded<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.940> virus<00:03:30.090> total<00:03:31.099> which<00:03:32.099> scans

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
you uploaded a virus total which scans

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.000 
you uploaded a virus total which scans
it<00:03:32.639> on<00:03:32.730> over<00:03:34.010> 43<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.579> maybe<00:03:36.540> even<00:03:36.750> more<00:03:37.010> anti

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
it on over 43 to maybe even more anti

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.110 
it on over 43 to maybe even more anti
viruses<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.819> then<00:03:39.629> from<00:03:39.959> there<00:03:40.019> it's<00:03:40.500> um

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
viruses and then from there it's um

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.159 
viruses and then from there it's um
tells<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.269> if<00:03:42.329> any<00:03:42.449> of<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.629> antivirus<00:03:43.049> has

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
tells you if any of the antivirus has

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.210 
tells you if any of the antivirus has
picked<00:03:43.379> up<00:03:43.530> any<00:03:45.169> virus<00:03:46.169> kind<00:03:46.409> of<00:03:46.530> signatures<00:03:46.979> I

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
picked up any virus kind of signatures I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.149 
picked up any virus kind of signatures I
guess<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:48.319> then<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.680> decide<00:03:49.739> if<00:03:50.040> you

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
guess and then you can decide if you

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.559 
guess and then you can decide if you
want<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.430> trust<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.699> program<00:03:51.090> or<00:03:51.150> not<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.479> it

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
want to trust the program or not and it

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.659 
want to trust the program or not and it
allows<00:03:51.780> people's<00:03:52.109> like<00:03:52.260> make<00:03:53.129> comments<00:03:53.549> as

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
allows people's like make comments as

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.849 
allows people's like make comments as
well<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.120> as<00:03:54.629> you<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:54.810> see<00:03:54.989> right<00:03:55.019> now<00:03:55.199> my

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
father is being analyzed and just

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.040 
father is being analyzed and just
waiting<00:03:59.129> for<00:03:59.400> that<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.780> I'll<00:04:01.500> try<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:01.799> like

have a virus to upload to virustotal or

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.090 
have a virus to upload to virustotal or

if their programs are virus because if

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.560 
if their programs are virus because if
it<00:04:32.370> gets<00:04:32.550> detected<00:04:32.990> then<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.170> like<00:04:34.590> um<00:04:35.570> sends

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
it gets detected then it like um sends

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.480 
it gets detected then it like um sends
out<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:37.380> thing<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.710> all<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.100> other<00:04:38.220> anti

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
out the thing to all the other anti

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.100 
out the thing to all the other anti
viruses<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.210> they<00:04:39.360> have<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.690> pick<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:39.990> up

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
viruses so that they have to pick it up

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.860 
viruses so that they have to pick it up
as<00:04:40.260> well<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:41.130> basically<00:04:41.790> their<00:04:42.390> virus<00:04:42.690> will

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
as well so basically their virus will

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.190 
as well so basically their virus will
get<00:04:43.050> picked<00:04:43.290> up<00:04:43.500> but<00:04:44.430> if<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:45.120> unlike<00:04:45.690> me<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:45.930> have

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
get picked up but if I unlike me I have

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.290 
get picked up but if I unlike me I have
nothing<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.650> hide<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:46.830> all<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.970> legit
