00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.420 
golden space on modern 43 I believe this
map<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.780> called<00:01:34.110> bootleg<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.890> takes<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.280> one

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
map is called bootleg it takes up one

map is called bootleg it takes up one
takes<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.060> two<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.540> guess<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> quad<00:01:37.409> food<00:01:37.619> here

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
takes out two I guess the quad food here

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.929 
takes out two I guess the quad food here
in<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> second<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.460> he's<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.700> done<00:01:38.909> yet

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
in a second but he's not done yet

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.880 
in a second but he's not done yet
because<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.570> would<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.020> pretty<00:01:40.500> good<00:01:40.590> clip

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
because that would be a pretty good clip

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
because that would be a pretty good clip
we're<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.369> worthy<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> top<00:01:42.600> five<00:01:42.720> plays
