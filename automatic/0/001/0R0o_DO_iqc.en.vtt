00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
here let's see I'm going to slow down to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.710 
here let's see I'm going to slow down to
this<00:01:46.920> part<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.030> different<00:01:48.420> pads

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
this part we can go different pads

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
this part we can go different pads
depending<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:50.040> school<00:01:50.369> I

super<00:02:17.190> style<00:02:17.370> yes<00:02:17.720> good<00:02:18.720> point<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:21.270> can<00:02:21.390> go<00:02:21.420> off

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
super style yes good point we can go off

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.030 
super style yes good point we can go off
the<00:02:21.690> ramp<00:02:21.870> sketch<00:02:22.140> two<00:02:22.260> rings<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.800> path

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the ramp sketch two rings here this path

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.740 
the ramp sketch two rings here this path
is<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.580> much<00:02:23.730> faster<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.150> go<00:02:24.480> through<00:02:24.660> this

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
is it's much faster to go through this

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.540 
is it's much faster to go through this
path<00:02:24.960> as<00:02:25.170> opposed<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.680> trying<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> platform<00:02:26.100> so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
path as opposed to trying to platform so

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.130 
path as opposed to trying to platform so
and<00:02:27.090> then<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.300> destroys<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.780> car<00:02:27.930> Thea

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
and then it just destroys the car Thea

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.300 
and then it just destroys the car Thea
and<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.290> did<00:02:28.380> really<00:02:28.500> need<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.800> anyway<00:02:29.040> let's
