00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

I<00:00:00.060> thought<00:00:00.329> you<00:00:00.570> eat<00:00:00.719> as<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.870> fat<00:00:01.140> you<00:00:01.350> wear<00:00:01.589> and

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I thought you eat as a fat you wear and

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.679 
I thought you eat as a fat you wear and
so<00:00:01.979> there<00:00:02.399> died<00:00:02.610> before<00:00:02.909> it<00:00:03.330> would<00:00:03.480> be

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so there died before it would be

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.660 
so there died before it would be
calorically<00:00:04.500> dense<00:00:04.620> just<00:00:05.130> because<00:00:05.339> it<00:00:05.520> has

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
calorically dense just because it has

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.880 
calorically dense just because it has
more<00:00:05.700> fat<00:00:06.299> naturally<00:00:06.600> so<00:00:07.170> I'm<00:00:07.589> wondering

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
more fat naturally so I'm wondering

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.640 
more fat naturally so I'm wondering
instead<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.700> maybe<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.780> know<00:00:09.900> reducing<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
instead of maybe you know reducing the

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.290 
instead of maybe you know reducing the
amount<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.950> calories<00:00:11.190> just<00:00:11.400> replacing<00:00:12.150> them

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
amount of calories just replacing them

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.720 
amount of calories just replacing them
with<00:00:12.330> healthy<00:00:13.200> food<00:00:13.440> groups<00:00:13.710> such<00:00:14.160> as<00:00:14.190> legumes

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
with healthy food groups such as legumes

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.950 
with healthy food groups such as legumes
whole<00:00:15.059> grains<00:00:15.360> fruits<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.139> vegetables<00:00:16.680> that

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
whole grains fruits and vegetables that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.210 
whole grains fruits and vegetables that
would<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> wonderful<00:00:19.619> thing<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.039> do

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
would be a wonderful thing to do

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.980 
would be a wonderful thing to do
although<00:00:21.289> you<00:00:22.289> know<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> studies<00:00:23.039> done<00:00:23.310> on

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
although you know the studies done on

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.400 
although you know the studies done on
fatty<00:00:24.990> whole<00:00:25.529> plant<00:00:26.039> foods<00:00:26.430> okay<00:00:27.060> like<00:00:27.449> nuts

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
fatty whole plant foods okay like nuts

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.640 
fatty whole plant foods okay like nuts
and<00:00:28.710> seeds<00:00:29.039> works<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> yeah<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.449> would

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
and seeds works and yeah you would

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
and seeds works and yeah you would
expect<00:00:31.650> because<00:00:32.250> they're<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.910> clearly<00:00:33.270> been

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
expect because they're so clearly been

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.260 
expect because they're so clearly been
they<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.380> much<00:00:34.590> fat<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.160> them<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:35.910> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
they have so much fat in them then you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.119 
they have so much fat in them then you
don't<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.020> handful<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.530> walnuts<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
don't have it a handful of walnuts to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.250 
don't have it a handful of walnuts to
your<00:00:38.250> daily<00:00:38.399> diet<00:00:38.579> any<00:00:39.540> weight<00:00:39.780> there's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> lot

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
your daily diet any weight there's a lot

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
your daily diet any weight there's a lot
of<00:00:40.379> calories<00:00:40.559> turns<00:00:41.160> out<00:00:41.280> that's<00:00:41.399> actually

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
of calories turns out that's actually

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.240 
of calories turns out that's actually
not<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.510> happens<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.290> mean<00:00:43.860> there's<00:00:44.070> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
not what happens I mean there's this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.810 
not what happens I mean there's this
remarkable<00:00:45.180> consistency<00:00:45.750> among<00:00:46.640> trials<00:00:48.230> some

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
remarkable consistency among trials some

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.240 
remarkable consistency among trials some
support<00:00:50.820> by<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:50.969> industry<00:00:51.780> some<00:00:51.960> others<00:00:52.289> some

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
support by the industry some others some

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the expected weight gain you would even

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.670 
the expected weight gain you would even
though<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:59.809> whole<00:01:00.809> plant<00:01:01.140> foods<00:01:01.410> there's<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
though your whole plant foods there's a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.549 
though your whole plant foods there's a
bunch<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:03.090> fascinating<00:01:04.049> theories<00:01:04.379> as

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
bunch of really fascinating theories as

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
bunch of really fascinating theories as
to<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.159> through<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> videos

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
to what I go through them of the videos

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.109 
to what I go through them of the videos
not<00:01:06.869> actually<00:01:09.830> really<00:01:10.830> fascinating<00:01:11.189> ways<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
not actually really fascinating ways the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.840 
not actually really fascinating ways the
origin<00:01:12.630> eating<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.610> has<00:01:14.610> some

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
origin eating them has some

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.359 
origin eating them has some
physiological<00:01:15.689> effects<00:01:16.409> basically<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
physiological effects basically so I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.600 
physiological effects basically so I
would<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.850> would<00:01:18.360> say<00:01:18.540> stay<00:01:18.840> away<00:01:19.580> we<00:01:20.580> really

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
would I would say stay away we really

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.210 
would I would say stay away we really
need<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> minimize<00:01:21.619> animals<00:01:22.619> junk<00:01:22.920> foods

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
need to minimize animals junk foods

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
need to minimize animals junk foods
right<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.939> would<00:01:24.210> encourage<00:01:24.479> people<00:01:24.600> eat<00:01:24.990> whole

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
right I would encourage people eat whole

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.340 
right I would encourage people eat whole
plant<00:01:25.530> foods<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:27.270> less<00:01:27.630> important<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
plant foods and it's less important to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.510 
plant foods and it's less important to
me<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> ratio<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
me you know kind of the ratio of the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
me you know kind of the ratio of the
macronutrients<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.759> carbs<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
macronutrients you know carbs really the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
macronutrients you know carbs really the
source<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:35.369> long<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.700> getting<00:01:35.909> from<00:01:36.180> whole

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
source as long as getting from whole

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.080 
source as long as getting from whole
plant<00:01:36.900> foods<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.340> think<00:01:38.759> that's<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:38.970> most

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
plant foods that I think that's the most

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.539 
plant foods that I think that's the most
important<00:01:39.450> thing<00:01:39.479> okay<00:01:39.860> yeah<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.100> remember

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
important thing okay yeah I do remember

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.340 
important thing okay yeah I do remember
seeing<00:01:41.880> those<00:01:42.150> videos<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.899> showing<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
seeing those videos of you showing the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
seeing those videos of you showing the
studies<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> nuts<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.820> kind<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
studies with the nuts if you can kind of

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
studies with the nuts if you can kind of
just<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.420> into<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.840> how's<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> possible

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
just go into that how's that possible

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.280 
just go into that how's that possible
you<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.579> you're<00:01:47.850> eating<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:49.049> much

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
you know you're eating so much

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
you know you're eating so much

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
calorically dense you know high fatty

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.130 
calorically dense you know high fatty
foods<00:01:52.020> where<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.860> those<00:01:52.979> calories<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
foods where do those calories go do the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.749 
foods where do those calories go do the
calories<00:01:55.890> disappear<00:01:56.640> too<00:01:57.710> yeah<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.009> why<00:02:01.759> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.430 
okay great great yeah so the video on
the<00:02:18.150> side<00:02:18.330> nutrition<00:02:18.840> packs<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.140> are<00:02:19.320> it's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the side nutrition packs that are it's

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.860 
the side nutrition packs that are it's
called<00:02:19.620> solving<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> mystery<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
called solving the mystery of the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.680 
called solving the mystery of the
missing<00:02:22.110> calories<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:24.030> follows<00:02:24.660> a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
missing calories and so that follows a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.140 
missing calories and so that follows a
video<00:02:25.650> nothing<00:02:26.010> obesity<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> weight<00:02:26.970> of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
video nothing obesity the weight of

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.080 
video nothing obesity the weight of
evidence<00:02:27.330> where<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:27.990> goes<00:02:28.350> through<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:30.000> know

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
evidence where it goes through you know

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.300 
evidence where it goes through you know
all<00:02:30.360> every<00:02:30.900> study<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.530> last<00:02:31.740> eight<00:02:32.280> years

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
all every study in the last eight years

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.060 
all every study in the last eight years
that<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.540> has<00:02:34.050> looked<00:02:34.290> at<00:02:34.440> weight<00:02:34.620> gaining<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
that it has looked at weight gaining the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.470 
that it has looked at weight gaining the
risk<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.310> overweight<00:02:35.670> obesity

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
risk of overweight obesity

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.400 
risk of overweight obesity
I'm<00:02:36.690> not<00:02:37.080> obesity<00:02:37.710> with<00:02:37.890> nut<00:02:38.070> consumption<00:02:38.520> and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
I'm not obesity with nut consumption and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.830 
I'm not obesity with nut consumption and
seeing<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.710> there's<00:02:40.920> no<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.780> don't

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
seeing that there's no that you don't

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.420 
seeing that there's no that you don't
get<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.140> kind<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.560> weight<00:02:43.770> gain<00:02:43.950> where<00:02:44.250> do

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
get that kind of weight gain where do

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.960 
get that kind of weight gain where do
the<00:02:44.550> nut<00:02:44.790> calories<00:02:45.360> go<00:02:45.690> oh<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.459> talked

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the nut calories go oh and so I talked

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.300 
the nut calories go oh and so I talked
about<00:02:48.060> some<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> various<00:02:49.170> theories<00:02:49.830> one

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
about some of the various theories one

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.990 
about some of the various theories one
of<00:02:50.340> which<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.740> so-called<00:02:53.000> pistachio

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
of which is the so-called pistachio

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.830 
of which is the so-called pistachio
principle<00:02:54.830> which<00:02:55.830> which<00:02:56.700> basically<00:02:57.150> suggests

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
principle which which basically suggests

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.790 
principle which which basically suggests
that<00:02:59.060> that<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.780> nuts<00:03:01.050> are<00:03:01.200> such<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.410> pain<00:03:01.770> to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
that that that nuts are such a pain to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.650 
that that that nuts are such a pain to
eat<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.430> gonna<00:03:02.670> sit<00:03:02.970> down<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.209> actually<00:03:03.330> eat

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
eat like gonna sit down and actually eat

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.990 
eat like gonna sit down and actually eat
pistachios<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.800> actually<00:03:05.220> shell<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.760> means

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
pistachios and actually shell the means

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000 
pistachios and actually shell the means
really<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.540> mean<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:06.959> just<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.440> mean<00:03:07.470> would<00:03:07.770> just

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
really I mean you just I mean would just

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.830 
really I mean you just I mean would just
you<00:03:08.310> know<00:03:08.340> cut<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.850> your<00:03:08.970> body's<00:03:09.360> not<00:03:09.390> enough

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
you know cut that your body's not enough

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.520 
you know cut that your body's not enough
already

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
already

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.600 
already
I<00:03:10.560> mean<00:03:11.220> even<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.400> having<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.850> chew<00:03:12.150> them

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
I mean even just having to chew them

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.190 
I mean even just having to chew them
basically<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:15.090> more<00:03:15.270> chewing<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.900> have<00:03:16.050> to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
basically the more chewing you have to

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.330 
basically the more chewing you have to
do<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.780> know<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.080> more<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:20.010> kind<00:03:20.310> of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
do the you know the more this kind of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.340 
do the you know the more this kind of
atheneum<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.150> chewing<00:03:21.540> my<00:03:21.690> bay<00:03:21.840> people<00:03:22.170> eat

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
atheneum of chewing my bay people eat

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.479 
atheneum of chewing my bay people eat
less<00:03:22.560> overall<00:03:23.550> but<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.030> wouldn't<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:26.459> then

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
less overall but that wouldn't and then

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.520 
less overall but that wouldn't and then
another<00:03:27.090> one<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.900> about<00:03:28.170> people

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
another one is this about people

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.550 
another one is this about people
excretion<00:03:28.920> theory<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.610> then<00:03:29.730> many<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.560> US

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
excretion theory and then many of the US

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.100 
excretion theory and then many of the US
you<00:03:31.709> screen<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> lot<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.030> fat<00:03:33.330> founded<00:03:33.870> nuts

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
you screen a lot of the fat founded nuts

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.500 
you screen a lot of the fat founded nuts
I'm<00:03:34.769> out<00:03:35.040> together<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:36.030> mean<00:03:36.180> there's<00:03:36.450> only

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
I'm out together and I mean there's only

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.870 
I'm out together and I mean there's only
so<00:03:36.690> much<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.410> chew<00:03:37.830> almonds<00:03:38.370> right<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
so much you can chew almonds right and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.729 
so much you can chew almonds right and
you<00:03:39.239> get<00:03:39.390> those<00:03:39.540> little<00:03:39.750> pieces<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.170> almonds

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
you get those little pieces of almonds

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.530 
you get those little pieces of almonds
many<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.640> which<00:03:41.790> kind<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.120> go<00:03:42.209> right<00:03:42.420> through

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
many of which kind of go right through

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.090 
many of which kind of go right through
you<00:03:42.660> know<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.959> fat<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.590> was<00:03:43.830> still

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
you know the fat that was still

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.650 
you know the fat that was still
contained<00:03:44.670> in<00:03:44.970> those<00:03:45.120> little<00:03:45.330> bits<00:03:45.570> of

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
contained in those little bits of

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.410 
contained in those little bits of
almonds<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.980> know<00:03:47.100> may<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.310> not<00:03:48.030> all<00:03:48.209> get

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
almonds you know may not not all get

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.150 
almonds you know may not not all get
absorb<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.110> know<00:03:49.320> it<00:03:49.470> says<00:03:49.650> oh<00:03:49.799> my<00:03:49.830> god

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
absorb so you know it says oh my god

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
absorb so you know it says oh my god
this<00:03:50.370> many<00:03:50.640> almonds<00:03:51.060> has<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.330> many<00:03:51.540> calories

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
this many almonds has this many calories

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.199 
this many almonds has this many calories
it<00:03:52.680> only<00:03:52.860> has<00:03:53.070> any<00:03:53.340> comment<00:03:53.790> begin<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.090> your

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
it only has any comment begin to your

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.910 
it only has any comment begin to your
body<00:03:54.450> right<00:03:55.019> doesn't<00:03:55.470> matter<00:03:55.620> how<00:03:55.799> many

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
body right doesn't matter how many

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.979 
body right doesn't matter how many
calories<00:03:56.250> make<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.970> toilet<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:57.840> they

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
calories make it to the toilet so they

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.770 
calories make it to the toilet so they
tested<00:03:58.920> these<00:03:59.340> theories<00:03:59.670> by<00:03:59.940> comparing<00:04:00.510> nuts

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
tested these theories by comparing nuts

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.340 
tested these theories by comparing nuts
to<00:04:01.080> nut<00:04:01.290> butters<00:04:01.790> okay<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:02.850> then<00:04:03.299> what<00:04:03.600> if<00:04:04.140> we

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
to nut butters okay so then what if we

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.500 
to nut butters okay so then what if we
say<00:04:04.560> okay<00:04:04.890> almond<00:04:05.400> butter<00:04:05.610> versus<00:04:06.060> almonds

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
say okay almond butter versus almonds

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.810 
say okay almond butter versus almonds
then<00:04:07.080> almond<00:04:07.650> butter<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:08.010> get<00:04:08.190> all<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.610> fat

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
then almond butter you get all that fat

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.120 
then almond butter you get all that fat
right<00:04:09.030> there's<00:04:09.480> no<00:04:09.570> little<00:04:09.870> bits<00:04:10.110> right<00:04:10.620> and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
right there's no little bits right and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.039 
right there's no little bits right and
you<00:04:11.670> don't<00:04:11.820> have<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.060> chew<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.630> mean<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:12.989> just

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
you don't have to chew I mean you just

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.890 
you don't have to chew I mean you just
suck<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.769> right<00:04:13.920> down<00:04:14.160> right<00:04:14.630> and<00:04:15.630> then<00:04:15.750> they

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
suck it right down right and then they

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.539 
suck it right down right and then they
did<00:04:16.080> these<00:04:16.169> like<00:04:16.350> smoothie<00:04:16.950> recipes<00:04:17.370> where

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
did these like smoothie recipes where

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.640 
did these like smoothie recipes where
they<00:04:17.640> just<00:04:17.820> like<00:04:17.940> walnuts<00:04:18.419> smoothies<00:04:19.049> where

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
they just like walnuts smoothies where

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.560 
they just like walnuts smoothies where
they<00:04:19.859> made<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.700> know<00:04:20.850> they<00:04:20.970> blended<00:04:21.450> it

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
they made it so you know they blended it

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.890 
they made it so you know they blended it
up

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.230 

see<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.380> wait<00:04:24.560> game<00:04:24.830> right<00:04:25.370> so<00:04:25.850> they<00:04:25.970> said<00:04:26.120> oh

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
see the wait game right so they said oh

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.180 
see the wait game right so they said oh
forget<00:04:26.660> okay<00:04:26.930> so<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.199> old<00:04:27.350> pistachio<00:04:27.919> thing

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
forget okay so the old pistachio thing

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.670 
forget okay so the old pistachio thing
theory<00:04:28.790> out<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.090> window<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.630> whole<00:04:29.680> thing

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
theory out the window the whole thing

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.750 
theory out the window the whole thing
out<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.979> window<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.699> what<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.300> heck<00:04:32.540> is<00:04:32.780> it

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
out the window so what the heck is it

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.870 
out the window so what the heck is it
probably<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:36.080> main<00:04:36.320> reason<00:04:36.889> is<00:04:37.070> what's

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
probably the main reason is what's

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.790 
probably the main reason is what's
called<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.300> battery<00:04:38.690> compensation<00:04:39.500> theory

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
called the battery compensation theory

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.430 
called the battery compensation theory
where<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:41.030> shows<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.690> mean<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.169> add<00:04:42.410> a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
where it shows that I mean you add a

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.909 
where it shows that I mean you add a
handful<00:04:43.130> nuts<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.610> your<00:04:43.760> daily<00:04:44.270> diet<00:04:44.919> yeah

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
handful nuts to your daily diet yeah

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.250 
handful nuts to your daily diet yeah
that's<00:04:46.100> a<00:04:46.130> couple<00:04:46.370> hundred<00:04:46.610> calories<00:04:47.260> and

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
that's a couple hundred calories and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.610 
that's a couple hundred calories and
that<00:04:48.470> people<00:04:48.970> that<00:04:49.970> diets<00:04:50.720> are<00:04:50.870> so<00:04:51.050> see<00:04:51.350> I'm

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
that people that diets are so see I'm

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.360 
that people that diets are so see I'm
not<00:04:51.979> so<00:04:52.310> satiating<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:53.510> filling<00:04:54.050> that<00:04:54.680> even

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
not so satiating so filling that even

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.000 
not so satiating so filling that even
though<00:04:55.699> they<00:04:56.449> weren't<00:04:56.660> told<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.320> replace<00:04:57.710> nuts

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
though they weren't told to replace nuts

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.279 
though they weren't told to replace nuts
or<00:04:58.190> something<00:04:58.520> else<00:04:58.760> just<00:04:59.300> naturally<00:05:00.080> people

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
or something else just naturally people

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.379 
or something else just naturally people
would<00:05:00.620> eat<00:05:00.949> and<00:05:01.639> a<00:05:01.729> two<00:05:01.910> hundred<00:05:02.210> calories

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
would eat and a two hundred calories

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.590 
would eat and a two hundred calories
less<00:05:03.020> of<00:05:03.289> other<00:05:03.530> foods<00:05:03.889> throughout<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.400> day

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
less of other foods throughout the day

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.029 
less of other foods throughout the day
and<00:05:05.600> so<00:05:05.690> they<00:05:05.810> even<00:05:05.990> though<00:05:06.260> they<00:05:06.440> were<00:05:06.500> told

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
and so they even though they were told

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.279 
and so they even though they were told
and<00:05:07.400> just<00:05:08.330> eat<00:05:08.750> whatever<00:05:08.900> you're<00:05:09.169> eating

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
and just eat whatever you're eating

and just eat whatever you're eating
before<00:05:09.500> but<00:05:10.340> at<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> handful<00:05:10.970> or<00:05:11.030> two<00:05:11.180> handfuls

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
before but at a handful or two handfuls

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:12.730 
before but at a handful or two handfuls
of<00:05:11.720> nuts<00:05:11.780> your<00:05:12.110> daily<00:05:12.380> diet

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
of nuts your daily diet

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.830 
of nuts your daily diet
they<00:05:13.220> said<00:05:13.430> okay<00:05:13.789> god<00:05:14.030> I'm<00:05:14.300> gonna<00:05:14.479> get<00:05:14.660> fat

they said okay god I'm gonna get fat

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.159 
they said okay god I'm gonna get fat
alright<00:05:15.289> but<00:05:15.440> they<00:05:15.530> kept<00:05:15.860> eating<00:05:16.250> nuts<00:05:16.610> um<00:05:17.169> but

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
alright but they kept eating nuts um but

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.900 
alright but they kept eating nuts um but
just<00:05:18.199> because<00:05:18.710> you<00:05:19.039> know<00:05:19.130> they<00:05:19.250> felt<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:19.639> full

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
just because you know they felt so full

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.730 
just because you know they felt so full
and<00:05:20.090> they're<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.449> packed<00:05:20.900> with<00:05:21.229> nutrition

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
and they're so packed with nutrition

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.680 
and they're so packed with nutrition
that<00:05:22.610> their<00:05:22.789> body<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.090> know<00:05:23.210> they<00:05:23.360> just<00:05:23.539> ate

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
that their body you know they just ate

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.390 
that their body you know they just ate
less<00:05:24.020> for<00:05:24.440> something<00:05:24.680> without<00:05:24.919> him<00:05:25.070> thinking

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
less for something without him thinking

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.370 
less for something without him thinking
about<00:05:25.639> it<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.060> so<00:05:26.419> we<00:05:26.449> actually<00:05:26.840> calculate

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
about it and so we actually calculate

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.770 
about it and so we actually calculate
their<00:05:27.530> diets<00:05:27.860> they<00:05:28.010> were<00:05:28.070> eating<00:05:28.610> kind<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.240> 200

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
their diets they were eating kind of 200

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.200 
their diets they were eating kind of 200
calories<00:05:30.229> less<00:05:30.800> without<00:05:31.250> any<00:05:31.460> thinking<00:05:31.910> about

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
calories less without any thinking about

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.150 
calories less without any thinking about
it<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:32.599> so<00:05:33.349> they're<00:05:33.530> boy

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
it and so they're boy

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.140 
it and so they're boy
you<00:05:34.490> know<00:05:34.630> displacing<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:37.430> other<00:05:37.729> foods<00:05:38.060> in

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
you know displacing the other foods in

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.629 
you know displacing the other foods in
their<00:05:38.270> diet<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:38.660> ninety<00:05:39.530> percent<00:05:40.010> of<00:05:40.400> what

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
their diet and ninety percent of what

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.659 
their diet and ninety percent of what
people<00:05:41.240> eat<00:05:41.479> in<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:41.900> country<00:05:42.139> is<00:05:42.830> much<00:05:43.340> less

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
people eat in this country is much less

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.100 
people eat in this country is much less
helpful<00:05:43.970> than<00:05:44.120> nuts<00:05:44.419> right<00:05:44.780> so<00:05:44.900> you're

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
helpful than nuts right so you're

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.529 
helpful than nuts right so you're
displacing<00:05:45.620> bad<00:05:46.130> stuff<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:47.210> know<00:05:47.300> it's<00:05:47.419> not

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
displacing bad stuff you know it's not

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.210 
displacing bad stuff you know it's not
like<00:05:47.750> they<00:05:47.960> weren't<00:05:48.139> eating<00:05:48.349> 200<00:05:48.830> calories<00:05:49.130> of

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
like they weren't eating 200 calories of

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.909 
like they weren't eating 200 calories of
kale<00:05:49.490> that<00:05:49.520> day<00:05:49.970> right<00:05:50.930> they<00:05:51.320> were<00:05:51.380> eating<00:05:51.740> and

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
kale that day right they were eating and

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.350 
kale that day right they were eating and
so<00:05:52.220> it<00:05:52.760> benefited<00:05:53.630> their<00:05:53.810> health<00:05:54.260> overall<00:05:55.330> and

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
so it benefited their health overall and

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.050 
so it benefited their health overall and
and<00:05:57.970> finally<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.300> last<00:05:59.479> bit<00:05:59.900> is<00:06:00.699> it<00:06:01.699> turns<00:06:01.910> out

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
and finally the last bit is it turns out

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.480 
and finally the last bit is it turns out
that<00:06:02.270> when<00:06:03.070> eating<00:06:04.070> nuts<00:06:04.389> actually<00:06:05.389> boosts

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
that when eating nuts actually boosts

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.120 
that when eating nuts actually boosts
the<00:06:07.490> amount<00:06:07.669> of<00:06:07.729> fat<00:06:08.060> we<00:06:08.330> burn<00:06:08.889> throughout<00:06:09.889> the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
the amount of fat we burn throughout the

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.540 
the amount of fat we burn throughout the
day<00:06:10.340> um<00:06:11.330> so<00:06:11.690> about<00:06:12.050> 70%<00:06:12.680> of<00:06:13.010> the<00:06:13.099> disappeared

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
day um so about 70% of the disappeared

calories and nuts is is a made up for in

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.879 
calories and nuts is is a made up for in
the<00:06:17.840> in<00:06:18.470> the<00:06:18.970> compensation<00:06:20.470> but<00:06:21.470> there's

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
the in the compensation but there's

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.529 
the in the compensation but there's
still<00:06:22.070> 30%<00:06:22.430> of<00:06:22.789> calories<00:06:23.180> need<00:06:23.360> to<00:06:23.449> be

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
accounted for and they appear to what

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:34.480 
accounted for and they appear to what
kind<00:06:26.990> of<00:06:27.050> boost<00:06:27.289> metabolism<00:06:28.449> such<00:06:29.449> that<00:06:33.490> we

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
kind of boost metabolism such that we

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.300 
kind of boost metabolism such that we
actually<00:06:34.640> burn<00:06:35.030> more<00:06:35.210> fat<00:06:35.750> kind<00:06:36.080> of

have old video about that whether it's

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.080 
have old video about that whether it's
because<00:06:43.960> the<00:06:44.290> polyphenols<00:06:45.130> these<00:06:45.400> wonderful

the<00:06:53.770> combination<00:06:54.610> you<00:06:54.820> add<00:06:55.360> up<00:06:55.570> all<00:06:55.720> these

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
the combination you add up all these

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.840 
the combination you add up all these
pieces<00:06:56.200> and<00:06:56.770> that's<00:06:57.280> the<00:06:57.490> hundred<00:06:57.790> percent

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
pieces and that's the hundred percent

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.950 
pieces and that's the hundred percent
calories<00:06:59.070> and<00:07:00.210> so<00:07:01.210> I<00:07:01.240> encourage<00:07:01.570> people<00:07:01.810> to

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
calories and so I encourage people to

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.110
