00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.780 
camera you can see the storm trooper is
in<00:01:43.259> perfect<00:01:43.680> focus<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> front<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.700> i

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
in perfect focus in the front now if i

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.399 
in perfect focus in the front now if i
type<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> background<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
type in the background it's going to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.450 
type in the background it's going to
make<00:01:46.500> everything<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> background<00:01:47.369> in

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
make everything in the background in

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.370 
make everything in the background in
focus<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> storm<00:01:48.990> trooper<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
focus and then the storm trooper is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
focus and then the storm trooper is
going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.860> focus<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.909> i<00:01:50.939> could<00:01:51.090> say

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
going to be out of focus so i could say

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.490 
going to be out of focus so i could say
it's<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.869> need<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.200> hold<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it's a bit like you need to hold it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.289 
it's a bit like you need to hold it
really<00:01:52.770> still<00:01:53.189> otherwise<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.210> going

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
really still otherwise that you're going

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.730 
really still otherwise that you're going
to<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:55.049> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> move

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
to see here it's going to kind of move

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.620 
to see here it's going to kind of move
the<00:01:55.920> picture<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.460> tightly<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.329> that's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the picture on so tightly because that's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.569 
the picture on so tightly because that's
kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.930> where<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.560> moved<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> actual

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
kind of where it moved on the actual

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.100 
kind of where it moved on the actual
image<00:01:59.939> itself<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:00.509> i<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.719> kind<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.960> holding

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
image itself when i was kind of holding

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
image itself when i was kind of holding
around<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.530> wiggle<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> phone<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.790> it's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
around the wiggle in the phone but it's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910 
around the wiggle in the phone but it's
kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.329> neat<00:02:04.079> design<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.590> terms<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
kind of a neat design in terms of the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.200 
kind of a neat design in terms of the
way<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.189> work<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.579> she<00:02:05.610> focused<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
way that a work so she focused on the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.119 
way that a work so she focused on the
background<00:02:06.390> focus<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> foreground<00:02:07.560> so

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
background focus on the foreground so

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.619 
background focus on the foreground so
it's<00:02:08.280> very<00:02:08.429> nice<00:02:08.640> long<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.239> hold<00:02:09.479> it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
it's very nice long so if you do hold it

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.910 
it's very nice long so if you do hold it
really<00:02:10.020> still<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.619> some<00:02:10.739> really

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
really still you can get some really

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.980 
really still you can get some really
nice<00:02:11.220> results<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:12.300> may<00:02:12.540> actually

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
nice results what may actually

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.450 
nice results what may actually
a<00:02:13.020> quick<00:02:13.320> look<00:02:13.500> edges<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> couple<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> some

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
a quick look edges a couple of some

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.400 
a quick look edges a couple of some
