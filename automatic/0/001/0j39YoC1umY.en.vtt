horizons and sort of show some variety
and<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.830> think<00:02:35.250> dead<00:02:36.030> rising<00:02:36.240> is<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.990> good<00:02:37.500> place

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
and I think dead rising is a good place

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.770 
and I think dead rising is a good place
to<00:02:37.860> start<00:02:38.070> it's<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.490> fun<00:02:38.700> game<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.570> little

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
night recording that

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.050 
night recording that
ten-minute<00:04:28.200> segment<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.190> had<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.640> stop<00:04:29.850> because

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
ten-minute segment I had to stop because

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.320 
ten-minute segment I had to stop because
my<00:04:30.450> game<00:04:30.630> went<00:04:30.870> load<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.740> next<00:04:32.010> point<00:04:32.220> but<00:04:32.550> it

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
my game went load the next point but it

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.610 
my game went load the next point but it
was<00:04:33.510> fun<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:34.080> was<00:04:34.230> like<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.700> live<00:04:35.700> action<00:04:36.620> you

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
was fun it was like a live action you

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.670 
was fun it was like a live action you
know<00:04:37.710> comedy<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.580> way<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.360> just<00:04:39.960> commentary

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
and I think that more suits my

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.920 
and I think that more suits my
personality<00:04:43.890> I<00:04:44.430> guess<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:45.600> know<00:04:45.720> live

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
personality I guess you know live

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.680

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.780 
commentary because this right now it's
obviously<00:04:49.290> not<00:04:49.380> live<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.310> just<00:04:50.520> have<00:04:50.670> to
