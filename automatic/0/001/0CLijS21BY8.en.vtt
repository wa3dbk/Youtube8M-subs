can still wear some really amazing crop
tops<00:03:53.330> that<00:03:53.570> are<00:03:53.660> available<00:03:53.810> there<00:03:54.320> at<00:03:54.410> the

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
tops that are available there at the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.810 
tops that are available there at the
moment<00:03:54.620> because<00:03:54.950> they're<00:03:55.070> quite<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> big<00:03:55.490> trend

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
moment because they're quite a big trend

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.640 
moment because they're quite a big trend
the<00:03:56.210> yes<00:03:56.420> so<00:03:56.600> it's<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:56.870> gold<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.440> black

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
the yes so it's like gold and black

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.160 
the yes so it's like gold and black
sparkles<00:03:58.460> and<00:03:59.300> then<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.600> thought<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.930> jeans

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
sparkles and then I thought the jeans

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.440 
sparkles and then I thought the jeans
would<00:04:00.320> go<00:04:00.470> really<00:04:00.770> nicely<00:04:01.040> together<00:04:01.490> so<00:04:02.240> it's

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
would go really nicely together so it's

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.350 
would go really nicely together so it's
kind<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:02.810> again<00:04:03.200> like<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.920> clashing<00:04:04.490> of<00:04:04.790> real

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
kind of again like the clashing of real

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.830 
kind of again like the clashing of real
sparkly<00:04:06.050> smart<00:04:06.950> glittery<00:04:07.490> and<00:04:07.910> then<00:04:08.360> kind<00:04:08.720> of

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
sparkly smart glittery and then kind of

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.930 
sparkly smart glittery and then kind of
the<00:04:08.900> coolness<00:04:09.410> from<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.710> jeans<00:04:09.980> I've<00:04:10.580> matched
