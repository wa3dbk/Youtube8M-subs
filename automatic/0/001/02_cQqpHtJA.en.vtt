00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
a very difficult year clearly we've been

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.200 
a very difficult year clearly we've been
running<00:06:22.800> out<00:06:23.070> old<00:06:23.310> models<00:06:23.640> and<00:06:23.880> we've<00:06:24.060> been

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
running out old models and we've been

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.280 
running out old models and we've been
launching<00:06:24.570> new<00:06:24.780> ones

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
launching new ones

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.860 
launching new ones
but<00:06:25.860> so<00:06:26.070> far<00:06:26.310> it<00:06:27.030> has<00:06:27.270> been<00:06:27.300> very<00:06:27.690> encouraging

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
but so far it has been very encouraging

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.530 
but so far it has been very encouraging
in<00:06:28.440> September<00:06:29.220> we<00:06:29.490> achieved<00:06:29.850> our<00:06:29.970> best<00:06:30.330> ever

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
in September we achieved our best ever

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.930 
in September we achieved our best ever
market<00:06:31.020> share<00:06:31.470> result<00:06:31.830> of<00:06:32.040> the<00:06:32.220> year<00:06:32.460> six

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
market share result of the year six

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.790 
market share result of the year six
percent<00:06:33.360> so<00:06:33.840> it<00:06:34.110> might<00:06:34.260> have<00:06:34.410> been<00:06:34.530> a<00:06:34.560> tough

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
percent so it might have been a tough

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.890 
percent so it might have been a tough
year<00:06:34.830> but<00:06:35.220> it's<00:06:35.460> becoming<00:06:35.820> a<00:06:35.970> very<00:06:36.000> successful

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
year but it's becoming a very successful
