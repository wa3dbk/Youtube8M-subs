clammer<00:00:09.450> circuit<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.309> just<00:00:11.309> use<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
clammer circuit and just use the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.310 
clammer circuit and just use the
oscillator<00:00:12.210> part<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.900> puts<00:00:13.139> out

three or four hundred volts into this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.049 
three or four hundred volts into this
thing<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:01.070> it's<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> build<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.879> in

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
thing here it's going to build up in

thing here it's going to build up in
that<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> start<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.159> up

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
that and that's going to start that up

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.830 
that and that's going to start that up
you<00:01:07.439> notice<00:01:07.830> there's<00:01:08.070> no<00:01:08.310> return<00:01:08.760> path<00:01:09.119> that's

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you notice there's no return path that's

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.100 
you notice there's no return path that's
going<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.830> wire<00:01:11.299> I've<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.780> bail

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
going on one wire I've got a little bail

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
going on one wire I've got a little bail
system<00:01:13.500> set<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> take

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
system set up here I'm going to take

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.320 
system set up here I'm going to take
this<00:01:15.509> off<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:16.340> just<00:01:17.340> turn<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.030> I'll

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
this off now just turn it off and I'll

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.370 
this off now just turn it off and I'll
shock<00:01:18.600> myself<00:01:20.780> now<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> start<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
shock myself now I'm going to start the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
shock myself now I'm going to start the
bail<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:27.270> notice<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> motor<00:01:27.869> speeds

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
bail up here you notice the motor speeds

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.060 
bail up here you notice the motor speeds
up<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:29.340> how<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.880> working<00:01:30.710> it's<00:01:31.710> very

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
up now how this is working it's very

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
up now how this is working it's very
very<00:01:32.400> interesting<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> high

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
very interesting this is the high

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.560 
very interesting this is the high
voltage<00:01:34.229> scenario<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.970> actually<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
voltage scenario there is actually a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.730 
voltage scenario there is actually a
return<00:01:37.079> path<00:01:37.670> through<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> paper<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.530> have

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
return path through the paper and I have

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.249 
return path through the paper and I have
a<00:01:40.770> wire<00:01:41.159> coming<00:01:41.880> off<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.329> board<00:01:42.630> down<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a wire coming off the board down to that

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.950 
a wire coming off the board down to that
paper<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> high<00:01:44.820> voltage<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> actually

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
paper so the high voltage is actually

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.289 
paper so the high voltage is actually
making<00:01:46.200> its<00:01:46.500> way<00:01:46.740> all<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.340> way<00:01:47.369> through<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
making its way all the way through and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.280 
making its way all the way through and
back<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.369> paper<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:52.140> is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
back with the paper and this is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
back with the paper and this is
something<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.710> I've<00:01:53.009> been<00:01:53.610> warned<00:01:54.060> about

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
something that I've been warned about

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
something that I've been warned about
building<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:54.990> electrostatic<00:01:55.740> devices<00:01:56.280> out<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
building my electrostatic devices out of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.280 
building my electrostatic devices out of
wood<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.600> when<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> high

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
wood because when you get the high

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.469 
wood because when you get the high
voltage<00:01:58.829> built<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.909> will<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.270> right

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
voltage built up that will go right

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.420 
voltage built up that will go right
through<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> wood<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.290> here's<00:02:01.799> an<00:02:01.920> example

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
through the wood and here's an example

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.209 
through the wood and here's an example
of<00:02:02.520> how<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.880> works<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:04.649> little<00:02:04.979> setup

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
of how it works and this little setup

of how it works and this little setup
here<00:02:05.579> runs<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.060> about<00:02:06.149> ten<00:02:06.600> minutes<00:02:07.399> ten<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
here runs for about ten minutes ten to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820 
here runs for about ten minutes ten to
fifteen<00:02:09.030> minutes<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> capacitor

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
fifteen minutes on that the capacitor

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.540 
fifteen minutes on that the capacitor
which<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:12.050> 2500

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
which is a 2500

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.720 
which is a 2500
volt<00:02:15.950> 560<00:02:16.950> picofarad<00:02:17.850> cap

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
volt 560 picofarad cap

now<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.910> little<00:02:21.150> driver<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:22.550> we<00:02:23.550> made<00:02:23.760> a

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
now this little driver we we made a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.720 
now this little driver we we made a
bunch<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.240> these<00:02:24.390> setups<00:02:24.930> years<00:02:25.500> ago<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.370> make

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
bunch of these setups years ago to make

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.520 
bunch of these setups years ago to make
lights<00:02:27.120> out<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.540> them<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.960> can<00:02:28.140> take<00:02:28.350> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
lights out of them and you can take this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.650 
lights out of them and you can take this
little<00:02:28.590> driver<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.420> make<00:02:30.630> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
little driver and you can make a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.170 
little driver and you can make a
fluorescent<00:02:31.320> light<00:02:31.470> out<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.940> bunch

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
fluorescent light out of it and a bunch

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.070 
fluorescent light out of it and a bunch
of<00:02:33.300> us<00:02:33.450> did<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:34.940> years<00:02:35.940> ago<00:02:36.300> but<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.630> problem

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
of us did this years ago but the problem

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.440 
of us did this years ago but the problem
is<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.560> about<00:02:37.890> 300<00:02:38.580> milliamps<00:02:38.970> out<00:02:39.360> of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
is it's not about 300 milliamps out of

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.300 
is it's not about 300 milliamps out of
that<00:02:39.570> double-a<00:02:39.960> battery<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.920> even<00:02:41.190> though

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
that double-a battery so even though

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.890 
that double-a battery so even though
it's<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.700> double-a<00:02:42.090> battery<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.660> still

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
it's just a double-a battery it's still

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.540 
it's just a double-a battery it's still
taken<00:02:43.230> quite<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.770> juice<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:44.160> do<00:02:44.340> that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
taken quite a bit of juice to do that

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.210 
taken quite a bit of juice to do that
but<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> tell<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.050> works<00:02:46.290> really<00:02:46.740> really

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
but I tell you it works really really

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.490 
but I tell you it works really really
good<00:02:47.460> on<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.760> setup<00:02:48.060> here<00:02:48.600> because<00:02:49.380> you

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
good on this setup here because you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.200 
good on this setup here because you
don't<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.920> run<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.430> very<00:02:50.670> long<00:02:50.730> you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
don't have to run it for very long you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.290 
don't have to run it for very long you
can<00:02:51.750> charge<00:02:52.050> up<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.290> capacitor<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:54.090> few

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
can charge up that capacitor and a few

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.330 
can charge up that capacitor and a few
seconds<00:02:54.840> off<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.920> many<00:02:56.160> many

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
seconds off that and do it many many

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.590 
seconds off that and do it many many
many<00:02:56.670> times<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:57.420> run<00:02:58.200> your<00:02:58.380> experiments<00:02:59.160> and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
many times to run your experiments and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.300 
many times to run your experiments and
of<00:03:00.600> course<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:01.020> you<00:03:01.170> string<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.710> chain<00:03:02.070> out

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
of course if you string that chain out

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.310 
of course if you string that chain out
further<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.940> keep<00:03:03.180> up<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> voltage<00:03:04.050> that

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
further you keep up on the voltage that

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.740 
further you keep up on the voltage that
it<00:03:04.800> gets<00:03:04.950> more<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.220> more<00:03:05.430> dangerous<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.420> like

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
it gets more and more dangerous so like

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.880 
it gets more and more dangerous so like
I<00:03:06.780> see<00:03:07.020> you'd<00:03:07.140> have<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.380> be<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:07.530> really

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
I see you'd have to be really really

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.670 
I see you'd have to be really really
careful<00:03:08.580> with<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.880> let<00:03:09.840> me<00:03:09.960> discharge<00:03:10.530> it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
careful with this let me discharge it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.770 
careful with this let me discharge it
I'll<00:03:10.800> show<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.160> what<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.310> mean<00:03:17.660> that's<00:03:18.660> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
I'll show you what I mean that's a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.260 
I'll show you what I mean that's a
pretty<00:03:18.989> big<00:03:19.200> jolt<00:03:19.560> folks<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.250> it'll<00:03:20.910> knock<00:03:21.090> it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
pretty big jolt folks and it'll knock it

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.570 
pretty big jolt folks and it'll knock it
for<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> loop<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.080> anyway<00:03:22.770> if<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.010> build<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:23.459> of

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
for a loop so anyway if you build one of

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.600 
for a loop so anyway if you build one of
these<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.660> careful<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.410> if<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.370> want<00:03:26.550> to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
these just be careful and if you want to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.250 
these just be careful and if you want to
know<00:03:26.670> how<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.880> build<00:03:27.209> one<00:03:27.450> do<00:03:27.690> some<00:03:27.900> research

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
know how to build one do some research

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.810 
know how to build one do some research
on<00:03:28.470> your<00:03:28.500> own<00:03:28.680> I'm<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.010> going<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.430> do<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.550> how-to
