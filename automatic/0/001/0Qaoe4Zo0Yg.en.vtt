00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
can't judge it but it seems like a

as a sniper can't be that much of
aggressive<00:04:41.220> with<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.370> sniper<00:04:41.669> in<00:04:41.760> this<00:04:41.910> game

aggressive with a sniper in this game

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.210 
aggressive with a sniper in this game
and<00:04:42.480> call<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.840> duty<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.110> what<00:04:43.260> not<00:04:43.410> see<00:04:44.040> that's

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220

way too repetitive and I think that game

way too repetitive and I think that game
reminds<00:04:47.700> me<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:47.930> call<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:48.960> duty<00:04:49.320> in<00:04:49.350> some<00:04:49.800> ways

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
reminds me of call of duty in some ways
