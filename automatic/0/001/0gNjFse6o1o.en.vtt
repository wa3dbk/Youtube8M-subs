00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
it using the tap technique then you can

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.630 
it using the tap technique then you can
learn<00:01:18.079> how<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.290> do<00:01:18.530> all<00:01:18.829> of<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.430> just

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
learn how to do all of this and just

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.100 
learn how to do all of this and just
imagine<00:01:20.119> what<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.420> would<00:01:20.540> paint<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.990> you

could paint anywhere scape in minutes

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.600 
could paint anywhere scape in minutes
and<00:01:24.200> then<00:01:24.409> we're<00:01:24.500> gonna<00:01:24.590> move<00:01:24.799> on<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.340> hit<00:01:25.490> our

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
and then we're gonna move on and hit our

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.760 
and then we're gonna move on and hit our
toe<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:25.939> going<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.420> go<00:01:27.229> back<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.530> some<00:01:27.740> basics

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
toe is going to go back to some basics

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.240 
toe is going to go back to some basics
about<00:01:28.430> planet<00:01:29.649> creation<00:01:30.649> and<00:01:30.890> planet

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
ways that you can make planets and he's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.600 
ways that you can make planets and he's
gonna<00:01:35.930> go<00:01:36.110> over<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.829> talk<00:01:37.159> about<00:01:37.430> all

really<00:01:45.770> gorgeous<00:01:46.280> looking<00:01:46.549> planets<00:01:47.060> they

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
really gorgeous looking planets they

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.149 
really gorgeous looking planets they
look<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.140> beautiful<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.710> he<00:01:48.799> knows<00:01:48.950> how<00:01:49.100> to
