00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:04.040
 coasts 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.690
 Friar who continues to stand out for making quality works in neighborhoods 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.069
 where it is needed most 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.099
 in the biennial of Colombian architecture held in Cartagena 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.630
 the constructions stole all eyes being the city protagonist of 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 the new urban trends 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.269
 protest 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.399
 The biennial of Colombian architecture is an event coordinated and organized by 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.710
 the merchants themselves 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 it is a biannual call 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.300
 projects but the field of urban architecture 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.590
 have any any significant relevance and have been presented to the 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.260
 convocation of the same 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.910
 two 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.340
 tusk 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.870
 we present 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.900
 the comprehensive bill of the northeastern zone 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.620
 in the category of territorial ordering and was the national prize of 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.460
 architecture in that category 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.790
 It's very important because you see an urban management model 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.800
 for neighborhoods in which 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.490
 the difficulties in their growth group led them to have problems I made a 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.480
 little this model tried to compensate for that difficulty 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.570
 the urban project of the northeastern zone also galibier some 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.860
 basic deficiencies in these neighborhoods stood out for doing it with wit and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.440
 aesthetic since architectural works stand out like the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.880
 library park spain 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.440
 the bridges that connect sectors and the public space around the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.439
 metrocable 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.720
 finally the carabobo passage 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.870
 I think that the category of urban design projects as Eurovision of 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.590
 Homer as honorable mention 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.060
 all those nine months of the year 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.250
 for the holy lottery sunday 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.420
 for the lpga san javier 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.429
 for high school 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.959
 for in the square of silence 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.100
 of the public library pilot 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.149
 and some other more particular areas 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.579
 It is very important to highlight the large amount of 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.269
 works of the city 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.870
 who the framework of this biennial gave relevance to the production 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.079
 architectural and urban 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.079
 so much 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.269
 we are still working on the integral project of this model 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.199
 of management that we have applied 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.339
 already in the northeastern commune we have been working for a couple of years in 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:49.019
 the commune 13 and we will continue in the commune centroriental antillÃ³n the commune 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.749
 Northwest around the Latin culture 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.819
 also those new constructions like the quality schools more 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.120
 supporters of almost five hundred homes 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.140
 all this as part of the process in a city of architectural innovation 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.260
 shows that in Medellin, Barcelona
