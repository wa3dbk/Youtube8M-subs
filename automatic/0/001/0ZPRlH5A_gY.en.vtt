00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.680
 one of the most common mistakes that 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.719
 we commit when buying a 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.309
 camera is to worry more 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.760
 by the body of it that by the lens 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.650
 what he brings 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.420
 we look for cameras with a large number of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.260
 functions and we forgot to ask 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.260
 how is your goal 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.230
 look at the function of an objective in a 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.910
 camera is to define the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.220
 image about the negative if you have 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.630
 analog camera or on the ctt yes 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.880
 you have a digital camera 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.320
 the better the lens the more quality 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 will have in your photographs 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.770
 regardless of the camera model 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.970
 what you have and what you have paid 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.740
 for her 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.780
 the objective is one of those responsible 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.850
 most direct of the will emit an image 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.330
 something that is greatly valued in 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.330
 Photography 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.329
 the best thing when buying a camera is 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.090
 hold a season with the goal 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.770
 what it brings and then later 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.480
 replace it with one of higher quality or 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.370
 if it's not going to be done only with the body and 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.720
 buy the goal apart this 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.320
 possibility offered by many 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.320
 manufacturers 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.410
 attending to its focal the objectives is 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.290
 say the photographic optics are 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.790
 they divide into three large objective groups 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.150
 whose angle of view in a scene 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.000
 reaches between 60 and 85 degrees 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.170
 we will call wide angle is 35 mm 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.170
 or less focal 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.560
 targets whose angle of view in a 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.260
 scene round 45 degrees the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.060
 we will call the standard objectives 50 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.979
 millimeters of focal 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.860
 and objective is whose angle of vision 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.890
 reaches between 35 and 8 degrees 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.430
 we will call telephoto lenses 70 millimeters or 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.430
 more of focal 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.770
 let's do the following experiment 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.380
 we will place our camera on a tripod 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.969
 and framing we have a scene let's go 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.399
 changing objectives and move from 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.049
 site for more comfort varying the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.079
 focal of our zoom that is exactly 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.099
 the same we will see what happens 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.539
 let's place first a big 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.539
 angular and look at the image 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.519
 the angle of capture is very wide but the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.519
 objects look very far away 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.720
 now let's put a standard lens 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.780
 the angle of vision has been reduced and 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.780
 objects do not seem so far away 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.390
 finally a telephoto or a tele 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.019
 as it is known in the long 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.019
 photographic 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.030
 what is the difference between the angle of 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.189
 vision is greatly reduced we see a lot 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.989
 less scene but the objects are very 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.989
 next and they seem larger 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.069
 as you see the different focus of 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.020
 our goals will allow us 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.459
 very different interpretations of the 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.459
 scene that we intend to photograph 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.840
 let's get to know them a little better 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.510
 wide angle lenses the most 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.370
 used are 24 mm on 28 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.370
 millimeters and 35 mm 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.209
 besides that great angle of vision in 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.190
 normal conditions give a lot 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.760
 Depth of field almost everything out 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.319
 sharp 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.730
 although the objects seem smaller 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.090
 and away from us as we have already 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.090
 viewed 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.310
 they are quite bright objectives with 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.730
 openings that can reach up to 0 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.730
 with 8 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.130
 psychologically transmit feeling of 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.320
 amplitude in addition to a wide-angle 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.300
 produces such a sense of realism that you 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.470
 get inside the image especially if 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.300
 we incorporate an element in the foreground 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.920
 They are ideal for photographing in 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.080
 interiors or places where you can not 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.350
 go back and you need to cover it almost 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.350
 all 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.900
 streets rooms closed enclosures 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.239
 for architectural photography houses 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.769
 monuments buildings although they provoke a 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.450
 characteristic line distortion 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.430
 it seems that these fall inwards 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.730
 especially if we get very close to 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.730
 object 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.550
 but its great theme without a doubt is 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.470
 the landscape since they were a broad 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.950
 record of it and at the same time a large 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.600
 sharpness throughout the entire scene 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.340
 the strength and realism with which 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.690
 show this kind of images is not 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.690
 achieved for no other purpose 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.320
 the standard objective is usually unique 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.320
 50 mm 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.440
 It is a goal of great quality 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.120
 especially the fixed focal 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.400
 has long been the goal 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.200
 favorite of photographers as well as 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.190
 the manufacturers that included it as standard 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.190
 their cameras 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.070
 have a viewing angle that remembers 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.350
 much to the human eye so it does not 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.300
 causes distortion of lines does not produce 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.980
 images too spectacular but 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.080
 forces the photographer to move around a lot to 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.430
 look for the photo in this way you can 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.430
 serve for almost all situations 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.940
 its excellent brightness efe 1.8 1.4 o 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.460
 even 1 make it the goal 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.229
 ideal for photographing in sunsets and 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.229
 other situations where there is very little light 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:25.910
 telephoto lenses called also he is the 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:28.620
 most used are 70 the 135 the 200 and 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.570
 300 mm 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.100
 these very voluminous objectives the 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.840
 most of them have an angle of 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.430
 very small vision but allow us 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.790
 zoom the image of the objects towards 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.790
 we 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.729
 they also force us to concentrate on 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.729
 very specific parts of the scene 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.590
 are usually not very bright except for those 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.240
 high-end are ideal for making 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.190
 selective approaches and by compressing the 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.520
 perspective of the planes stun the 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.520
 image 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.230
 They are mainly used for 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.190
 photograph from far places of 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.110
 difficult access 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.500
 shows sports themes with about 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.500
 wild 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.780
 for detail photography 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.939
 we will learn as in photography many 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.020
 Sometimes it is more interesting to take a part 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:15.020
 that the whole of an object 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.910
 and how not to practice the portrait its 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.860
 great topic and certainly for most 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.420
 professionals the star theme of the 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.770
 photograph which we will see in 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.770
 more later
