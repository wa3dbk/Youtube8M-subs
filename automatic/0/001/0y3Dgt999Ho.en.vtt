00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 We continue with the incidents in the 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.790
 roads because today we have known a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.189
 shuddering fact nothing less than 23 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.530
 horses and mules has died this year the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.330
 pilgrimage of the dew well by starvation by 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.219
 difficult due to dehydration or 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 fatigue these animals have 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.690
 faint despite the continuous 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.550
 recommendations to take care of them are 23 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.320
 He looked dead but be sure the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.900
 blocks in sorry conditions now 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.789
 this is angels and to recover it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.220
 recommends rest a good 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.289
 feeding and drinking especially a lot 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.120
 water all this is essential if 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.900
 we want the end of your path to be 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.480
 the block and not the incinerator 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.390
 24,000 horses like these have been given 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.550
 appointment this year in the pilgrimage of the dew 23 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.010
 of them all have died for a 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.840
 excessive physical effort the horses 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.850
 during the year they are quite inactive 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.010
 people use them only for purposes of 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.290
 week loose days and the dew comes and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.080
 within 45 days of dew them 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.140
 they submit to physical efforts as very very 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.640
 high animal workouts respond 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.620
 well with organic failures and a lot of 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.750
 they cause death, abuse 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.760
 abandon and sacrifice those in a way 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.950
 inadequate are the main abuses 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.860
 that are committed against these animals 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.910
 as he found some cases of abandonment 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.560
 of sick animals that have been 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.790
 abandoned in particular some in the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.210
 beaches of the national park of doñana 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.040
 luck be luck we completely live 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.970
 has to sacrifice it some other of 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.920
 animal abuse of jockeys who beat 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.050
 the horses proved to intervene for 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.970
 make any reports the reports have 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.710
 been sent to the civil guard for 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.720
 act accordingly 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.490
 yesterday they were removed from the park 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.380
 national of doñana five horses 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.210
 dead when they call us for animal 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.800
 dead we go we have to 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.540
 find out the cause of death 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.830
 see that there is no problem 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.180
 infectious that could lead to 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.590
 half measures apart and then with 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.380
 Subsequent not what we do is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.020
 move the animals to an area outside 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.970
 from the village of El Rocío where they accumulate 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.070
 until the end of the day and every day 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.140
 in the afternoon a truck collects in 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.320
 collect the vats with the animals 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.940
 dead and taken in an incinerator 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.680
 in these containers are transported 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.660
 from the village to the incinerator of 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.820
 Osuna here are responsible for eliminating their 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.830
 remains the most worrying thing is that all 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.200
 the years receive the same number of 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.700
 corpses a slight increase but very 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.390
 little bit about what is going 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.550
 normal every year with the pilgrimage of the dew 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.410
 a sad ending that could be avoided is 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.420
 fundamental to train the horses 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.190
 before embarking on the road to 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.110
 dew what they have to do is go 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.780
 putting the horse a little activity to 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.300
 little so that the effort that during the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.890
 dew not be not at once and once 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.450
 that are already there and when it is there and 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.160
 especially water supply especially in 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.380
 hot days how are you doing these 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.959
 days an abundant water supply and a 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.470
 adequate food and especially let 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.020
 rest to the horse 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.970
 every certain time of activity during 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.700
 the way you have to check the status 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.770
 of the horse as it is known to the naked eye 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.830
 if a horse is tired well what 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.830
 First 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.570
 we did not know the mucous membrane of the mouth 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.340
 Hydrated capillary is correct after 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.100
 we look at the hydration of the horse 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.790
 checking the skin the natural skin is 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.000
 important breathing 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.950
 and finally the general attitude of the horse 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.200
 during the pilgrimage the horses are 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.780
 submitted to a physical effort that leaves 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.910
 sequels a good feeding rest 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.250
 and hydration are the main 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.050
 care that you have to provide them 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.030
 I recommend once they arrive and 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.740
 horses to his stable to retrieve them 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.020
 after the dew men coming 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.420
 just tired because he has 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.550
 rest and good nutrition in the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.110
 foot you get water already different if well 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.940
 in short dehydrated with the one that has 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.600
 certified beneficiary 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.820
 the horse we have treatments 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.100
 veterinarians so that the 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.500
 horses do not pay a high price to go 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.200
 to the dew this has been the end of 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.790
 path for 23 of them that only 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.790
 they tried to serve their owners
