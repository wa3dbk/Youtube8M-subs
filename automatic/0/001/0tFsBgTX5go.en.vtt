00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.750
 what gc and theme of the tree with a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.460
 there was a very early update 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.410
 problems with the huntsman crate her 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.279
 knows the thing where this really great 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 things like the xm 10 14 gave the car 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:27.810
 pump as even the p90 was helping 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.939
 before the you see the 90 years exactly 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.940
 this gate ahead and you know 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.050
 and of course the mph four hole 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.680
 orders the 4 foul 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.300
 the interesting thing is this hall and so on 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.149
 it does not exist the same way anymore 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 a usb sos ps3 does not exist so 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.969
 are crates can be pulled or 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.300
 a pina surfer or a cz 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.379
 75 poison dart this is no longer possible 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.610
 you have seen that completely 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.530
 problems with these weapons gives that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.090
 means the makers must yes before 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.570
 tick the Post they have indeed 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.100
 say this is my work 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.390
 I did not steal that have it 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 is and the people in the skin 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 example have uploaded this as yours 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.119
 design but it was not all 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.189
 and the community has not 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.360
 reported it came out now that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.490
 which should have made the glass itself 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 was stolen so what it spends it with 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.659
 the people who have all the skins 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.930
 except for the pure and similar to them 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.060
 however, are available in your inventory 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.799
 it is an exception to the owl 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.479
 skin was redesigned by cisco 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.490
 The I show you is I 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.060
 you namely indeed the looks you see 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.770
 and stands m4 foul contraband content 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.810
 filter rifle that existed before 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.840
 not that is something very special 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 Below is the color here from the field 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.790
 We're going to examine those who see now 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.829
 so off the skin 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.460
 I think this thing is worth a lot 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.020
 be because the skin is so in the sense of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.790
 eat original condition as we do 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.649
 can not get to know the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.149
 skin is no longer possible because the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.259
 came out due to the copyright 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.030
 problems and, interestingly, the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.890
 I will not topped here so 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.299
 the way she looks can be topped 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.479
 it can only be people who own a house 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.250
 owns the food you can have so 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.090
 got as a substitute and that is 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.030
 that can become 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.260
 very much worth the thing but 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.580
 first look what new skins in 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.319
 the huntsman box is in it as I said 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.940
 copied problems and in it is on all 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.290
 cases the us psk one looks very cool like 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.790
 said the ura i am now on the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.080
 Weapons crates went there 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.690
 no longer in the dior a similar 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.099
 it seems that there is something in it 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.260
 So we have problems here too 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:36.629
 that's not normal then we have 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.150
 here the strike therefore recommends that 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.870
 the set for the hole I do not know 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.260
 So little perspective of the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.840
 from now on the very simple one 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.610
 I would like geometric design now 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.329
 do not throw away the thing but me 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.879
 also does not look nice 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.470
 then we have the p90 module so if you 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.190
 the weapon game does not play often 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.910
 but has something and then we have those here 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.769
 p 2000 ps the 2004 we would have a lot 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.310
 like because the cool out I have patrick 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.769
 m 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.190
 but the protestant name tag on it 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.519
 turn the pop rostow please do that 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.250
 No 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.540
 and then here we have the mac capital 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.530
 stage it makes me wonder with 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.530
 the actors do not play changeable and the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.910
 cz 570 euro twist we are actually 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.599
 also quite this very cool from the 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.730
 I like it 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.620
 and, of course, the rolling ones too 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.389
 Stones thick overworked because the up 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.079
 Corporate business figures for this is 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.940
 now in the pillow incomes of the comb 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:43.349
 of the fight cool pocket barbecue 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.500
 quite funny and stretches that is funny 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:51.299
 this sticker we will rec rec 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.849

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.359
 if that's interested yes that was it 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.549
 actually an opening I know that 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.870
 do as I said you need only to the 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.730
 team market then go peep you at times 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.250
 the huntsman boxes rat off because you see 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.739

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.739
 all I that the ears lack the 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:16.290
 the foul lacks the p90's goal 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:18.600
 do not miss that 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.080
