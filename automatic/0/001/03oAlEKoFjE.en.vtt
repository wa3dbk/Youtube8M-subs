00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.259
 comex masters the best against the 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.259
 better we start 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.280
 welcome to this segment master comes 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.980
 the best against the best in this 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.259
 Occasion we say hello in spine joseph ramón 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.040
 fernández commentator of that chain 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:27.730
 how are you ramón things 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.770
 to leave for you there is some culprit of 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 the elimination of mexico the soccer players 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.970
 the technician what do you think of the elimination 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.980
 it depends what you call it guilty 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.330
 guilty was I believe that the whole process 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.510
 of the national team foresaw the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.800
 worldwide and it was shown that in about 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.750
 how many months can you prepare a 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.180
 team if there was time to prepare it 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.890
 in four years it would be more competitive 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.900
 team and I would have more options and about 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.150
 all more arguments to avoid what 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.010
 happened to him against Holland to handle a 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.510
 mexican party 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.150
 in some games and we've seen it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.340
 against bulgaria in several matches 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.350
 important world cup when they are 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.410
 decisive matches against Germany in 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.910
 1998 as a bridge costs work to manage 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.770
 the favorable result 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.300
 mexico was 10 above holland 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.550
 holland is a soft power came from 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.110
 thrashing the world champion holland is 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.880
 a world champion holland has with 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.520
 players and they could never stop 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.259
 robben and if marquez does not stick his foot in 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.509
 nothing happens rubén falls and the referee does not 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.820
 brand nothing sticks your foot in the foot 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.009
 robben takes advantage and as they had already 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.660
 forgiven one the habit whistles the second 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.130
 and they beat him in two in two three four 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.530
 minutes he goes around the game I 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.030
 I think the process is guilty today 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.350
 I come here has justino here close 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.869
 from the hotel and chatted with the one who arrived 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.710
 of strength and he said quietly 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.720
 He said 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 is that if we beat him yesterday we are at 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.680
 point of winning at costa rica we beat him 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.280
 and we go to the final of the world cup 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.170
 that is, let's go and let's go and let's go 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.700
 interesting for managers but if 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.610
 managers do not plan well football 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.470
 Mexican do not avoid so much foreigner 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.659
 allow Mexican players to come out 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.090
 more europe and soccer fogueen 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.610
 Mexican will continue to get stuck in that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.950
 famous fourth party we carry six 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.259
 consecutive world we stayed 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.420
 there I do not agree on the reduction 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.890
 of foreigners I agree in 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.630
 you have to work a lot I'm from 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.480
 I agree that something happens but I do 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 liked this selection and I do not think 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.650
 the process was guilty I think it was 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.540
 they make mistakes yesterday and cast blame between the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.310
 technical and the players because you 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.989
 played Holland well because you had the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.150
 controlled party because he got a 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.560
 goal and suddenly missing 25 minutes the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.140
 team was thrown back when they do the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.330
 change of giovanni inexplicably 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.040
 they throw back and I think that's 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.080
 the cause of the lack of control of the equipment 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.250
 because it started to grow in Holland began to 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.230
 holland to grow began to holland to 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.790
 grow up and they won us the match they do not 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.950
 they forgive and we do forgive 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.260
 exactly raul you know that when 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.569
 Mexico stops attacking or stops driving 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.430
 the match allows a rival the 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.200
 power of holland that comes to put 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.939
 many team goal goals 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.530
 important will the party handle you 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.049
 is going to overpower you is going to look for 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.250
 plays and plays them very well with loom 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.260
 it's a big change 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.090
 snyder is a great shooter rob us is 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.689
 the best player in the game acts very 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.950
 well and when the fifa shows the cardboard 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.409
 that ochoa is the best game of the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.810
 party means that as happened with 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.120
 brazil mexico played well handled well 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.250
 in some matches better in others but 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.200
 he missed the step the usual step and 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.120
 that step I do not know when it's going to happen when 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.799
 there is that correct process that there is not 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.989
 interruptions that you keep the 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.609
 technician that lasts four years that integrates 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.689
 well to the players that come out more 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.299
 foreign players 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.470
 the valence is understood to see here 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.120
 understand that see why here 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.230
 they made mistakes in a court of 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.419
 game that do not have to do with the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.579
 process the ideal would be to do it proceed 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.169
 right because they commit us not 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.020
 see action of the man most audience was 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.910
 marquez 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:54.250
 good marquez has made mistakes very 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.110
 serious in the list if I'm not 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.940
 agreement with you and if it is a pity that we 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.220
 we come back to stay something happens that no 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.370
 we managed to pass on seasoning in that we will be 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.690
 okay then we should 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.540
 make it if robben will play for mexico 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.010
 the best robben 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.220
 that's what we have there is that 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.590
 making them would be excellent but 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.470
 meanwhile what is a reality is 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.790
 yesterday the match was winnable now if 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.280
 we 're going to history was winnable 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.020
 against germany if we go was against 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.550
 vulnerable against germany was winnable 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.450
 against holland but if I knew 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.450
 round then 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.050
 when you do not re where you do a job 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.390
 Bayern short ears not 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.540
 rounded off the job and you went in the 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:43.060
 last minute with two to one very sad 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:45.130
 very forceful with Algeria Algiers and you 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.260
 gives a great game and does not forgive German and 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.260
 we beat him good come on let's go with another 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.120
 let's go with another topic let's go now 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.460
 is for you this is the best selection 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.330
 that we had the one that competed here in 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.160
 Brazil good is a good selection yes 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.720
 I think it's very good but to me 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.550
 it seems that the 98 of lapuente played 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.600
 good to football also for everyone with 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.490
 germany with holland already in match 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.440
 score points but lost with 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.880
 Germany dramatically I liked it a lot 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.550
 the selection of confederations that do not 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.260
 it was the world cup of 2005 and I liked it 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.410
 also from germany playing against 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.350
 Argentina of 2006 but this selection 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.720
 he played quite well against brazil very 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.720
 defensive so much so that ochoa took out everything 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.590
 what he could do well with croatia 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.010
 managed the game with Holland and what 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.780
 lost for lack of experience and declared 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.880
 which is a great selection hopefully 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.590
 there is a good basis for the next one that 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.490
 keep working but we can not forget 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.020
 other elections 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.120
 this is the one that has most connected with the 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.090
 people and that I'm clear something else thing 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.949
 ramón 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.990
 Well, nothing more than people need that 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.550
 that connect you and people today will have 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.320
 to go to work and forget that I 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.680
 I'm out of the world how are you going to put 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.680
 so many 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.680
 I'm not happy because I lost 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.750
 doctor 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.099
 I would have liked him to win but what 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.770
 I 'm not happy with the respite 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.180
 will mark robben and when it will not be unchecked 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.490
 a player of international stature 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.020
 robben international great player 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.340
 high quality large capacity 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.710
 talent that has played in real madrid 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.970
 the bayern mentions Dutch team and 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.490
 when you robben you have the worst 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.000
 dangers I knew three colors back the 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.800
 democracy arena robben 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.240
 thanks to the master comics the 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.240
 better against the best 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:40.569
 this was comics masters the best 30 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.569
 the best
