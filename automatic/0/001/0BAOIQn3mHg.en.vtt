00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
pear shape I don't know why there is

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
pear shape I don't know why there is
something<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.440> their<00:00:46.649> foundations<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.280> just

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
something in their foundations that just

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.630 
something in their foundations that just
really<00:00:48.000> don't<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.649> that's<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.250> my

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
really don't like me but that's just my

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.430 
really don't like me but that's just my
skin<00:00:50.700> reaction<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> did<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.170> through<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
skin reaction so I did go through the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160 
skin reaction so I did go through the
trouble<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.949> wearing<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.510> eight

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
trouble of wearing this for about eight

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.290 
trouble of wearing this for about eight
nine<00:00:55.440> could<00:00:56.219> even<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.640> ten<00:00:56.850> days<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> know

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
nine could even be ten days but I know

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.150 
nine could even be ten days but I know
it<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.600> definitely<00:00:57.780> way<00:00:58.260> over<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> week<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it was definitely way over a week and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.180 
it was definitely way over a week and
whatever<00:00:59.309> week<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.030> me<00:01:00.149> nine<00:01:00.629> days<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.079> sure

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
whatever week for me nine days for sure

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.979 
whatever week for me nine days for sure
so<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.399> does<00:01:02.850> come<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> doe<00:01:03.930> foot

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so this does come with a doe foot

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.130 
so this does come with a doe foot

instead of applying it all over multiple

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.590 
instead of applying it all over multiple
times<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.899> layer<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.500> two<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
idea behind that I have built this up to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.690 
idea behind that I have built this up to
two<00:01:48.750> layers<00:01:49.049> which<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.950> maximum

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
two layers which is then like maximum

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.999 
two layers which is then like maximum
coverage<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.509> very<00:01:51.750> full<00:01:52.079> coverage<00:01:52.110> it

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
was not that it was too heavy feeling it

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.150

it's very full coverage which is kind of

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.380 
it's very full coverage which is kind of
weird<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.100> did<00:04:08.250> expect<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.820> feel<00:04:08.940> very<00:04:09.209> heavy

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
use either no I don't think it will work

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.990 
use either no I don't think it will work
I<00:04:34.690> mean<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:34.960> also<00:04:35.170> does<00:04:35.920> oxidize<00:04:36.220> that's<00:04:36.880> why

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
I mean this also does oxidize that's why

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.600 
I mean this also does oxidize that's why
I<00:04:37.030> say<00:04:37.360> for<00:04:37.390> oily<00:04:37.840> skin<00:04:38.110> as<00:04:38.230> well<00:04:38.350> stable<00:04:38.950> my

is probably my rash coming through as

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.860 
is probably my rash coming through as
well<00:04:48.430> but<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:48.730> does<00:04:48.850> oxidize<00:04:49.120> into<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:49.780> bit

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
well but it does oxidize into that bit

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.700 
well but it does oxidize into that bit
of<00:04:49.960> orange<00:04:50.320> shade<00:04:50.680> as<00:04:50.860> well<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:51.310> overall

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710
