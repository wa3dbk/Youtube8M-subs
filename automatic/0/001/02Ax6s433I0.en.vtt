00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:10.170
 let's see what's in here milk 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.759
 the vegetable steaks eggs what 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.710
 it is lacking in the habit of seeing 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 finally signing the photographs do not 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.570
 no one signs but what a pity I do not 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.859
 I know that though I read a 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.539
 book of an author that I like and want 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.010
 to know that with the author because then I go 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.019
 to retrieve the rest of the things he has 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.710
 written I read it very willingly 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.869
 or if there is music of beautiful music 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.030
 I love those radios that do and don't 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.950
 they do it in many though they introduce 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.750
 a piece of music and then you get a little 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.370
 late even when it is over 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.379
 introduce they tell you it was the group 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.550
 the artist is so you go to catch them 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.750
 instead photography is not customary 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.850
 but what the heck means is not 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.800
 customary the consiplines is not one 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.890
 unchangeable thing we are there 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.059
 the imprint in the refrigerator to use as 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 custom is the effect of things that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.559
 let us take the actions we perform 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.420
 We then it is for that reason that if there 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.920
 they are journalists they should do 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.210
 information does not 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 if there are portals they should 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.460
 giving directions do not give it well 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.799
 let's ask us then if we are interested and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.909
 we are interested in knowing who made some 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.380
 nice things because we still want to 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.220
 review those beautiful things we can 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.470
 to know who the author is and we ask for it 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 writes take data from the colophon 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.580
 of the magazine you will find the data in the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.210
 portal contacts it takes a 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.799
 minutino but losing p minutes ads 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.090
 fuck on youtube to see these 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.189
 beyond what it would take for 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.329
 write an email and independently 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.950
 by the fact that you are a photographer 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.140
 professional and therefore clearly there 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.790
 keep or an amateur also cares for us 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.530
 for that but also if you are a person 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.780
 who wants to understand that he wants to understand that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.200
 who has around who did what for 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.360
 because you have to find it again and not 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.920
 to stand there with a scamorza wait for that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.259
 the custom is applied which 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.630
 others have decided well in all of these 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.520
 cases we write we write in many e 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.409
 when it will pass on these communicators 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.659
 feeling the perception because things 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.549
 they are so interested in knowing who has 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.560
 done something beautiful that it is then 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.119
 the author of the images well when 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.450
 will pass this information then 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.009
 things will start to change 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.140
 and we can make them change we can do 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.690
 change habits hi to one thing 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.890
 maybe they also let others know about it 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.010
 roda characters 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.010
 Hello
