00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 autoradio and sportbox.ru portal 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.290
 I present the time of the sport to the author to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello friends hello this time 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.280
 sports sports shows which goes to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.990
 with the support of the sportbox.ru portal 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.090
 studios are still Sergey Krasnov and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.930
 zakhar as well as editor of the portal f1news.ru 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 auto racing commentator alexander 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.340
 wild boars and we speak naturally 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.890
 formula-1 alexander hello 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 master pro petrova really want to ask 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.239
 I can not wear all the expectations were 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.160
 much more than what we 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.489
 got pogrom on the output 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 last season a pr was a colossal 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 the children met him in schools and as year on 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.840
 my South Korean or Chinese 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.800
 leader flowers brought to the game 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 invited myself 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.170
 open classes he conducted and so on 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.930
 please tell me there is a bomb 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.110
 which revolves around lime vitalia 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.020
 Petrov and the result which does not have 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.680
 and in general its meaning is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.920
 Equally, I am certainly the role of Petrov in 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.229
 Russia and the world are not equally understandable 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 us it is consistent yuri gagarin which 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.920
 the first to get there scintilla even 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.570
 rose to the podium well for the whole world 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.310
 which is already half an hour the third year the myth 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.930
 formula-1 of course this is certainly interesting 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.090
 one more country here was poland 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.799
 Czech Republic Ging and now Russia is there 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.780
 Malaysia is generally different all sorts of parties 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.400
 replenish the family but they have their own there 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.350
 recognized favorites country with the richest 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.750
 racing history and of course there is vital 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.080
 they understand you somewhat differently if in 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.230
 last year 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.550
 I've been thinking what taxes to bring 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.620
 vitalia can say so here's the first year 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.140
 10 then comes Formula 1 and its 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.330
 throw rocks into rough sea waters give 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.610
 malik lifebuoy enough , learn 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.680
 swim and he inhales there floundering 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.420
 before flies wrong submit taxies but 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.090
 like something I learned at the end there even 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.980
 alonso overcame the finish line passes winter 2 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 season he already gained experience 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.050
 in this trying to start a stormy sea 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.060
 somehow we cope with the elements and suddenly 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.679
 it turns out that in the winter in the rally 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.450
 accident in a severe accident hits him 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.670
 mate robert kubits team leader 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.860
 Renault then is broken turns into 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.180
 her games can go through such taxes that 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.830
 he is taken to a lifeline in this 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.050
 the sea gives a little dumbbell 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.760
 kilograms at 816 so you know how 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.190
 swim in a plumb dumbbell boiler rake 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.130
 command of the form of forward such an experience vitali 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.910
 of course it was not very difficult 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.050
 the team decided on risky 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.310
 technical experiment they are there 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.470
 tried one very tricky 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.690
 a system that initially shines on 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.880
 job third place mossy at start a 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.100
 then it turned out that it is unstable 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.020
 not amenable to force modification 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.030
 improvement and rivals went ahead and 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.580
 speak for the year well what vitalis 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.840
 diretide and when itâ€™s not good swimming 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.580
 we would probably like ours 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.140
 cooperation as it probably for a while 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.150
 set aside or draw a line under it and 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.860
 despite a two year contract it 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.500
 send 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.900
 relatively speaking for the door well, moral 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.760
 aside, let's leave aside 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.800
 formula 1 there when millions of dollars up 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.769
 I give you morality 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.140
 shifted income back why I asked 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.410
 don't you think that if you separate 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.060
 Mrs. Kosachenko and managers 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.000
 and Italy itself for a certain 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.769
 the amount of time it has 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.250
 I think Vitali is just a lot of very 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.019
 distracted directly from racing on 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.849
 all sorts of PR actions 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.830
 which suits him natural 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.720
 I now have acute program went I 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.569
 love it yes it is interesting topic i would 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.519
 said that when sebastian vettel 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.420
 won his first title in tenth year 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.310
 he renewed contracts red bull and one 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.590
 of the key issues in this contract 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.269
 world champion little youngest pilot 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.880
 about, too, rampant in which vbuhano 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.500
 a huge amount of money was involved in 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.989
 sponsorship events he said guys 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.549
 of brothers i can't so much that is 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.500
 even world champions even the best pilots 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.099
 formulas-1 of forced to work out their 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.579
 contracts 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.220
 it is clear there is a different mentality in our 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.280
 same as not cool but the man grew up 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.799
 our I on our lands, the public is aware 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.220
 as an athlete one of the journalists and to 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:12.299
 every kind of visit before the must 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.639
 pajamas that are completely there 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.530
 working as a journalist and that understands yes 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.780
 it is there they have a job in the west before a 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.240
 here to this still many here an hour 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.400
 just started to leave 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.830
 do me a favor now I will leave the beach 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.750
 in with the zone and in the magazine will pass by 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.289
 through the lip I can answer maybe even 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.240
 to someone 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.860
 Formula 1 was not such a ride 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.370
 individual characters who tried so 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.050
 behave 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.240
 did not last long would like to ask 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.800
 a couple more questions but it is forbidden to ours 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.000
 regulations friends because the program 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.720
 time of sport is coming to its 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.430
 completion 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.979
 I remind you that we had an editor at a party 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.110
 portal f1news.ru alexander boars sky 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.520
 there was a male red to Sergei 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.910
 meeting through huge syringes to communicate 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.940
 autoradio 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:00.010
