00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so when the case is closed you still

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.089 
so when the case is closed you still
have<00:02:09.270> access<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.140> 30-pin<00:02:11.039> connector

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
and have a very steep angle a kind of

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.700 
and have a very steep angle a kind of
less<00:02:51.090> steep<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.630> then<00:02:51.750> an<00:02:51.840> even<00:02:52.110> less<00:02:52.290> steep

one<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.400> three<00:02:53.580> different<00:02:53.730> angles<00:02:54.210> but<00:02:54.450> what

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
one so three different angles but what

unlike some of the cases I've tried that

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.440 
unlike some of the cases I've tried that

the you know stand is going to allow the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.850 
the you know stand is going to allow the
case<00:03:29.310> or<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.670> ipad<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.360> flop<00:03:30.690> over<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.560> pretty

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
case or the ipad to flop over so pretty

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.960 
case or the ipad to flop over so pretty
cool<00:03:32.070> when<00:03:32.520> you're<00:03:32.670> done

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
