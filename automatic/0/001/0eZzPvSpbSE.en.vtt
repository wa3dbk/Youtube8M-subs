to be talking to you guys throughout the
entire<00:00:12.300> video<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.719> narrating<00:00:13.500> my<00:00:13.620> process

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
entire video just narrating my process

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.609 
entire video just narrating my process
on<00:00:14.549> how<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:14.969> draw<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.509> fraction<00:00:15.960> illustration

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
on how I draw a fraction illustration

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.650 
on how I draw a fraction illustration
from<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.310> very<00:00:17.490> beginning<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> very<00:00:18.420> end

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
from the very beginning to the very end

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.019 
from the very beginning to the very end
that's<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.529> long<00:00:19.740> video<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.160> I've<00:00:20.490> divided<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that's a long video so I've divided it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.410 
that's a long video so I've divided it
into<00:00:21.210> two<00:00:21.330> parts<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.619> part<00:00:23.010> 1<00:00:23.400> um

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
into two parts and this is part 1 um

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.310 
into two parts and this is part 1 um
since<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> long<00:00:26.279> video<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
since it is going to be a long video I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.230 
since it is going to be a long video I
didn't<00:00:28.320> actually<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.130> real<00:00:29.310> time<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:30.029> put

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
didn't actually do it in real time I put

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
didn't actually do it in real time I put
it<00:00:30.269> into<00:00:30.539> time-lapse<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.130> times<00:00:32.489> 4

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it into time-lapse but it's just times 4

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.360 
it into time-lapse but it's just times 4
so<00:00:33.120> I'm<00:00:33.239> hoping<00:00:33.630> that's<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.170> lot<00:00:34.380> too<00:00:34.680> fast<00:00:35.040> for

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
so I'm hoping that's a lot too fast for

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
so I'm hoping that's a lot too fast for
you<00:00:35.460> guys<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.420> usually<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.110> my<00:00:37.260> time

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
you guys because I usually do my time

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.799 
you guys because I usually do my time
lapse<00:00:37.790> videos<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:39.260> time<00:00:40.260> 16<00:00:40.860> -<00:00:41.399> times<00:00:41.670> 20<00:00:42.239> so

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
lapse videos on time 16 - times 20 so

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.610 
lapse videos on time 16 - times 20 so
times<00:00:43.770> 4<00:00:44.280> wouldn't<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.840> fast<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
times 4 wouldn't really be that fast I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.420 
times 4 wouldn't really be that fast I
guess<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:48.030> yeah<00:00:48.510> um<00:00:48.960> anyway<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.770> hope<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.280> liked

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and yes I'm just scrolling through the

page and looking for images to just put

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.250 
page and looking for images to just put
my<00:01:22.410> mind<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.130> creative<00:01:23.820> mood<00:01:24.300> and<00:01:24.630> it

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
my mind in this creative mood and it

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.999 
my mind in this creative mood and it
basically<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.860> preps<00:01:26.640> me<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:28.259> actually

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
basically just preps me into actually

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.590 
basically just preps me into actually
starting<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:29.759> sketch<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:33.150> first<00:01:33.390> thing

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
starting a sketch so the first thing

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.990 
starting a sketch so the first thing
that<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.440> I<00:01:34.500> start<00:01:34.710> sketching<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.729> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that I do when I start sketching is I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.770 
that I do when I start sketching is I
like<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> draw<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:36.930> circle<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.979> head

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
like to draw a circle for the head

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.850 
like to draw a circle for the head
although<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.930> isn't<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.830> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
although this isn't going to be a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.190 
although this isn't going to be a
tutorial<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.880> how<00:01:41.940> to<00:01:42.360> draw<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> fashion

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
tutorial on how to draw the fashion

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.290 
tutorial on how to draw the fashion
figure<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> already<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> tutorial

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
figure because I already have a tutorial

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.280 
figure because I already have a tutorial
on<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:47.670> don't<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:48.990> want<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> be

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
on that and I don't really want to be

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.219 
on that and I don't really want to be
repeating<00:01:49.710> myself<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.640> video<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
repeating myself in this video but the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.960 
repeating myself in this video but the
reason<00:01:52.560> why<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.740> actually<00:01:53.250> start<00:01:53.520> drawing<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
reason why I actually start drawing a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.240 
reason why I actually start drawing a
circle<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.110> happens<00:01:55.590> every<00:01:55.770> single

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
circle and this happens every single

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.840 
circle and this happens every single
time<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.850> sketch<00:01:57.440> like<00:01:58.440> no<00:01:58.770> joke<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.610> habit

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
time I sketch like no joke it's a habit

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.140 
time I sketch like no joke it's a habit
of<00:02:00.150> mine<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.420> always<00:02:01.020> draw<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.650> circle<00:02:02.220> every

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
of mine I always draw a circle every

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.000 
of mine I always draw a circle every
time<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.600> sketch<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.560> first<00:02:04.830> thing

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
time I sketch and that's the first thing

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.280 
time I sketch and that's the first thing
I<00:02:05.159> draw<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.299> guess<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> reason<00:02:06.870> why<00:02:07.229> is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
I draw and I guess the reason why is

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.000 
I draw and I guess the reason why is
because<00:02:07.620> I<00:02:08.130> feel<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.000> annoyed<00:02:09.510> when<00:02:10.229> I'm

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
because I feel so annoyed when I'm

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.830 
because I feel so annoyed when I'm
looking<00:02:11.370> at<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> blank<00:02:11.610> piece<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.060> paper<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
looking at a blank piece of paper and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.370 
looking at a blank piece of paper and
have<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> pencil<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:13.830> my<00:02:13.890> hand<00:02:14.780> yet<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.989> don't

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
have a pencil on my hand yet I don't

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.220 
have a pencil on my hand yet I don't
really<00:02:16.590> have<00:02:16.920> an<00:02:17.160> idea<00:02:17.549> of<00:02:17.850> what<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.239> draw<00:02:18.480> so

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
really have an idea of what to draw so

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.720 
really have an idea of what to draw so
I'm<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.830> telling<00:02:20.070> myself

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
I'm just telling myself

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.960 
I'm just telling myself
draw<00:02:21.480> something<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.140> suddenly<00:02:22.380> my<00:02:22.860> hand<00:02:23.190> just

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
draw something and suddenly my hand just

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.420 
draw something and suddenly my hand just
starts<00:02:24.360> moving<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.959> circular<00:02:25.170> motion<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.040> I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
starts moving in a circular motion and I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
starts moving in a circular motion and I
have<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> circle<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.750> forms<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.530> head

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
have a circle and then it forms the head

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.940 
have a circle and then it forms the head
and<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.549> actually<00:02:29.850> when<00:02:30.330> my<00:02:30.600> mind<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.560> in

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
and that's actually when my mind is in

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.509 
and that's actually when my mind is in
the<00:02:32.250> creative<00:02:32.790> mood<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.950> ideas<00:02:34.950> start

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
the creative mood and ideas start

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.270 
the creative mood and ideas start
kicking<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:37.110> inspiration<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
kicking in and I have inspiration and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.729 
kicking in and I have inspiration and
suddenly<00:02:38.970> everything<00:02:39.630> just<00:02:39.840> flows<00:02:40.380> together

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
suddenly everything just flows together

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.670 
suddenly everything just flows together
so<00:02:41.610> once<00:02:41.790> I've<00:02:41.970> drawn<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.330> head<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.900> then<00:02:43.380> just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
so once I've drawn the head I then just

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.150 
so once I've drawn the head I then just
draw<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.220> body<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.150> then<00:02:45.840> draw<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.410> legs<00:02:46.830> and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
draw the body and then draw the legs and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.009 
draw the body and then draw the legs and
then<00:02:47.250> draw<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.549> arms<00:02:48.120> because<00:02:48.390> basically<00:02:48.989> I

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
then draw the arms because basically I

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.830 
then draw the arms because basically I
have<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.739> rough<00:02:49.980> idea<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.760> post<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.360> my<00:02:51.420> head

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
have a rough idea of the post in my head

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.759 
have a rough idea of the post in my head
and<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.890> also<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.549> have<00:02:53.880> an<00:02:54.180> idea<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
and I also just have an idea of the

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.100 
and I also just have an idea of the
dress<00:02:56.070> or<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.730> outfit<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:57.600> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.930> be

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
dress or the outfit that I'm going to be

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.170 
dress or the outfit that I'm going to be
creating<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.799> they<00:02:59.160> all<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.670> come<00:02:59.940> together

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
creating and they all just come together

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.309 
creating and they all just come together
creating<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.320> clear<00:03:01.799> picture<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.319> that's

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
creating this clear picture and that's

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.309 
creating this clear picture and that's
then<00:03:05.160> transferred<00:03:05.880> onto<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.330> paper<00:03:06.510> so

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
then transferred onto the paper so

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.320 
then transferred onto the paper so
basically<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.860> act

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
basically I act

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.550 
basically I act
we<00:03:08.450> get<00:03:08.720> inspiration<00:03:09.380> when<00:03:09.710> I<00:03:09.860> start<00:03:10.640> working

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
we get inspiration when I start working

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.000 
we get inspiration when I start working
um<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.910> also<00:03:13.910> actually<00:03:14.270> use<00:03:14.720> guidelines<00:03:15.260> when

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
um I also actually use guidelines when

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.790 
um I also actually use guidelines when
I'm<00:03:16.130> drawing<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.580> fashion<00:03:16.940> figure<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:18.440> I'm

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
I'm drawing the fashion figure like I'm

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.130 
I'm drawing the fashion figure like I'm
using<00:03:19.240> action<00:03:20.240> lines<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:20.720> can't<00:03:20.960> really

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
using action lines but you can't really

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.350 
using action lines but you can't really
see<00:03:21.350> them<00:03:21.530> clearly<00:03:22.160> because<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.820> just<00:03:22.970> do<00:03:23.180> them

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
see them clearly because I just do them

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.840 
see them clearly because I just do them
really<00:03:23.720> lightly<00:03:24.050> since<00:03:25.010> I'm<00:03:25.190> not<00:03:25.340> exactly<00:03:25.640> a

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
really lightly since I'm not exactly a

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.570 
really lightly since I'm not exactly a
beginner<00:03:26.410> nor<00:03:27.410> am<00:03:27.530> i<00:03:27.650> professional<00:03:28.280> I'm<00:03:28.400> not

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
sketch I actually sketch really roughly

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.160 
sketch I actually sketch really roughly

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.550 
I don't know how other people do it I
just<00:04:06.740> can't<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.430> create<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.330> line<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.990> then<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.260> go

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
just can't I create a line and then I go

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.820 
just can't I create a line and then I go
over<00:04:09.770> that<00:04:10.070> line<00:04:10.310> multiple<00:04:11.060> times<00:04:11.450> until<00:04:12.080> I'm

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
over that line multiple times until I'm

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.979 
over that line multiple times until I'm
really<00:04:13.160> satisfied<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.450> think<00:04:14.810> it's

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
really satisfied and I think it's

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.320 
really satisfied and I think it's
probably<00:04:15.260> because<00:04:15.830> when<00:04:16.640> there's<00:04:16.820> more<00:04:17.060> line

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
probably because when there's more line

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.720 
probably because when there's more line
on<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.750> paper<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.320> just<00:04:18.590> translates<00:04:19.130> that

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
on the paper it just translates that

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.320 
on the paper it just translates that
I've<00:04:20.060> worked<00:04:20.480> hard<00:04:21.049> on<00:04:21.320> this<00:04:21.739> sketch<00:04:22.040> I<00:04:22.430> don't

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
I've worked hard on this sketch I don't

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.630 
I've worked hard on this sketch I don't
know<00:04:23.480> but<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.720> always<00:04:24.169> press<00:04:24.590> hard<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
know but I always press hard on the

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.880 
know but I always press hard on the
paper<00:04:25.850> when<00:04:26.150> I'm<00:04:26.270> sketching<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:27.050> it's<00:04:27.590> really

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
paper when I'm sketching and it's really

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.510 
paper when I'm sketching and it's really
bad<00:04:28.100> especially<00:04:28.430> when<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.210> am<00:04:29.750> using<00:04:30.530> like<00:04:31.190> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
bad especially when I am using like the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.700 
bad especially when I am using like the
paper<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.600> I'm<00:04:32.690> going<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:33.020> be<00:04:33.140> coloring<00:04:33.470> in

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
paper that I'm going to be coloring in

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.810 
paper that I'm going to be coloring in
with<00:04:33.919> because<00:04:34.520> it<00:04:35.180> creates<00:04:35.570> grooves<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.820> it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
with because it creates grooves and it

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.590 
with because it creates grooves and it
just<00:04:38.120> doesn't<00:04:38.419> work<00:04:39.110> very<00:04:39.380> well<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:41.240> right<00:04:41.450> now

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
just doesn't work very well so right now

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.020 
just doesn't work very well so right now
I'm<00:04:41.720> actually<00:04:41.870> using<00:04:42.350> regular<00:04:43.340> white<00:04:43.580> printer

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
I'm actually using regular white printer

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.870 
I'm actually using regular white printer
paper<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.900> do<00:04:45.050> my<00:04:45.200> sketch<00:04:45.500> in<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.010> then<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.640> just

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
paper to do my sketch in and then I just

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.110 
paper to do my sketch in and then I just
transfer<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.630> onto<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:49.310> paper<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:50.000> I'm

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
transfer that onto the paper that I'm

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.000 
transfer that onto the paper that I'm
going<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.450> be<00:04:50.540> using<00:04:50.840> for<00:04:50.870> my<00:04:51.110> copics<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.650> little

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
going to be using for my copics a little

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.060 
going to be using for my copics a little
later<00:04:52.190> on<00:04:52.540> what<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.570> actually<00:04:53.780> use<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.530> transfer

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
later on what I actually use to transfer

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.280 
later on what I actually use to transfer
the<00:04:55.280> sketch<00:04:56.060> onto<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.540> other<00:04:56.690> piece<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:56.990> paper

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
the sketch onto the other piece of paper

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.650 
the sketch onto the other piece of paper
is<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.680> lightbox<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:58.520> know<00:04:58.580> like<00:04:58.940> boxes<00:04:59.450> can

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
is a lightbox and I know like boxes can

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.740 
is a lightbox and I know like boxes can
be<00:04:59.810> a<00:04:59.960> little<00:05:00.500> bit<00:05:00.620> expensive<00:05:00.830> but<00:05:01.750> an

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
be a little bit expensive but an

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.930 
be a little bit expensive but an
alternative<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:03.740> can<00:05:03.860> use<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.550> used

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
alternative that you can use and I used

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.900 
alternative that you can use and I used
to<00:05:05.390> use<00:05:05.600> this<00:05:05.870> alternative<00:05:06.560> is<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.979> window<00:05:07.580> and

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
to use this alternative is a window and

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.200 
to use this alternative is a window and
morning<00:05:08.660> sunlight<00:05:09.490> now<00:05:10.490> I'm<00:05:10.669> just<00:05:10.880> going<00:05:11.180> to

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
morning sunlight now I'm just going to

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.020 
morning sunlight now I'm just going to
be<00:05:11.390> darkening<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.020> lines<00:05:12.320> to<00:05:12.979> prep<00:05:13.370> this<00:05:13.729> in

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
be darkening the lines to prep this in

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.630 
be darkening the lines to prep this in
order<00:05:14.240> for<00:05:14.540> me<00:05:14.630> to<00:05:14.660> transfer<00:05:15.260> it<00:05:15.350> onto<00:05:15.640> the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
order for me to transfer it onto the

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.180 
order for me to transfer it onto the
other<00:05:16.850> piece<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.210> paper<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:18.080> since<00:05:18.650> I<00:05:18.830> sketch

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
other piece of paper and since I sketch

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.420 
other piece of paper and since I sketch
really<00:05:19.550> roughly<00:05:19.970> I

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
really roughly I

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.280 
really roughly I
like<00:05:20.670> to<00:05:20.880> make<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.300> lines<00:05:21.570> that<00:05:21.900> I'm<00:05:21.990> going<00:05:22.260> to

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
like to make the lines that I'm going to

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.910 
like to make the lines that I'm going to
actually<00:05:22.800> be<00:05:22.950> um<00:05:23.810> using<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:25.050> fineliner<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.770> go

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
actually be um using a fineliner to go

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.980 
actually be um using a fineliner to go
over<00:05:26.280> with<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.700> like<00:05:26.940> to<00:05:27.060> make<00:05:27.210> them<00:05:27.390> dark<00:05:27.690> so

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
over with I like to make them dark so

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.720 
over with I like to make them dark so
that<00:05:28.020> I<00:05:28.440> know<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.710> this<00:05:29.100> is<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.430> line<00:05:29.580> I'm

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
that I know that this is the line I'm

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.720 
that I know that this is the line I'm
going<00:05:29.880> to<00:05:30.090> be<00:05:30.210> using<00:05:30.570> I<00:05:30.890> also<00:05:31.890> don't<00:05:32.280> draw<00:05:32.670> the

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
going to be using I also don't draw the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.270 
going to be using I also don't draw the
details<00:05:33.390> of<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.810> design<00:05:33.960> or<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.500> dress<00:05:34.830> I'm

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
details of the design or the dress I'm

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.980 
details of the design or the dress I'm
going<00:05:35.640> to<00:05:35.760> be<00:05:35.940> doing<00:05:36.180> that<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.360> little<00:05:36.630> later<00:05:36.900> on

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
going to be doing that a little later on

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.200 
going to be doing that a little later on
once<00:05:37.410> I've<00:05:37.650> inked<00:05:37.920> this<00:05:38.160> sketch<00:05:38.490> and<00:05:38.820> then<00:05:39.150> I

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
once I've inked this sketch and then I

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.910 
once I've inked this sketch and then I
look<00:05:39.480> at<00:05:39.570> it<00:05:39.660> for<00:05:39.840> a<00:05:39.870> minute<00:05:40.170> or<00:05:40.290> two<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.770> then

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
look at it for a minute or two and then

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.830 
look at it for a minute or two and then
that's<00:05:41.130> when<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.370> decide<00:05:41.790> what<00:05:42.330> I'm<00:05:42.510> going<00:05:42.720> to

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
that's when I decide what I'm going to

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.960 
that's when I decide what I'm going to
be<00:05:43.050> doing<00:05:43.200> with<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.500> it's<00:05:44.220> just<00:05:44.370> like<00:05:44.670> working

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
be doing with it it's just like working

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.090 
be doing with it it's just like working
with<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.330> blank<00:05:45.570> canvas<00:05:45.900> all<00:05:46.350> over<00:05:46.650> again<00:05:46.920> and

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
with a blank canvas all over again and

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.850 
with a blank canvas all over again and
the<00:05:47.700> possibilities<00:05:48.450> are<00:05:48.720> endless<00:05:49.050> with<00:05:49.650> what

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
the possibilities are endless with what

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.500 
the possibilities are endless with what
I<00:05:49.890> could<00:05:50.160> do<00:05:50.310> with<00:05:50.490> this<00:05:50.640> dress<00:05:51.030> like<00:05:51.270> with<00:05:51.420> the

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
I could do with this dress like with the

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.420 
I could do with this dress like with the
patterns<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.200> design<00:05:52.530> because<00:05:53.040> I<00:05:53.130> feel

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
patterns and the design because I feel

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.940 
patterns and the design because I feel
like<00:05:53.460> sticking<00:05:54.150> to<00:05:54.450> one<00:05:54.780> possible<00:05:55.560> design

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
like sticking to one possible design

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.130 
like sticking to one possible design
might<00:05:56.340> make<00:05:56.640> me<00:05:56.790> change<00:05:57.030> my<00:05:57.120> mind<00:05:57.270> and<00:05:57.720> then

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
might make me change my mind and then

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.960 
might make me change my mind and then
I'd<00:05:58.290> end<00:05:58.320> up<00:05:58.650> not<00:05:58.890> liking<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.370> design<00:05:59.670> at<00:05:59.820> all

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
I'd end up not liking the design at all

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.230 
I'd end up not liking the design at all
so<00:06:00.570> I'll<00:06:00.660> just<00:06:00.780> leave<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.080> here<00:06:01.230> and<00:06:01.530> then

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
so I'll just leave it here and then

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.640 
so I'll just leave it here and then
basically<00:06:03.240> this<00:06:03.540> is<00:06:03.750> how<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:03.960> finish<00:06:04.470> the

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
basically this is how I finish the

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.890 
basically this is how I finish the
sketch
