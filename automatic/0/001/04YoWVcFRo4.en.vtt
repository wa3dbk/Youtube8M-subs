reason why you need that is because you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
reason why you need that is because you
can<00:01:04.500> slip<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> back<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.450> your

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
can slip it here in the back of your

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.280 
can slip it here in the back of your
phone<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.560> does<00:01:07.770> two<00:01:08.070> things<00:01:08.540> one<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
phone and it does two things one the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.570 
phone and it does two things one the
first<00:01:10.530> thing<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> does<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> blocks

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
first thing that it does is it blocks

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789 
first thing that it does is it blocks
you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.180> harmful<00:01:12.840> radiation<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.560> say

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you know harmful radiation they say

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
you know harmful radiation they say
roughly<00:01:14.640> powerful<00:01:15.180> radiation<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> back

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
roughly powerful radiation from the back

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
roughly powerful radiation from the back
I<00:01:16.140> guess<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.740> you're<00:01:16.860> facing<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.220> from

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I guess because if you're facing it from

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.320 
I guess because if you're facing it from
the<00:01:17.400> front<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.939> gonna<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.180> like

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
the front then it's not gonna be like

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.420 
the front then it's not gonna be like
yeah<00:01:18.810> ready<00:01:19.140> blocking<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:20.040> over<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> place

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
yeah ready blocking all over the place

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.210 
yeah ready blocking all over the place
and<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> second<00:01:21.720> thing<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.140> does<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.500> if

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and the second thing that it does is if

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
and the second thing that it does is if
you<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.850> put<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> card<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you put you can put a card in here and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.270 
you put you can put a card in here and
if<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.080> had<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.409> NFC<00:01:25.740> card<00:01:25.950> or<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.159> had<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
if you had like an NFC card or you had a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.859 
if you had like an NFC card or you had a
credit<00:01:26.430> card<00:01:26.670> unit<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.970> has<00:01:27.119> NFC<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.600> know

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
credit card unit that has NFC you know

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.179 
credit card unit that has NFC you know
or<00:01:28.020> Wireless<00:01:28.380> payments<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.950> let's<00:01:29.070> say<00:01:29.159> our

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
or Wireless payments and let's say our

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.890 
or Wireless payments and let's say our
metro<00:01:29.520> card<00:01:29.700> put<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> put<00:01:30.750> this

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
metro card put that in then you put this

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 
metro card put that in then you put this
Ray<00:01:31.290> absorbent<00:01:31.740> card<00:01:31.920> behind<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.909> make

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
Ray absorbent card behind it and so make

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.460 
Ray absorbent card behind it and so make
sure<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.720> phone<00:01:33.869> doesn't<00:01:34.200> interfere

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
sure that your phone doesn't interfere

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
sure that your phone doesn't interfere
you<00:01:34.860> know<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.640> NFC<00:01:36.060> itself<00:01:36.420> so

table<00:03:08.110> design<00:03:08.319> no<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.280> does<00:03:09.489> not<00:03:09.730> make<00:03:10.450> done

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
table design no it does not make done

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.039 
table design no it does not make done
and<00:03:10.959> miss<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.290> actually<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:13.180> looks<00:03:13.959> like

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
and miss you actually and it looks like

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.800 
and miss you actually and it looks like
and<00:03:14.410> let<00:03:14.530> me<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.620> try<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.950> get<00:03:15.310> close<00:03:15.810> into

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
and let me just try to get close into

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.259 
and let me just try to get close into
this<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.109> said<00:03:17.290> give<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.100> at<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.459> angle<00:03:18.670> right

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
this I said give it at that angle right

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.539 
this I said give it at that angle right
over<00:03:19.329> there

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
over there

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.460 
over there
so<00:03:21.549> if<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:21.970> take<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.239> look<00:03:22.630> at<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.989> edge<00:03:23.140> it

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
so if you take a look at the edge it

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.170 
so if you take a look at the edge it
looks<00:03:23.859> like<00:03:24.040> it's<00:03:24.220> just<00:03:24.370> like<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.579> hairline<00:03:25.030> or

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
looks like it's just like a hairline or

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.819 
looks like it's just like a hairline or
maybe<00:03:25.359> almost<00:03:25.810> exact<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.440> know<00:03:26.500> what<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.799> is

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
maybe almost exact you know what it is

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.550 
maybe almost exact you know what it is
exactly<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.850> edge<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.209> screen<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
exactly to the edge of the screen and

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.810 
exactly to the edge of the screen and
then<00:03:29.680> they<00:03:29.980> know<00:03:30.130> there's<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> little<00:03:30.489> gap<00:03:30.670> over

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
then they know there's a little gap over

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.949 
then they know there's a little gap over
there<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.180> if<00:03:31.269> you're<00:03:31.390> gonna<00:03:31.510> you're<00:03:31.900> gonna

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
there so if you're gonna you're gonna

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.569 
there so if you're gonna you're gonna

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.759 
differently the screen protector again I
recommend<00:03:33.940> speaking<00:03:34.390> some<00:03:34.810> glas.t<00:03:35.320> I<00:03:35.350> love<00:03:35.650> it

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
like it's gonna add significant

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.870 
like it's gonna add significant
thickness<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.290> because<00:04:02.920> it's<00:04:03.100> curved<00:04:03.489> you

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
thickness to it because it's curved you

thickness to it because it's curved you
don't<00:04:04.060> feel<00:04:04.390> like<00:04:04.600> it's<00:04:04.750> thick<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:04.959> actually

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
don't feel like it's thick and actually

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
I love the curvature I mean I didn't

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.360 
I love the curvature I mean I didn't
really<00:04:08.139> like<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.470> know<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.709> sharp<00:04:08.950> edges<00:04:09.130> you

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
really like you know the sharp edges you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.990 
really like you know the sharp edges you
know<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:10.630> iPhone<00:04:11.170> 4<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.440> iPhone<00:04:11.650> 5<00:04:12.190> went

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
know that the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 went

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.809 
know that the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 went
with<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.389> so<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.540> prefer<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.440> curved<00:04:14.709> edges<00:04:15.040> so

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
with and so I prefer the curved edges so

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.759 
with and so I prefer the curved edges so
it<00:04:15.880> feels<00:04:16.030> really<00:04:16.269> nice<00:04:16.389> and<00:04:16.630> by<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.109> way<00:04:17.320> if

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
it feels really nice and by the way if

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.120 
it feels really nice and by the way if
you're<00:04:17.979> interested<00:04:18.669> in<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.329> iPhone<00:04:19.720> 5c<00:04:20.260> I

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
you're interested in the iPhone 5c I

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.800 
you're interested in the iPhone 5c I
think<00:04:21.459> this<00:04:21.580> kind<00:04:21.760> of<00:04:21.880> gives<00:04:22.120> it

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
think this kind of gives it

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.830 
think this kind of gives it
a<00:04:22.840> similar<00:04:23.290> look<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:24.130> know<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.280> mean<00:04:24.490> so<00:04:25.060> maybe

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
a similar look you know I mean so maybe

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.230 
a similar look you know I mean so maybe
this<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.230> solution<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:27.130> have<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.460> iPhone<00:04:27.790> 5c

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
this is a solution to have the iPhone 5c

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.390 
this is a solution to have the iPhone 5c
look<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:28.780> know<00:04:28.900> with<00:04:29.169> your<00:04:29.320> iPhone<00:04:30.100> 5<00:04:30.370> a

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
look you know with your iPhone 5 a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.280 
look you know with your iPhone 5 a
little<00:04:30.669> bit<00:04:30.760> early<00:04:31.000> taking<00:04:31.900> a<00:04:32.020> look<00:04:32.139> at<00:04:32.230> the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
little bit early taking a look at the

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.409 
little bit early taking a look at the
top<00:04:32.470> that's<00:04:32.800> how<00:04:32.950> it's<00:04:33.100> open<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.700> on<00:04:33.970> on<00:04:34.270> the

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
top that's how it's open and on on the

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.690 
top that's how it's open and on on the
sides<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:36.010> might<00:04:36.190> think<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.520> because

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
sides and you might think that because

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.250 
sides and you might think that because
these<00:04:36.970> are<00:04:37.120> plastic<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.570> little<00:04:37.780> bit<00:04:37.930> said<00:04:38.110> that

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
these are plastic a little bit said that

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.110 
these are plastic a little bit said that
you<00:04:38.380> something<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.950> be<00:04:39.070> concerned<00:04:39.430> about<00:04:39.550> no

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
you something to be concerned about no

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.879 
you something to be concerned about no
there's<00:04:40.570> nothing<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.870> be<00:04:41.020> worried<00:04:41.260> about<00:04:41.320> I've

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
there's nothing to be worried about I've

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.440 
there's nothing to be worried about I've
been<00:04:41.950> using<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.430> as<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.700> mentioned<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.090> know<00:04:43.180> for
