thing<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.600> encourage<00:01:15.780> people<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520

draw their own art I just really think

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.109 
draw their own art I just really think
that<00:01:19.979> art<00:01:20.130> should<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.460> reflection<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
that art should be a reflection of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.789 
that art should be a reflection of
yourself<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.290> copy<00:01:22.470> somebody

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
yourself and so when you copy somebody

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
else you know it's a reflection I don't

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.420 
else you know it's a reflection I don't

because<00:03:13.060> it's<00:03:13.600> good<00:03:13.959> for<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.140> laugh<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:14.620> um<00:03:15.160> I

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
because it's good for a laugh but um I

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.449 
because it's good for a laugh but um I
didn't<00:03:16.150> start<00:03:16.540> drawing<00:03:16.900> better<00:03:17.500> until<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.250> just

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
didn't start drawing better until I just

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.949 
didn't start drawing better until I just
stop<00:03:18.640> copying<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.360> then<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.570> just<00:03:19.690> clicked

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
stop copying and then it just clicked

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.500 
stop copying and then it just clicked
and<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.290> could<00:03:20.440> draw<00:03:20.560> Walt<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.370> that's<00:03:22.239> another

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
and I could draw Walt so that's another

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.780 
and I could draw Walt so that's another
reason<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.829> good<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.160> find<00:03:24.670> your

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
reason that it's good to just find your

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.300 
reason that it's good to just find your
own<00:03:24.850> style<00:03:24.910> because<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:27.010> just<00:03:27.160> copy

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
own style because if you just copy

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.770 
own style because if you just copy
everybody<00:03:27.700> else<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.239> drawings<00:03:28.570> I'm<00:03:28.660> gonna

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
look the same every time or they're

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.500 
look the same every time or they're
gonna<00:03:29.890> look<00:03:30.070> exactly<00:03:30.220> like<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:31.150> person<00:03:31.480> that
