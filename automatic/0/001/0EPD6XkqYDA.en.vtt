00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.340
 It is almost common sense to think that the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.920
 play if a well-built villain is a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.690
 game in a way incomplete, not me 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.130
 I agree with that, after all. 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 most charismatic characters and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.570
 are usually the same villains 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.760
 only that even carrying this face of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.189
 villain many games showed billions 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.260
 who had good intentions even 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.260
 ended up changing sides during the game 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.219
 I like the cool robots 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.190
 different I believe the most 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.800
 wanted the series to be 10 because my 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.390
 understand is mass even to receive 5 goes 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.289
 be cooler than mega blaster this 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.760
 there's no way 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.159
 only the character I always liked 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.000
 even the man himself who by the way is 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.530
 we will talk about it now 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.989
 character makes the first appearance in 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.399
 mega man 3 but disguised, right? 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.589
 because he did not want to be recognized or 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.260
 by doctor light and by the mega man already 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.489
 broke tomem let's say the most brother 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.679
 old mega man 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.450
 in addition they look the same 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:08.890
 both are Dr. Light's creations only 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.780
 broke was also the first robot with 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.819
 artificial intelligence already created 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.159
 and how the vast majority of prototypes 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:17.170
 breeding was not perfect for rape 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.520
 also needed repairs only that he 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.710
 was afraid that white doctor 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.200
 altered your personality and memories 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.360
 and eventually fled but really 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.860
 needed repairs so much that it ended 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.929
 down the middle of the road and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.399
 rescued by doctor wii that ended 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.140
 helping pro too after promising 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.280
 that would not interfere with his personality and 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.479
 your memories 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.610
 in addition he also received a 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.349
 helmet that hid your identity 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.910
 after being felt indignant with the 

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:42.310
 doctor william and ended up following 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.330
 faithfully the doctor during the events of 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.920
 mega man 3 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.229
 doctor william ends up attracting the doctor 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.720
 light and each mega man destroy the eight 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.280
 robots that you loose on the planet only 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.750
 broke also mega man faces some 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.520
 times during this process will 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.649
 realizing that what they are doing is 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.720
 wrong and what doctor william is what he 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.640
 I thought it was then an end 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.069
 surprising after the fight between the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.080
 ig medication begins to crumble 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.500
 so it also appears and saves your 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.500
 younger brother 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.069
 and ends up leaving it in the laboratory 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.599
 doctor light arriving soon 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.430
 but because he had already left 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.170
 only the other set aside the whistle 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.129
 of its prototype that makes it clear that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.750
 changed sides 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.950
 despite not fighting alongside mega man 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.959
 still at least undoubtedly the end of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.910
 miami 30 most detailed in the series 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.910
 classic and the most exciting 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.819
 for so many years that the nucleus is a 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.010
 ally of the sonic that is not everyone who 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.620
 knows that one day he was once a species 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.450
 of sonic 3 franchise villain you already 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.010
 start the game with new ones by stealing all 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.620
 their abodes of chaos 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.720
 but the very one in which he is the greatest victim 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.489
 of the game and in fact the guardian of 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.739
 emerald master who sent the raymond 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.209
 then its main function is to protect 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.879
 this emerald that is responsible for 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.830
 give energy and keep the island floating 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.540
 only after the end of sonic 2 the ship 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.150
 robotics end up falling just in 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.200
 joaçaba and knowing that the sony river has the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.819
 would follow him 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.160
 he says broadly that the two lived 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.349
 to steal emerald master so let's 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.640
 main guardian, the neco goes after the 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.620
 two to stop them 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.629
 and it starts short of validity between the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.519
 two only that who really was behind the 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.379
 emerald master was the robotnik himself 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.079
 who wanted to use emerald energy 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.849
 to restore your ship and you can 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.140
 even when you see a real 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.819
 launch your ship 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.890
 I needed it to be in a beam trying to 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.170
 stop the sonic picks up the balance ends 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.150
 falling only then after the new club 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.130
 doctor robot people stealing emerald 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.670
 who realizes that she was deceived and tries 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.670
 stop him 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 only that it ends up being hurt and solves 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:04.670
 help the sonic to stop the doctor in 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.920
 pokémon 25 is battling for insignia 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.520
 evolve our pokémons and capture several 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.990
 others 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.240
 but none of this fits into what 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.850
 We call villain gyms leaders 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.050
 they're just his gym name, not even 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.340
 there is a feeling that we are 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.049
 battling evil 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.480
 and maybe that's why the rocket team 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.580
 was created this is the great villain of the 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.220
 first generation of games from there 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.840
 came the team magma the galaxy team and the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.230
 amazing staff who did the job 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.210
 paper in white and black versions 12 more 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.290
 we will especially focus on one of the leaders 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.270
 team's 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.370
 bn the team aiming the game has as 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.240
 aim to free all pokémons from 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.620
 humans 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.450
 because they believe that the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.860
 human beings do not have the capacity to 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.500
 right of a pokémon 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.960
 but calm down the guy that the freedom of 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.470
 pokémons that stay in poker balls and are 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.030
 drawn to fight the pokémons a 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.250
 right with the team more about this evil 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.570
 all there and asks me to 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.640
 liberty coaches in their pokémons 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.390
 so that they can live free and in 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.160
 peace 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.590
 but of course no one will obey a 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.090
 Crazy these days I play Pokemon from the 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.560
 first generation and I know that within the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.360
 universe of pokémon 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.700
 they are treated as friends and not as 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.360
 slaves with some exceptions of course 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.190
 huh 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.870
 but we'll get the initial idea 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.510
 even though consider a villain 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.980
 exactly does not make much sense right? 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.360
 from this the team commits in 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.640
 some evil things in favor of what they 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.380
 believe and such but the most curious even 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.720
 is that pokémon presented this philosophy 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.310
 inside the game itself that can do 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.180
 you reflect a little more about it 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.180
 even out of the game 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.060
 ae 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.190
 without a doubt one of the characters 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.320
 most popular of chrono trigger is mages 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.840
 the personality of the character well 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.030
 style to be said at least at first 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.500
 is also regarded as the main villain by 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.790
 certain point of the game 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.620
 This is because the heroes of the game 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.570
 They believed responsible for creating 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.460
 one side is the destroyer of the world 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.680
 was precisely the magicians with his 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.020
 black magic specialty 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.270
 but the deal is far from that. 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.350
 first time in kicking with the magician without 600 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.340
 after Christ 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.260
 that's because we went there 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.030
 precisely to prevent the magician from bringing the 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.980
 to the surface and even 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.990
 we managed to prevent but you have some 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.950
 notion of what magician really sought with 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.990
 all that 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.090
 originally but does not belong to this 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.770
 in time it is actually 12 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.900
 Thousand before Christ King and Queen 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.330
 brother scale deviance 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.770
 the great motivation of wizards all started 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.470
 with the ambition of his mother that after 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.580
 discovered lava in the depths of the earth 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.320
 build a machine to start 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.030
 train the power of lakes 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.320
 only that she gained the evil of the 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.810
 animal and ended up losing control 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.920
 always in search of power and the coveted 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.780
 immortality 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.550
 except that this invoked his own daughter 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.270
 to help train Satanic power 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.340
 of eggs 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.530
 only that they exaggerated the dose and lavos 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.300
 ended up waking up with his absurd power 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.280
 played each one for a different period 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.380
 in time it was there that the magician stopped at the 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.150
 the average age at which it actually 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.970
 known as a magician since his real name 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.740
 It's been years you 're generating. 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.530
 said and said nothing 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.120
 why did she play each one? 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.250
 for a period other than the first 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.350
 thing that landmarks reminded was of his sister 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.640
 searched for it in all 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.590
 times you've been able to 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.360
 Only you could never find it. 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.920
 fact that he had tried and vowed to 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.660
 mean age was precisely to 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.860
 avenge of the beast and try to know the 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.450
 whereabouts of his sister 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.450
 right after our fight with Marlos in his 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.100
 castle it back to christ 2011 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.930
 Only those who do not reveal their identity soon 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.360
 Go ahead and try to end it.
