to<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.950> all<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.519> sides<00:00:14.730> I'm<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.839> have

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
to be on all the sides I'm going to have

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.359 
to be on all the sides I'm going to have
two<00:00:16.230> sides<00:00:16.560> with<00:00:17.490> four<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.270> two<00:00:19.170> sides<00:00:19.529> with

two sides with four and two sides with

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.070 
two sides with four and two sides with
three<00:00:21.320> that's<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> give<00:00:22.769> me<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.949> total<00:00:23.369> of

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
three that's going to give me a total of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.460 
three that's going to give me a total of
14<00:00:26.689> pieces<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:29.060> those<00:00:30.060> pieces<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.410> to

14 pieces and those pieces are going to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.040 
14 pieces and those pieces are going to
be<00:00:31.560> made<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.009> my<00:00:32.369> treated<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.540> by<00:00:33.719> fours

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
be made out of my treated two by fours

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.500 
be made out of my treated two by fours
and<00:00:34.410> they're<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.250> 14<00:00:35.790> inches<00:00:36.239> long

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and they're going to be 14 inches long

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.880 
and they're going to be 14 inches long
and<00:00:38.390> that's<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.660> give<00:00:39.750> me<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> my

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and that's going to give me all of my

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.150 
and that's going to give me all of my
sides<00:00:42.140> now<00:00:43.140> first<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:43.980> we're

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
sides now first off when we're

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.729 
sides now first off when we're
calculating<00:00:44.399> our<00:00:44.910> measurements<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:46.530> by

one and a half by three and a half so if

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100 
one and a half by three and a half so if
I<00:00:52.649> take<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> look<00:00:53.039> at<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> top<00:00:53.730> view<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.420> my

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
I take a look at the top view of my

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.069 
I take a look at the top view of my
sides<00:00:55.500> I've<00:00:55.949> laid<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.300> pieces<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
sides I've laid out all my pieces and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.979 
sides I've laid out all my pieces and
when<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.070> math<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.390> 14

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
when I do the math on that I have 14

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.670 
when I do the math on that I have 14
inches<00:01:01.379> by<00:01:02.039> 13<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> half<00:01:03.449> inches<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
inches by 13 and a half inches which is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.140 
inches by 13 and a half inches which is
almost<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.549> square<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.260> top<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.670> i'm

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
almost a square now on top of this i'm

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.810 
almost a square now on top of this i'm
going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.229> having<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.830> pieces<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
going to be having my pieces that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.219 
going to be having my pieces that
overhang<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> i'm<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.400> using<00:01:14.430> these

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
overhang so i'm going to be using these

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.359 
overhang so i'm going to be using these
measurements<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.380> i<00:01:16.409> calculated<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
measurements that i calculated as a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
measurements that i calculated as a
rough<00:01:18.060> estimate<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> amount<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
rough estimate for the amount of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.410 
rough estimate for the amount of
materials<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.460> i'm<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.790> need<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.299> my

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420

four by about 11 for all of my bottom
pieces<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.079> then<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.320> course<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
pieces and then of course I'm going to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.610
