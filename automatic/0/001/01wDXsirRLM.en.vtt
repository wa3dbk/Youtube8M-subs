today<00:00:01.949> we<00:00:02.070> got<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.250> few<00:00:02.520> items<00:00:02.669> in<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.600> mail<00:00:03.810> and

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
today we got a few items in the mail and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.370 
today we got a few items in the mail and
first<00:00:05.430> up<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:06.440> the<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.919> white<00:00:08.099> package

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
first up is the one in the white package

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.379 
first up is the one in the white package
but<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.809> so<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.730> swipe<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:15.000> and

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
but what is it so this is swipe it's and

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.490 
but what is it so this is swipe it's and
swipe<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:17.250> glove<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.930> put<00:00:19.320> on

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
swipe it's is a glove that you put on

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.140 
swipe it's is a glove that you put on
and<00:00:19.800> then<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.699> helps<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.210> cat<00:00:21.869> hair<00:00:21.900> removal

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
and then it helps with cat hair removal

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.419 
and then it helps with cat hair removal
so<00:00:26.630> this<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.230> looks<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:29.189> got

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so this is what it looks like it's got

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.639 
so this is what it looks like it's got
little<00:00:29.730> tiny<00:00:32.809> well<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.020> feels<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.440> little

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
little tiny well it feels like little

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.380 
little tiny well it feels like little
bumps<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.219> over<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:35.760> I'm<00:00:35.910> sure<00:00:36.120> there's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
bumps all over it but I'm sure there's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.549

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
review this is just um me testing it out

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.520 
review this is just um me testing it out
of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> bag<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> mean<00:01:15.810> who<00:01:16.080> wouldn't

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
of the bag because I mean who wouldn't

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.760 
of the bag because I mean who wouldn't
do<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.810> out<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> bag<00:01:21.770> look

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
do this out of this out of the bag look

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.080 
do this out of this out of the bag look
like<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> worked<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
like it worked pretty well what do you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.690 
like it worked pretty well what do you
think<00:01:24.330> Chi<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> direct<00:01:25.920> sunlight<00:01:26.840> so

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
think Chi you got a direct sunlight so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.380 
think Chi you got a direct sunlight so
that<00:01:29.700> gives<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.479> an<00:01:30.720> indication<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that gives you an indication and if you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.850 
that gives you an indication and if you
think<00:01:33.630> about<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> takes<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.829> much

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
think about it it takes just as much

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.450 
think about it it takes just as much
time<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.700> would<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:37.079> were<00:01:37.460> vacuuming<00:01:38.509> a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
time as it would if you were vacuuming a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.359 
time as it would if you were vacuuming a
chair<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:41.880> whatever<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.990> that's<00:01:43.979> pretty<00:01:44.220> good

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
chair or whatever so that's pretty good

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.789 
chair or whatever so that's pretty good
