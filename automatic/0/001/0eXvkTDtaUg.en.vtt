00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello and welcome to the live 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.429
 with the silverling and the new me 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.429
 wanted to fight this very briefly 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 because that's what it is today 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.889
 we have to go through the whole day 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.889
 look at the matchmaker 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.860
 notice something we do not have 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.860
 turned 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.060
 not a decent heavy so 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.690
 not only that the 214 have no you 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.000
 have to condemn even a spd e75 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.620
 to get that is very uncomfortable 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.090
 That's why we decided 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.690
 just drive up to the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.690
 monastery as fast as possible and capel 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.800
 while doing that with our team completely 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.800
 can be used up in seconds 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.710
 So yes, I do not know dear 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.730
 please matchmaker please 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.489
 spread to at least next and the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.010
 Panzer a bit more meaningful because only 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.619
 mediums was just heavy it does not matter 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.550
 fun who the one team after another 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.200
 no matter how it ends because the medium if 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.229
 you a good pass cristo the no 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.640
 kills or you're going down mercilessly 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.960
 the heavy makes the halifax the same 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.280
 i could also bet that we are very 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.690
 My ski has much less on the field 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.130
 It really worked 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:37.600
 I'm going to give you 2000 differences 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.360
 that's how I was so very day 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.570
 pretty character comes I have something 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.570
 Not 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.630
 yes that was really the thing that had been going on 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.090
 quite often not today 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:06.330
 first time a game has it here already 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:08.940
 seen such a game that is nothing 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.619
 how to get over the cap and get it through the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.619
 is the rubbish 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.970
 I am now behind the first 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.930
 cap wait for the opposing team 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.200
 distributed a bit and then 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.200
 immediately 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.549
 Everything else is just not doing 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.549
 sense 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:38.230
 so their cut off that is also one 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.230
 the all flat kg 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 hey 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.519
 yes, that's the only thing you do 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.700
 We can only actually do it 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.840
 force them to come to us again 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.189
 open field so we shoot them down 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.579
 can or the weapon carrier to 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:10.549
 I just can not do that 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.689
 close window 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:23.720
 I come to build in his diligence 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:31.609
 WaffentrÃ¤ger now hit his cannon 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:31.609
 yes such a game it is 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.440
 did not expect anything else 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.000
 but as I said the plan could work 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:53.530
 I only have one percent off though 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.769
 i still live and who gives through the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.340
 Julian won that again 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.670
 firing a shot 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.400
 I also have promotions yes that 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:14.019
 love me again i need one 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:15.639
 lamp on the button the ball was running now 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.560
 By the way, Sundays on because today 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.820
 died for every dead tank is 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.090
 again five seconds high so 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.430
 not every time after the death of one 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.690
 panzers back up to five seconds like that 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.300
 You can also win if 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:34.000
 killing everyone so fast I have 919 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.169
 but you see that was not different 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.050
 to win and yes, that 's it 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.430
 first for the type 61 as a bonus video 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.430
 you're good at courage
