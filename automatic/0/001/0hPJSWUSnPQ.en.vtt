00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
guys welcome to my l2 + r2 dribbling

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.480 
guys welcome to my l2 + r2 dribbling
tutorial<00:00:03.480> I'm<00:00:04.200> gonna<00:00:04.440> start<00:00:04.710> with<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.980> basics

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
tutorial I'm gonna start with the basics

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.909 
tutorial I'm gonna start with the basics
and<00:00:05.580> ends<00:00:05.940> with<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.210> boosting<00:00:06.569> part<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.740> make

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
and ends with the boosting part so make

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.209 
and ends with the boosting part so make
sure<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.370> hang<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:08.880> there<00:00:09.080> I'm<00:00:10.080> holding<00:00:10.679> L<00:00:10.889> 2

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
sure to hang in there I'm holding L 2

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.980 
sure to hang in there I'm holding L 2
and<00:00:11.250> R<00:00:11.759> 2<00:00:11.940> simultaneously

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
and R 2 simultaneously

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
and R 2 simultaneously
could<00:00:13.530> see<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.040> control<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.460> Messi<00:00:14.820> is

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
could see that the control of Messi is

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.170 
could see that the control of Messi is
really<00:00:15.900> good<00:00:16.080> even<00:00:16.830> when<00:00:17.190> he<00:00:17.279> walks<00:00:17.490> backwards

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
really good even when he walks backwards

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.460 
really good even when he walks backwards
you<00:00:18.420> keep<00:00:18.830> facing<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> goal<00:00:20.840> so<00:00:21.840> all<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.350> have

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
you keep facing the goal so all you have

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.279 
you keep facing the goal so all you have
to<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.010> hold<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.580> alt<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.090> Auntie<00:00:24.900> r2

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
to do is hold the alt to Auntie r2

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.220 
to do is hold the alt to Auntie r2
button<00:00:25.619> simultaneously<00:00:26.630> now<00:00:27.630> let's<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
button simultaneously now let's have a

button simultaneously now let's have a
look<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:28.890> apply<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.340> into<00:00:29.730> your

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
look at how you can apply this into your

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.179 
look at how you can apply this into your
game<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.650> Alaba<00:00:32.009> I'm

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
game so you can see what Alaba I'm

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
game so you can see what Alaba I'm
holding<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> l2<00:00:32.910> +<00:00:33.030> r2<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.690> take<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> step

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
holding the l2 + r2 to take a step

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.590 
holding the l2 + r2 to take a step
backwards<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.070> order<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> pass<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.450> be

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
backwards in order for the pass to be

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.380 
backwards in order for the pass to be
able<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.989> reach<00:00:37.230> reburied<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.309> resulting<00:00:39.300> is

analog<00:01:16.869> stick<00:01:16.930> into<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.910> 45<00:01:19.420> degrees

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
analog stick into about the 45 degrees

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.520 
analog stick into about the 45 degrees
direction<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.790> player<00:01:22.030> will<00:01:22.330> have<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.200> great

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
direction the player will have a great

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.560 
direction the player will have a great
acceleration<00:01:24.310> into<00:01:24.460> space<00:01:24.850> which<00:01:25.210> can<00:01:25.420> be

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
acceleration into space which can be

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.980 
acceleration into space which can be
really<00:01:25.960> used<00:01:26.140> for<00:01:26.320> your<00:01:26.920> text<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.720> what<00:01:28.869> you

need to do is release the l2 button and
movie<00:01:31.930> left<00:01:32.140> analog<00:01:32.500> stick<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.979> about<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> 45

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
movie left analog stick in about a 45

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.040 
movie left analog stick in about a 45
degree<00:01:34.630> angle<00:01:34.979> releasing<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.070> button<00:01:36.220> and

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
degree angle releasing the button and

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.530 
degree angle releasing the button and
moving<00:01:38.050> an<00:01:38.140> analog<00:01:38.500> stick<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:39.729> practice<00:01:40.330> on

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
moving an analog stick also practice on

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.930 
moving an analog stick also practice on
the<00:01:40.900> direction<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.500> need<00:01:41.710> your<00:01:42.490> player<00:01:42.700> won't

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
the direction you need your player won't

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.300 
the direction you need your player won't
be<00:01:43.090> sluggish<00:01:43.509> but<00:01:43.720> really<00:01:44.050> dusted<00:01:45.009> great

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
be sluggish but really dusted great

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.670 
be sluggish but really dusted great
acceleration<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.870> angle<00:01:47.260> is<00:01:47.350> really

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
acceleration the angle is really

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.760 
acceleration the angle is really
important<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.630> can<00:01:49.750> see<00:01:49.990> this<00:01:50.230> was<00:01:50.409> me

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
important as you can see this was me

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.550 
important as you can see this was me
using<00:01:51.190> it<00:01:51.250> in<00:01:51.490> FIFA<00:01:51.820> 13<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.990> us<00:01:53.140> way<00:01:53.530> more

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
using it in FIFA 13 to us way more

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.950 
using it in FIFA 13 to us way more
powerful<00:01:54.159> then<00:01:54.490> but<00:01:54.760> now<00:01:55.450> let's<00:01:55.659> have<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.810> look

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
powerful then but now let's have a look

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.910 
powerful then but now let's have a look
at<00:01:56.140> how<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.770> can<00:01:56.950> use<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.490> FIFA<00:01:57.880> 14<00:01:58.150> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
at how it you can use it in FIFA 14 and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.250 
at how it you can use it in FIFA 14 and
I<00:01:59.920> had<00:02:00.280> some<00:02:00.550> clips<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:00.909> FIFA<00:02:01.210> 13<00:02:01.240> as<00:02:01.750> well<00:02:01.930> so

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
I had some clips of FIFA 13 as well so

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.399 
I had some clips of FIFA 13 as well so
let's<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.979> look<00:02:03.100> at<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.260> see

let's have a look at this you can see

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.080 
let's have a look at this you can see
Messi<00:02:06.010> I'm<00:02:06.280> using<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.270> l2<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.810> r2

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
Messi I'm using the l2 and r2

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.370 
Messi I'm using the l2 and r2
acceleration<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.209> get<00:02:10.390> past<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.840> opponent

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
acceleration to get past that opponent

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.670 
acceleration to get past that opponent
and<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:13.299> trade<00:02:13.540> ball<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:13.930> creates<00:02:14.320> all<00:02:14.530> that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
and the trade ball just creates all that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.590 
and the trade ball just creates all that
space<00:02:14.980> which<00:02:15.340> make<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.820> co-op<00:02:16.030> possible

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
space which make this co-op possible

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.690 
space which make this co-op possible
here<00:02:17.140> we<00:02:17.230> go<00:02:17.380> again<00:02:17.500> holding<00:02:17.950> L<00:02:18.100> 2<00:02:18.250> R<00:02:18.400> 2<00:02:18.430> and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
here we go again holding L 2 R 2 and

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.060 
here we go again holding L 2 R 2 and
quickly<00:02:19.120> release<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.720> l2<00:02:19.870> holding<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.830> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
quickly release in the l2 holding it and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.699 
quickly release in the l2 holding it and
release<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.610> out<00:02:21.730> 2<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.959> pass<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.440> player

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
release the out 2 so a pass this player

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.610 
release the out 2 so a pass this player
give<00:02:24.340> me<00:02:24.549> all<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:24.940> space<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.480> now<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.930> put

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
give me all this space so now I can put

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.770 
give me all this space so now I can put
off<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.920> series<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.430> skill<00:02:27.700> moves<00:02:28.000> but

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
off the series of skill moves but

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.390 
off the series of skill moves but
without<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.350> starting<00:02:29.739> dribble<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.190> would

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
without that starting dribble I would

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.280 
without that starting dribble I would
have<00:02:30.549> never<00:02:30.700> had<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> space<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.660> perform<00:02:32.140> all

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
have never had a space to perform all

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.460 
have never had a space to perform all
these<00:02:32.380> skill<00:02:32.650> moves<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.640> it's<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.880> great<00:02:34.150> goal

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
these skill moves and it's a great goal

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.170 
these skill moves and it's a great goal
so<00:02:35.470> here<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.620> am<00:02:35.799> holding<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.310> l2<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.730> r2<00:02:36.790> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
so here I am holding the l2 and r2 and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.720 
so here I am holding the l2 and r2 and
are<00:02:37.480> releasing<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.049> l2<00:02:38.730> simultaneously

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
are releasing the l2 simultaneously

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.490 
are releasing the l2 simultaneously
moving<00:02:40.060> my<00:02:40.269> left<00:02:40.450> stick<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.989> upper<00:02:41.320> right

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
moving my left stick to the upper right

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.180 
moving my left stick to the upper right
which<00:02:42.100> results<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:42.910> acceleration<00:02:43.600> and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
which results in this acceleration and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.160 
which results in this acceleration and
nice<00:02:45.190> kill<00:02:45.459> move<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.120> it's<00:02:46.540> again<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> good

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
nice kill move and it's again a good

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.100 
nice kill move and it's again a good
goal<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:49.030> we<00:02:49.090> go<00:02:49.239> my<00:02:49.390> seller<00:02:49.600> gets<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.930> ball

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
goal here we go my seller gets the ball

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.770 
goal here we go my seller gets the ball
I<00:02:50.290> start<00:02:50.860> with<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.040> L<00:02:51.220> 2<00:02:51.430> r2<00:02:51.790> acceleration

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
I start with the L 2 r2 acceleration

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.540 
I start with the L 2 r2 acceleration
into<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.920> space<00:02:54.459> on<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.730> wing

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
into the space on the wing

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.910 
into the space on the wing
then<00:02:55.820> I'm<00:02:55.940> holding<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.360> l2<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.780> r2<00:02:56.930> again<00:02:57.470> to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
then I'm holding the l2 and r2 again to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.250 
then I'm holding the l2 and r2 again to
do<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> little<00:02:58.310> step<00:02:58.550> back<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.750> I'm<00:02:59.870> able<00:03:00.050> to

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260

Ronaldo L 2 R 2 and then releasing the
l2<00:03:22.040> for<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.460> boost<00:03:22.700> after<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.600> go<00:03:23.840> in<00:03:23.960> the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
l2 for that boost after I go in the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.650 
l2 for that boost after I go in the
right<00:03:24.230> position<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:26.060> between<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.510> two

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
right position in between the two

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.870 
right position in between the two
defenders<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.350> now<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:27.830> wanted<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.370> accelerate

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
defenders so now I wanted to accelerate

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.720 
defenders so now I wanted to accelerate
a<00:03:28.910> minute<00:03:29.300> correct<00:03:29.630> but<00:03:29.840> I'm<00:03:30.280> giving<00:03:31.280> here<00:03:31.520> and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
a minute correct but I'm giving here and

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.770 
a minute correct but I'm giving here and
release<00:03:32.030> me<00:03:32.240> out<00:03:32.360> too

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
release me out too

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.600 
release me out too
I<00:03:32.810> noticed<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.680> space<00:03:33.980> in<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.190> upper<00:03:34.280> right

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
I noticed it space in the upper right

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.120 
I noticed it space in the upper right
and<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.000> want<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.240> make<00:03:35.390> use<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.630> that<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.890> use

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
and I want to make use of that so I use

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.040 
and I want to make use of that so I use
the<00:03:37.310> acceleration<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.300> go<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.810> upper

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
the acceleration and go to the upper

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.290 
the acceleration and go to the upper
right<00:03:39.230> which<00:03:39.890> gives<00:03:40.160> me<00:03:40.310> all<00:03:40.520> this<00:03:40.700> space<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:41.270> I

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
right which gives me all this space so I

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.120 
right which gives me all this space so I
can<00:03:41.540> do<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:41.840> amazing<00:03:42.110> dribble

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.980 

here<00:03:47.130> holding<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.550> l2r<00:03:47.880> -<00:03:48.210> waiting<00:03:48.660> for<00:03:48.840> him

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.560 
here holding the l2r - waiting for him
to<00:03:49.230> get<00:03:49.740> on<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.950> defensive<00:03:50.460> line<00:03:50.520> then<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.330> give

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
to get on the defensive line then I give

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.449 
to get on the defensive line then I give
him<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> pass

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.849 

again<00:03:55.420> waiting<00:03:55.840> for<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.079> right<00:03:56.260> time<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.709> give

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
again waiting for the right time to give

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.209 
again waiting for the right time to give

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
that past by holding the alt or two

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.420 
that past by holding the alt or two
combination

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
combination

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.869 
combination
this<00:04:01.090> was<00:04:01.269> FIFA<00:04:01.540> 13<00:04:01.569> by<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.140> way<00:04:02.579> I'm<00:04:03.579> not<00:04:03.640> as

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
this was FIFA 13 by the way I'm not as

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.119 
this was FIFA 13 by the way I'm not as
Tribble<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:04.329> can<00:04:04.480> see<00:04:04.659> I'm<00:04:04.900> again<00:04:05.319> using<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
Tribble you can see I'm again using the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.309 
Tribble you can see I'm again using the
alto<00:04:06.400> are<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.760> boost<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.659> gives<00:04:07.870> me<00:04:07.989> all<00:04:08.140> this

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
alto are to boost it gives me all this

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.399 
alto are to boost it gives me all this
space<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:09.579> I'm<00:04:10.359> gonna<00:04:10.569> do<00:04:10.750> some<00:04:10.900> skill<00:04:11.139> moves

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
space so I'm gonna do some skill moves

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.399 
space so I'm gonna do some skill moves
the<00:04:11.560> first<00:04:11.799> one<00:04:12.010> was<00:04:12.700> a<00:04:12.730> bit<00:04:13.209> redundant<00:04:13.750> the

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
the first one was a bit redundant the

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.319 
the first one was a bit redundant the
second<00:04:14.769> one<00:04:14.920> was<00:04:15.159> needed<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:15.879> results<00:04:16.269> in

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
second one was needed and it results in

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.810 
second one was needed and it results in
it<00:04:16.449> go<00:04:16.660> now<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.500> little<00:04:17.829> skill<00:04:18.039> move<00:04:18.310> can

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
it go now a little skill move can

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.789 
it go now a little skill move can
acceleration<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.810> right<00:04:19.989> will<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.680> give

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
acceleration to the right will you give

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.560 
acceleration to the right will you give
me<00:04:20.889> just<00:04:21.039> place<00:04:21.280> any<00:04:21.489> momentum<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.210> do<00:04:22.360> that

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
me just place any momentum to do that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.680 
me just place any momentum to do that
other<00:04:22.750> skill<00:04:23.050> move<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:24.389> after<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.449> skill

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
other skill move and after the skill

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.140 
other skill move and after the skill
move<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:26.020> can<00:04:26.169> shoot<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.470> into<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.740> goal<00:04:27.150> you

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
move I can shoot it into the goal you

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.790 
move I can shoot it into the goal you
can<00:04:28.389> see<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.660> acceleration<00:04:28.900> out<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.590> nowhere

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
can see the acceleration out of nowhere

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.219 
can see the acceleration out of nowhere
created<00:04:30.400> chance<00:04:30.669> and<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:30.970> girl<00:04:31.229> now

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
created chance and a girl now

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.460 
created chance and a girl now
acceleration<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.430> back<00:04:33.610> line<00:04:33.849> which<00:04:34.780> caso

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
acceleration to the back line which caso

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.830 
acceleration to the back line which caso
makes<00:04:35.710> me<00:04:35.889> able<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.820> give<00:04:37.060> this<00:04:37.180> nice<00:04:37.389> assist

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
makes me able to give this nice assist

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.320 
makes me able to give this nice assist
so<00:04:38.229> again<00:04:38.560> no<00:04:38.889> dangerous<00:04:39.310> situation<00:04:39.820> ago<00:04:40.030> at

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
so again no dangerous situation ago at

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.830 
so again no dangerous situation ago at
all<00:04:40.539> a<00:04:40.930> duty<00:04:41.289> acceleration<00:04:42.099> and<00:04:42.389> at<00:04:43.389> that

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
all a duty acceleration and at that

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.230 
all a duty acceleration and at that
right<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.440> analog<00:04:44.979> stick<00:04:45.250> tip<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.940> do<00:04:46.090> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
right the analog stick tip to do the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.230 
right the analog stick tip to do the
extra<00:04:46.900> extra<00:04:47.470> acceleration<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.669> results<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.180> a

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
extra extra acceleration it results in a

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.480 
extra extra acceleration it results in a
go<00:04:49.949> this<00:04:50.949> one<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:51.639> an<00:04:51.880> acceleration<00:04:53.490> again

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
go this one so an acceleration again

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.879 
go this one so an acceleration again
nothing<00:04:54.880> up<00:04:55.030> not<00:04:55.419> in<00:04:55.599> the<00:04:55.780> up<00:04:55.930> at<00:04:56.080> all<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.770> the

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
nothing up not in the up at all to the

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.629 
nothing up not in the up at all to the
acceleration<00:04:57.340> at<00:04:57.699> to<00:04:57.820> go<00:04:59.070> so<00:05:00.070> this<00:05:00.370> was<00:05:00.490> my

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
acceleration at to go so this was my

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.600 
acceleration at to go so this was my
first<00:05:00.849> tutorial<00:05:01.510> I<00:05:02.080> hope<00:05:02.289> you<00:05:02.349> liked<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:02.860> I'm

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
first tutorial I hope you liked it I'm

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.260 
first tutorial I hope you liked it I'm
not<00:05:03.760> sure<00:05:04.000> how<00:05:04.180> it's<00:05:04.389> gonna<00:05:04.659> work<00:05:04.750> for<00:05:04.930> FIFA<00:05:05.260> 15

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
not sure how it's gonna work for FIFA 15

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.939 
not sure how it's gonna work for FIFA 15
for<00:05:07.270> FIFA<00:05:07.510> 13<00:05:07.539> it<00:05:08.139> was<00:05:08.260> really<00:05:08.620> better<00:05:08.830> than

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
for FIFA 13 it was really better than

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.110 
for FIFA 13 it was really better than
for<00:05:09.220> FIFA<00:05:09.370> 14

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
for FIFA 14

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.719 
for FIFA 14
but<00:05:10.750> however<00:05:10.930> for<00:05:11.320> FIFA<00:05:11.530> 15<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:12.130> am<00:05:12.400> gonna

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
but however for FIFA 15 I am gonna

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.730 
but however for FIFA 15 I am gonna
upload<00:05:13.000> some<00:05:14.280> some<00:05:15.280> tutorials<00:05:16.199> so<00:05:17.199> if<00:05:17.590> you're
