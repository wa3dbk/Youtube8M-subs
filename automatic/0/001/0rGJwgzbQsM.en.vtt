00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.300

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:19.240
 gringo I'm here to present one 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.920
 new column in this section I will talk 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.770
 of the best and in everyday life 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.330
 how it affects us in this first 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.000
 episode will talk about gamers 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.160
 in real life describe how these 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.410
 players behave behind the screen 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.379
 and the actions they perform in one 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.220
 unpleasant or pleasant situation 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:44.570
 first typology that analyzes 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:47.320
 and shows that of the beloved realplayer e 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.320
 do not play 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:58.580
 that is, the opposite can well know therefore I must 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:01.240
 let's see if so-so though 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.240
 it does not seem 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.170
 I find that I understood so much real plot 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.760
 and you that like you have seen kids better 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.560
 if that guy invited video home 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.090
 to play is rather prepared 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.130
 otherwise he puts it in the middle of his balls 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.360
 throughout the evening the second type 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.920
 it's about our talented pacifists 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.990
 linger stupendously as one spoke 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.950
 yield of pomepi we play a little 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.830
 call of Duty 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.560
 hello guys how much i am 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.869
 insulted mom when she left me 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.869
 pois yesterday I was doing food 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:59.509
 he killed iomega again maybe 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:02:01.490
 making a men I would let them play though 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.300
 my game and already you will go out 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.070
 punishment these people do not care 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.979
 wording the game but simply 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.120
 have fun and participate in parties from 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.120
 their degree in motion 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.000
 it is not enough to participate with its models 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.400
 where you have to win the third type is 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.830
 the one concerning the dear nathans 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.020
 drake and that playstation or even in the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.240
 post the so - called Romans too are 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.000
 50 platinum but then all these 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.740
 including today I immediately have ordinary things 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:51.640
 would not make people in a row that cures 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:53.530
 look typology the camper arrives these 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.890
 little devils have fun at 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.840
 hide in the most unlikely places 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.670
 not even like gamma hide and seek 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.760
 if this strategy could be done 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:10.310
 take place in the not too distant future 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:13.739
 of donated with vico then of bologna but 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.530
 who is that nun who beats reporters and 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.530
 I close by going but also by ticket 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.530
 puts you ahead calm but that I 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:33.980
 fuck you not like the same type 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.980
 is that of the hardcore player alphabet 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.730
 these people who make the world seen 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.829
 as a profession they speak then 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.079
 only in English do they use invoke a 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.970
 close it in the new shopping mall 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.040
 taking into consideration the hours that 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.959
 they go on ahead of the race amazes me 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.980
 when they don't have blocks 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:05.849
 kidney or something 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:09.739
 the seventh type thanks concern i 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.739
 so-called passionate videogames 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.800
 break these people out of turn 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.600
 bitter to admire the landscapes of the 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.090
 video games remain for hours 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.100
 in front of the large structures of the 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.949
 video games like you saw assassin is 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:05:16.880
 the most plausible example of these is there 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:05:19.550
 are of course many other others 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.010
 guys hope the first episode of 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.289

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.270
 no 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:13.020
 the same type and with the same 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:18.110
 typology and the same typology is 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.110
 the same type
