problem with that the other day I put
loads<00:00:18.529> of<00:00:18.740> pressure<00:00:18.950> on<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.250> fork<00:00:19.520> and

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
loads of pressure on the fork and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.060 
loads of pressure on the fork and
instead<00:00:20.690> of<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.869> fork<00:00:21.110> seal<00:00:21.350> popping<00:00:21.710> out<00:00:21.830> it

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
instead of the fork seal popping out it

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.960 
instead of the fork seal popping out it
just<00:00:22.250> went<00:00:22.400> and<00:00:23.350> peed<00:00:24.350> up<00:00:24.560> fork<00:00:25.189> or<00:00:25.400> light<00:00:25.640> but

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
just went and peed up fork or light but

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.030 
just went and peed up fork or light but
didn't<00:00:26.689> loosen<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.080> see<00:00:27.259> a<00:00:27.290> little<00:00:27.619> once

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
didn't loosen the see a little once

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.380 
didn't loosen the see a little once
you've<00:00:28.220> lost<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:28.520> pressure<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:29.029> game<00:00:29.270> is

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
you've lost the pressure that game is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.960 
you've lost the pressure that game is
pretty<00:00:29.540> much<00:00:29.750> gone<00:00:29.990> so<00:00:30.439> I<00:00:30.680> need<00:00:31.610> to<00:00:31.759> find

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
pretty much gone so I need to find

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.170 
pretty much gone so I need to find
another<00:00:32.090> way<00:00:32.419> I<00:00:32.750> also<00:00:33.590> wanted<00:00:33.980> to<00:00:34.190> be<00:00:34.850> able<00:00:34.940> to

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
another way I also wanted to be able to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.360 
another way I also wanted to be able to

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
bushes in them and reuse the brushes

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.680 
bushes in them and reuse the brushes
because<00:00:41.809> they're<00:00:41.960> very<00:00:42.079> expensive<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:42.739> buy<00:00:43.690> so

and<00:03:11.900> there's<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.170> bolt<00:03:12.440> out<00:03:12.710> there<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.430> a

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
and there's the bolt out there is a

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.890 
and there's the bolt out there is a

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
actually still in the fork I'm not

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.000 
actually still in the fork I'm not
worrying<00:03:17.660> about<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.900> I'll<00:03:18.620> just<00:03:18.800> leave<00:03:18.980> it

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
worrying about that I'll just leave it

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.410 
worrying about that I'll just leave it
there<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.520> check<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.030> still<00:03:20.240> there

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
there and check that it's still there

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.860 
there and check that it's still there
when<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.600> put<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:20.930> bolt<00:03:21.110> back<00:03:21.170> in<00:03:22.420> this<00:03:23.420> is<00:03:23.480> also

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
when I put the bolt back in this is also

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.600 
when I put the bolt back in this is also
an<00:03:23.960> excellent<00:03:24.230> chance<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.770> dribble<00:03:25.220> some<00:03:25.460> more

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
an excellent chance to dribble some more

tough<00:04:14.750> grade<00:04:15.740> suspension<00:04:16.430> bolt<00:04:16.670> through

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
tough grade suspension bolt through

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.970 
tough grade suspension bolt through
which<00:04:17.450> is<00:04:17.600> going<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.810> act<00:04:18.020> as<00:04:18.260> my<00:04:18.380> puller<00:04:18.650> so

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
which is going to act as my puller so

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.060 
which is going to act as my puller so
you<00:04:19.040> need<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.310> washer<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.960> inside<00:04:21.440> which<00:04:21.799> is

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
you need a washer on the inside which is

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.130 
you need a washer on the inside which is
the<00:04:22.850> bolt<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.330> then<00:04:23.450> pull<00:04:23.660> against<00:04:23.900> without

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
the bolt can then pull against without

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.250 
the bolt can then pull against without
damaging<00:04:24.650> your<00:04:24.740> top<00:04:25.010> bolt<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:27.050> could

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
damaging your top bolt you could

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.830 
damaging your top bolt you could
actually<00:04:27.410> put<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:28.010> bush<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:29.000> some<00:04:29.240> kind<00:04:29.540> through

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
actually put a bush of some kind through

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.020 
actually put a bush of some kind through
there<00:04:29.990> just<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.320> guide<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.710> but<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.860> find<00:04:31.160> when

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
there just to guide it but I find when

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.820 
there just to guide it but I find when
it's<00:04:32.180> nicely<00:04:32.600> centered<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.200> board<00:04:33.440> that

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it's nicely centered on the board that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.770 
it's nicely centered on the board that
essentially<00:04:34.400> anyway<00:04:34.670> so<00:04:34.730> it's<00:04:34.940> not<00:04:35.120> an<00:04:35.210> issue

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
essentially anyway so it's not an issue

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.920 
essentially anyway so it's not an issue
the<00:04:36.290> next<00:04:36.530> thing<00:04:36.650> we<00:04:36.740> need<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.920> do<00:04:37.160> is<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:38.060> screw

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
the next thing we need to do is to screw

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.540 
the next thing we need to do is to screw
this<00:04:39.200> into<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.800> top<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.190> okay<00:04:42.340> now<00:04:43.340> we've

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
this into the top of the okay now we've

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.470 
this into the top of the okay now we've
just<00:04:43.580> put<00:04:43.910> our<00:04:44.090> special<00:04:45.100> adapted<00:04:46.100> top<00:04:47.000> bolt<00:04:47.240> in

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
just put our special adapted top bolt in

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.410 
just put our special adapted top bolt in
this<00:04:48.290> is<00:04:49.010> loose<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.610> pull<00:04:49.820> through<00:04:50.030> here<00:04:50.300> and

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
this is loose to pull through here and

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.130 
this is loose to pull through here and
it<00:04:50.570> will<00:04:50.630> center<00:04:51.080> nicely<00:04:52.510> so<00:04:53.510> all<00:04:53.810> we<00:04:53.960> need<00:04:54.080> to

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
it will center nicely so all we need to

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.280 
it will center nicely so all we need to
do<00:04:54.320> now<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.860> attach<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.610> our<00:04:55.870> pulling<00:04:56.870> jig

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
do now is attach it to our pulling jig

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.520 
do now is attach it to our pulling jig
type<00:04:57.740> plank<00:04:58.570> right<00:04:59.570> now<00:04:59.720> so<00:04:59.780> here<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:00.200> have<00:05:00.320> our

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
type plank right now so here we have our

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.320 
type plank right now so here we have our
pulling<00:05:00.890> device<00:05:01.190> which<00:05:01.460> basically<00:05:01.760> consists

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
pulling device which basically consists

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.120 
pulling device which basically consists

you want it to float so that you're
pulling<00:06:12.770> level<00:06:13.340> so<00:06:14.290> that's<00:06:15.290> that<00:06:15.530> unsorted

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
pulling level so that's that unsorted

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.270 
pulling level so that's that unsorted
really<00:06:16.750> now<00:06:17.750> you<00:06:17.780> might<00:06:18.050> want<00:06:18.260> to<00:06:18.410> grind<00:06:19.040> a

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
really now you might want to grind a

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.110 
really now you might want to grind a
couple<00:06:19.580> of<00:06:19.640> flats<00:06:19.910> on<00:06:20.150> this<00:06:20.330> bolt<00:06:21.730> shaft<00:06:22.730> here

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
couple of flats on this bolt shaft here

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.180 
couple of flats on this bolt shaft here
just<00:06:23.750> to<00:06:23.870> hold<00:06:24.080> it<00:06:24.350> so<00:06:24.620> that<00:06:24.650> when<00:06:24.860> you<00:06:24.950> do<00:06:25.070> the

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
just to hold it so that when you do the

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.100 
just to hold it so that when you do the
nut<00:06:25.400> Hut<00:06:25.640> this<00:06:25.940> doesn't<00:06:26.270> spin<00:06:26.510> on<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.720> inside

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
nut Hut this doesn't spin on the inside

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.900 
nut Hut this doesn't spin on the inside
but<00:06:27.260> I<00:06:27.320> find<00:06:27.710> that's<00:06:27.830> fine<00:06:28.130> and<00:06:28.370> she's<00:06:28.430> a<00:06:28.610> pair

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
but I find that's fine and she's a pair

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.880 
but I find that's fine and she's a pair
of<00:06:28.940> grips<00:06:29.420> to<00:06:29.660> grab<00:06:30.200> it<00:06:30.350> and<00:06:30.380> as<00:06:30.560> soon<00:06:30.710> as<00:06:30.800> it

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
of grips to grab it and as soon as it

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.350 
of grips to grab it and as soon as it
gets<00:06:30.980> ready<00:06:31.220> to<00:06:31.340> be<00:06:31.580> tight<00:06:31.850> it<00:06:32.060> stopped

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
hopefully seeing well as far as you can

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.839 
hopefully seeing well as far as you can
see<00:07:20.389> here<00:07:20.800> definite<00:07:21.800> movement<00:07:22.219> of<00:07:22.370> that<00:07:22.490> seal

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
see here definite movement of that seal

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.869 
see here definite movement of that seal
now<00:07:23.150> because<00:07:23.419> you<00:07:23.509> can<00:07:23.659> no<00:07:23.840> longer<00:07:23.870> see<00:07:24.650> the

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 
now because you can no longer see the

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:28.390 
now because you can no longer see the
place<00:07:25.879> where<00:07:25.909> the<00:07:26.300> metal<00:07:26.659> clip<00:07:26.930> those<00:07:27.199> so<00:07:27.740> it's

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
place where the metal clip those so it's

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.869 
place where the metal clip those so it's
probably<00:07:28.699> move<00:07:28.940> three<00:07:29.569> or<00:07:29.690> four<00:07:29.930> mil<00:07:30.199> so<00:07:30.530> far

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:30.879 
probably move three or four mil so far

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:34.469 
probably move three or four mil so far
