00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
set up top here up the stairs so we can

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.310 
set up top here up the stairs so we can
just<00:00:33.210> wait<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:33.660> them<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> come<00:00:33.989> pouring

around<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.770> corner<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.460> hopefully

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
around this corner here and hopefully

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.299 
around this corner here and hopefully
motion<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:36.390> start<00:00:36.630> rushing<00:00:37.140> us<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.129> just

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
motion will start rushing us we can just

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.740 
motion will start rushing us we can just
hide<00:00:38.520> around<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.910> corner<00:00:39.239> where<00:00:39.540> I'll<00:00:39.629> be

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
hide around this corner where I'll be

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950 
hide around this corner where I'll be
safe<00:00:40.020> from<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.590> turret<00:00:41.219> damage<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.780> guy

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
safe from the turret damage but the guy

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.010 
safe from the turret damage but the guy
with<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.280> scorcher<00:00:44.280> does<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> fair<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
with the scorcher does do a fair bit of

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.869 
with the scorcher does do a fair bit of
damage<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.770> berserkers<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
damage to the berserkers because the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910 
damage to the berserkers because the
berserkers<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.600> susceptible<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.440> flame

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
berserkers are susceptible to flame

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.729 
berserkers are susceptible to flame
damage<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.840> he<00:00:51.840> takes<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.469> first

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
damage and he takes out the first

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.380 
damage and he takes out the first
bazooka<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.760> least<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.059> took<00:00:54.210> out

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
bazooka here but at least we took out

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.760 
bazooka here but at least we took out
one<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> Onyx<00:00:56.940> God<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:58.320> guy<00:00:58.500> comes

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
one of the Onyx God and it guy comes

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
one of the Onyx God and it guy comes
down<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> stairs<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> silver<00:01:00.030> back<00:01:00.210> here

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
down the stairs in a silver back here

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
down the stairs in a silver back here
which<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.809> good<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.350> chairman

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
which is good it's actually chairman

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.969 
which is good it's actually chairman
Prescott<00:01:02.579> take<00:01:03.510> him<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.650> helps

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
Prescott take him out and that helps

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.100 
Prescott take him out and that helps
extend<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> time<00:01:05.790> quite<00:01:06.360> significantly

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
extend the time quite significantly

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.690 
extend the time quite significantly
though<00:01:07.320> we've<00:01:07.500> got<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.070> obviously<00:01:08.280> in

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
though we've got because obviously in

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.570 
though we've got because obviously in
base<00:01:08.909> mode<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.320> time<00:01:10.770> limit<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
base mode you have a time limit that you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.929 
base mode you have a time limit that you
have<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.600> order<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.990> finish<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.740> waves<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
have in order to finish the waves so you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
have in order to finish the waves so you
have<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.299> finish<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.720> waves<00:01:15.900> within<00:01:16.140> time

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
have to finish the waves within time

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
have to finish the waves within time
limit<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.460> fail<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.960> took<00:01:19.110> out<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
limit or you do fail and we took out a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.830 
limit or you do fail and we took out a
number<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.770> Onyx<00:01:20.009> guard<00:01:20.310> there<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> it's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
number of Onyx guard there so it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390 
number of Onyx guard there so it's
really<00:01:22.020> ideal<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.830> hang<00:01:23.009> around<00:01:23.159> this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
really ideal if you can hang around this

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
really ideal if you can hang around this
corner<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.119> wait<00:01:24.810> from<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> rush

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
corner and just wait from the rush

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.289 
corner and just wait from the rush
around<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.920> corner<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> hopefully<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.119> take

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
around the corner and hopefully we take

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
around the corner and hopefully we take
out<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> majority<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:28.110> them<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.860> before

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
out the majority of them this way before

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.830 
out the majority of them this way before
we<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.790> venture<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.570> where<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
we have to venture up to where the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
we have to venture up to where the
turrets<00:01:31.229> are<00:01:31.350> set<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> do

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
turrets are set up that are going to do

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.280 
turrets are set up that are going to do
as<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> lot<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.299> damage<00:01:33.720> once<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.439> there

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
as a lot of damage once we get up there

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.630 
as a lot of damage once we get up there
all<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.710> we'll<00:01:37.860> run<00:01:38.009> through<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> first

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
all right so we'll run through the first

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.340 
all right so we'll run through the first
barrier<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.689> these<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
barrier here and these are all the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.080 
barrier here and these are all the
highest<00:01:40.799> level<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.189> fortifications

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
highest level of fortifications

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
highest level of fortifications
obviously<00:01:42.689> you've<00:01:42.869> got<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.290> red<00:01:43.829> laser<00:01:44.189> laser

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
obviously you've got the red laser laser

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.630 
obviously you've got the red laser laser
barriers<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.960> troika<00:01:46.530> flame<00:01:46.890> turrets<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
barriers the troika flame turrets and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.550 
barriers the troika flame turrets and
all<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.509> stuff<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.049> well<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:52.170> Onyx

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
all that stuff as well and the Onyx

to down them and then finish them off
once<00:01:59.729> they're<00:01:59.939> down<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.570> they're<00:02:00.719> pretty<00:02:00.869> hard

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
once they're down so they're pretty hard

seconds<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.090> I'll<00:02:06.750> try<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.140> extend<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
seconds here I'll try and extend the

seconds here I'll try and extend the
time<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:08.190> bit<00:02:08.340> by<00:02:08.520> running<00:02:08.729> through<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
time a little bit by running through and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.720 
time a little bit by running through and
destroying<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:10.470> many<00:02:10.679> fortifications<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
pushing it a little bit here we'll see

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.750 
pushing it a little bit here we'll see
how<00:02:36.299> we<00:02:36.360> go<00:02:36.629> and<00:02:37.099> I'll<00:02:38.099> take<00:02:38.280> out<00:02:38.459> some<00:02:38.700> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
how we go and I'll take out some of

how we go and I'll take out some of
these<00:02:38.849> fortifications<00:02:39.180> once<00:02:39.870> again<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:41.459> were

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
these fortifications once again we were

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.339 
these fortifications once again we were
down<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.940> nine<00:02:42.000> seconds<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.200> did

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
down to nine seconds there but it did

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.240 
down to nine seconds there but it did
extend<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.859> time<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.099> little<00:02:44.370> bit<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:46.250> six

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
extend the time a little bit and six

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.660 
extend the time a little bit and six
guys<00:02:47.459> left<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:48.060> kill<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.760> puny<00:02:51.239> humans<00:02:51.780> are

guys left to kill the puny humans are

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.009 
guys left to kill the puny humans are
hopefully<00:02:53.670> they<00:02:53.819> won't<00:02:54.000> put<00:02:54.209> up<00:02:54.329> too<00:02:54.629> much<00:02:54.840> of

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
hopefully they won't put up too much of

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.289 
hopefully they won't put up too much of
a<00:02:55.079> fight<00:02:55.379> here<00:02:55.709> at<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.889> end<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.970> we'll<00:02:57.090> take

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
a fight here at the end and we'll take

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.490 
a fight here at the end and we'll take
out<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.750> last<00:02:58.049> turret<00:02:58.680> I<00:03:00.170> was<00:03:01.170> doing<00:03:01.409> this

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
out this last turret I was doing this

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.990 
out this last turret I was doing this
fair<00:03:01.829> bit<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.010> damage<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.519> I've<00:03:02.609> only<00:03:02.730> got

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
fair bit of damage and I've only got

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.039 
fair bit of damage and I've only got
seven<00:03:03.810> six<00:03:04.760> down<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.909> six<00:03:06.180> seconds<00:03:06.659> there<00:03:06.870> but

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
seven six down to six seconds there but

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.690 
seven six down to six seconds there but
we<00:03:07.139> did<00:03:07.319> manage<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.680> extend<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:08.250> time<00:03:08.459> once

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
we did manage to extend a time once

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.319 
we did manage to extend a time once
again<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.299> take<00:03:10.139> out<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.379> decoy<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:14.329> have

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
again and take out that decoy and have

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.349 
again and take out that decoy and have
to<00:03:15.480> get<00:03:15.629> another<00:03:15.870> Berserker<00:03:16.500> here<00:03:16.849> top<00:03:17.849> at<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
to get another Berserker here top at the

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.170 
to get another Berserker here top at the
time<00:03:18.569> sticking<00:03:18.930> down<00:03:19.260> once<00:03:19.919> again<00:03:20.129> so<00:03:21.090> we're

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
time sticking down once again so we're

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.180 
time sticking down once again so we're
going<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.329> have<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.569> try<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.840> extend<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.500> we

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
going to have to try and extend it we

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.869 
going to have to try and extend it we
still<00:03:23.400> got<00:03:23.579> six<00:03:23.790> guys<00:03:24.090> left<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:25.879> thankfully

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
still got six guys left and thankfully

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.520 
still got six guys left and thankfully
they<00:03:27.000> start<00:03:27.329> rushing<00:03:27.720> me<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> little<00:03:28.079> bit<00:03:28.290> here

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
they start rushing me a little bit here

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.319 
they start rushing me a little bit here
so<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.799> take<00:03:29.129> out<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.790> couple<00:03:30.569> of<00:03:30.810> them<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:32.329> that

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329
