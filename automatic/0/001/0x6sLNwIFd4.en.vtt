well<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.350> can<00:01:06.530> tell<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:06.830> car<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.310> me<00:01:07.460> that

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
well I can tell you this car to me that

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.430 
well I can tell you this car to me that
there's<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:07.940> much<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.180> say<00:01:08.420> I'm<00:01:09.050> just<00:01:09.140> gonna

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.090 

thank<00:01:12.440> you<00:01:12.619> what's<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.430> 675<00:01:14.649> first<00:01:15.649> of<00:01:15.800> all<00:01:15.920> to

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
thank you what's the 675 first of all to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.650 
thank you what's the 675 first of all to
understand<00:01:16.460> what<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.640> nega<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.090> do<00:01:17.300> it's<00:01:17.450> about

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
understand what the nega I do it's about

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.050 
understand what the nega I do it's about
proportions<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.430> end<00:01:19.460> what<00:01:19.910> we<00:01:20.000> be

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
proportions and to that end what we be

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.090 
proportions and to that end what we be
able<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.270> do<00:01:20.390> with<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:20.630> car<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.350> shape<00:01:21.920> the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
able to do with this car is shape the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100 
able to do with this car is shape the
car<00:01:22.310> exactly<00:01:22.790> as<00:01:23.000> we<00:01:23.090> want<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.390> because<00:01:23.479> this

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
car exactly as we want it because this

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.830 
car exactly as we want it because this
is<00:01:24.259> a<00:01:24.290> hybrid<00:01:25.000> because<00:01:26.000> all<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.360> components

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
is a hybrid because all the components

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.810 
is a hybrid because all the components
are<00:01:26.930> separated<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:28.100> means<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.399> could<00:01:28.490> design

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
are separated it means you could design

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.760 
are separated it means you could design
the<00:01:28.970> car<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:29.540> want<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.960> look<00:01:30.110> rather<00:01:30.560> than

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
the car that we want to look rather than

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.960 
the car that we want to look rather than
drab<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.070> car<00:01:31.280> around

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
drab the car around

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.609 
drab the car around
various<00:01:32.420> components<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.050> because<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.440> makes

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
various components so because that makes

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.070 
various components so because that makes
our<00:01:33.770> job<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.220> lot<00:01:34.520> easier<00:01:34.970> if<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.750> walk<00:01:35.930> around

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
our job a lot easier if we walk around

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.050 
our job a lot easier if we walk around
the<00:01:36.320> car<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.340> first<00:01:37.520> thing<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:37.759> want<00:01:37.910> you<00:01:38.000> to

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
the car the first thing I want you to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.359 
the car the first thing I want you to
notice<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:39.259> state<00:01:39.470> glass<00:01:39.740> one<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.310> the

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
notice is the state glass one of the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.859 
notice is the state glass one of the
most<00:01:40.520> important<00:01:40.910> things<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.180> any<00:01:41.330> Jago<00:01:41.750> is

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
most important things in any Jago is

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.980 
most important things in any Jago is
this<00:01:42.020> shape<00:01:42.200> here<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:43.190> beautiful

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
this shape here it's beautiful

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.450 
this shape here it's beautiful

designer<00:01:47.180> speak<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:48.350> then<00:01:48.470> that's<00:01:48.650> then

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
designer speak and then that's then

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.590 
designer speak and then that's then
offset<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:49.610> it's<00:01:49.790> very<00:01:50.000> very<00:01:50.270> strong

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
offset but it's very very strong

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.020 
offset but it's very very strong
fuselage<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.890> lower<00:01:52.340> part<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.790> car

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
fuselage and the lower part of the car

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.760 
fuselage and the lower part of the car
it's<00:01:54.020> very<00:01:54.080> important<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.740> that

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
it's very important that that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.800 
it's very important that that
proportional<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.790> achieves<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.090> large<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
proportional to achieves a large to the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.560 
proportional to achieves a large to the
cabin<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.890> right<00:01:58.040> measure<00:01:58.310> now<00:01:59.299> from

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
cabin is it the right measure now from

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.450 
cabin is it the right measure now from
this<00:01:59.780> wonderful<00:01:59.990> fuselage<00:02:00.710> emanates<00:02:01.280> these

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
this wonderful fuselage emanates these

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.280 
this wonderful fuselage emanates these
wheel<00:02:01.700> arches<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.240> wrap<00:02:02.630> around<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.080> wheels

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
wheel arches that wrap around the wheels

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.230 
wheel arches that wrap around the wheels
again<00:02:03.650> it's<00:02:03.799> very<00:02:03.860> important<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.760> wheel

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
again it's very important that the wheel

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.730 
again it's very important that the wheel
arches<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.810> skin<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.290> wheels<00:02:06.470> wrap

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
arches the skin of the wheels wrap

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.039 
arches the skin of the wheels wrap
around<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.130> tires<00:02:07.369> as<00:02:07.549> tight<00:02:07.729> as<00:02:07.850> possible

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
around the tires as tight as possible

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.150 
around the tires as tight as possible
and<00:02:09.049> then<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.229> notice<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.560> similar<00:02:09.860> thing<00:02:10.009> as

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
and then you notice a similar thing as

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.670 
and then you notice a similar thing as
it<00:02:10.250> comes<00:02:10.429> through<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.670> back<00:02:11.500> but<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
it comes through the back but it's a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.910 
it comes through the back but it's a
little<00:02:12.799> bit<00:02:12.950> longer<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.610> proportion<00:02:14.299> of

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
little bit longer and that proportion of

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.430 
little bit longer and that proportion of
one-third<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.130> two-thirds<00:02:16.780> again<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:18.080> right

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
one-third to two-thirds again is right

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.319 
one-third to two-thirds again is right
for<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.709> stance<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.160> car<00:02:19.250> come<00:02:20.090> along<00:02:20.239> and

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
for the stance of the car come along and

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.479 
for the stance of the car come along and
say<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> card<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.930> lovely<00:02:21.350> in<00:02:21.530> air<00:02:21.920> intake

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
say the card is lovely in air intake

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.880 
say the card is lovely in air intake

weren't materials and there are birds

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.550 
weren't materials and there are birds
bringing<00:04:35.639> wonderful<00:04:36.090> form<00:04:36.389> using<00:04:37.110> materials

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
bringing wonderful form using materials

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.140 
bringing wonderful form using materials
into<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:37.919> car<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.699> there's<00:04:38.819> some<00:04:38.940> wonderful

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
into the car and there's some wonderful

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.670 
into the car and there's some wonderful
details<00:04:39.690> as<00:04:39.870> well<00:04:40.020> for<00:04:40.259> instance<00:04:40.319> you<00:04:40.530> see<00:04:40.650> the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
details as well for instance you see the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.710 
details as well for instance you see the
sculpted<00:04:41.190> metal<00:04:41.550> running<00:04:42.120> through<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.479> car

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
sculpted metal running through the car

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.629 
sculpted metal running through the car
and<00:04:43.199> this<00:04:43.530> actually<00:04:43.949> is<00:04:43.979> part<00:04:44.280> of<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
and this actually is part of the

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.999 
and this actually is part of the
chambers<00:04:45.150> for<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.360> air<00:04:45.539> feeding<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.560> air

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
chambers for the air feeding the air

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.610 
chambers for the air feeding the air
into<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.520> turbines<00:04:48.270> themselves<00:04:48.500> now<00:04:49.500> when

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
into the turbines themselves now when

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.960 
into the turbines themselves now when
you<00:04:49.680> look<00:04:49.770> at<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:49.949> doors<00:04:50.220> we<00:04:50.490> have<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.699> very

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
you look at the doors we have this very

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.850 
you look at the doors we have this very
very<00:04:51.150> fine<00:04:51.270> mesh<00:04:51.780> running<00:04:52.650> through<00:04:52.770> the

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
very fine mesh running through the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.159 
very fine mesh running through the
surface<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:53.280> doors<00:04:53.520> set<00:04:54.419> behind<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:55.020> are

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
surface the doors set behind it are

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.710 
surface the doors set behind it are
these<00:04:55.320> miniature<00:04:55.740> speakers<00:04:56.190> very<00:04:56.880> unique<00:04:57.270> and

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
these miniature speakers very unique and

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.870 
these miniature speakers very unique and
when<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:57.990> Sun<00:04:58.229> comes<00:04:58.470> on<00:04:58.770> speakers<00:04:59.400> light<00:04:59.610> up

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
when the Sun comes on speakers light up

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.120 
when the Sun comes on speakers light up
so<00:05:00.449> it<00:05:00.509> really<00:05:00.870> is<00:05:01.080> about<00:05:01.349> light<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:01.949> sound

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
so it really is about light and sound

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.189 
so it really is about light and sound
working<00:05:02.639> together<00:05:02.789> and<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.660> gives<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.080> the

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
working together and it gives you the

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.180 
working together and it gives you the
most<00:05:04.910> amazing<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.120> unique<00:05:06.470> sense<00:05:07.470> of<00:05:07.710> space

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
most amazing and unique sense of space

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:18.590 
most amazing and unique sense of space
inside<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.880> car

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.689 

okay<00:05:19.600> so<00:05:19.660> we're<00:05:19.900> inside<00:05:20.139> the<00:05:20.259> car<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:21.430> notice

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
okay so we're inside the car you notice

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.070 
okay so we're inside the car you notice
the<00:05:21.789> seats<00:05:22.060> are<00:05:22.270> actually<00:05:22.539> built<00:05:22.810> into<00:05:22.990> the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
the seats are actually built into the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.200 
the seats are actually built into the
shape<00:05:23.259> of<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.440> car<00:05:23.650> it's<00:05:23.800> very<00:05:24.130> very<00:05:24.370> snug<00:05:24.699> you

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
shape of the car it's very very snug you

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.460 
shape of the car it's very very snug you
feel<00:05:25.479> as<00:05:25.630> if<00:05:25.750> you're<00:05:25.900> part<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.139> a<00:05:26.229> cockpit

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
feel as if you're part of a cockpit

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.050 
feel as if you're part of a cockpit
almost<00:05:26.919> feels<00:05:27.039> like<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.280> aircraft

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
almost feels like the aircraft

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.060 
almost feels like the aircraft
of<00:05:28.630> course<00:05:28.870> any<00:05:29.020> controls<00:05:29.470> just<00:05:29.710> moved

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
of course any controls just moved

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.320 
of course any controls just moved
backwards<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:30.610> forwards<00:05:30.970> actually<00:05:31.210> might

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
backwards and forwards actually might

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.040 
backwards and forwards actually might
need<00:05:31.479> them<00:05:31.660> like<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:33.150> we<00:05:34.150> have<00:05:34.270> virtual<00:05:34.720> dials

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
need them like so we have virtual dials

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.150 
need them like so we have virtual dials
in<00:05:35.169> front<00:05:35.350> of<00:05:35.440> us<00:05:35.530> we<00:05:35.620> have<00:05:35.770> an<00:05:35.830> enormous

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
in front of us we have an enormous

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.520 
in front of us we have an enormous
amount<00:05:36.550> of<00:05:36.699> information<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.930> then<00:05:38.169> just

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
amount of information and then just

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.620 
amount of information and then just
offset<00:05:38.770> against<00:05:39.400> that<00:05:39.580> and<00:05:40.300> complete

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
offset against that and complete

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.050 
offset against that and complete
contrast<00:05:41.080> we<00:05:41.259> have<00:05:41.289> this<00:05:41.590> mechanical<00:05:42.580> bremen

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
contrast we have this mechanical bremen

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.469 
contrast we have this mechanical bremen
clock<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.949> I<00:05:44.949> think<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.880> detailing<00:05:46.270> of

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
clock and I think that the detailing of

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.540 
clock and I think that the detailing of
that<00:05:46.660> really<00:05:47.560> is<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> completed<00:05:48.220> John's

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
that really is a completed John's

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.969 
that really is a completed John's
position<00:05:49.030> of<00:05:49.449> design<00:05:49.990> with<00:05:50.470> the<00:05:50.530> rest<00:05:50.740> of<00:05:50.860> it

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
position of design with the rest of it

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.550 
position of design with the rest of it
very<00:05:51.310> beautiful<00:05:52.050> this<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.169> a<00:05:53.199> lever<00:05:53.440> for

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
very beautiful this is a lever for

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.830 
very beautiful this is a lever for
forward<00:05:54.130> to<00:05:54.250> reverse<00:05:54.520> that's<00:05:55.060> it<00:05:55.300> nothing

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
forward to reverse that's it nothing

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.650 
forward to reverse that's it nothing
more<00:05:56.020> than<00:05:56.289> that<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:57.430> pedals<00:05:57.789> have<00:05:58.120> also<00:05:58.330> come

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
more than that the pedals have also come

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.879 
more than that the pedals have also come
towards<00:05:59.080> you<00:05:59.169> as<00:05:59.320> you<00:05:59.470> move<00:05:59.680> with<00:05:59.830> the

beautiful detailing in here with the
leather<00:06:06.280> changes<00:06:06.699> texture<00:06:07.120> there's

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
leather changes texture there's

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.909 
leather changes texture there's
something<00:06:07.479> much<00:06:07.599> more<00:06:07.810> mechanical<00:06:08.440> and<00:06:08.860> the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
something much more mechanical and the
