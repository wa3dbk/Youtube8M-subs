 Pong Well then is Akiyoshi number of the influence of the drum instructor Kokitsuki 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:17.820
 This time I would like to deliver high tips that make Philin cool with a little thing 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.160
 I think that I want to keep cool the phrase "Tanthan Takaton " 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.880
 Since the great easy-to-well dressed 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.730
 I think I can also challenge the TV 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.730
 Does not have to play a little Well then First usually Tintin was Kato 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.820
 ban 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 bea 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.710
 This phrase is this phrase This phrase is this phrase 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.170
 I think that I want to cool the a person who was a little it easy 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.930
 It is Hidariryou name only hit Pashi' and the one shot you doing a little in front of the Tintin Taka Don 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 Neu Waan Tude 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170
 Don 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.620
 To say 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.620

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.280
 How is it ? 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.290
 While I am thinking how can I have a much human communication 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.290
 I just opened it in front of it 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.479
 Way to think that it is called Tan Tan Takaton 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:02.390
 It is one of the ideas is to enter the whether I was Surui pattern after the One hanging Yappa 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:08.650
 Another one is Tsutsupantsu 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.650
 It is a way of thinking that fall Tteyuu flying there was Tintin since the beginning of Te sputtering 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.840
 eh 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.840
 Pattern 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:27.790
 If I think Na or another can I smoothly that us to practice or a pattern of 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.750
 If you haven't seen it yet , I think it's kinda difficult, so I'll explain it a little slowly 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.400
 I will continue 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.400
 2 parts 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.909
 2 pa 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:45.660

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:52.070
 Since has become Fifi class of 200 with him was Tintin I in this time by just one bar in two 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.070
 At the time of buzz while the eyes of the novel come out 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.880
 I will party the left hand soon after 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.620
 eaa 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:15.710
 From that time I had me running my little go wait big time now, but hit strongly 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.760
 It 's easy to connect with that filin and it's easy to get it cool 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.890
 Than cheap 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.640
 a 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:29.040
 If you think it's a bit difficult, please practice until here 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:32.129
 Was 2 shots the other end following Tintin is up to you first turn right director of the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.719
 2 part pattern to receive 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.719
 I'm doing this for a moment 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.750
 eh 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:51.850
 Let's play and as it is not a path Star Pampanga Taka Once you 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.850
 One-to-one video of the person 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.910
 bea 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.570
 2 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.570
 ban 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.570
 b 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:14.920
 While my image is santanka moonball 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.400
 Sta turn turn 2 minutes like crescendo 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:25.470
 It is an image that gets bigger and bigger Star turn 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.470
 Tintin et al cut was I calm down a little sound at the pig flying Luo cut 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.510
 Hmm 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:35.370
 There are many things 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:41.430
 But it's kinda like that how to put that intonation by that song 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:44.820
 Brackets look to try it in different places because I think there If you do not look good look good to the brackets bad 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:49.650
 Please use it by all means in a place that you think is good 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:53.020
 Then the trick that makes the fill-in cool with a little bit then 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:58.750
 It seemed that the child was deterred 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.750
