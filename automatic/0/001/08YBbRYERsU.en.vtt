00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.580

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 today an external battery with 7800 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.880
 milliampere from the company play3 one 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.490
 as I do not pronounce that special 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.460
 At this battery you can second knows 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.820
 is at the same time iphone or so 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:30.359
 ipad android devices alike and also 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:33.690
 mp3 players grab the device 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.610
 is available for 1 59 euro at media market 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.850
 for example, to get one hand or one 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.800
 Just buy it on the internet 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.160
 what else do we have in there? 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 manual with all kinds of facts 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 you need all kinds of languages 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.219
 we will not be weighted by the device 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 it 's a savings what has 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.969
 here is a charging plug and two usb 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.670
 on it still to load the device 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.030
 micro usb like it for example 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.330
 At samsung we know that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330
 aside 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.600
 sticker 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.600
 no stickers okay 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.159
 Let's take a take for example 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.909
 an iphone 5 is stuck everywhere 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.520
 lightning on 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.520
 and cover it to the battery via usb 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.579
 it is just an ipad 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.869
 so you can see two devices 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.569
 load at the same time 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.399
 it means that you can be three times iphone 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.330
 can fully charge 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:12.620
 I find it myself this device very much 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.660
 good as you can you can just the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:24.049
 Throw a bag and get totally locked 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:25.220
 from It's also quite good one just has 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.340
 not an external height like that 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.510
 charge iphone and ipad and two 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.160
 yellow he need time and great thing 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.160
 to recommend 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.630
 that was my conclusion
