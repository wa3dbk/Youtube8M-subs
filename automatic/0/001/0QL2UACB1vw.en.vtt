start<00:00:35.590> by<00:00:35.829> drawing<00:00:36.100> out<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.400> fish<00:00:36.730> now<00:00:37.120> don't

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
start by drawing out the fish now don't

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.360 
start by drawing out the fish now don't
freak<00:00:37.780> out<00:00:37.989> it's<00:00:38.260> not<00:00:38.560> as<00:00:38.739> difficult<00:00:38.950> as<00:00:39.340> it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
freak out it's not as difficult as it

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.310 
freak out it's not as difficult as it
looks<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:40.239> first<00:00:40.480> thing<00:00:40.630> you<00:00:40.720> want<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:40.900> do<00:00:41.079> is

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
looks the first thing you want to do is

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.810 
looks the first thing you want to do is
just<00:00:41.350> create<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:41.920> rough<00:00:42.130> shape<00:00:42.370> of<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.640> body

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
just create the rough shape of the body

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.439 
just create the rough shape of the body
so<00:00:43.150> it<00:00:43.300> kind<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.630> creates<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.260> long<00:00:45.149> rounded<00:00:46.149> to

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
so it kind of creates a long rounded to

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.240 
so it kind of creates a long rounded to
buy<00:00:46.660> suppose<00:00:46.989> rounded<00:00:47.440> at<00:00:47.530> one<00:00:47.710> end<00:00:47.859> and<00:00:48.070> then

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
buy suppose rounded at one end and then

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.459 
buy suppose rounded at one end and then
thinning<00:00:48.760> out<00:00:48.910> into<00:00:49.210> the<00:00:49.329> tail<00:00:49.570> once<00:00:50.289> you've

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
thinning out into the tail once you've

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.560 
thinning out into the tail once you've
drawn<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:50.859> shape<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.910> then<00:00:52.090> start<00:00:52.269> adding

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
drawn that shape you then start adding

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.270 
drawn that shape you then start adding
in<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.960> extra<00:00:53.289> little<00:00:53.440> details<00:00:53.920> like<00:00:54.039> the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
in the extra little details like the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.090 
in the extra little details like the
fins<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:54.879> mouth<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.570> tail<00:00:55.840> always<00:00:56.500> start<00:00:57.010> off

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
fins the mouth the tail always start off

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.950 
fins the mouth the tail always start off
with<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.309> really<00:00:57.579> basic<00:00:57.789> features<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.629> then<00:00:58.750> go

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
with a really basic features and then go

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.209 
with a really basic features and then go
for<00:00:59.109> detail<00:00:59.500> if<00:00:59.710> you<00:00:59.769> do<00:00:59.890> it<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.070> other<00:01:00.100> way

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
for detail if you do it the other way

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.740 
for detail if you do it the other way
around<00:01:00.309> you're<00:01:00.760> going<00:01:00.910> to<00:01:00.969> get<00:01:01.059> confused<00:01:01.300> and

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
around you're going to get confused and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.270 
around you're going to get confused and
you're<00:01:01.899> going<00:01:02.019> to<00:01:02.140> mess<00:01:02.289> up<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:03.039> much<00:01:03.250> easier

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
you're going to mess up it's much easier

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.310 
you're going to mess up it's much easier
to<00:01:03.670> just<00:01:03.910> break<00:01:04.120> it<00:01:04.300> down<00:01:04.420> into<00:01:04.690> simple<00:01:05.019> steps

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
to just break it down into simple steps

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.240 
to just break it down into simple steps
and<00:01:05.590> then<00:01:05.710> start<00:01:06.040> from<00:01:06.190> there<00:01:08.100> once<00:01:09.100> you've

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
and then start from there once you've

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.830 
and then start from there once you've
sketched<00:01:09.520> out<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.820> basic<00:01:10.180> shape<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.630> fish

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
sketched out the basic shape of the fish

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840 
sketched out the basic shape of the fish
you<00:01:11.530> want<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.740> go<00:01:11.890> over<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.190> again<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.610> make

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
you want to go over it again and make

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.370 
you want to go over it again and make
sure<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.270> lines<00:01:13.450> all<00:01:13.720> need<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.230> you've

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
sure that the lines all need and you've

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.350 
sure that the lines all need and you've
got<00:01:14.530> them<00:01:14.680> exactly<00:01:14.980> how<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.310> want<00:01:15.550> them<00:01:15.700> now

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
got them exactly how you want them now

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.760 
got them exactly how you want them now
you<00:01:16.450> can<00:01:16.570> skip<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:16.960> step<00:01:17.200> if<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:17.439> don't<00:01:17.619> want

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
you can skip this step if you don't want

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.200 
you can skip this step if you don't want
to<00:01:17.920> do<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.220> but<00:01:18.250> what<00:01:18.490> I'm<00:01:18.579> going<00:01:18.759> to<00:01:18.820> do<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.090> I'm

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
to do it but what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.210 
to do it but what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.479> take<00:01:19.540> white<00:01:19.990> concealer<00:01:20.530> amuses<00:01:21.040> as

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
going to take white concealer amuses as

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.310 
going to take white concealer amuses as
a<00:01:21.250> base<00:01:21.549> so<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.270> anything<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:22.810> put<00:01:22.990> on<00:01:23.110> top

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
a base so that anything I put on top

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.800 
a base so that anything I put on top
will<00:01:23.560> stand<00:01:23.860> out<00:01:24.100> even<00:01:24.130> more<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.390> place

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
will stand out even more so I place

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.330 
will stand out even more so I place
these<00:01:26.020> on<00:01:26.079> the<00:01:26.259> back<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.439> my<00:01:26.590> hand<00:01:26.829> just<00:01:27.009> warm

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
these on the back of my hand just warm

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.770 
these on the back of my hand just warm
it<00:01:27.399> up<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:27.729> it's<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.939> little<00:01:28.060> bit<00:01:28.180> more<00:01:28.420> pliable

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
it up so it's a little bit more pliable

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.590 
it up so it's a little bit more pliable
for<00:01:29.590> me<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.829> apply<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.159> onto<00:01:30.310> my<00:01:30.430> face<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:31.299> using

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
for me to apply it onto my face so using

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600 
for me to apply it onto my face so using
a<00:01:31.780> brush<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.259> plated<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.740> all<00:01:32.950> over<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.310> design

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
a brush I plated it all over the design

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.340 
a brush I plated it all over the design
and<00:01:34.180> make<00:01:34.360> sure<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.780> edges<00:01:34.899> are<00:01:35.110> very

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
and make sure that the edges are very

creating<00:03:39.280> patterns<00:03:39.490> around<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.090> fish<00:03:40.300> now

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
creating patterns around the fish now

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.420 
creating patterns around the fish now
obviously<00:03:41.380> if<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.800> don't<00:03:41.980> want<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.160> do<00:03:42.280> this

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
obviously if you don't want to do this

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.460 
obviously if you don't want to do this
you<00:03:42.610> don't<00:03:42.730> have<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.210> but<00:03:43.570> some<00:03:43.930> people<00:03:44.290> might

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
you don't have to but some people might

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.200 
you don't have to but some people might
find<00:03:44.740> it<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.980> little<00:03:45.100> bit<00:03:45.340> strange<00:03:45.670> just<00:03:46.120> to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
find it a little bit strange just to

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.360 
find it a little bit strange just to
have<00:03:46.360> fish<00:03:46.660> on<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.020> face<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.040> designs

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
have fish on the face so the designs

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.830 
have fish on the face so the designs
will<00:03:48.580> help<00:03:48.760> make<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.120> look<00:03:49.270> a<00:03:49.330> little<00:03:49.480> bit<00:03:49.690> more

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
will help make it look a little bit more

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.500 
will help make it look a little bit more
artistic<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:50.560> less<00:03:50.800> like<00:03:51.130> fish<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.180> your<00:03:52.330> face

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
artistic and less like fish on your face

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:15.900 
artistic and less like fish on your face
suppose<00:04:14.070> make<00:04:15.070> sure<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.459> edges<00:04:15.550> are<00:04:15.790> all

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
suppose make sure that the edges are all

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.670 
suppose make sure that the edges are all
blended<00:04:16.269> nicely<00:04:16.420> and<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.019> can<00:04:17.170> use<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.350> brush

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
blended nicely and you can use a brush

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.440 
blended nicely and you can use a brush
or<00:04:17.980> fingers<00:04:18.370> whatever<00:04:18.580> tool<00:04:18.940> works<00:04:19.180> better

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
or fingers whatever tool works better

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.430 
or fingers whatever tool works better
for<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.720> once<00:04:22.870> I've<00:04:23.020> done<00:04:23.169> all<00:04:23.320> these

for you and once I've done all these

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.630 
for you and once I've done all these
designs<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.040> then<00:04:24.130> I'm<00:04:24.220> going<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.400> take<00:04:24.520> a

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
faded out so I'm not going to be

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.710 
faded out so I'm not going to be
covering<00:04:30.370> up<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.700> edges<00:04:30.850> where<00:04:31.480> there's<00:04:31.660> a

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
covering up the edges where there's a

place it on the fish where you would

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.780 
place it on the fish where you would
naturally<00:04:44.470> get<00:04:44.650> highlights<00:04:45.160> if<00:04:45.400> they<00:04:45.520> were<00:04:45.580> in
