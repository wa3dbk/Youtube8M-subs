00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.219
 hello good here we are that travis ela 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.770
 one more time to bring you in this case 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.799
 a little advance on the patch 3.16 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.160
 is the one of the lunar delight as you see the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.570
 login screen that they are going to put is that 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.890
 and the music on the login screen is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.160
 what are you going to hear during the whole 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.160
 video 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.480
 we start with the splash as you know 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.550
 to get 3 skins of king 20 champions 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.349
 dyn to meridiana and here you go to see 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.450
 raven dragon sword trina month of the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.600
 realms of combat and diana goddess of the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.600
 Moon 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.910
 they are also going to take out some new icons 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.399
 invoker to which we will have access 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.089
 sure about the store buying the ones with 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.089
 riot points 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.330
 as for the champions the first thing that 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.580
 you have to know is the target to cv 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.670
 the mayor and se the w of jeans the rd congo 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.110
 the queens w and the warwick w already 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.880
 reveal enemies in stealth 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.680
 so if you use champions that 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.480
 can become invisible while 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.880
 you are invisible of these 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.830
 successes do not take effect in you not 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.930
 they reveal instead if you are not in 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.840
 invisible for example with clicks you are 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.120
 in normal and the cv of diana gives you so 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.700
 is going to reveal you in a moment of a set 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.690
 or for example in the changes of the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.130
 champions 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.720
 we started with raven which is one of the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.640
 strongest we have now starting 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.630
 of the last patch is used a lot in 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.940
 rne that if it is one of the first 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.610
 handles that are usually made arrive 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.030
 they are going to lower the damage based to 51 plus 3 by 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.340
 level instead of 54 plus 275 that there is now 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.930
 that in the background is more that is in law came 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.430
 it's going to have a lot more damage but the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.580
 initial is less than is the one that bothers 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.160
 especially now in which they are going to announce 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.440
 the three uses have lowered the damage of 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.690
 10 to 90 thirty 30 130 so it's a 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.490
 pretty curious mirror and all uses 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.100
 of scale instead of 70 percent 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.979
 that we have now in him 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.430
 in the official is going to climb to 40 by 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.979
 hundred of the d so this skill the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.869
 embassy enough not to abuse about 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.850
 the whole principle also have him 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.069
 lowered have decreased the time it lasts 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.950
 shield to a second and a half m of two 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.200
 seconds and a half that we had before 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.599
 with queen they have also lowered a 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.090
 little bit in the period of use of the q 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.400
 from low activation skill 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.560
 two seconds instead of six so now 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.239
 they will not be able to throw it when they want and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.709
 launch practically what it is 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.200
 before, now they're going to have to 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.310
 think well of activating the cure and the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.470
 w and space have specified that come 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.750
 recover 60 percent of the pe 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.840
 has life that they did not specify before 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.599
 nowhere 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.750
 as to whether they go to the w the embassy of 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.930
 damage per second of 25 85 that we have 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.940
 now in the officer to 20 80 have you 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.530
 lowered a bit the same is just the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.560
 little bit that you need to not abuse 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.519
 so much especially in the patting when 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.260
 he does when he is in jungle and harassment 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.000
 what he does when he is everything in the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.230
 the initial damage has also decreased and the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.580
 evolutionary but in the end they have left 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.290
 same now goes from 60 to 220 m from 80 to 220 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.719
 what do we have now 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.540
 anna their have increased the range of the 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.769
 w because when he has the erre no longer 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.900
 increases the range of attacks 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.430
 Lassus gets bigger and all that 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.240
 but no longer reach the enemies that 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.760
 be further with your skins 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.500
 with bump or q increases the initial damage 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.800
 the evolutionary and at the end of the skill 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.890
 with damage from 80 to 280 instead of 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.110
 60 260 but now it only reduces the 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.730
 armor and the magical resistance of 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.300
 first enemy hit by this skin 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.980
 so when launches q is no longer 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.140
 reduces the armor the magic resistance 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.970
 of all people of all 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.440
 all the champions that pass over 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.530
 from the stifle simply to the first one 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.780
 I have hit 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.610
 as for jeans it lowers in the life of 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.220
 base to 380 plus 82 per level from 420 to 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.069
 80 per level that is now in the official 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.790
 and makes it that now the most here games 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.280
 inflicted from 80 to 300 instead of 100 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.110
 100 to 300 lowers you in the initial damage and 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.850
 the evolutionary but at maximum level cxi mo 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.150
 it stays the same, they do it because 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.769
 jeans abused a lot in early game but 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.720
 actually where it worked well 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.710
 with the states that I had so the have 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.630
 left practically the same go down to the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.830
 erre the embassy of the duration of four 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.870
 seconds that we have now in the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.580
 official server to three seconds that 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.740
 you have now in the baby but you have 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.950
 raised the basic cure and the scale of 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.830
 ap now the basic healing is saying 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.440
 to 200 instead of 70 to 150 that we have 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.720
 now on the official and scale by 60 by 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.260
 cent percent of the 35 percent heal that heals 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.170
 now in the official 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.610
 relieves is a pretty important change 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.860
 especially those who use it a lot 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.320
 they raise the speed of the basic attack by 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.610
 which takes less to reach the objective 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.500
 so if you use it you have to 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.790
 change our parking mode because 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.130
 now the ball is going to take less in 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.170
 get there from when you throw it until 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.060
 arrives at the head of the subject by 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.410
 example so you have to control 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.590
 again the times of farmer or of 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.780
 relieves in other skills simply you 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.310
 they have changed the cost of mana by 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.350
 example in which you have lowered the cost 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.750
 of final mana and the wl have put in 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.130
 Fixed mana set of 70 have also not 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.540
 made many more changes but it's 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:29.320
 important what of the times of farn I 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.060
 matalÃ³n has changed in the description of 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.840
 the e because actually the game does not 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.980
 it shows but in theory it gets the cut 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.050
 immediately behind the champion a 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.400
 objective if I would cut it in place a 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.010
 little away from the objective champion without more 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.780
 Darius have made the mistake can be 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.630
 return to shoot in the middle of 12 seconds 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.640
 after killing an enemy that 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.110
 be 20 instead of making it so abusive 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.900
 how it was at the beginning when they took out 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.580
 the champion wants to balance it because 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.530
 as it stays a little energy do 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.900
 from these 12 seconds that you 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.000
 they put 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.600
 and the cooling of ti bears has gone up 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.009
 Makes you bears can not be active 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.750
 as often as it is now in the 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.570
 games so it is going to notice a tad 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.789
 especially those who use ni 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.230
 we've been sitting here pretty 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.260
 my side 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:24.040
 that hump a little bit of this change 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:28.360
 hello the cut now slows down a little bit 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.630
 less than 29 45% instead of 35 55 what 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.210
 I can not chase anymore 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.760
 easily pulling the ax as 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.950
 I used to do it before because it was a little 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.970
 abused especially if you were skilled in 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.980
 place the q always pick up the ax 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.490
 he slowed down if in the end he 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.190
 dying running away 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.199
 and finally evelyn the now infringe 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.500
 Physical damage instead of magic and scale 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.699
 for 100% of ap in the middle of 50% follows 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.190
 giving also a percentage of the 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.560
 depression has not changed and well this is 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.669
 all like it subscribed if you are not 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.669
 until the next video
