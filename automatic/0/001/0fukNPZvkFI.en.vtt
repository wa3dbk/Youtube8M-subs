00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
right now that has a lot of give so you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.610 
right now that has a lot of give so you
can<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.649> curve<00:00:44.219> around<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.660> features<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
can really curve around the features of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
can really curve around the features of
the<00:00:47.579> face<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:50.340> trick<00:00:50.879> about<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> synthetic

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the face and the trick about a synthetic

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.500 
the face and the trick about a synthetic
brush<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.649> why<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.850> such<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> good

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
brush or why I think it's such a good

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.830 
brush or why I think it's such a good
idea<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:56.070> go<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> synthetic<00:00:56.969> brush<00:00:57.539> when

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
idea to go with a synthetic brush when

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.889 
idea to go with a synthetic brush when
you're<00:00:58.050> using<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.829> cream<00:00:59.579> based<00:01:00.000> product<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you're using a cream based product is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.759 
you're using a cream based product is
that<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.800> won't<00:01:02.730> absorb<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.600> product<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that it won't absorb the product so it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.289 
that it won't absorb the product so it
will<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:06.570> medium<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:08.010> spread<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
will just be a medium to spread the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.850 
will just be a medium to spread the
product<00:01:09.570> evenly<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> face<00:01:11.990> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.710> are

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
product evenly on the face if you are

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.649 
product evenly on the face if you are
using<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.820> natural<00:01:15.810> hair<00:01:16.619> brush<00:01:17.030> like<00:01:18.030> sable

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
using a natural hair brush like sable

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
using a natural hair brush like sable
for<00:01:19.320> example<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:21.090> tends<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.810> absorb<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:23.549> oils

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
for example it tends to absorb the oils

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
for example it tends to absorb the oils
of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.479> cream<00:01:24.750> based<00:01:24.990> products<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> do

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
of the cream based products so I do

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
of the cream based products so I do
think<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.939> synthetic<00:01:27.509> brush<00:01:27.750> works<00:01:28.020> best

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
think that a synthetic brush works best

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.300 
think that a synthetic brush works best
look<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> nice<00:01:29.700> rounded<00:01:30.299> brush<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
look for a nice rounded brush so you can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.859 
look for a nice rounded brush so you can
really<00:01:32.670> blend<00:01:33.570> smoothly<00:01:34.250> another<00:01:35.250> good<00:01:35.460> idea

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
really blend smoothly another good idea

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
really blend smoothly another good idea
to<00:01:36.869> blend<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> product<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:40.159> use<00:01:41.159> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to blend the product well is to use a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.200 
to blend the product well is to use a
latex<00:01:41.939> sponge<00:01:42.270> these<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.740> come<00:01:44.040> also<00:01:44.970> in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
latex sponge these actually come also in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.170 
latex sponge these actually come also in
all<00:01:45.390> shapes<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.200> sizes<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.000> they're

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
all shapes and sizes and they're

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660 
all shapes and sizes and they're
actually<00:01:48.329> fairly<00:01:49.009> inexpensive<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.610> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
actually fairly inexpensive so you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.789 
actually fairly inexpensive so you
really<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> spend<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.380> lot<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
really don't have to spend a lot and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.969 
really don't have to spend a lot and
finally<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.479> hands<00:01:54.930> your<00:01:55.290> hands<00:01:55.680> are

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
finally really your hands your hands are

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.030 
finally really your hands your hands are
not<00:01:56.369> bad<00:01:56.700> tools<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.270> all<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:58.320> warmth<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
not bad tools at all the warmth of the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.219 
not bad tools at all the warmth of the
finger<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.670> actually<00:02:00.090> spread<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.509> product

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
finger can actually spread a product

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.630 
finger can actually spread a product
much<00:02:01.890> more<00:02:02.219> evenly<00:02:02.610> than<00:02:02.759> maybe<00:02:03.630> any

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
much more evenly than maybe any

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.550 
much more evenly than maybe any
expensive<00:02:05.640> brush<00:02:06.270> or<00:02:06.600> sponge<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.119> also

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
expensive brush or sponge you can also

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.020 
expensive brush or sponge you can also
luckily<00:02:10.560> they<00:02:10.739> come<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.039> different<00:02:11.190> sizes<00:02:11.400> too

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
luckily they come in different sizes too

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.540 
luckily they come in different sizes too
so<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.840> maybe

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
so you can maybe

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.090 
so you can maybe
go<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.880> with<00:02:14.120> your<00:02:14.300> smaller<00:02:14.690> finger<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.920> blend

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
go in with your smaller finger to blend

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.540 
go in with your smaller finger to blend
on<00:02:16.700> smaller<00:02:17.120> areas<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.020> maybe<00:02:18.650> with<00:02:18.980> your

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
on smaller areas and maybe with your

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.180 
on smaller areas and maybe with your
thumb<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.270> blend<00:02:20.540> out<00:02:20.840> larger<00:02:21.560> areas<00:02:21.980> of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
thumb you can blend out larger areas of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.100 
thumb you can blend out larger areas of
the<00:02:22.340> face<00:02:22.370> just<00:02:23.090> make<00:02:23.330> sure<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.600> sanitize

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the face just make sure you sanitize

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.270 
the face just make sure you sanitize
your<00:02:24.740> hands<00:02:25.340> frequently<00:02:26.380> because<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.920> really

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
your hands frequently because you really

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.030 
your hands frequently because you really
don't<00:02:28.520> want<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.000> bring<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.810> extra<00:02:30.290> bacteria

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
don't want to bring in extra bacteria

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.210 
don't want to bring in extra bacteria
onto<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.000> face
