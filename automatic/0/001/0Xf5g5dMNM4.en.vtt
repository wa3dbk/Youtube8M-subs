00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
we're about to go to Thompson's sawmill

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.010 
we're about to go to Thompson's sawmill
and<00:00:27.160> have<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.340> very<00:00:27.669> large<00:00:28.029> white<00:00:28.449> oak<00:00:28.660> log

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
and have a very large white oak log

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.920 
and have a very large white oak log
Shawn<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:30.340> make<00:00:30.520> these<00:00:30.730> floor<00:00:31.090> Timbers<00:00:31.570> out<00:00:31.750> of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
Shawn to make these floor Timbers out of

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.520 
Shawn to make these floor Timbers out of
and<00:00:32.140> it's<00:00:32.259> also<00:00:32.470> going<00:00:32.920> to<00:00:33.010> have<00:00:33.670> this<00:00:34.629> 4-foot

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
and it's also going to have this 4-foot

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.650 
and it's also going to have this 4-foot
in<00:00:35.710> that<00:00:35.920> same<00:00:36.250> log<00:00:36.579> so<00:00:36.940> it's<00:00:37.059> quite<00:00:37.329> a<00:00:37.360> large

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
in that same log so it's quite a large

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.410 
in that same log so it's quite a large
diameter<00:00:38.050> log<00:00:38.650> and<00:00:38.980> see<00:00:39.400> here<00:00:39.699> that<00:00:39.850> this<00:00:40.360> is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
diameter log and see here that this is

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.689 
diameter log and see here that this is
the<00:00:40.690> center<00:00:41.080> of<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.320> tree<00:00:41.559> right<00:00:41.860> here<00:00:41.890> right

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
the center of the tree right here right

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.310 
the center of the tree right here right
in<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.089> middle<00:00:43.300> of<00:00:43.449> that<00:00:43.570> floor<00:00:43.839> timber<00:00:44.230> now

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
in the middle of that floor timber now

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.290 
in the middle of that floor timber now
that's<00:00:44.500> what's<00:00:44.680> called<00:00:44.980> boxed<00:00:45.550> heart<00:00:45.820> it's

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
that's what's called boxed heart it's

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.210 
that's what's called boxed heart it's
not<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.690> greatest<00:00:47.110> situation<00:00:47.260> because<00:00:48.070> what

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
not the greatest situation because what

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.009 
not the greatest situation because what
happens<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:48.909> checks<00:00:49.239> around<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.809> heart

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
happens is it checks around the heart

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.899 
happens is it checks around the heart
like<00:00:50.260> that<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:51.100> we<00:00:51.250> don't<00:00:51.339> want<00:00:51.519> to<00:00:51.610> do<00:00:51.730> that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
like that so we don't want to do that

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.340 
like that so we don't want to do that
because<00:00:52.089> we're<00:00:52.360> going<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.540> install<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.110> floor

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
because we're going to install the floor

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.100 
because we're going to install the floor
timbers<00:00:53.710> dream<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:55.000> what<00:00:55.390> we<00:00:55.540> want<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.809> do<00:00:55.960> is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
timbers dream so what we want to do is

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.469 
timbers dream so what we want to do is
have<00:00:56.320> them<00:00:56.470> custom<00:00:57.070> sawn<00:00:57.400> onto<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:57.879> log<00:00:58.150> and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
have them custom sawn onto that log and

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.539 
have them custom sawn onto that log and
we're<00:00:58.900> going<00:00:59.019> to<00:00:59.080> have<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.379> heart<00:00:59.650> of<00:00:59.920> the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
we're going to have the heart of the

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.329 
we're going to have the heart of the
tree<00:01:00.790> there<00:01:01.119> over<00:01:01.360> here<00:01:01.600> or<00:01:02.019> over<00:01:02.409> here<00:01:02.439> so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
tree there over here or over here so

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.369 
tree there over here or over here so
what<00:01:03.820> happens<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.540> annual<00:01:04.960> rings<00:01:05.199> are

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
what happens is the annual rings are

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.410 
what happens is the annual rings are
going<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.560> be<00:01:05.710> going<00:01:06.220> right<00:01:06.460> through<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.090> log

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
going to be going right through that log

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.000 
going to be going right through that log
from<00:01:07.750> one<00:01:07.960> side<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.260> the<00:01:08.470> other<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:08.890> that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
from one side to the other and that

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.130 
from one side to the other and that
would<00:01:09.130> be<00:01:09.280> referred<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.790> as<00:01:09.939> quarter<00:01:10.420> sawn<00:01:10.659> or

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
would be referred to as quarter sawn or

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.350 
would be referred to as quarter sawn or
edge<00:01:11.619> grain<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.369> what<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.820> does<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.210> it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
edge grain and what that does is it

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.749 
edge grain and what that does is it
reduces<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:14.110> amount<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.860> timber<00:01:15.610> will

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
reduces the amount that the timber will

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.370 
reduces the amount that the timber will
shrink<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.330> change<00:01:16.630> shape<00:01:16.990> in<00:01:17.170> this

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
shrink and change shape in this

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.859 
shrink and change shape in this
direction<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:18.340> can<00:01:18.460> see<00:01:18.670> I've<00:01:18.850> extracted<00:01:19.450> the

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
direction you can see I've extracted the

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.350 
direction you can see I've extracted the
four<00:01:20.140> foot<00:01:20.470> out<00:01:20.680> from<00:01:21.130> on<00:01:21.310> top<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.030> keel

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
four foot out from on top of the keel

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.300 
four foot out from on top of the keel
and<00:01:22.630> out<00:01:23.080> from<00:01:23.320> underneath<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:24.040> floor

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
and out from underneath the floor

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.580 
and out from underneath the floor
timbers<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.000> mast<00:01:25.240> step<00:01:25.570> area<00:01:25.990> here<00:01:26.320> and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
timbers in the mast step area here and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.260 
timbers in the mast step area here and
I've<00:01:26.920> got<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.159> out<00:01:27.369> on<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.579> couple<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:28.060> sawhorses

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
I've got it out on a couple of sawhorses

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.330 
I've got it out on a couple of sawhorses
here's<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.289> piece<00:01:29.499> that<00:01:29.799> we're<00:01:29.920> going<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.130> try

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
here's the piece that we're going to try

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.279 
here's the piece that we're going to try
to<00:01:30.399> get<00:01:30.670> out<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.090> large<00:01:31.390> log<00:01:31.810> out<00:01:32.049> of<00:01:32.079> the

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
to get out of that large log out of the

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.340 
to get out of that large log out of the
sawmill<00:01:32.829> and<00:01:33.070> like<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.670> say<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.689> annual<00:01:35.140> rings

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
sawmill and like I say the annual rings

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.770 
sawmill and like I say the annual rings
in<00:01:35.619> this<00:01:35.740> log<00:01:36.039> were<00:01:36.280> on<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.520> kind<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.060> diagonal

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
in this log were on a kind of a diagonal

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.569 
in this log were on a kind of a diagonal
to<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:37.960> log<00:01:38.229> right<00:01:38.560> here<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.369> medullary

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
to the log right here and the medullary

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.219 
to the log right here and the medullary
Ray's<00:01:40.090> going<00:01:40.420> through<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.719> that<00:01:40.869> way<00:01:41.020> we

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
Ray's going through it that way we

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.450 
Ray's going through it that way we
wouldn't<00:01:41.409> want<00:01:41.619> that<00:01:41.679> because<00:01:41.950> our<00:01:42.249> logs

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
wouldn't want that because our logs

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.859 
wouldn't want that because our logs
gonna<00:01:42.640> be<00:01:42.850> green<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.299> we<00:01:43.359> don't<00:01:43.539> want<00:01:43.689> it<00:01:43.749> to

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
gonna be green and we don't want it to

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.620 
gonna be green and we don't want it to
shrink<00:01:44.200> into<00:01:44.499> a<00:01:44.619> rhombus<00:01:45.249> so<00:01:45.939> basically<00:01:46.479> we

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
shrink into a rhombus so basically we

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.840 
shrink into a rhombus so basically we
want<00:01:46.749> to<00:01:46.929> maintain<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.469> nice<00:01:47.829> rectangle<00:01:48.579> after

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
want to maintain a nice rectangle after

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.459 
want to maintain a nice rectangle after
it's<00:01:48.999> sawn<00:01:49.210> out<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.659> if<00:01:49.719> we<00:01:49.840> caught<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> thought

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
it's sawn out and if we caught a thought

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.559 
it's sawn out and if we caught a thought
out<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:50.799> that<00:01:51.039> log<00:01:51.249> that's<00:01:51.880> what<00:01:52.179> it'll<00:01:52.359> do

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
out of that log that's what it'll do

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.260 
out of that log that's what it'll do
we've<00:01:52.899> made<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.200> pattern<00:01:53.770> here<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.850> it's

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
we've made a pattern here of it and it's

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.739 
we've made a pattern here of it and it's
really<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:56.020> trace<00:01:56.439> of<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.579> outside<00:01:58.179> shape<00:01:58.539> of

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
really a trace of the outside shape of

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.510 
really a trace of the outside shape of
the<00:01:58.840> timber<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.469> then<00:01:59.859> there's<00:02:00.039> some<00:02:00.189> lines

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
the timber and then there's some lines

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.279 
the timber and then there's some lines
on<00:02:00.819> the<00:02:00.909> other<00:02:01.060> side<00:02:01.329> of<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.569> that<00:02:01.749> represent

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
on the other side of it that represent

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.169 
on the other side of it that represent
the<00:02:02.409> beam<00:02:02.590> line<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.249> inside<00:02:03.609> rabbit<00:02:04.090> and

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
the beam line and the inside rabbit and

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.370 
the beam line and the inside rabbit and
those<00:02:04.299> things<00:02:04.569> that<00:02:04.719> we<00:02:04.810> can<00:02:04.959> show<00:02:05.079> you<00:02:05.170> more

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
those things that we can show you more

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.050 
those things that we can show you more
about<00:02:05.499> that<00:02:05.770> later<00:02:05.829> you<00:02:06.399> can<00:02:06.549> see<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.880> this

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
about that later you can see that this

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.109 
about that later you can see that this
is<00:02:07.840> all<00:02:08.020> black<00:02:08.440> here<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.039> what<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.729> is<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.090> a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
is all black here and what that is is a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.690 
is all black here and what that is is a
migration<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:11.110> steel<00:02:11.440> electrons<00:02:12.250> through

migration of steel electrons through
that<00:02:12.880> area<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:15.459> got<00:02:15.640> electrolysis

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
that area and it's got electrolysis

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.559 
that area and it's got electrolysis
problems<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:18.270> moisture<00:02:19.270> in<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.540> wood

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
problems the the moisture in the wood

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.350 
problems the the moisture in the wood
conducts<00:02:20.410> electricity<00:02:20.920> because<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.819> ions

snapped at off from the inside rabbit
line<00:02:34.269> forward<00:02:34.659> so

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
line forward so

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.290 
line forward so
it<00:02:35.710> doesn't<00:02:36.040> show<00:02:36.190> much<00:02:36.430> damage<00:02:36.910> around<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
it doesn't show much damage around the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.690 
it doesn't show much damage around the
screw<00:02:37.630> holes<00:02:37.930> here<00:02:38.410> where<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.160> plankton<00:02:39.550> was

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
screw holes here where the plankton was

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.400 
screw holes here where the plankton was
fastened<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.390> because<00:02:40.720> those<00:02:40.870> were<00:02:41.080> bronze

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
fastened to it because those were bronze

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.980 
fastened to it because those were bronze
screws<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.310> these<00:02:42.700> were<00:02:42.880> iron<00:02:43.330> bolts<00:02:43.780> going

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
screws and these were iron bolts going

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.780 
screws and these were iron bolts going
through<00:02:44.320> here<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.010> iron<00:02:45.280> bolts<00:02:45.640> had

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
through here so the iron bolts had

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.400 
through here so the iron bolts had
deteriorated<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.750> that's<00:02:46.930> what's<00:02:47.110> caused

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
deteriorated and that's what's caused

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.350 
deteriorated and that's what's caused
most<00:02:47.770> of<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.040> problems<00:02:48.130> with<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.880> got<00:02:49.330> a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
most of the problems with it got a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.810 
most of the problems with it got a
number<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.810> other<00:02:49.990> problems<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:51.190> healin<00:02:51.610> had

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
number of other problems the healin had

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.640 
number of other problems the healin had
a<00:02:51.850> few<00:02:52.090> problems<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.900> also<00:02:53.080> did<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.500> bow

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
a few problems and so also did the bow

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.710 
a few problems and so also did the bow
in<00:02:53.860> but<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.310> major<00:02:54.610> problem<00:02:55.600> that

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
in but this is a major problem that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.630 
in but this is a major problem that
we've<00:02:55.870> had<00:02:55.900> with<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.920> timber<00:02:57.250> seems<00:02:57.490> to

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
we've had with it the timber seems to

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.220 
we've had with it the timber seems to
have<00:02:57.760> stayed<00:02:58.090> pretty<00:02:58.270> stable<00:02:58.690> but<00:02:59.050> we're

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
have stayed pretty stable but we're

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.350 
have stayed pretty stable but we're
after<00:02:59.470> getting<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.490> annual<00:03:00.880> rings<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.330> go

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
after getting the annual rings to go

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.150 
after getting the annual rings to go
right<00:03:01.660> directly<00:03:01.840> through<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.710> way<00:03:02.950> in

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
right directly through it this way in

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.590 
right directly through it this way in
the<00:03:03.190> medullary<00:03:03.700> raised<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.270> this<00:03:04.420> direction

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
the medullary raised in this direction

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.230 
the medullary raised in this direction
so<00:03:04.960> we're<00:03:05.290> gonna<00:03:05.410> have<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.340> center<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
so we're gonna have the center of the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.170 
so we're gonna have the center of the
tree<00:03:07.540> when<00:03:08.170> we<00:03:08.350> cut<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.800> out<00:03:09.040> either<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.880> this

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
tree when we cut it out either on this

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.480 
tree when we cut it out either on this
side<00:03:10.240> of<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.810> timber<00:03:11.230> directly<00:03:12.100> in<00:03:12.250> line<00:03:12.280> with

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
side of the timber directly in line with

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.610 
side of the timber directly in line with
the<00:03:12.790> bolt<00:03:13.000> holes<00:03:13.270> here<00:03:13.570> or<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.170> other<00:03:14.290> side

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
the bolt holes here or on the other side

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.470 
the bolt holes here or on the other side
of<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.890> timber<00:03:15.280> depends<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.210> curvature

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
of the timber depends on the curvature

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.510 
of the timber depends on the curvature
and<00:03:16.900> how<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.350> looks<00:03:17.590> when<00:03:17.770> we<00:03:17.800> roll<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.280> log

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
and how it looks when we roll the log

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.400 
and how it looks when we roll the log
over<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.030> things<00:03:19.270> so<00:03:19.750> we're<00:03:19.930> off<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.320> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
over and things so we're off to the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.650 
over and things so we're off to the
sawmill<00:03:20.650> now<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.370> get<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:21.700> log<00:03:22.150> up<00:03:22.420> on<00:03:22.570> the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
sawmill now to get that log up on the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.360 
sawmill now to get that log up on the
mill<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.080> see<00:03:23.650> what<00:03:23.800> we<00:03:23.920> get<00:03:24.070> out<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:26.370> we've

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
mill and see what we get out of it we've

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.640 
mill and see what we get out of it we've
come<00:03:27.400> up<00:03:27.640> with<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:28.060> here<00:03:28.420> log<00:03:28.690> as<00:03:29.140> being<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
come up with this here log as being the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.220 
come up with this here log as being the
largest<00:03:30.220> white<00:03:30.760> oak<00:03:30.970> log<00:03:31.270> in<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.630> yard<00:03:31.900> and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
largest white oak log in the yard and

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.320 
largest white oak log in the yard and
obviously<00:03:33.100> when<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.280> buy<00:03:33.610> something<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.240> I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
obviously when I buy something that I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.910 
obviously when I buy something that I
want<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.570> cut<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> timber<00:03:35.230> out<00:03:35.380> if<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.650> want<00:03:35.830> to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
want to cut a timber out if I want to

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.800 
want to cut a timber out if I want to
cut<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.220> out<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.520> largest<00:03:36.880> log<00:03:37.240> I<00:03:37.450> can<00:03:37.480> get

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
cut it out of the largest log I can get

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.840 
cut it out of the largest log I can get
it<00:03:37.930> out<00:03:38.020> of<00:03:38.170> because<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:38.680> don't<00:03:39.250> want<00:03:39.490> to<00:03:39.700> have

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
it out of because I don't want to have

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.820 
it out of because I don't want to have
any<00:03:40.060> hot<00:03:40.330> in<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.690> just<00:03:40.840> all<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.410> timbers<00:03:41.800> and

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
any hot in it just all the timbers and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.260 
any hot in it just all the timbers and
everything<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.340> we<00:03:42.430> cut<00:03:42.670> out<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.060> log

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
everything that we cut out of this log

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.420 
everything that we cut out of this log
are<00:03:43.480> gonna<00:03:43.660> be<00:03:43.840> clear<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.500> hot<00:03:44.709> completely

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
are gonna be clear of the hot completely

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.520 
are gonna be clear of the hot completely
because<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.330> size<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.900> timber<00:03:47.260> if<00:03:47.380> it

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
because of the size of the timber if it

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.960 
because of the size of the timber if it
was<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.650> smaller<00:03:48.040> timber<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.550> wouldn't<00:03:48.790> allow

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
was a smaller timber it wouldn't allow

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.820 
was a smaller timber it wouldn't allow
us<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.330> do<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:49.930> it's<00:03:50.080> very<00:03:50.200> important<00:03:50.770> to

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
us to do that so it's very important to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.370 
us to do that so it's very important to
me<00:03:51.010> not<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:51.760> have<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.120> hot<00:03:52.300> in<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.630> timber<00:03:53.020> and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
me not to have the hot in the timber and

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.320 
me not to have the hot in the timber and
this<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.920> log<00:03:54.130> we've<00:03:54.459> come<00:03:54.790> up<00:03:54.820> with<00:03:54.970> it's

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
tree it has obviously fell in that

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.909 
tree it has obviously fell in that

direction the hot of the tree is way

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.310 
direction the hot of the tree is way
over<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.580> side<00:04:18.640> so<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.840> going<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.049> allow

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
over on this side so it's going to allow

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.200 
over on this side so it's going to allow
me<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.650> get<00:04:20.799> quite<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.130> large<00:04:21.400> timber<00:04:21.940> out<00:04:22.090> of

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
me to get quite a large timber out of

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.490 
me to get quite a large timber out of
this<00:04:22.360> side<00:04:22.600> right<00:04:22.810> here<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.169> that's<00:04:23.290> what<00:04:23.470> I

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
this side right here and that's what I

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.990 
this side right here and that's what I
need<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.919> make<00:04:23.950> that<00:04:24.220> four<00:04:24.520> foot<00:04:24.730> four<00:04:24.910> the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
need to make that four foot four the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.580 
need to make that four foot four the
eight<00:04:25.120> meter<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.780> then<00:04:26.050> we're<00:04:26.200> gonna<00:04:26.320> get

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
eight meter and then we're gonna get

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.500 
eight meter and then we're gonna get
some<00:04:26.800> four<00:04:27.100> by<00:04:27.310> four<00:04:27.640> floor<00:04:27.850> Timbers<00:04:28.240> out<00:04:28.390> of

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
some four by four floor Timbers out of

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.000 
some four by four floor Timbers out of
it<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.690> everything<00:04:28.930> but<00:04:28.960> this<00:04:29.140> gives<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.590> an

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
it and everything but this gives you an

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.130 
it and everything but this gives you an
idea<00:04:30.250> of<00:04:30.520> what<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.880> butt<00:04:31.150> end<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.630> log<00:04:31.840> this

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
idea of what the butt end of a log this

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.560 
idea of what the butt end of a log this
size<00:04:32.410> looks<00:04:32.770> like<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.490> is<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.790> small<00:04:34.180> end<00:04:34.480> of

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
size looks like this is the small end of

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.390 
size looks like this is the small end of
the<00:04:34.690> log<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.230> bottom<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.740> log<00:04:35.890> is<00:04:36.100> much

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
the log the bottom of the log is much

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.090 
the log the bottom of the log is much
bigger<00:04:36.880> in<00:04:37.030> diameter<00:04:37.300> than<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.140> and<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.890> see

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
bigger in diameter than this and you see

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.330 
bigger in diameter than this and you see
a<00:04:39.130> little<00:04:39.490> knot<00:04:40.000> in<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.390> here<00:04:40.600> because<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:41.110> is

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
a little knot in it here because this is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.670 
a little knot in it here because this is
was<00:04:42.340> cut<00:04:42.610> off<00:04:42.730> just<00:04:43.000> above<00:04:43.390> a<00:04:43.600> large<00:04:43.870> branch<00:04:44.380> on

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
was cut off just above a large branch on

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.100 
was cut off just above a large branch on
this<00:04:44.890> end<00:04:45.130> so<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.880> log<00:04:46.090> appears<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.810> be<00:04:46.930> about

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
this end so the log appears to be about

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.480 
this end so the log appears to be about
20<00:04:47.500> feet<00:04:47.650> long<00:04:47.710> but<00:04:48.160> we're

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
20 feet long but we're

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.040 
20 feet long but we're
gonna<00:04:48.610> use<00:04:48.729> maybe<00:04:48.940> 18<00:04:49.360> feet<00:04:49.599> of<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.900> because

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
gonna use maybe 18 feet of it because

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.629 
gonna use maybe 18 feet of it because
we're<00:04:50.169> gonna<00:04:50.259> buck<00:04:50.560> it<00:04:50.710> off<00:04:50.860> here<00:04:51.130> on<00:04:51.280> this<00:04:51.400> end

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
we're gonna buck it off here on this end

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.089 
we're gonna buck it off here on this end
I'm<00:04:52.210> looking<00:04:52.539> to<00:04:52.660> get<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.840> very<00:04:53.110> large<00:04:53.229> timber

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
I'm looking to get a very large timber

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.360 
I'm looking to get a very large timber
out<00:04:54.280> of<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.610> thing<00:04:54.910> that's<00:04:55.060> about<00:04:55.419> 14<00:04:56.139> inches
