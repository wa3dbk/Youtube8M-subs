now what you're finding John is there's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.510 
now what you're finding John is there's
a<00:01:55.170> lot<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> multiples<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.280> now<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
a lot of multiples out there now that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.520 
a lot of multiples out there now that
are<00:01:56.729> utilizing<00:01:57.299> yeast<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.380> what

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
are utilizing yeast and that's what

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
are utilizing yeast and that's what
they're<00:01:58.680> doing<00:01:58.710> they're<00:01:59.040> basically<00:01:59.520> growing

people may have right now is what you're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.490 
people may have right now is what you're
saying<00:02:15.390> yeast<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.810> keep<00:02:15.930> saying<00:02:16.170> yeast<00:02:16.350> is

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
saying yeast you keep saying yeast is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.130 
saying yeast you keep saying yeast is
this<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.190> give<00:02:17.970> someone<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.900> yeast

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
this going to give someone a yeast

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.650 
this going to give someone a yeast
infection<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.950> will<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.370> help<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.030> Candida<00:02:21.480> in

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
infection or will it help the Candida in

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.750 
infection or will it help the Candida in
the<00:02:21.690> body<00:02:21.780> grow<00:02:22.380> things<00:02:22.770> like<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.250> well

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the body grow things like that well

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.370 
the body grow things like that well
there<00:02:24.060> there's<00:02:24.330> debates<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:24.840> both<00:02:25.020> sides<00:02:25.260> of

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
there there's debates on both sides of

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.870 
there there's debates on both sides of
this<00:02:25.470> issue<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> sacrum<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.670> seized

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
this issue this is a sacrum I seized

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.850 
this issue this is a sacrum I seized
which<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.360> not<00:02:27.510> implicated<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.290> Candida

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
which is not implicated on Candida

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.860 
which is not implicated on Candida
albicans<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.910> there<00:02:30.150> are<00:02:30.240> people<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.690> swear

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
albicans now there are people that swear

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
albicans now there are people that swear
that<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.320> does<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.370> reason<00:02:32.520> why<00:02:32.730> is

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that it does and and the reason why is

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.070 
that it does and and the reason why is
just<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.120> think<00:02:33.330> simply<00:02:33.570> because<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.960> word

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
just I think simply because the word

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.470 
just I think simply because the word
yeast<00:02:34.350> we<00:02:34.830> know<00:02:35.100> there<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.550> good<00:02:35.760> bacteria<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
yeast we know there is good bacteria and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.540 
yeast we know there is good bacteria and
bad<00:02:36.720> bacteria<00:02:36.960> we<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.860> there's<00:02:38.070> good<00:02:38.280> yeast

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
bad bacteria we know there's good yeast

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.820 
bad bacteria we know there's good yeast
and<00:02:38.790> bad<00:02:38.970> yeast<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.540> think<00:02:40.050> ultimately<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.710> goes

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
and bad yeast I think ultimately it goes

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.160 
and bad yeast I think ultimately it goes
back<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.400> again<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.210> diet<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.630> people<00:02:43.050> are

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
back to again the diet that people are

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.080 
back to again the diet that people are
on<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.890> state<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.280> you're<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.520> but<00:02:45.000> if

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
on the state that you're in but if

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.580 
on the state that you're in but if
you're<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.240> normal<00:02:45.510> healthy<00:02:45.930> person<00:02:45.959> now<00:02:46.500> if

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
you're a normal healthy person now if

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.960 
you're a normal healthy person now if
you've<00:02:46.680> got<00:02:46.860> Candida<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.520> you're<00:02:47.670> eat<00:02:47.820> up

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
you've got Candida and you're eat up

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.850 
you've got Candida and you're eat up
with<00:02:48.090> Candida<00:02:48.510> probably<00:02:49.380> should<00:02:49.560> stay<00:02:49.740> away

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
with Candida probably should stay away

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.680 
with Candida probably should stay away
from<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.310> mainly<00:02:50.520> because<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> B<00:02:51.209> vitamins

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
from it mainly because of the B vitamins

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.660 
from it mainly because of the B vitamins
nothing<00:02:51.990> cuts<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.380> yeast<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:53.459> that

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
nothing cuts the yeast but because that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.240 
nothing cuts the yeast but because that
feeds<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.120> candida<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.320> far<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.740> normal

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
feeds the candida but as far as a normal

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.370 
feeds the candida but as far as a normal
average<00:02:56.490> healthy<00:02:56.970> person<00:02:57.420> yes<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.080> it's<00:02:58.200> not

average healthy person yes and it's not
now<00:02:58.560> what<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.040> recommend<00:02:59.250> eating<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.880> can<00:03:00.120> of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
now what I recommend eating a can of

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.780 
now what I recommend eating a can of
this<00:03:00.390> date<00:03:00.720> no<00:03:01.170> but<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> couple<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.400> tablespoons

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
this date no but a couple of tablespoons

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.670 
this date no but a couple of tablespoons
