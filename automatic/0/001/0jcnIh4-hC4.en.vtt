00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 grosso shop puntonet staff is pleased 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.420
 to present you a new video 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.840
 review today we will compare 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.480
 m onenote month against the last nine months 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.230
 m2 night so let's not waste time and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.230
 let's start right away 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.259
 the soft touch touch rate is 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.859
 was one of the features 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.989
 main of the months one note on 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.699
 new model or m2 night was 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.340
 instead introduced a hardware key 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.129
 physical that can be crushed and is a 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.530
 mechanism clearly mechanical m2 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.059
 night to the successor of m onenote pur 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.760
 having more or less the same identical 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.570
 5.5-inch display features 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.280
 product ips lcd from sharp really 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.470
 beautiful under sunlight you see 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 very well in addition a feature 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.830
 not just 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.189
 system memory can be expanded 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.150
 than from 16 or 32 gigabytes through one 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:04.250
 micro sd 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.290
 so more or less you have already understood that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.590
 the technical characteristics of both en 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.479
 iso m one notes both of the known m2 months are 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.549
 practically identical therefore not 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.409
 let's do nothing but start our own 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.340
 classic tests and we go immediately with the 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.340
 audio test 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:33.900
 Yes No 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.900
 salt 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.270
 we lost 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.550
 Hello 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.450
 no 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.180
 after hearing our audio head 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.190
 now let's go to view the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.070
 one night temperatures in this 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.830
 case is of m2 night in this other 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.080
 temperature and with device more or less 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.240
 in stand by before clearly going 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.240
 to perform benchmark tests and games 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.350
 accounts 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.110
 no 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.340
 no 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.180
 after making our classics 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.060
 test quadrant antutu big bang 3 and have 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.310
 played real racing 3 as you can 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.350
 see these are the temperatures of the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.190
 two smartphones on the left we have 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:05.000
 put m onenote on the right we have m2 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.840
 night coming around and 40.7 point 8 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.610
 degrees 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.680
 however the heat dissipation in 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.020
 both cases is really good e 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.840
 really hard to choose between michelin 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.940
 one note from m2 note m2 note one 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.950
 particularity not just that of 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.239
 be able to insert a micro sd card e 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.110
 so to go expand our 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.420
 memory 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.340
 a detail that is not negligible 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.730
 also seen the heaviness of all the 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.070
 app 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.710
 now on the android red world shop 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.110
 puntonet greets you and sends you back as 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.110
 always to the next video reviews
