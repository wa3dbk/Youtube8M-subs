00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that's really kind of making it easier

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.410 
that's really kind of making it easier
for<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> end<00:00:55.829> user<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.250> maintain<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.270> or

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
for for the end user to maintain it or

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.790 
for for the end user to maintain it or
just<00:00:57.600> work<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> or<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.680> they

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
just work on it or what have you if they

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
just work on it or what have you if they
need<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.070> some<00:00:59.250> maintenance<00:00:59.579> but<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.940> couple

this unique seat stay design I've never
actually<00:01:47.280> seen<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> road<00:01:48.299> bike<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.780> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
actually seen a road bike with that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.920 
actually seen a road bike with that
design<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.740> talk<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.189> bit<00:01:50.310> about

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
design can you talk a little bit about

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.510 
design can you talk a little bit about
what<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.079> provides<00:01:52.409> well<00:01:53.369> that's

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
what that provides well that's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.969 
what that provides well that's
reminiscent<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.540> serios<00:01:55.170> time<00:01:55.470> trial<00:01:55.740> bike

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
reminiscent of a serios time trial bike

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
reminiscent of a serios time trial bike
time<00:01:56.729> trial<00:01:56.939> bikes<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:58.020> their<00:01:58.259> air

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
time trial bikes now have their air

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.950

that's<00:02:06.869> for<00:02:07.170> improved<00:02:07.500> aerodynamics<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
that's for improved aerodynamics so a

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.770 
that's for improved aerodynamics so a
lot<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.660> bike<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
lot of this bike is a

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.130 
lot of this bike is a
a<00:02:10.830> derivative<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.280> our<00:02:12.690> aerodynamic<00:02:13.690> research

a derivative of our aerodynamic research
from<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.860> Serio<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.340> that's<00:02:15.520> how<00:02:15.670> that's<00:02:15.940> the

from the Serio so that's how that's the

combination it still complies enough to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.170 
combination it still complies enough to
rip<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.800> downhills<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:36.489> not<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.940> not<00:02:37.060> ever
