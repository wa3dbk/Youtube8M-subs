00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.920
 first video of the subscriber's app 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.989
 Well, I'm really glad that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.059
 We are talking about opening this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.010
 series because good since apart that was 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.470
 the first one that sent it to me is for me 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 a perfect is a little what I was looking for 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.020
 I 'm not a very quick aggressive 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.769
 nothing to camp or be for me one more 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.020
 perfect more of how these on my channel 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.090
 they will always be welcome 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.620
 Of course, comment that the artist 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.920
 In this fashion you make ibrahimovic the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.480
 forward that is not immobile itch yes 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.960
 mister an artist of this of the asthmable 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.120
 that I've gone through your channel first 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 is I recommend it one hundred percent as 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.890
 he said he passed through his channel and has several 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 apps about all this style although it has 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.760
 some equal mask and such but good 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.920
 is a guy who plays very well is everything 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.210
 the modern warfare 3 so I recommend 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.460
 100% that you spend on your channel 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.690
 but a good part of the videos of the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.700
 fashions and such has other videos 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.700
 evidently of modern warfare 3 and such 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.190
 with very good games or with a face trolley 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.680
 she dares to camperos that is, although not 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.000
 comments of the videos do not comment 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.460
 but good has its touch of humor 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.869
 always for me it was entertaining and 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.210
 I even saw a few videos 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.619
 followed by him so good as you 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.630
 I say I recommend you to go because 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.630
 well it's a channel for me that's fine 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.340
 so it's worth it and has and since 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.500
 then they deserve more subscribers so 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.820
 please stop by his channel and throw him 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.399
 a look and if you like it look or 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.690
 subscribe good and for commenting a 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.970
 bit of gameplay tell you that is 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.460
 using the mp7 with silencer and 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.580
 scope as an advantage is using the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.700
 sleight of hand and hunter and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.860
 of streaks take it from specialists 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.010
 with fast unsheathed stable aim 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.410
 and scavenger and good as we can see 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.930
 This map is shown on the map look down 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.370
 in a domain game in which your 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.380
 team is doing perfectly 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.269
 having controlled two flags and 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.040
 leaving them one so that the rest is 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.980
 more or less controlled 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.319
 If this is not the case, he can respond 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.040
 uncontrolled enough and can steal us 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.560
 the death 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.010
 and as we can see it is not a jacket or 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.329
 much less do you see that it is always 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.400
 here for there looking for where you 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.109
 can the enemy come so for me 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.030
 this is a love as God sends as 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.099
 it must be so we 're like 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.629
 a lot and as I said before I'm happy 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.239
 that is the first for more or 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.420
 unless you take a little example of the type of 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.010
 maps that I look for 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.900
 that by the way, tell me what has 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.480
 delighted the detail of the beginning of the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.900
 split when you put a c4 in the car 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.910
 of the flag to if I'm not wrong what 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.250
 leave it there and as soon as it leaves and 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.170
 it detects that they are taking away a 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.430
 triple low yes sir I liked 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.290
 very much that beginning 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.870
 since good I do not really use 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.420
 almost never or never the c4 and seeing things 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.950
 well when it makes you want to use it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.170
 well many will say what nonsense 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.140
 I do this often but good 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.370
 realize that many people watch videos 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.670
 of modern warfare 3 to learn to 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.349
 play I include myself or that these 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.840
 details because many people stay with 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.639
 them so well then that this has me 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.109
 it seemed like a nice detail the something that 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.959
 took into account for when they play two 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.540
 mini things as well as I tell you does not stand out 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.450
 c4 but I thought it was very good 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.599
 good idea here look we already have the app or 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.659
 be an elegant smart quickie love 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.830
 without perfect campe pica the perfect me 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.780
 he liked it a lot is good 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.630
 Well, kids and kids here 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.770
 is going to finish more or less the game 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.800
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.920
 as I will of course leave you the 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.590
 link to your channel in a note during the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.090
 video and good what I hope for please 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.490
 is that you pass because as I say 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.490
 chao worth and deserves to another
