00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.880
 [music] 

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:10.679
 flowers all hi dear friends with 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.150
 you weiss and now would like to write to you 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.429
 mod that adds tactical 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 traps that will allow you to secure your 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.330
 house and also lure your enemies on 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 your territory by playing with them by yours 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.289
 the rules and so let's get started and 1 what 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 would like to start this specifically given 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.369
 dummy he will be the bait for 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.330
 your enemies are crafting it pretty 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.390
 in the usual way 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.279
 two boards and head from above, he does not 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.190
 no action completely even head 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.899
 not cool what makes him a fool this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.219
 dummy will call him that way 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.890
 Now I will release the spider to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.590
 show you the effect of this 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 dummies as you see instant sex 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 literally rushed on this 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.850
 defenseless little fool can say so 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 he is dumb as does nothing at all in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.460
 overall he will be very good 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.230
 the bait especially here with our data 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.059
 traps now I'll show you all i 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.340
 I think you understand what this is doing 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.700
 being lure we go further here at 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.020
 we are located igniter hot 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.720
 little thing in general now I tell you 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.680
 demonstrate the fact and it turns out 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.700
 mechanism and so we release the spider 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.369
 we press the button and it burns with grief and hell 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.280
 flame in general how do you see the effect on 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.979
 really very good very powerful 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.439
 literally all the regiment of us evaporated gone 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.470
 on nowhere and it will burn endlessly 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.600
 completely off we do not need 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.560
 here and so hot with me and so all 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.509
 trumpet and so I think you understand the effect 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 This mechanism is very important 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.680
 great when you have something 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.750
 like this imagine and matter in 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.860
 tom that's not everything you can do 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.530
 something more awesome 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.470
 let's say you want to burn 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 given land given ground level but you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.310
 don't want to be seen 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.770
 actually these mechanisms you just 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
 hide them under the wall 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.430
 pressing right under the wall under the ground what 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.170
 difference if you can for the arrival of the wall 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.740
 hide the principle behind the floor or else 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.600
 somewhere 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.069
 right click like you 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.220
 see the inventory opens where you are 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.040
 see is located here such here 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.200
 icons are 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.640
 special thing that increases 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.269
 distance of this mechanism 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.849
 I mean one icon is one level 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.340
 such icons in a pack can only get up 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.500
 and maybe 8 pieces and how you see 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.590
 here are six cells i'm up to forty 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.510
 eight levels to level 48 not 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.640
 imagine this is just huge 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.470
 quantity can use this 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.170
 mechanism and very tactfully everything is possible 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.239
 it will be great to arrange simply and so 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.299
 you put i put 4 here because 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.099
 that we have here 1 2 3 and this level 4 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.359
 so our must burn 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.879
 it is over there so turn on the effect 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.659
 ready as you will see the spider is burning also 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:59.599
 ok, let's make a kebab out of a spider 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.220
 spoons in general everything i think i am you 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.599
 specifically all told in detail by 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.109
 about this mechanism 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.299
 go ahead just super thing at the very 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.970
 I really liked it and more 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.669
 we have here is such a chest 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.349
 magnetic chest here crafting system 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.389
 magnetic chest actually 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.699
 attracts things that lie in two 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.930
 meters from him imagine that you do not 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.870
 you want to open you just want to 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.989
 throw and leave right and this egg 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.870
 or some other 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.269
 creature or subject I don't know oh 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.519
 I'm sorry I didn’t want to do something 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.859
 so be reports that we have demonstrated 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.290
 mod in general just throw and how are you 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.879
 see the subject flies in this very 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.310
 the chests that principle is very cool 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.979
 why is this head of weeks body but 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.620
 flew all took me spoiled 1 and 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:50.030
 everything is in the chest 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.370
 just gorgeous in my opinion go further 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.349
 and here we have a fan 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.269
 the fan actually move 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.799
 items but i don't know why i have it 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.079
 not working as you see 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.659
 icon bounces literally on 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.590
 a little bit quite and no effect 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:08.150
 gives in general the idea of ​​things you should have 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.939
 blow blow 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.859
 away from the fan that principle 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.290
 great if you combine these two subjects 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:18.199
 would be very cool imagine you 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.239
 somewhere you work outside 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.989
 I do not know the farm is valid for you and you 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.450
 somehow reluctant 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.060
 the main chest is in your house 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.510
 don't want to go there you just bet i 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.580
 I do not know 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.640
 make someone put a tunnel 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.770
 on the sides these fans and voila throw 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.470
 the subject he is with you goes through this tunnel 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.020
 and straight to this chest which of course 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.030
 absorbs everything myself just great 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.780
 wonderful in my opinion further with us 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.220
 there are such things 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.250
 super weapons really damage very 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.990
 powerful very fast literally I don't know 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.480
 so let's all let him die 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.890
 imagine he already died actually 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.570
 very quickly and now I am you 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.970
 I'll show you how it is 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.080
 works you just jump very much 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.390
 everything is spent quickly 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.320
 life like water flows literally into 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.210
 nowhere so be careful if you 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.230
 stumble on it well at least 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.890
 somehow avoidable 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:16.130
 go ahead and here we are 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.260
 something like a grassy carpet in 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.480
 general trap is also a trap remember in 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.480
 childhood someone did you tied 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.210
 sticks between each other and it turns out to be dug 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.480
 Yankee put these sticks on this hole 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.390
 closed ant grass and here's such 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.540
 garbage in general is obtained so let's say in 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.170
 we have a diamond here and we are such 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.220
 joyful now we will pick it up and 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.740
 there it was 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.260
 agree very cool no one at all 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.800
 guess what is not natural 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.300
 the earth is not natural at all a layer of grass 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.070
 it's just great in my opinion is 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.190
 just cool to use 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.270
 make fun of your friend or 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.370
 make fun of new try 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.140
 make this pit much deeper effect 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.450
 will be much better also you can 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.900
 put the bayonets on the very last 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.850
 level 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.100
 it would be also deadly in my opinion 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.840
 but lava seems to do more 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.580
 effect than let's say these things 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.190
 as both difficult to even get the glory and 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.770
 so go on and on we have 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.110
 This one here is such a bullshit and for 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.190
 she spent so much time 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.390
 that i can't show you 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:26.510
 the effect is obtained by this trap because 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.570
 that everything just crashes 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.670
 maynkavt poor maykravt so much 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.650
 experienced because of this shit some 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.440
 Generally insert this trap any living 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.300
 the creature that hits him she 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.040
 exposed to damage so be 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.240
 neater from basically you can be 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.550
 sloppy because you are not 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.270
 acts acts on all other any 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.270
 creatures 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.870
 so you can do it in principle 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.310
 good trap 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.100
 in front of the house right in front of the entrance 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.170
 put it would be cool and so in 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.760
 Basically, we have finished everything according to 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.650
 The subject matter is simply 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.590
 chic set that can 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.720
 use just brilliantly tactically 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.310
 and strategically 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.470
 it would be just great bait running 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.840
 and here we have traps which is actually 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:13.070
 deals damage to 3 2 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:16.190
 act as an auxiliary to you and 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.710
 here are the rest to the detriment of others 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.230
 so I think you understand this principle 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.210
 very cool grass layer you will have 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.890
 impose on that subtle edge what 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.070
 principle is not convenient as you see it 

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.810
 it’s not at all put there so better 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.300
 put it to the block like this 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.700
 closer closer well that's all in principle 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.560
 cool take as you understand the objects 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.960
 can stay on the surface 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.550
 what makes it so much better 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.760
 it turns out no one will notice and what 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.830
 i can do maura top below 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.380
 watch the plank here 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:51.410
 that principle already somehow logically affects 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:55.010
 this is finally some kind of unusual 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.360
 thin slabs of grass understandable guys in 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.950
 Basically, this is all I wanted. 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.540
 explain about this mod 

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.320
 if you like subscribe to 

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.360
 my channel leave comments 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.830
 rate the video I will be very happy 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.890
