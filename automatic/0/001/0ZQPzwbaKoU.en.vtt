00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 and let's start with the light bars 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.290
 of orange I'm going to go with this recipe 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.570
 I'm going to give it to you because I'm here 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.219
 of high fructose corn syrup this 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.110
 we 're going to do it with sugar that less 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.240
 damage does us but finally they are 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.590
 full of fiber are very good for the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.810
 organism especially when we're not 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.279
 do well that digestion or that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.710
 we have to eat between meals something not 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.449
 it's a good option so it gladdens the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.900
 ingredients of those light bars 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.349
 to have 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.470
 We are going to use a bar for pasta 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.020
 of margarine in cubes of 90 grams 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.010
 bars a quarter cup of sugar 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.770
 brunette a cup of half wholemeal flour 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.050
 Almond cup, chopped a splash of 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.800
 water and for the filling we will use 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.559
 three quarts cup honey half cup 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.230
 of orange juice three eggs one 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.890
 whole wheat spoon an orange 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.000
 only the zest and half a teaspoon of 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.379
 baking powder put some seconds 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.379
 the butter to the micro 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.540
 and while or go for a bowl to do 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.370
 a mix this is fine 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.370
 I think she's the butter 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.869
 what I already see here we are going to do we are going to 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.759
 take a spoon and let's start 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.759
 incorporate this butter 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.509
 with 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.409
 a quarter cup of sugar is only 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.140
 a quarter cup of no more we will 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.650
 mix it with these girls so that 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.159
 touch 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.619
 our butter 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.109
 we're going to add flour to this 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.229
 integral eye is not white flour is 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.460
 integral that is to say it has fiber and it's going to 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.500
 serve well to digest the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.130
 grown foods from these bars 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.220
 They are made with white flour and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.960
 refined then we want that 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.960
 let's mix incorporate 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.280
 and we will also add the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.590
 almonds that this too could 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.550
 replace with other things we're going to 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.550
 see the trickle of water 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.360
 and what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.210
 put a layer 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.940
 and we're going to extend it here and we're going to 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.170
 put in the oven 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.850
 about 15 minutes for forgiveness 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.100
 but sometimes the hands are much more 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.320
 useful than the spoon 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:43.280
 no no sometimes sometimes it 's ok this 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.240
 let's put a few minutes in the oven 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.940
 although 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.400
 so that the paste that will be 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:57.290
 20 minutes at about 180 to 190 degrees 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.290
 is going to toast is going to make toast 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:07.000
 then we are going to put this for you 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.020
 it heated up this shot what has led 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.120
 over here 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.560
 and now what are we going to do here 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.560
 I have only one 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.000
 how nice here I already have one that is already 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.459
 armed and what remains is to mix the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.230
 following ingredients with the help of 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.970
 a balloon 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.970
 let's mix 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.340
 the juice 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.260
 of orange that preferably be 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.940
 natural we do not want it because we're 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.970
 avoiding high corn syrups 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.290
 fructose then let's do it with 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.740
 syrup with ben you saw from alzheimer this 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.280
 we're going to do it with natural juice 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.470
 orange 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.700
 let's also throw the eggs 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.700
 let's incorporate 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.120
 now let's put the honey that is going to be 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.120
 our source of sugar which is fructose 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.290
 and this also works for people who 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.139
 he suffers from diabetes s conditions and so 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.840
 Well, honey, there are some doctors who 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.449
 they leave depending on their level of 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.610
 insulin that will let them consume or 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:28.320
 no honey we are going to add you 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.730
 a little bit of 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.730
 oil flour 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.180
 integral a little bit we are going to add you in 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.880
 the baskets of the oranges 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.689
 Y 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.889
 the dust 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:47.620
 and with this 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:51.630
 we're going to put it on top of the apple 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.630
 and we're going to put it back in the oven 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:59.020
 how is it 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:02.009
 other knots to things 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.009
 ready him 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.010
 at 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.530
 the 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.570
 to this you see that everything you understand well 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:20.880
 fast is not then let's put 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:23.820
 that later and that's how easy they already collided 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.610
 then the hand cut me that they believe because 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.699
 for this 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.000
 I am nothing is good if it is good that 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.000
 I'm bad 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.340
 but that they blow him if he did not teach nothing 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.520
 if they are blowing if they are blowing 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:46.140
 well I know so that it gives screeching 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.140
 have shrewd look 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.430
 you saw 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.260
 they crave 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.260
 a little piece for the production already 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.250
 they are also moving away from the one who has 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.250
 achieved his court has returned 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.889
 you
