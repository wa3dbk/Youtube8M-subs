cool<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.299> was<00:00:15.450> basically<00:00:15.660> he<00:00:16.080> had<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
cool it was basically he had the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.900 
cool it was basically he had the
trenches<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.210> oat<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.199> then<00:00:19.710> he<00:00:19.949> was<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> paper

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
trenches of oat and then he was a paper

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.500 
trenches of oat and then he was a paper
saying<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.840> hill<00:00:22.050> up<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> trenches<00:00:23.699> so

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
saying the hill up to the trenches so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.150 
saying the hill up to the trenches so
rather<00:00:24.689> than<00:00:24.930> taking<00:00:25.230> something<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> digging

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
rather than taking something and digging

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.759 
rather than taking something and digging
down<00:00:26.369> into<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:27.000> he<00:00:27.539> would<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.349> figure

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
down into it he would you know figure

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.900 
down into it he would you know figure
out<00:00:28.890> his<00:00:28.980> trenches<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.519> then<00:00:29.670> build

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
out his trenches and then build

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.450 
out his trenches and then build
everything<00:00:30.150> else<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.250> pretty<00:00:32.250> cool

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
everything else up to it pretty cool

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.120 
everything else up to it pretty cool
idea<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.120> don't<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.260> paper<00:00:34.710> mache

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

no one of the one of the ways I do it is
I<00:01:13.110> basically<00:01:13.409> simulate<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.760> I'll<00:01:14.850> chalk

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
I basically simulate so so I'll chalk

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.120 
I basically simulate so so I'll chalk
pieces<00:01:15.270> white<00:01:15.720> stuff<00:01:16.020> okay<00:01:16.380> i'm<00:01:16.439> gonna<00:01:16.920> show

pieces white stuff okay i'm gonna show
you<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.369> first<00:01:17.580> year<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you this first year for the this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.440 
you this first year for the this
simulation<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.770> i'll<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.490> let's<00:01:21.119> say<00:01:21.270> I'm

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
simulation so i'll have let's say I'm

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
simulation so i'll have let's say I'm
going<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.350> know<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.650> side<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.159> i'll

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
going up you know this side here i'll

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.490 
going up you know this side here i'll
build<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.360> bit<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
build it up a little bit and then for a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.039 
build it up a little bit and then for a
backdrop<00:01:26.159> I'll<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> cut<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.810> phone

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
backdrop I'll just kind of cut my phone

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.260 
backdrop I'll just kind of cut my phone
you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.340> kind<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> hill

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you know and how kind of like a hill

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.050 
you know and how kind of like a hill
along<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> side<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.290> along<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> box<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
along the side and along the box and and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.770 
along the side and along the box and and
then<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.079> top<00:01:34.320> edge<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.549> know<00:01:35.780> using

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
then just a top edge here you know using

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.289 
then just a top edge here you know using
you<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.350> round<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.920> round<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.670> off<00:01:38.909> pay

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you all round this round this off pay

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
you all round this round this off pay
the<00:01:39.750> top<00:01:39.960> edge<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.829> it'll<00:01:41.009> look<00:01:41.159> kind<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the top edge and then it'll look kind of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.090 
the top edge and then it'll look kind of
like<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.909> know<00:01:41.939> hill<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.680> usually

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
like you know hill there and and usually

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
like you know hill there and and usually
I<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.250> stick<00:01:44.729> these<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.810> way<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.590> know

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
I don't stick these on that way you know

eight we're doing a huge scene in so

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.170 
eight we're doing a huge scene in so
they<00:03:50.630> have<00:03:50.810> much<00:03:51.110> pieces<00:03:51.650> like<00:03:51.890> this<00:03:52.130> all<00:03:52.700> in

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
they have much pieces like this all in

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.210 
they have much pieces like this all in
the<00:03:53.300> same<00:03:53.480> angle<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.170> then<00:03:54.650> they<00:03:54.800> would<00:03:54.980> stick

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
the same angle and then they would stick

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.020 
the same angle and then they would stick
them<00:03:55.370> on<00:03:55.519> their<00:03:55.730> board<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:58.010> know<00:03:58.100> like<00:03:58.730> this

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
them on their board you know like this

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.910

you know expanding foam spray stuff I

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.840 
you know expanding foam spray stuff I
always<00:04:33.260> use<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.470> low-density<00:04:33.919> stuff<00:04:34.490> but<00:04:34.700> in

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
always use the low-density stuff but in

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.840 
always use the low-density stuff but in
this<00:04:35.570> case<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.080> could<00:04:36.500> use<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:37.190> know<00:04:37.220> more

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
all this expanding foam you'll be stuck

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.050 
all this expanding foam you'll be stuck
up<00:05:13.760> on<00:05:13.910> top<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.419> all<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.690> rises<00:05:15.320> of<00:05:15.590> foam<00:05:16.400> okay

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
up on top of all the rises of foam okay

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.810 
up on top of all the rises of foam okay
just<00:05:17.960> pretty<00:05:18.800> much<00:05:18.950> like<00:05:19.190> your<00:05:19.310> leg<00:05:19.490> paper

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
just pretty much like your leg paper

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.460 
just pretty much like your leg paper
mache<00:05:20.030> over<00:05:20.479> but<00:05:20.690> it's<00:05:20.810> all<00:05:20.900> one<00:05:21.110> solid<00:05:21.289> piece

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
mache over but it's all one solid piece

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.350 
mache over but it's all one solid piece
of<00:05:21.620> home<00:05:21.919> anyways<00:05:22.729> we'll<00:05:22.880> do<00:05:23.030> one<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.210> those

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
of home anyways we'll do one of those

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.230 
of home anyways we'll do one of those
systems<00:05:23.750> I<00:05:23.930> make<00:05:24.680> room<00:05:24.950> in<00:05:25.100> here<00:05:25.340> for<00:05:25.370> a<00:05:25.850> big

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
systems I make room in here for a big

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.170 
systems I make room in here for a big
project<00:05:26.570> like<00:05:26.900> that<00:05:27.580> because<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:28.700> is<00:05:28.910> kind<00:05:29.150> of

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
project like that because it is kind of

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.860 
project like that because it is kind of
cool<00:05:30.169> method<00:05:30.440> of<00:05:30.680> do
