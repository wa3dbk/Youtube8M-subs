than<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.480> making<00:00:45.780> an<00:00:46.020> argument<00:00:46.170> has<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> very

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
than just making an argument has a very

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
than just making an argument has a very
venerable<00:00:47.399> history<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.120> goes<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.420> way

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
venerable history that goes all the way

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
venerable history that goes all the way
back<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> Plato<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.500> his<00:00:49.620> dialogues<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.610> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
back to Plato and his dialogues but it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.819 
back to Plato and his dialogues but it
presents<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.090> very<00:00:51.360> unique<00:00:51.809> challenge<00:00:52.410> because

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
presents a very unique challenge because

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.080 
presents a very unique challenge because
not<00:00:52.980> only<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> make<00:00:53.699> sure<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
not only have you got to make sure that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.639 
not only have you got to make sure that
the<00:00:54.149> philosophy<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.719> clear<00:00:55.020> you've<00:00:55.379> got<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the philosophy is clear you've got to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.990 
the philosophy is clear you've got to
make<00:00:55.739> sure<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> characters<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.730> their

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
make sure that the characters and their

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
make sure that the characters and their
setting<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.690> engaging<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.500> come<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.829> life<00:00:59.010> as

setting or engaging and come to life as

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
setting or engaging and come to life as
well<00:00:59.250> otherwise<00:00:59.850> at<00:01:00.180> best<00:01:00.539> they're<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.140> kind

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
well otherwise at best they're just kind

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.360 
well otherwise at best they're just kind
of<00:01:01.320> pointless<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> may<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.100> well<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
of pointless and you may as well just

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
of pointless and you may as well just
write<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> normal<00:01:03.000> argument<00:01:03.420> or<00:01:03.539> whist<00:01:04.170> they're

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
write a normal argument or whist they're

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
write a normal argument or whist they're
actually<00:01:04.739> getting<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> way<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.850> it's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
actually getting in the way so it's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
actually getting in the way so it's
interesting<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.689> tetra<00:01:07.049> log<00:01:07.229> none<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
interesting that in tetra log none of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
interesting that in tetra log none of
the<00:01:07.770> characters<00:01:07.979> represent<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.939> supposedly

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the characters represent a supposedly

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.899 
the characters represent a supposedly
correct<00:01:10.290> point<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> view<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.670> very

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
correct point of view that's very

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
correct point of view that's very
different<00:01:12.119> from<00:01:12.270> say<00:01:12.750> Plato's<00:01:13.290> dialogues

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
different from say Plato's dialogues

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
different from say Plato's dialogues
where<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> character<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.670> Socrates<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
where the character of Socrates is the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.999 
where the character of Socrates is the
guy<00:01:15.900> we're<00:01:16.049> supposed<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.619> rooting<00:01:16.979> for

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
guy we're supposed to be rooting for

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.890 
guy we're supposed to be rooting for
he's<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.909> who's<00:01:18.119> making<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.720> argument

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
he's the one who's making the argument

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.480 
he's the one who's making the argument
that<00:01:19.320> we're<00:01:19.650> supposed<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> take<00:01:20.250> away<00:01:20.430> from

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that we're supposed to take away from

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
that we're supposed to take away from
this<00:01:20.759> whereas<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.390> tetra<00:01:21.659> log<00:01:21.810> everybody's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
this whereas in tetra log everybody's

is a little bit forced at times and I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
is a little bit forced at times and I
suppose<00:02:17.189> that's<00:02:17.370> probably<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:17.909> keeping

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
suppose that's probably because keeping

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.170 
suppose that's probably because keeping

for identifiable voices going requires

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
you to make them quite easily and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.770 
you to make them quite easily and
quickly<00:02:22.920> distinctive<00:02:23.790> now<00:02:24.150> because<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.599> book

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
quickly distinctive now because the book

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.470 
quickly distinctive now because the book
is<00:02:24.900> one<00:02:25.319> continuous<00:02:25.680> conversation<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.999> four

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
parts it isn't always as clear as it

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.849 
parts it isn't always as clear as it
could<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.209> for<00:02:30.870> instance<00:02:31.109> contrasting<00:02:31.769> it

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
could be for instance contrasting it

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.709 
could be for instance contrasting it
again<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.430> Socratic<00:02:32.909> dialogues<00:02:33.269> at<00:02:33.569> the

start of those you usually get Socrates

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:36.949 
start of those you usually get Socrates
or<00:02:35.939> some<00:02:36.060> other<00:02:36.180> character<00:02:36.510> saying<00:02:36.750> hey

everybody<00:02:37.290> let's<00:02:37.680> talk<00:02:37.920> about<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.340> and

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
everybody let's talk about this and

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.800 
everybody let's talk about this and
maybe<00:02:38.909> along<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.299> way<00:02:39.389> we'll<00:02:39.569> talk<00:02:39.719> about

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
maybe along the way we'll talk about

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.970 
maybe along the way we'll talk about
this<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.439> but<00:02:40.530> we'll<00:02:40.769> get<00:02:40.889> to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
this this and this but we'll get to

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.440 
this this and this but we'll get to
those<00:02:41.069> later<00:02:41.189> so<00:02:41.790> you've<00:02:41.939> kind<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.239> got<00:02:42.389> an

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
those later so you've kind of got an

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.000 
those later so you've kind of got an
idea<00:02:42.749> of<00:02:42.810> where<00:02:43.079> it's<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.680> what<00:02:43.889> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
idea of where it's going and what to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.309 
idea of where it's going and what to
look<00:02:44.129> out<00:02:44.280> for<00:02:44.340> whereas<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.269> tetra<00:02:45.599> log<00:02:45.780> it's

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
look out for whereas in tetra log it's

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.440 
look out for whereas in tetra log it's
kind<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.739> written<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> continuous<00:02:48.000> flowing

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
kind of written as a continuous flowing

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.539 
kind of written as a continuous flowing
piece<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.139> it<00:02:49.169> moves<00:02:49.590> from<00:02:50.099> position<00:02:50.519> to

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549

view it does move quickly and it does

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
trying to keep things simple it does

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.460 
trying to keep things simple it does
sometimes<00:03:23.879> bite<00:03:24.299> off<00:03:24.479> more<00:03:24.750> than<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:24.989> can<00:03:25.169> chew

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
sometimes bite off more than it can chew

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.170 
sometimes bite off more than it can chew
so<00:03:25.979> if<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.189> was<00:03:26.280> intended<00:03:26.729> for<00:03:26.849> people<00:03:27.060> who've

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
so if it was intended for people who've

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.999 
so if it was intended for people who've
studied<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.569> lot<00:03:27.659> of<00:03:27.780> philosophy<00:03:28.199> before<00:03:28.560> then

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:29.009 
studied a lot of philosophy before then

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.800 
studied a lot of philosophy before then
they<00:03:29.159> might<00:03:29.340> find<00:03:29.699> that<00:03:29.849> it<00:03:29.939> doesn't<00:03:30.180> quite<00:03:30.359> go

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
they might find that it doesn't quite go

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.149 
they might find that it doesn't quite go
into<00:03:31.019> as<00:03:31.139> much<00:03:31.229> detail<00:03:31.290> as<00:03:31.739> they<00:03:31.889> would<00:03:32.129> like

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
into as much detail as they would like

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.159 
into as much detail as they would like
so<00:03:32.699> I<00:03:32.729> think<00:03:32.879> I'd<00:03:33.120> recommend<00:03:33.449> it<00:03:33.780> for<00:03:33.900> people

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
so I think I'd recommend it for people

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.140 
so I think I'd recommend it for people
who<00:03:34.259> are<00:03:34.409> neither<00:03:34.620> new<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.250> philosophy<00:03:35.729> nor

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
who are neither new to philosophy nor

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.849 
who are neither new to philosophy nor
experts<00:03:36.689> in<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.989> if<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:37.290> picked<00:03:37.530> up<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.680> little

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
experts in it if you picked up a little

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.170 
experts in it if you picked up a little
bit<00:03:37.949> of<00:03:38.040> philosophy<00:03:38.400> before<00:03:38.729> maybe<00:03:38.970> some

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
bit of philosophy before maybe some

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.670 
bit of philosophy before maybe some
other<00:03:39.299> introductory<00:03:39.629> books<00:03:40.079> or<00:03:40.290> classic

other introductory books or classic
texts<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.459> might<00:03:41.609> get<00:03:41.759> a<00:03:41.790> kick<00:03:41.939> out<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.120> it

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
texts and you might get a kick out of it

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.390 
texts and you might get a kick out of it
it's<00:03:42.449> pretty<00:03:42.689> good<00:03:42.870> writing<00:03:43.620> philosophy<00:03:44.189> as<00:03:44.370> a

it's pretty good writing philosophy as a

the characters with the philosophy and
