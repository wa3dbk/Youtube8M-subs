00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.609
 welcome back to our appointment with the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.890
 care and maintenance of ours 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.939
 car we are in the workshop a 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.869
 riad has placed giancarlo in roma 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.759
 carapelli to speak this time of the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.370
 cutting an important appointment 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.710
 hello giancarlo is an appointment at 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.629
 which of course we have to submit 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.000
 our car during the first two 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.190
 years of life so as not to fall from the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.140
 guarantee but it is also an appointment that 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.730
 need to renew over time for 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.160
 guarantee the safety of the car 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.989
 especially in some periods giancarlo 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.460
 certainly in the winter period a lot 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.340
 important that the car is 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.780
 coupon considering that there are gods 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.090
 checks to be done is in operation 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.350
 of the increase of winter I would propose 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.759
 some tips where we need to do 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.200
 some simple things for example 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.049
 check the coolant 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.920
 in the cooling system 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.310
 check the tire pressure 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.810
 it is very important for consumption for 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.799
 grip especially in winter because 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.679
 even if we don't want to fit the tires 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.270
 thermal percent in Italy the 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.429
 climatic temperatures do not require it 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.990
 assembly of thermal tires though 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.639
 important to check over 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.889
 pressure also the tread is a 

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.749
 vase was wear in addition to 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.700
 this I propose to check the 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:36.020
 washer fluid is provided on 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.649
 control of the air system 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.869
 conditioning 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.209
 if you need an addition of air fat 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.529
 conditioned and about it giancarlo is 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.779
 true that the air conditioning must 

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:46.639
 use it even in winter to avoid 

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.529
 that the circuit is ruined uncertain but to the 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.749
 beyond the circuit the air is ruined 

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:53.569
 winter conditioning serves to protect 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.999
 further visibility by 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.829
 driver as it removes moisture 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.659
 from the inner area of ​​where we need to 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.939
 provide control 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.109
 the engine and beyond that the lights 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.149
 lights are really important 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.069
 I would say fundamental and environmental 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.789
 additional rear lights 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.299
 low beam 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.310
 then you look at happy holidays then 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.590
 we also talk about oil in particular 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.269
 the oil must be changed 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.030
 periodically also the oil change 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.480
 carried out according to the processions of the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.849
 mother house and says either at km or within a year 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.360
 the oil is used precisely to lubricate 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.599
 hence to prevent friction between parts 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 mechanical there are various types of oil and 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.260
 for those who had to make a do-it-yourself refill 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.540
 you or a do-it-yourself oil change is 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.060
 important to carlo to occur 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.250
 always the oil label we tend to 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.510
 buy and above all then check 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.250
 if it complies with what is written 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.540
 in the use and maintenance booklet 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.519
 our car because there are more 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.470
 oil types exactly are you more 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.540
 types of oils with specifications but for 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.269
 guarantee the use 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.340
 oil from your car yes 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.170
 can do it in two ways or respect the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.630
 use and maintenance manual or yes 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.370
 turn to the workshop that place with the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.019
 our software can tell you which one 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.900
 oil must mount and therefore it is much more 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.160
 easy to come here in the workshop e 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.260
 then check the oil you need but 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.150
 not just because then other controls 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.970
 important before traveling 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.639
 or anyway before facing 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.709
 collettati winter in addition to the oil that is 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.139
 just as you said the protective of 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.060
 radiator sure as here because why 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.980
 we have the liquid in front of us 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.599
 protective radiator and so on 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.829
 works together radiator in this case 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.799
 the tip of the water the internal organs 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:42.310
 of the engine the refill should be done with 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.310
 absolutely radiator liquid 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.829
 rusts but not among other rusts 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.510
 there are the engine components 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.970
 so here it is done absolutely 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.620
 when products with products 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.940
 suitable as these are called products 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.520
 anti-freezing among other things but suitable 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.730
 to the cooling system 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.010
 we also have the filters here instead 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.290
 filter that must be replaced when yes 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.240
 goes to replace the oil here we do not have 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.380
 said before but remember that when you do 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.420
 we need the oil change 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.640
 also replace the filter I would say not 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.530
 only advisable but recommended 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.959
 the situation is even mandatory 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.390
 of the filter because the filter replaced 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.570
 increases the oil capacity of 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.640
 lubricate the moving parts keeps 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.650
 the capacity is substantially longer 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.050
 oil at the brief i care then we have 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.300
 said another important check 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.070
 is what concerns the tires that 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.050
 they should be checked very often 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.150
 even once a month 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.250
 once to mix the pressure in 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.920
 more in addition to this one should 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.200
 reverse the tires which means that 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.180
 every 5000 km should be replaced 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.550
 front tire with the rear 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.590
 on the same side both right and stood 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.480
 here therefore without ever crossing them as 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.340
 used once in 20 kings means 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.840
 reversing means mounting the mind 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.580
 right anterior posterior neumatic 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.170
 right and front tire seen 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.850
 place the left and vice versa, and this is 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.130
 a good rule also to prolong 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.290
 so the life of our tires e 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.260
 so travel with security on 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.240
 wet surfaces or facing the 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.040
 cold here we also have another 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.700
 very important element besides this 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.210
 beautiful engine filter 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.490
 we have the tablets of d day this is 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.050
 obviously another check of 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.310
 fundamental importance 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.080
 let's say this is a check 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.700
 done in our workshops or in the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.410
 workshops that you choose but in addition 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.290
 to the control that we can do like 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.210
 I recommend the consumption of tablets of 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.190
 brakes are checked on the dashboard with 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.870
 a beach vat that marks theirs up 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.120
 consumption then go to the workshop 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.780
 morning lights also because 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.169
 we remember with the new law many is 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.720
 You can also make the coupon 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.400
 of cars under warranty at 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.460
 independent workshops such as le 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.860
 your rice mills well and 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.840
 giancarlo we said more or less everything 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.510
 what 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.880
 It is important to know before you get in 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.949
 travel before facing anyway a 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.449
 particularly difficult period as 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.130
 winter to take care of 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.990
 thanks to our car already in the field though 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.990
 it stopped even this time we are
