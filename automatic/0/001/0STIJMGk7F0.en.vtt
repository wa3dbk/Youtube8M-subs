the easy pump sprayers and I thought I

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.619 
the easy pump sprayers and I thought I
would<00:00:37.770> try<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.430> did<00:00:38.610> yesterday<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.420> I'm

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
would try it and I did yesterday and I'm

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
convenient but the only off problem is

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.590 
convenient but the only off problem is
when<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.010> bow<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.490> weed<00:02:25.700> eat<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.330> can't

when you bow and you weed eat you can't

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.240 
when you bow and you weed eat you can't
get<00:02:26.810> all<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.290> grass<00:02:27.500> down<00:02:27.740> at<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.950> bottom

get all of the grass down at the bottom

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.070 
get all of the grass down at the bottom
so<00:02:28.370> I've<00:02:28.490> had<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.670> hand<00:02:29.000> trim<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.450> keep<00:02:29.959> it

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
so I've had to hand trim it keep it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.810 
so I've had to hand trim it keep it
really<00:02:30.320> short<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.800> then<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.040> went<00:02:31.220> along<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
the property I'm just fighting that as

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.440 
the property I'm just fighting that as
hard<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.739> can<00:02:51.850> obviously<00:02:52.850> we're<00:02:53.360> not

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
hard as I can obviously we're not

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.360 
hard as I can obviously we're not
perfect<00:02:53.959> but<00:02:54.140> in<00:02:54.320> any<00:02:54.470> way<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.860> shape<00:02:55.100> or<00:02:55.250> form

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
perfect but in any way the shape or form

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.280 
perfect but in any way the shape or form
that<00:02:55.489> we<00:02:55.700> can<00:02:55.910> again<00:02:56.330> as<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.570> say<00:02:56.750> remove<00:02:57.110> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
that we can again as I say remove the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.660 
that we can again as I say remove the
chemical<00:02:57.440> thumbprint<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:58.400> think<00:02:58.580> that

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
chemical thumbprint I just think that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.430 
chemical thumbprint I just think that
improves<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.510> health<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.840> your<00:02:59.989> property

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
