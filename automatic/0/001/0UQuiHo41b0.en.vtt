00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
do have different values but pedram and

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.689 
do have different values but pedram and
then<00:04:06.290> there<00:04:06.530> are<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.829> ones<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.220> kind<00:04:07.669> of

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
then there are the ones that kind of

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.849 
then there are the ones that kind of
crossover<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.299> lot<00:04:08.449> in<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.629> market<00:04:09.049> so<00:04:09.470> I'm<00:04:09.590> you

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
crossover a lot in the market so I'm you

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.030 
crossover a lot in the market so I'm you
know<00:04:10.009> value<00:04:10.669> whites<00:04:10.909> so<00:04:11.599> this<00:04:12.560> allows<00:04:12.709> me<00:04:12.859> to

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
know value whites so this allows me to

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.949 
know value whites so this allows me to
kind<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.430> explore<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.970> market<00:04:14.329> by<00:04:14.449> increasing

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
kind of explore the market by increasing

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.800 
kind of explore the market by increasing
their<00:04:15.049> values<00:04:15.639> quite<00:04:16.639> a<00:04:16.669> lot<00:04:16.940> as<00:04:17.419> obviously<00:04:17.720> it

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
their values quite a lot as obviously it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.409 
their values quite a lot as obviously it
can<00:04:17.959> look<00:04:18.049> quite<00:04:18.400> realistic<00:04:19.400> if<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.150> make<00:04:20.389> one

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
can look quite realistic if I make one

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.510 
can look quite realistic if I make one
player<00:04:20.930> if<00:04:21.469> I<00:04:21.620> list<00:04:21.799> one<00:04:21.979> player<00:04:22.250> for<00:04:22.490> a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
player if I list one player for a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.459 
player if I list one player for a
certain<00:04:22.820> amount<00:04:22.900> because<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.110> other<00:04:24.229> players

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:24.469 
certain amount because the other players

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.070 
certain amount because the other players
there<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.800> back<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.039> up<00:04:25.279> and<00:04:25.520> show<00:04:25.760> that

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
there to back it up and show that

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.499 
there to back it up and show that
worth<00:04:26.259> their<00:04:26.650> mom<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.550> example<00:04:27.699> I<00:04:28.210> can<00:04:28.270> list

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
worth their mom so in example I can list

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.080 
worth their mom so in example I can list
a<00:04:28.629> beer<00:04:28.870> for<00:04:29.020> 25k<00:04:29.409> for<00:04:29.650> okay<00:04:30.129> bye<00:04:30.310> now<00:04:30.550> this

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
a beer for 25k for okay bye now this

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.529 
a beer for 25k for okay bye now this
Pedro<00:04:31.449> for<00:04:31.629> 12.5<00:04:32.289> k<00:04:32.590> 18.5<00:04:33.580> k<00:04:33.759> buy<00:04:34.030> it<00:04:34.090> now<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:34.509> it

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
Pedro for 12.5 k 18.5 k buy it now so it

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.629 
Pedro for 12.5 k 18.5 k buy it now so it
kind<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.840> gives<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.650> buyer<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.069> an<00:04:36.280> assurance

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
kind of gives the buyer and an assurance

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.089 
kind of gives the buyer and an assurance
so<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.360> knows<00:04:37.599> that<00:04:37.629> one<00:04:38.169> players<00:04:38.469> worth<00:04:38.740> more

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
so it knows that one players worth more

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.790 
so it knows that one players worth more
than<00:04:39.550> another<00:04:39.819> so<00:04:40.689> let's<00:04:41.080> just<00:04:41.259> actually<00:04:41.409> see

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
than another so let's just actually see

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.679 
than another so let's just actually see
what<00:04:42.009> happens<00:04:42.340> when<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.550> our<00:04:42.819> list<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.509> players

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
what happens when I our list of players

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.800 
what happens when I our list of players
and<00:04:43.870> come<00:04:44.710> to<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.889> end<00:04:45.099> so<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.120> can<00:04:46.300> see<00:04:46.509> here

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
and come to the end so you can see here

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.439 
and come to the end so you can see here
I'm<00:04:46.990> actually<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.469> finishing<00:04:48.099> off<00:04:48.310> by<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> bind

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
I'm actually a finishing off by a bind

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.450 
I'm actually a finishing off by a bind
and<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.900> last<00:04:50.110> ever<00:04:50.319> fear<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.889> I<00:04:50.949> go<00:04:51.159> into<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
and the last ever fear and I go into the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.490 
and the last ever fear and I go into the
trade<00:04:52.210> par<00:04:52.979> so<00:04:53.979> what<00:04:54.219> you<00:04:54.969> see<00:04:55.300> here<00:04:55.330> that<00:04:55.960> i

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
trade par so what you see here that i

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.490 
trade par so what you see here that i
actually<00:04:57.150> have<00:04:58.150> 40<00:04:58.629> in<00:04:58.719> my<00:04:58.840> trade<00:04:59.080> partner<00:04:59.379> now

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
a bit of variation in there as well as

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.510 
a bit of variation in there as well as
for<00:05:10.419> 40<00:05:10.780> formations<00:05:11.409> for<00:05:11.590> once<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:11.919> want<00:05:12.340> to

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
for 40 formations for once you want to

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.999 
for 40 formations for once you want to
just<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.270> kind<00:05:13.449> of<00:05:13.539> varied<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.050> value<00:05:14.379> make<00:05:14.860> it

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
just to kind of varied a value make it

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.379

market a bit more and depth it doesn't
take<00:06:46.970> that<00:06:47.090> much<00:06:47.210> time<00:06:47.480> takes<00:06:47.810> a<00:06:47.900> few<00:06:48.050> minutes

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
take that much time takes a few minutes

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.170 
take that much time takes a few minutes
literally<00:06:48.770> it's<00:06:49.430> not<00:06:49.550> how<00:06:49.670> much<00:06:49.790> your<00:06:50.000> time

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
literally it's not how much your time

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.490 
literally it's not how much your time
with<00:06:50.300> you<00:06:50.450> used<00:06:50.690> is<00:06:50.840> technique<00:06:51.170> this<00:06:51.320> is

with you used is technique this is

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.710 
with you used is technique this is
called<00:06:51.740> crossover<00:06:52.490> manipulation<00:06:53.210> I<00:06:53.390> know

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
called crossover manipulation I know

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.620 
called crossover manipulation I know
that's<00:06:53.900> wacky<00:06:54.140> etc<00:06:54.890> but<00:06:55.070> it's<00:06:55.880> a<00:06:55.970> new<00:06:56.210> sick

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
that's wacky etc but it's a new sick
