in<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.220> other<00:00:05.370> videos<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.210> ran<00:00:06.720> into<00:00:06.899> all<00:00:07.200> kinds

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740

in the other videos I ran into all kinds
of<00:00:07.799> stuff<00:00:07.940> so<00:00:08.940> my<00:00:09.330> water<00:00:09.480> pumps<00:00:09.929> off<00:00:10.110> I'm

trying<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.950> do<00:00:11.099> my<00:00:11.309> timing<00:00:12.179> chain<00:00:12.480> gear<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.639> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
trying to do my timing chain gear and a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849 
trying to do my timing chain gear and a
few<00:00:15.059> things<00:00:15.330> they<00:00:15.480> don't<00:00:15.630> tell<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.379> get

few things they don't tell you to get
this<00:00:17.070> whole<00:00:17.310> thing<00:00:17.609> off<00:00:17.970> without<00:00:18.300> taking

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
this whole thing off without taking

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.630 
this whole thing off without taking
everything<00:00:19.109> off<00:00:19.380> there's<00:00:20.189> three<00:00:20.460> bolts

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
everything off there's three bolts

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.800 
everything off there's three bolts
there's<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.539> there's<00:00:22.850> one<00:00:23.850> back<00:00:24.480> there

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
there's one here there's one back there

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.339 
there's one here there's one back there
and<00:00:25.640> then<00:00:26.640> there's<00:00:27.090> another<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:28.220> right<00:00:29.220> there

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
we've got our harmonic balancer puller

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.580 
we've got our harmonic balancer puller
and<00:00:49.219> I'll<00:00:50.219> show<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.520> I've<00:00:50.789> already<00:00:51.180> ruined

from autozone only 20 bucks this thing
so<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.100> looks<00:00:59.840> broke<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> bolt<00:01:01.469> off<00:01:01.800> in

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
so it looks broke one of the bolt off in

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.830 
so it looks broke one of the bolt off in
the<00:01:02.969> bolt<00:01:03.180> holes<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.870> holds<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.640> pulley<00:01:06.510> on

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the bolt holes that holds the pulley on

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.250 
the bolt holes that holds the pulley on
the<00:01:07.229> harmonic<00:01:07.650> balancer<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.140> that's<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the harmonic balancer and that's the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.810 
the harmonic balancer and that's the
outer<00:01:10.409> ring<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> harmonic<00:01:11.310> balancer

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
outer ring of the harmonic balancer

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.920 
outer ring of the harmonic balancer
that<00:01:12.119> pulled<00:01:13.080> off<00:01:13.290> -<00:01:13.820> there's<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.150> pulley<00:01:15.420> get

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that pulled off - there's the pulley get

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.920 
that pulled off - there's the pulley get
yourself<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.439> parts<00:01:16.799> bin<00:01:17.390> here's<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.689> old

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
yourself a parts bin here's the old

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.280 
yourself a parts bin here's the old
water<00:01:19.170> pump<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:23.930> it<00:01:27.290> kind

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
water pump and as you can see it it kind

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710 
water pump and as you can see it it kind
of<00:01:28.320> makes<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> grind<00:01:28.890> inside<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.509> just

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
of makes a grind inside so I just

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
of makes a grind inside so I just
figured<00:01:30.990> I'd<00:01:31.110> replace<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> anyway<00:01:31.790> which<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
figured I'd replace it anyway which you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.160 
figured I'd replace it anyway which you
might<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.240> well<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.750> you're<00:01:33.900> doing<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
first place so stuck this thing on here

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.380 
first place so stuck this thing on here
and<00:02:18.790> wasn't<00:02:19.790> working

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
and wasn't working

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.690 
and wasn't working
just<00:02:20.660> wrenched<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.410> wrenched<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.010> ranch<00:02:22.250> had

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
just wrenched and wrenched and ranch had

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.300 
just wrenched and wrenched and ranch had
a<00:02:22.730> second<00:02:23.120> opinion<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.840> they<00:02:24.770> said<00:02:24.980> there<00:02:25.160> was

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
a second opinion and they said there was

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.670 
a second opinion and they said there was
a<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.720> know<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:26.930> thought<00:02:27.110> there<00:02:27.290> was<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> thing

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
a you know we thought there was a thing

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
on the end of the end of the shaft there

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.380 
on the end of the end of the shaft there
that<00:02:29.959> actually<00:02:30.110> bolted<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.430> that's<00:02:32.150> not

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
that actually bolted to but that's not

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.500 
that actually bolted to but that's not
the<00:02:32.510> case<00:02:32.720> what<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.160> do<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:35.030> what<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
the case what you have to do is what the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.830 
the case what you have to do is what the
other<00:02:35.630> guys<00:02:35.900> fede<00:02:36.260> ranch<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.830> forever<00:02:37.840> you

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
other guys fede ranch on it forever you

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.900 
other guys fede ranch on it forever you
have<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.110> put<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.380> bolt<00:02:39.620> back<00:02:39.739> in<00:02:40.250> because

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
have to put the bolt back in because

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.059 
have to put the bolt back in because
when<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.630> put<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> harmonic<00:02:42.350> balancer<00:02:42.380> and

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
when you put the harmonic balancer and

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.250 
when you put the harmonic balancer and
it's<00:02:43.370> not<00:02:43.610> pressing<00:02:44.090> against<00:02:44.690> anything<00:02:45.080> but

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
it's not pressing against anything but

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.680 
it's not pressing against anything but
itself<00:02:45.680> I've<00:02:46.310> beat<00:02:46.550> on<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.850> thing<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.300> hard<00:02:47.570> I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
itself I've beat on this thing so hard I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.020 
itself I've beat on this thing so hard I
got<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> crack<00:02:48.170> going<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.830> anyway<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.760> put

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
got a crack going in it anyway so I put

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.600 
got a crack going in it anyway so I put
the<00:02:50.180> bolt<00:02:50.420> back<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:51.200> not<00:02:52.160> all<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.489> way

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
the bolt back in not all the way

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.340 
the bolt back in not all the way
threaded<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.300> got<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.540> leave<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.810> out<00:02:53.959> and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
threaded and you got to leave it out and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.310 
threaded and you got to leave it out and
then<00:02:54.500> loosen<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.180> pulls<00:02:56.420> out<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.110> then

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
then loosen it so it pulls out and then

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.650 
then loosen it so it pulls out and then
take<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.769> off<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.459> loosen<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.880> again<00:02:59.209> put<00:02:59.570> it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
take it off and loosen it again put it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.570 
take it off and loosen it again put it
back<00:02:59.810> together<00:02:59.959> pull<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.470> out<00:03:00.560> more<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.220> anyway

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
back together pull it out more so anyway

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.479 
back together pull it out more so anyway
I<00:03:01.930> didn't<00:03:02.930> want<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.140> harm<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> bowl<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.130> just

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
I didn't want to harm the bowl so I just

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.640 
I didn't want to harm the bowl so I just
got<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> socket<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.420> fit<00:03:05.810> on<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.140> bolt<00:03:06.350> I

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
got a socket that fit on the bolt I

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.390 
got a socket that fit on the bolt I
think<00:03:07.130> it's<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:09.190> 3/16<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:13.040> I've<00:03:13.190> loosened

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
think it's a 3/16 and so I've loosened

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.199 
think it's a 3/16 and so I've loosened
the<00:03:13.760> bolt<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:15.430> put<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:16.580> on<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:16.970> put<00:03:17.180> the

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
the bolt and put that on it put the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.330 
the bolt and put that on it put the
puller<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.110> wouldn't<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.829> know<00:03:18.860> it

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
puller on it and wouldn't you know it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.550 
puller on it and wouldn't you know it

bolts<00:03:33.620> off<00:03:33.950> in<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.340> right<00:03:34.519> there<00:03:34.790> like<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.329> did

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
bolts off in it right there like I did

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.220 
bolts off in it right there like I did
and<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:38.000> didn't<00:03:38.299> seem<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.540> be<00:03:38.810> reversed

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
and it didn't seem to be reversed

thready there nothing on this seem to be
reversed<00:03:41.989> thread<00:03:42.350> so<00:03:42.829> just<00:03:43.519> clear<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:44.060> up

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
reversed thread so just clear that up

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.780 
reversed thread so just clear that up
too<00:03:44.530> anyway<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:45.590> now<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:46.010> get<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.280> take<00:03:46.579> this

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
too anyway so now I get to take this

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.090 
too anyway so now I get to take this
finally<00:03:47.600> get<00:03:47.750> my<00:03:47.930> stuff<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.440> got<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.620> harmonic

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
finally get my stuff I got a harmonic

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.250 
finally get my stuff I got a harmonic

not and smaller and anyway I'm assuming

not and smaller and anyway I'm assuming
it's<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.910> smaller<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.540> didn't<00:04:08.930> have<00:04:09.019> a

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
it's a smaller one I didn't have a

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.660 
it's a smaller one I didn't have a
chance<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.500> measure<00:04:09.680> anything<00:04:10.070> I<00:04:10.430> just

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
chance to measure anything I just

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.240 
chance to measure anything I just
ordered<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.480> if<00:04:11.750> not<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:12.290> can<00:04:12.709> exchange<00:04:12.920> it
