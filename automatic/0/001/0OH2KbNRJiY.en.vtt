00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
what we do is we go in again underneath

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
what we do is we go in again underneath
the<00:02:00.509> material<00:02:01.079> come<00:02:01.380> back<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.009> little<00:02:02.130> bit

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

keep your
material<00:02:14.330> folded<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> half<00:02:16.860> because

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
material folded in to the half because

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.250 
material folded in to the half because
remember<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.760> had<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.270> section<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.200> that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
remember we had that section and that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.240 
remember we had that section and that
was<00:02:19.500> ironed<00:02:20.210> halfway<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:22.140> that's<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.950> half

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
was ironed halfway so that's that half

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.340 
was ironed halfway so that's that half
of<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.460> binding<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.120> fold<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.630> tight<00:02:24.990> pit

I'll<00:02:58.410> take<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.130> corner<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.700> we<00:02:59.850> can<00:03:00.710> see

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
I'll take it to the corner so we can see

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.400 
I'll take it to the corner so we can see
that<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:02.490> just<00:03:02.820> seeing<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:03.930> when<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.200> do

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
that that's just seeing but when you do

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.200 
that that's just seeing but when you do
it<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.980> know<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.670> can<00:03:05.850> see<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
it like you know you can see the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.440 
it like you know you can see the
stitches<00:03:06.630> now<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.350> if<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.550> sew<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.240> press

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
stitches now but if I sew that and press

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.900 
stitches now but if I sew that and press
that<00:03:09.660> down<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.990> bit<00:03:10.110> they<00:03:10.530> won't<00:03:10.770> be<00:03:10.980> seen<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.880> I

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
that down a bit they won't be seen so I

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.820 
that down a bit they won't be seen so I
don't<00:03:12.270> mind<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.720> doesn't<00:03:13.050> matter<00:03:13.230> because<00:03:13.500> it

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
don't mind it doesn't matter because it

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.010 
don't mind it doesn't matter because it
just<00:03:13.980> adds<00:03:14.250> character<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:15.060> more<00:03:15.270> contrast<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
just adds character and more contrast to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
bit and go underneath the material come

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.230 
bit and go underneath the material come
back<00:03:30.060> at<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.660> point<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.860> catch<00:03:32.490> those<00:03:32.820> two

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
back at that point and catch those two

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.470 
back at that point and catch those two
bits<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.610> pull<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.790> through<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.450> that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
bits and pull that through so that

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.840 
bits and pull that through so that
corner<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.350> mitered<00:03:37.710> so<00:03:38.190> I'll<00:03:38.280> go<00:03:38.430> underneath

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
corner is mitered so I'll go underneath

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.990 
corner is mitered so I'll go underneath
again<00:03:39.420> make<00:03:40.200> sure<00:03:40.230> materials<00:03:41.010> fold<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.580> evenly

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
again make sure materials fold it evenly

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.390 
again make sure materials fold it evenly
go<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.960> the<00:03:43.320> stitch<00:03:43.680> line<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.430> come<00:03:45.240> back<00:03:45.420> up

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
go to the stitch line and come back up

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.400 
go to the stitch line and come back up
there<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.550> go<00:03:47.790> your<00:03:48.180> corners<00:03:48.630> mitered<00:03:49.170> and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
there you go your corners mitered and

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.160 
there you go your corners mitered and
your<00:03:50.130> bindings<00:03:50.610> being<00:03:51.150> done<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.930> that's

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
your bindings being done and that's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.840 
your bindings being done and that's
going<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.380> go<00:03:52.530> really<00:03:52.860> really<00:03:53.310> quick<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.610> it's

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
going to go really really quick and it's

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.610 
going to go really really quick and it's
interesting<00:03:54.120> because<00:03:54.420> it's<00:03:54.660> another<00:03:54.990> step<00:03:55.440> of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
interesting because it's another step of

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.170 
interesting because it's another step of
it<00:03:55.710> you're<00:03:55.860> not<00:03:56.010> always<00:03:56.280> doing<00:03:56.490> the<00:03:56.940> same

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180
