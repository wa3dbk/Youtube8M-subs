00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 ah 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.630
 or I then to present a scooter with the 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.760
 that I have worked a good friendship in 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.700
 these days thanks to their singular 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.029
 features is about the without maxim 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.190
 400 yes and is able to present battle to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.050
 the best of its category or if always 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.270
 has boasted of having standards of 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.710
 very high quality this may be a 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.570
 little inheritance that left him deep 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.059
 since in a part of its history 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.890
 was a subsidiary of the Japanese brand the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.530
 plastics and paint are very good 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.150
 quality plus its presence is very very 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.730
 nice and its nice touch and fit 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.310
 very well maybe to put some but 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.440
 the screen is fixed and could have 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.180
 made adjustable in height although 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.920
 out manually the position of 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.630
 driving is very comfortable is very 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.130
 good and also the habitability also 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.510
 it's fine there's plenty of space for 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.020
 legs and even for the drivers 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.250
 The seat is large and comfortable and 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.930
 you can not complain about our 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.330
 I have a backup 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.399
 but subject to turn your back one aspect 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.780
 important in this type of vehicle is 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.810
 its load capacity and in that sense 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.729
 the maximum 400 comes very well endowed 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.130
 has two side glove boxes one 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.049
 central with plugs for 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.000
 to charge the phone or how it looks 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.460
 also and then the eye socket the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 seat is truly wide fit 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.939
 two helmets although maybe 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.470
 require some skill and its placement 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.470
 but two full-length cats come in 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.390
 the maximum 400 offers us a modern 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.570
 400-centimeter single-cylinder engine 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.270
 cubic that yields 34 horses to 7,000 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.180
 revolutions and goes internally treated 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.580
 with a ceramic additive to reduce in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.440
 possible in frictions and optimize 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.000
 his performance I heard comments by 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.590
 part of some of my colleagues that is a 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.660
 engine that has a behavior a 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.310
 little rough at low revolutions to me 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.660
 I honestly did not like it 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.640
 it seems like it's great that it's going well 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.890
 of turns of subject of work no 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.140
 presents empty and then when it happens 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.720
 4,000 revolutions is a pretty engine 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.700
 cheerful an even fun engine that 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.290
 provides good benefits to 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.580
 level of the best in its category and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.470
 In terms of consumption, we can 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.910
 consider quite correct to me in a 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.010
 mixed use throughout the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.540
 proof has left me an average consumption of 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.680
 about 5 liters 100 kilometers that I 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.060
 it seems quite moderate 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.099
 the guide the litter has a 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.989
 smooth operation as befits 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.280
 a type of this type of vehicle well 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.799
 rather people 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.060
 big and maybe the shock absorbers 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.890
 rear that carries a double shock absorber 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.109
 back that is the behavior of 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.959
 price a little dry maybe it's that 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.299
 a small dot to improve your braking 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.489
 It is composed of two front discs and one 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.650
 back and also prefers the softness to 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.269
 the strength I really liked your 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.709
 progressivity and good touch that I 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.450
 provide the brakes their mobility in 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.510
 cities is very good much better than 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.099
 that it might seem by its size this 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.959
 maximum 400 I would recommend it 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.519
 mainly to all those who 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.840
 value above any other 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.000
 good relationship parameter 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.430
 quality-price offers very good 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.319
 good good equipment features 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.840
 good quality good running comfort 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.379
 load capacity in order a lot of maxi 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.379
 good things
