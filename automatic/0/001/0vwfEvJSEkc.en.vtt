and then when you play when you're

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.960 
and then when you play when you're
playing<00:01:38.890> multiple<00:01:39.160> cities<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.670> sort<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.880> want

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
playing multiple cities you sort of want

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.130 
playing multiple cities you sort of want
to<00:01:40.090> think<00:01:40.450> about<00:01:40.509> how<00:01:40.660> those<00:01:40.810> cities<00:01:41.050> are

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
to think about how those cities are

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.180 
to think about how those cities are
gonna<00:01:41.259> work<00:01:41.350> together<00:01:41.500> how<00:01:41.920> they're<00:01:42.040> going<00:01:42.130> to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
gonna work together how they're going to

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.800 
gonna work together how they're going to
support<00:01:42.520> each<00:01:42.670> other<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.660> may<00:01:43.780> be

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
support each other so it may be

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.960 
support each other so it may be
something<00:01:44.080> like<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.340> example<00:01:45.430> I<00:01:45.729> showed<00:01:45.759> I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
something like in the example I showed I

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.940 
something like in the example I showed I
have<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.149> big<00:01:46.300> casino<00:01:46.720> city<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.560> has<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.710> lot<00:01:47.920> of

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
have a big casino city that has a lot of

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.109 
have a big casino city that has a lot of
that<00:01:48.160> needs<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> lot<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.520> people<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.940> come<00:01:49.090> and

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
that needs a lot of people to come and

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.580 
that needs a lot of people to come and
be<00:01:49.270> tourists<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:49.899> created<00:01:50.229> some<00:01:50.440> other

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
be tourists so I created some other

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.380 
be tourists so I created some other
cities<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.040> sort<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.280> provide<00:01:51.610> people<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.240> come

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
cities to sort of provide people to come

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.700 
cities to sort of provide people to come
and<00:01:52.420> be<00:01:52.570> tourists<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.080> those<00:01:53.200> cities<00:01:53.410> and<00:01:53.680> I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
and be tourists in those cities and I

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.770 
and be tourists in those cities and I
even<00:01:53.800> created<00:01:54.009> one<00:01:54.369> that<00:01:54.670> was<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.210> trash<00:01:55.509> City

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
even created one that was a trash City

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.660 
even created one that was a trash City
and<00:01:56.050> all<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.200> did<00:01:56.410> was<00:01:56.440> provide<00:01:56.860> trash<00:01:57.310> coverage

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and all I did was provide trash coverage

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.300 
and all I did was provide trash coverage
those<00:01:57.940> other<00:01:58.330> cities<00:01:58.660> so<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.860> that's<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.130> lot

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
those other cities so and that's a lot

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.949 
those other cities so and that's a lot
of<00:02:00.340> fun<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.640> create<00:02:00.819> and<00:02:01.090> sort<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.509> push<00:02:01.810> the

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
of fun to create and sort of push the

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.210 
of fun to create and sort of push the
system<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.380> see<00:02:02.530> where<00:02:02.679> you<00:02:02.740> can<00:02:02.830> go<00:02:02.890> with<00:02:03.039> it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
system and see where you can go with it

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.699 
system and see where you can go with it
so<00:02:03.910> no<00:02:04.270> longer<00:02:04.479> do<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.840> have<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.080> decide<00:02:05.440> I'm

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
happens if I'd chosen to build a more

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.240 
happens if I'd chosen to build a more
industrial<00:02:11.230> thing<00:02:11.650> now<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:12.010> actually

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
industrial thing now you can actually

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.580 
industrial thing now you can actually
play<00:02:12.459> with<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:12.790> those<00:02:13.000> different

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
play with all those different

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.570 
play with all those different
possibilities<00:02:14.590> yeah<00:02:14.770> exactly<00:02:14.920> i<00:02:15.250> mean<00:02:15.310> you

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
possibilities yeah exactly i mean you

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580 
possibilities yeah exactly i mean you
can<00:02:15.730> not<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:16.690> every<00:02:16.870> city<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.140> make<00:02:17.319> can<00:02:17.500> be

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
can not it so every city you make can be

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.780 
can not it so every city you make can be
a<00:02:17.620> little<00:02:17.800> bit<00:02:17.950> different<00:02:18.340> answer<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.670> have

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
a little bit different answer to have

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.030 
a little bit different answer to have
its<00:02:18.970> own<00:02:19.030> specialization<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.860> can<00:02:20.950> sort

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
its own specialization and you can sort

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.320 
its own specialization and you can sort
of<00:02:21.160> push<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.580> different<00:02:21.819> ways<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.120> allows

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
of push that in different ways it allows

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.970 
of push that in different ways it allows
you<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> create<00:02:22.690> these<00:02:22.959> really<00:02:23.319> fun<00:02:23.560> cities

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
you to create these really fun cities

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.530 
you to create these really fun cities
too<00:02:24.250> if<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.700> if<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.060> built<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.420> right

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
too if you if you built the right

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.420 
too if you if you built the right
infrastructure<00:02:25.780> we're<00:02:26.380> sort<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:27.220> create

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
infrastructure we're sort of you create

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.339 
infrastructure we're sort of you create
these<00:02:27.580> central<00:02:27.940> cities<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.390> are<00:02:28.569> providing

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
these central cities that are providing

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.839 
these central cities that are providing
all<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.650> coverage<00:02:30.010> all<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.280> services<00:02:30.790> and

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
all the coverage all the services and

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.550 
all the coverage all the services and
everything<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:31.480> sort<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.750> go<00:02:31.959> crazy<00:02:32.140> with

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
everything you can sort of go crazy with

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.559 
everything you can sort of go crazy with
some<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.220> cities<00:02:33.490> in<00:02:33.610> there<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.209> mean

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
some of the cities in there so I mean

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.780 
some of the cities in there so I mean
like<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> big<00:02:34.990> roller<00:02:35.290> coaster<00:02:35.650> road<00:02:36.280> city<00:02:36.550> note

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
like a big roller coaster road city note

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.970 
like a big roller coaster road city note
I'm<00:02:36.940> sure<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.240> saw<00:02:37.270> on<00:02:37.510> my<00:02:37.750> demo<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.680> seemed<00:02:38.890> to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
I'm sure you saw on my demo it seemed to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.790 
I'm sure you saw on my demo it seemed to
go<00:02:39.010> over<00:02:39.220> really<00:02:39.370> well<00:02:39.459> today<00:02:39.819> so<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.770> a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
go over really well today so so it's a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.610 
go over really well today so so it's a
lot<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:41.950> fun<00:02:42.040> yeah<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.930> roller<00:02:43.930> coasters<00:02:44.440> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
lot of fun yeah and roller coasters and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.530 
lot of fun yeah and roller coasters and
roads<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.849> because<00:02:46.150> we're<00:02:46.270> it's<00:02:46.360> going<00:02:46.480> to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
roads and because we're it's going to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.760 
roads and because we're it's going to
have<00:02:46.630> corners<00:02:46.990> now<00:02:47.140> they<00:02:47.319> can<00:02:47.440> actually<00:02:47.680> be

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
have corners now they can actually be

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.880 
have corners now they can actually be
curvy

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
curvy

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.950 
curvy
yes<00:02:49.280> yes<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.880> course<00:02:50.120> we<00:02:50.300> know<00:02:50.420> curvy<00:02:50.720> roads

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
yes yes of course we know curvy roads

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.990 
yes yes of course we know curvy roads
one<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.620> best<00:02:51.800> most<00:02:52.490> requested<00:02:52.910> features

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
one of the best most requested features

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.090 
one of the best most requested features
and<00:02:53.630> we've<00:02:53.930> actually<00:02:54.020> given<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> bunch<00:02:55.010> of

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
and we've actually given a bunch of

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.949 
and we've actually given a bunch of
different<00:02:55.370> Road<00:02:55.520> draw<00:02:55.700> tools<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.540> can

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
different Road draw tools so you can

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.330 
different Road draw tools so you can
make<00:02:57.050> straight<00:02:57.350> roads<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:58.010> make<00:02:58.160> just

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
make straight roads you can make just

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.490 
make straight roads you can make just
sort<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.490> wild<00:02:59.150> random<00:02:59.600> curvy<00:02:59.959> roads<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.380> can

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
sort of wild random curvy roads you can

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.260 
sort of wild random curvy roads you can
we<00:03:00.950> even<00:03:01.069> have<00:03:01.190> this<00:03:01.310> arc<00:03:01.580> tool<00:03:01.850> so<00:03:02.120> it's

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
we even have this arc tool so it's

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.140 
we even have this arc tool so it's
really<00:03:02.480> easy<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.810> make<00:03:02.840> nice<00:03:03.200> smooth<00:03:03.590> curves

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
really easy to make nice smooth curves

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.750 
really easy to make nice smooth curves
and<00:03:05.150> then<00:03:05.660> we<00:03:05.750> have<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> grid<00:03:06.580> rectangle<00:03:07.580> draw

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
and then we have a grid rectangle draw

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.250 
and then we have a grid rectangle draw
tool<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:08.300> what<00:03:08.450> would<00:03:08.540> have<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.660> call<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.050> where

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
tool is what would have to call it where

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.750 
tool is what would have to call it where
you<00:03:09.410> can<00:03:09.560> make<00:03:09.650> sort<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:09.950> whole<00:03:10.160> city<00:03:10.459> blocks

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
you can make sort of whole city blocks

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.820 
you can make sort of whole city blocks
but<00:03:11.630> in<00:03:11.750> addition<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.380> actually<00:03:12.500> give

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
but in addition to that it actually give

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.170 
but in addition to that it actually give
you<00:03:12.950> guides<00:03:13.250> when<00:03:13.640> you're<00:03:13.760> drawing<00:03:13.940> those

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
you guides when you're drawing those

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.910 
you guides when you're drawing those
roads<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.630> sort<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.870> show<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.620> how<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:15.860> can

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
roads to sort of show you how you can

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.830 
roads to sort of show you how you can
optimally<00:03:16.400> place<00:03:16.760> those<00:03:17.030> roads<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.720> can

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
optimally place those roads so you can

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.449 
optimally place those roads so you can
really<00:03:17.989> take<00:03:18.500> advantage<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> real<00:03:19.160> estate

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
really take advantage of the real estate

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.280 
really take advantage of the real estate
you<00:03:20.030> know<00:03:20.120> well<00:03:20.480> that's<00:03:20.630> very<00:03:20.720> important<00:03:21.200> to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
you know well that's very important to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.170 
you know well that's very important to
our<00:03:21.320> players<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.190> was<00:03:22.550> about<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.820> say<00:03:22.940> how<00:03:23.120> do

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
our players so I was about to say how do

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.699 
our players so I was about to say how do
you<00:03:23.300> feel<00:03:23.540> about<00:03:23.570> making<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.110> game<00:03:24.260> where<00:03:24.590> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
you feel about making a game where the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.729 
you feel about making a game where the
thing<00:03:24.920> most<00:03:25.160> people<00:03:25.280> want<00:03:25.850> is<00:03:26.270> curvy<00:03:26.720> roads<00:03:26.900> I

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
thing most people want is curvy roads I

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.500 
thing most people want is curvy roads I
feel<00:03:28.130> great<00:03:28.220> about<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.670> mean<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.030> thing<00:03:29.480> is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
feel great about it I mean the thing is

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
feel great about it I mean the thing is
curvy<00:03:29.870> roads<00:03:30.019> are<00:03:30.110> actually<00:03:30.350> really

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
curvy roads are actually really

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.890 
curvy roads are actually really
complicated<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.550> put<00:03:31.700> into<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.000> game<00:03:32.209> it's

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
complicated to put into the game it's

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.540 
complicated to put into the game it's
not<00:03:33.050> just<00:03:33.110> making<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.800> intuitive<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.340> draw

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
not just making it intuitive to draw

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.220 
not just making it intuitive to draw
them<00:03:34.760> but<00:03:35.060> also<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.450> spacing<00:03:35.750> as<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.110> was

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
them but also that spacing as I was

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.890 
them but also that spacing as I was
talking<00:03:36.500> about<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.670> also<00:03:38.209> making<00:03:38.420> sure<00:03:38.570> that

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
talking about and also making sure that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.990 
talking about and also making sure that
the<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.470> buildings<00:03:40.190> look<00:03:40.340> good<00:03:40.580> because<00:03:40.790> when

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
the the buildings look good because when

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.490 
the the buildings look good because when
you<00:03:41.090> have<00:03:41.300> that<00:03:41.510> sort<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.780> ability<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.140> create

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
you have that sort of ability to create

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.720 
you have that sort of ability to create
these<00:03:42.680> roads<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.280> can<00:03:43.400> sort<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.610> do

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
these roads that you can sort of do

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
these roads that you can sort of do
whatever<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.120> want<00:03:44.330> you<00:03:44.450> want<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.630> make<00:03:44.720> sure

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
whatever you want you want to make sure

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.449 
whatever you want you want to make sure
the<00:03:44.930> building's<00:03:45.560> line<00:03:45.739> up<00:03:45.890> well<00:03:46.100> with<00:03:46.280> the

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
the building's line up well with the

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.630 
the building's line up well with the
streets<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.060> they<00:03:47.570> fit<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:47.959> nicely<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:49.489> do

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
streets and they fit in nicely so you do

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.090 
streets and they fit in nicely so you do

books<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.690> shiny<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.320> 3d<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.430> beautiful

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
books and shiny and 3d and beautiful

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.640 
books and shiny and 3d and beautiful
colors<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:05.930> looks<00:05:06.200> amazing<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.620> is

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
colors and looks amazing it is

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.620 
colors and looks amazing it is
realistically<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:07.760> is<00:05:07.850> exactly<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.450> same

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
realistically it is exactly the same

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.140 
realistically it is exactly the same
game<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.320> we<00:05:09.500> played<00:05:09.800> back<00:05:10.130> in<00:05:10.370> was<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:10.970> the

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
game that we played back in was it the

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.080 
game that we played back in was it the
early<00:05:11.420> 90s<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.620> was<00:05:12.830> with<00:05:13.430> no<00:05:13.610> graphics

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
early 90s and it was with no graphics

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.860 
early 90s and it was with no graphics
and<00:05:14.330> no<00:05:14.540> nore<00:05:15.470> 3d<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:15.980> was<00:05:16.070> all<00:05:16.220> just<00:05:16.370> very<00:05:16.430> flat

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
and no nore 3d it was all just very flat

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.210 
and no nore 3d it was all just very flat
everything<00:05:17.870> yeah<00:05:18.350> it's<00:05:18.530> true<00:05:18.740> i<00:05:18.770> mean<00:05:18.860> i<00:05:19.100> think

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
everything yeah it's true i mean i think

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
everything yeah it's true i mean i think
that<00:05:19.400> was<00:05:19.610> one<00:05:19.700> of<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.790> things<00:05:19.940> we're<00:05:20.090> really

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
that was one of the things we're really

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.850 
that was one of the things we're really
aiming<00:05:20.390> to<00:05:20.540> do<00:05:20.660> is<00:05:20.810> make<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.140> it<00:05:21.260> is<00:05:21.380> SimCity

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
aiming to do is make it it is SimCity

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.770 
aiming to do is make it it is SimCity
it's<00:05:22.010> got<00:05:22.160> to<00:05:22.280> feel<00:05:22.370> like<00:05:22.550> SimCity<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.300> uh<00:05:23.330> you

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
it's got to feel like SimCity and uh you

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.030 
it's got to feel like SimCity and uh you
know<00:05:23.840> when<00:05:24.050> people<00:05:24.140> get<00:05:24.350> their<00:05:24.530> hands<00:05:24.680> on<00:05:24.830> with

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
know when people get their hands on with

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.440 
know when people get their hands on with
with<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.550> for<00:05:25.700> the<00:05:25.760> first<00:05:25.940> time<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.150> mean<00:05:26.360> that

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
with it for the first time I mean that

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.870 
with it for the first time I mean that
sort<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:26.660> their<00:05:26.780> first<00:05:27.020> reaction<00:05:27.200> is<00:05:27.560> like<00:05:27.880> is

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
sort of their first reaction is like is

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.930 
sort of their first reaction is like is
it<00:05:29.150> SimCity<00:05:29.630> you<00:05:29.810> made<00:05:29.990> SimCity<00:05:30.410> hooray<00:05:30.940> and

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
it SimCity you made SimCity hooray and

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.180 
it SimCity you made SimCity hooray and
you<00:05:32.660> know<00:05:32.780> we're<00:05:33.440> really<00:05:33.590> pleased<00:05:33.860> with<00:05:33.920> sort

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
you know we're really pleased with sort

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.920 
you know we're really pleased with sort
of<00:05:34.250> where<00:05:34.400> that's<00:05:34.580> coin<00:05:34.820> and<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.060> think<00:05:35.300> what's

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
of where that's coin and I think what's

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.390 
of where that's coin and I think what's
interesting<00:05:35.990> is<00:05:36.410> looking<00:05:36.950> at<00:05:37.040> how<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.220> glass

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
interesting is looking at how the glass

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.580 
interesting is looking at how the glass
box<00:05:37.669> engine<00:05:37.940> works<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:38.419> how<00:05:38.900> it<00:05:38.930> drives<00:05:39.260> some

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
box engine works and how it drives some

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.560 
box engine works and how it drives some
city<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.070> while<00:05:40.640> it<00:05:40.730> just<00:05:40.790> feel<00:05:41.060> like<00:05:41.150> SimCity

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
city so while it just feel like SimCity

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.060 
city so while it just feel like SimCity
it's<00:05:41.720> a<00:05:41.810> new<00:05:41.930> SimCity<00:05:42.140> you<00:05:42.470> know<00:05:42.590> it<00:05:42.650> is<00:05:42.770> it<00:05:42.980> has

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
it's a new SimCity you know it is it has

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.350 
it's a new SimCity you know it is it has
been<00:05:43.220> reimagined<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.880> it<00:05:43.970> does<00:05:44.120> work<00:05:44.270> a

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
been reimagined and it does work a

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.060 
been reimagined and it does work a
little<00:05:44.480> differently<00:05:44.680> and<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:45.800> there's<00:05:45.980> that

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
little differently and so there's that

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.040 
little differently and so there's that
fun<00:05:46.370> of<00:05:46.520> like<00:05:46.700> discovering<00:05:47.180> how<00:05:47.480> it<00:05:47.660> works<00:05:47.840> and

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
fun of like discovering how it works and

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.570 
fun of like discovering how it works and
how<00:05:48.140> the<00:05:48.260> engine<00:05:48.590> works<00:05:48.620> how<00:05:49.070> to<00:05:49.130> use<00:05:49.400> it<00:05:49.550> to

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
how the engine works how to use it to

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.340 
how the engine works how to use it to
your<00:05:49.730> advantage<00:05:49.820> and<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.720> know<00:05:50.810> we<00:05:50.960> certainly

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
your advantage and you know we certainly

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.020 
your advantage and you know we certainly
know<00:05:51.740> a<00:05:51.770> lot<00:05:51.980> of<00:05:52.010> people<00:05:52.070> did<00:05:52.370> that<00:05:52.520> with<00:05:52.700> our

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
know a lot of people did that with our

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.970 
know a lot of people did that with our
previous<00:05:53.300> SimCity<00:05:53.930> so<00:05:54.200> I<00:05:54.380> think<00:05:54.620> for<00:05:54.890> those

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
previous SimCity so I think for those

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.320 
previous SimCity so I think for those
people<00:05:55.160> it's<00:05:55.490> really<00:05:55.700> opening<00:05:56.150> up<00:05:56.240> that

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
people it's really opening up that

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.240 
people it's really opening up that
opportunity<00:05:56.450> again<00:05:56.870> that<00:05:57.140> chance<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:58.010> sort<00:05:58.160> of

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
opportunity again that chance to sort of

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.790 
opportunity again that chance to sort of
rediscover<00:05:58.760> and<00:05:59.000> rekindle<00:05:59.450> that<00:05:59.570> love<00:05:59.840> of<00:06:00.260> the

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
rediscover and rekindle that love of the

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.460 
rediscover and rekindle that love of the
game<00:06:00.980> so<00:06:01.580> and<00:06:02.120> so<00:06:02.419> while<00:06:02.630> some<00:06:02.900> people<00:06:03.110> can

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
game so and so while some people can

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.130 
game so and so while some people can
obviously<00:06:03.740> play<00:06:04.070> it<00:06:04.190> from<00:06:04.430> from<00:06:04.700> as<00:06:05.000> as<00:06:05.840> much

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
obviously play it from from as as much

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.840 
obviously play it from from as as much
of<00:06:06.260> a<00:06:06.320> bird's<00:06:06.530> eye<00:06:06.740> view<00:06:06.770> as<00:06:07.100> far<00:06:07.340> back<00:06:07.520> as<00:06:07.580> they

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
of a bird's eye view as far back as they

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.960 
of a bird's eye view as far back as they
want<00:06:08.030> you<00:06:08.150> can<00:06:08.300> also<00:06:08.330> zoom<00:06:08.570> right<00:06:09.470> in<00:06:09.710> right<00:06:10.340> in

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
want you can also zoom right in right in

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.500 
want you can also zoom right in right in
and<00:06:11.180> pick<00:06:11.780> out<00:06:11.840> almost<00:06:12.169> individual<00:06:12.800> people

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
and pick out almost individual people

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.400 
and pick out almost individual people
can<00:06:14.510> you<00:06:14.570> tell<00:06:14.720> us<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:14.840> bit<00:06:14.930> about<00:06:15.080> how<00:06:15.380> that

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
can you tell us a bit about how that

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.290 
can you tell us a bit about how that
works<00:06:15.770> yeah<00:06:16.190> so<00:06:16.430> well<00:06:16.850> because<00:06:16.970> of<00:06:17.120> its

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
works yeah so well because of its

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.880 
works yeah so well because of its
because<00:06:17.630> it's<00:06:17.780> glass<00:06:17.960> box<00:06:18.260> and<00:06:18.410> because<00:06:18.590> every

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
because it's glass box and because every

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.230 
because it's glass box and because every
sim<00:06:19.130> walking<00:06:19.460> around<00:06:19.580> is<00:06:19.760> actually<00:06:20.090> being

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
sim walking around is actually being

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.640 
sim walking around is actually being
simulator<00:06:20.720> every<00:06:20.990> car<00:06:21.200> you<00:06:21.410> can<00:06:21.530> actually

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
simulator every car you can actually

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.469 
simulator every car you can actually
zoom<00:06:21.800> in<00:06:22.100> really<00:06:22.250> close<00:06:22.370> and<00:06:22.610> you<00:06:22.820> can<00:06:22.850> follow

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
zoom in really close and you can follow

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.850 
zoom in really close and you can follow
each<00:06:23.660> of<00:06:23.990> them<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.290> sort<00:06:24.380> of<00:06:24.470> see<00:06:24.680> where

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
each of them and sort of see where

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.590 
each of them and sort of see where
they're<00:06:25.010> going<00:06:25.310> and<00:06:25.460> how<00:06:25.880> they<00:06:26.030> feel<00:06:26.270> and<00:06:26.300> what

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
they're going and how they feel and what

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.050

sim<00:06:59.260> that's<00:07:00.260> a<00:07:00.380> good<00:07:00.560> question<00:07:01.210> you<00:07:02.210> can<00:07:02.360> see

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540 
sim that's a good question you can see

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.270 
sim that's a good question you can see
if<00:07:02.660> they<00:07:02.810> want<00:07:03.050> a<00:07:03.110> job<00:07:03.410> so<00:07:03.710> you<00:07:03.740> could<00:07:03.860> build<00:07:04.130> a

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
if they want a job so you could build a

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.950 
if they want a job so you could build a
nice<00:07:04.460> job<00:07:04.790> there<00:07:04.820> a<00:07:05.120> nice<00:07:05.360> next<00:07:05.690> to<00:07:05.840> their

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
nice job there a nice next to their

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.270 
nice job there a nice next to their
house<00:07:06.200> and<00:07:06.590> then<00:07:06.710> you<00:07:06.800> could<00:07:06.950> make<00:07:07.100> everything

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
house and then you could make everything

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.370 
house and then you could make everything
so<00:07:07.700> that<00:07:07.820> it's<00:07:07.940> just<00:07:08.090> perfectly<00:07:08.479> tailored<00:07:08.720> for

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380 
so that it's just perfectly tailored for

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.140 
so that it's just perfectly tailored for
that<00:07:09.710> one<00:07:10.099> will<00:07:10.340> make<00:07:10.460> maybe<00:07:10.729> that<00:07:11.000> one

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
that one will make maybe that one

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.610 
that one will make maybe that one
household<00:07:11.690> we<00:07:11.930> might<00:07:12.080> make<00:07:12.169> it<00:07:12.229> a<00:07:12.349> bit<00:07:12.470> bigger

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
household we might make it a bit bigger

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.050 
household we might make it a bit bigger
maybe<00:07:12.919> the<00:07:13.039> house<00:07:13.250> is<00:07:13.460> the<00:07:13.550> way<00:07:13.640> look<00:07:13.760> I<00:07:13.880> mean<00:07:14.000> I

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
maybe the house is the way look I mean I

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.460 
maybe the house is the way look I mean I
think<00:07:14.090> one<00:07:14.510> thing<00:07:14.539> to<00:07:14.690> look<00:07:14.810> at<00:07:14.930> is<00:07:14.990> like<00:07:15.229> this

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
think one thing to look at is like this

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.230 
think one thing to look at is like this
is<00:07:15.650> sim<00:07:15.860> city

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
is sim city

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.670 
is sim city
not<00:07:16.419> the<00:07:16.599> sands<00:07:16.810> right<00:07:17.050> so<00:07:17.199> the<00:07:17.289> idea<00:07:17.410> is<00:07:17.620> you

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
not the sands right so the idea is you

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.170 
not the sands right so the idea is you
are<00:07:17.889> managing<00:07:18.340> the<00:07:18.550> city<00:07:18.789> you're<00:07:19.030> not

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
are managing the city you're not

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.120 
are managing the city you're not
managing<00:07:19.389> an<00:07:19.690> individual<00:07:20.169> sim<00:07:20.410> so<00:07:20.650> while<00:07:21.039> you

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
managing an individual sim so while you

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.469 
managing an individual sim so while you
can<00:07:21.310> follow<00:07:21.580> them<00:07:21.849> you<00:07:21.970> know<00:07:22.060> they're<00:07:22.210> still

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 
can follow them you know they're still

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.270 
can follow them you know they're still
just<00:07:22.509> sort<00:07:22.810> of<00:07:22.840> a<00:07:22.930> sim<00:07:23.169> in<00:07:23.440> the<00:07:23.470> in<00:07:23.830> this<00:07:24.039> bigger

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 
just sort of a sim in the in this bigger

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.520 
just sort of a sim in the in this bigger
picture<00:07:24.669> of<00:07:24.789> the<00:07:24.880> game<00:07:25.060> so<00:07:25.389> I'm<00:07:26.169> not<00:07:26.349> going<00:07:26.470> to
