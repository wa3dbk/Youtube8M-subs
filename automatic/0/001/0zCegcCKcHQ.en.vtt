00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.829
 San Francisco is a very big city 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.029
 and it's full of problems again so you have to get to them by car 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 that's where the idea comes into play the formula has changed slightly with 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.520
 Regarding the view in the last installment of the series 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.580
 now graiver is closer to me fox-pitt elegance missed or what is it 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.830
 same is more like the first two installments of the saga 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.150
 however, he still has a lot to offer attentive 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.780
 the story begins with the flight of a criminal aspiring terrorist named 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.870
 Jericho 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 this character had been captured by Tangier the protagonist of the story 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740
 trying to rehunt the fugitive again 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.560
 in that persecution he also leaves very badly wounded and somehow gets a 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.030
 superpower that allows you to occupy bodies of three people 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.750
 From that moment on, he followed the track from the Jericó magazine 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.810
 and incidentally throw a cable to those people of San Francisco who 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.850
 need as you think necessary 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.460
 load 2 50 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.710
 your choice 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 I have ideas said 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.880
 dammit 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.270
 the formula to see how we say 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.250
 go back to where everything started 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.460
 it is no longer possible to get our character out of the car with the idea of ​​stealing 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.560
 some other, much less get us shotgun with the police 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.700
 however the powers of tanner manage to break the monotony in which 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.790
 the first two games fell 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.380
 now having can change car at any time what not only 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.019
 allows to shorten distances effectively 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.319
 and access other vehicles quickly 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.319
 it also becomes a weapon for the fans 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.729
 throughout San Francisco Baez find missions of all kinds 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.629
 all will be arranged on a map that actually after tradition 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.089
 extracorporeal without any matters 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.269
 and you can injure them automatically without needing to arrive 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.669
 up to them by car 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.379
 As the games progress, they will allow a higher one to be moved to move over 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.519
 that map more comfortably 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.719
 Yellow missions are needed to unlock missions 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.079
 of history that a queretana in 5 does not 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.469
 the blue emissions in which they serve to earn money and unlock new 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.639
 that is to say the ones that you have to do if you want to complete the game 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.009
 one hundred by one hundred 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.159
 those of history contemplate everything that you have lived before in some other 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.749
 moment the typical street races 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.049
 leaks in which you have to explain to the police 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.349
 persecutions to which we must keep the distance so as not to be discovered 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.989
 destroy vehicles all that 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.859
 and the blues are asking for more specific things 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.859
 shred objects around the city saints reckless driving 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.379
 that kind of things 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.799
 The idea is that when winning a race you can destroy a vehicle 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.839
 enemy we not only have the classic turbo ideas ramming 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:39.969
 the cinnamon powers allow to enter the body of someone who comes in 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.829
 opposite direction and directly look for a head-on collision with 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.259
 our enemy 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.309
 that way a race can be won by getting many turbo improvements 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.869
 possibly looking for our competitors to be out of play 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:56.599
 something almost essential if the goal is for a father and a daughter to be first and 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.009
 second place of the race for example 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.479
 Thank you 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.209
 you are not doing very well in a row 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.659
 josé luis montes 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.659
 if anything 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.989
 that of course makes adding san francisco happened to be something more than a 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.609
 simple car game 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.609
 and that something makes us not want high demand in an entire adventure 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.849
 these sections 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.490
 unfortunately the story is too short 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.319
 it is clear that the game is made to travel the city in search of 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.410
 hidden objects get money buy extras and so on 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.800
 but if you are one of those who cut to the chase and you go to look for tedh to put 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.289
 end to the story you are going to find an excessively short game 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.580
 and we can be talking about five necessary game wounds 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.330
 the rest until the 25 that can be given one hundred percent is voluntary 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.939
 bush driving as always but Carmen mirror I see a very rare aunt 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.849
 I will take 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.349
 then I get it 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.490
 I'm inside a woman's body 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.580
 caught as soon as you finish the chicken took the batch 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.580
 you see that the graphic section works wonders 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.510
 does not reach the visual creed that we could find in bernal stop and for example 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.610
 but that also helps that visually is much less overwhelming 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.719
 and we can manage better by the city 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.099
 With the modifications 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.210
 this week 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.210
 smn 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.639
 if you are alone 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.729
 three special women 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.150
 in short I expected too severe and san francisco 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.659
 and I've taken a good surprise 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.069
 I finished the game and I really want to plug the console back in 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.099
 look for more side missions 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.900
 just missing a longer storyline otherwise I 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:46.899
 It has seemed hilarious and highly recommended 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.599
 he said he urged to pass 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.270
 shows 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.580
 but as you do not convince me one hundred percent that took the block
