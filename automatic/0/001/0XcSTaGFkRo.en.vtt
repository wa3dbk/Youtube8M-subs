00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
about it and I figured people would make

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.360 
about it and I figured people would make
fun<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.799> me<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.549> didn't<00:02:47.180> do<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.359> video

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
fun of me so I didn't do that video

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.890 
fun of me so I didn't do that video
actually<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.400> uploaded<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.359> I<00:02:50.450> deleted<00:02:50.840> it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
actually I uploaded it and I deleted it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.110 
actually I uploaded it and I deleted it
so<00:02:51.380> if<00:02:51.440> any<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.099> you<00:02:52.190> saw<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.639> that's<00:02:52.880> really
