00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.760 

the<00:00:00.179> idea<00:00:00.510> behind<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.079> aircraft<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.620> to

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
the idea behind this aircraft is to

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.880 
the idea behind this aircraft is to
design<00:00:02.310> it<00:00:02.460> around<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.820> user<00:00:03.030> experience<00:00:03.689> so<00:00:04.500> we

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
design it around a user experience so we

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.980 
design it around a user experience so we
had<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> chance<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.520> really<00:00:05.730> refine<00:00:06.270> everything

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
had a chance to really refine everything

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.930 
had a chance to really refine everything
from<00:00:07.259> bigger<00:00:07.500> surfaces<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.250> all<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.670> small

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
from bigger surfaces to all the small

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.360 
from bigger surfaces to all the small
details<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.570> your<00:00:10.260> daily<00:00:10.620> interaction<00:00:11.190> with

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
details that your daily interaction with

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.249 
details that your daily interaction with
the<00:00:11.490> aircraft<00:00:11.940> will<00:00:12.210> be<00:00:12.240> hopefully<00:00:13.139> very

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
the aircraft will be hopefully very

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.299 
the aircraft will be hopefully very
satisfying

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
satisfying

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.400 
satisfying
whether<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.849> grab<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.420> bow<00:00:15.570> handle<00:00:16.020> or<00:00:16.230> you

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
whether you grab the bow handle or you

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.620 
whether you grab the bow handle or you
open<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.770> canopy<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.369> let's<00:00:18.240> let's<00:00:18.570> start

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
open the canopy so let's let's start

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.300 
open the canopy so let's let's start
with<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.930> bow<00:00:19.050> handle<00:00:19.410> actually<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.070> one<00:00:20.220> of

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
with the bow handle actually it's one of

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.790 
with the bow handle actually it's one of
my<00:00:20.400> favorite<00:00:20.730> every<00:00:21.689> part<00:00:21.990> every<00:00:22.170> boat<00:00:22.529> that

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
my favorite every part every boat that

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.250 
my favorite every part every boat that
you<00:00:22.949> have<00:00:23.430> needs<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.269> bow<00:00:24.420> ring<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
you have needs the bow ring on it you

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.450 
you have needs the bow ring on it you
have<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.740> bow<00:00:25.949> ring<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
have to have a bow ring you have to a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.279 
have to have a bow ring you have to a
way<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:27.119> tie<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> rope<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.930> whether<00:00:28.140> you're

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
way to tie a rope to it whether you're

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.349 
way to tie a rope to it whether you're
gonna<00:00:28.410> winch<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.279> onto<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.730> trailer<00:00:30.210> or

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
gonna winch it up onto a trailer or

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
gonna winch it up onto a trailer or
whether<00:00:30.630> you're<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> tie<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.650> off<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
whether you're going to tie it off to a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.459 
whether you're going to tie it off to a
buoy<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.450> course<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.870> could<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.290> put

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
buoy so of course we could have just put

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.229 
buoy so of course we could have just put
a<00:00:34.500> simple<00:00:34.710> ring<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> front<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.000> that's

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a simple ring on the front of it that's

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.180 
a simple ring on the front of it that's
just<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.600> icon<00:00:36.960> style<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.890> saw<00:00:38.040> an

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
just not icon style we saw an

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.680 
just not icon style we saw an
opportunity<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.879> make<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> great<00:00:39.300> user

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
opportunity to make a great user

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.440 
opportunity to make a great user
interface<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.010> whether<00:00:41.730> you're<00:00:42.059> you're

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
interface and so whether you're you're

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.240 
interface and so whether you're you're
tying<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.980> simple

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
tying it down and it's just a simple

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
tying it down and it's just a simple
tie-down<00:00:44.640> point<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> ramp<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:46.050> your

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
tie-down point on the ramp or on your

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.110 
tie-down point on the ramp or on your
trailer<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.430> want<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
trailer or if you want to use it as a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
trailer or if you want to use it as a
handle<00:00:48.480> we've<00:00:49.289> mentioned<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.649> couple<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.010> times

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
handle we've mentioned a couple of times

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
handle we've mentioned a couple of times
now<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.789> its<00:00:51.329> shape<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.379> could

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
now but it's its shape so that it could

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.920 
now but it's its shape so that it could
be<00:00:52.649> either<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.250> those<00:00:53.550> functions<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.329> like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
be either of those functions and like

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.139 
be either of those functions and like
all<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> metal<00:00:56.160> parts<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> airplane

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
all of the metal parts on the airplane

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
all of the metal parts on the airplane
any<00:00:57.870> piece<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> metal<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.949> airplane

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
any piece of metal on this airplane

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.010 
any piece of metal on this airplane
there's<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.910> much<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.480> try<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> stick

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
there's not that much we try to stick

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.270 
there's not that much we try to stick
with<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> composites<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.100> don't

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
with the composites because they don't

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
with the composites because they don't
corrode<00:01:02.609> any<00:01:03.359> piece<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> metal<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
corrode any piece of metal on the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
corrode any piece of metal on the
airplane<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.519> either

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
airplane like this one is either

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.270 
airplane like this one is either
stainless<00:01:06.090> steel<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.530> aluminum<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
stainless steel or if it's aluminum and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
stainless steel or if it's aluminum and
it<00:01:08.549> needs<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:09.000> aluminum<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.570> some<00:01:09.720> reason

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
it needs to be aluminum for some reason

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.649 
it needs to be aluminum for some reason
it's<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.770> anodizing<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> protect<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's got anodizing on it to protect it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.990 
it's got anodizing on it to protect it
against<00:01:12.960> corrosion<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.650> we've<00:01:14.070> done<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.700> much

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
against corrosion so we've done as much

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.429 
against corrosion so we've done as much
as<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.420> possibly<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> prevent

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
as you can possibly do to prevent

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.109 
as you can possibly do to prevent
corrosion<00:01:16.710> without<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> stainless

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
corrosion without going to stainless

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
corrosion without going to stainless
everywhere<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> aircraft<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:20.430> actually

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
everywhere on the aircraft it's actually

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.310 
everywhere on the aircraft it's actually
kind<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> funny<00:01:21.210> when<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.570> first<00:01:21.810> started<00:01:22.170> out

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
kind of funny when we first started out

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
kind of funny when we first started out
saying<00:01:22.590> hey<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.670> bow<00:01:23.850> ring<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.390> had

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
saying hey this the bow ring that we had

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
saying hey this the bow ring that we had
before<00:01:24.720> was<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.259> creating<00:01:25.799> some<00:01:25.979> pain<00:01:26.220> in

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
before was really creating some pain in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160 
before was really creating some pain in
our<00:01:26.670> shop<00:01:27.210> guys<00:01:27.450> hands<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.049> they're

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
our shop guys hands because they're

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.740 
our shop guys hands because they're
moving<00:01:28.470> around<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> paint<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.549> plane<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.689> we

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
moving around to paint the plane so we

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.450 
moving around to paint the plane so we
put<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.079> big<00:01:31.350> ring<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> front<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.310> know

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
put this big ring on the front I know

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.899 
put this big ring on the front I know
it's<00:01:32.610> working<00:01:32.970> great<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> looks<00:01:33.840> so

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
it's working great but it looks so

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's working great but it looks so
horrible<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:37.229> made<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> small<00:01:37.770> small<00:01:38.100> small

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
horrible so we made it small small small

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.770 
horrible so we made it small small small
small<00:01:38.430> until<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.210> too<00:01:39.360> small<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
small until it was too small and a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.270 
small until it was too small and a
little<00:01:40.079> bit<00:01:40.170> bigger<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.799> looks<00:01:41.009> really

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
little bit bigger now it looks really

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.010 
little bit bigger now it looks really
well<00:01:41.460> integrated<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.270> doesn't<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:42.750> sound

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
well integrated it doesn't really sound

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.580 
well integrated it doesn't really sound
stand<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:45.030> big<00:01:45.869> device<00:01:46.200> but

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
stand out as you know a big device but

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
stand out as you know a big device but
it<00:01:46.710> works<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.100> well<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.670> later<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.840> can

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it works really well so later on you can

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
it works really well so later on you can
try<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:49.890> yourself<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.549> really

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
try it out for yourself you can really

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.700 
try it out for yourself you can really
pull<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.390> high<00:01:51.600> without<00:01:52.079> squeezing<00:01:52.409> your

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
pull up high without squeezing your

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.960 
pull up high without squeezing your
fingers<00:01:53.009> because<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.369> got<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.700> bit<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
fingers because it's got a little bit of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
fingers because it's got a little bit of
a<00:01:54.030> surface<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.630> pull<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.500> side<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
a surface here pull to the side and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.590 
a surface here pull to the side and
actually<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> best<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.479> when

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
actually what I like the best is when

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.030 
actually what I like the best is when
you<00:01:57.750> want<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> push<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> aircraft<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> can

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you want to push the aircraft you can

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.789 
you want to push the aircraft you can
grab<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.820> like<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:01.229> maneuver<00:02:01.680> it

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
grab it like this and really maneuver it

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.969 
grab it like this and really maneuver it
really<00:02:02.219> well<00:02:02.369> so

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
really well so

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.889 
really well so
yeah<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:04.789> those<00:02:04.909> trades<00:02:05.210> are<00:02:05.329> going<00:02:05.539> on<00:02:05.659> all

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
yeah so those trades are going on all

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.770 
yeah so those trades are going on all
the<00:02:06.020> time<00:02:06.460> we're<00:02:07.460> looking<00:02:07.729> at<00:02:07.880> function<00:02:08.569> Klaus

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the time we're looking at function Klaus

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.869 
the time we're looking at function Klaus
is<00:02:09.019> looking<00:02:09.229> at<00:02:09.349> economics<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.250> styling<00:02:10.700> and
