00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.049
 hi my dear viewers and subscribers 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.240
 channel with you workshop hindi kra 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.820
 today i want to show you how you can 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.190
 make cool little dandelions 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.140
 with your own hands out of paper 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.950
 Flowers can be fun to decorate 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.470
 postcard 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.170
 or any other their work and 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.560
 You can also use them separately in 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.439
 bouquets and other compositions and so for 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.199
 dandelions i will use 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.110
 bright yellow design paper 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:40.620
 and and green 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:44.320
 double sided tape glue scissors and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.979
 green floristic wire and so 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.580
 for starters, I cut the paper into strips 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:55.180
 one centimeter thick yellow paper 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.930
 made long stripes and from green 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.260
 such a small length of 5-6 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.159
 centimeters now i need to do 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:11.040
 fringe for this scissors somewhere up 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:15.220
 mid- stripes I make very small 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:21.330
 cuts are literally a millimeter half a floor 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.330
 millimeter and so on the entire length of the strip 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 now i need to glue green 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.310
 paper 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.030
 and then I continue to cut the stripes 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.840
 on green paper but do less often and 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 I cut out here such triangles 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:57.799
 then i just twist the strip 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:02:02.000
 you need to twist it as much as possible now 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.569
 when I got to the green part of the strip I 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.030
 I glue it and twist it further 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.049
 now it's better not to wait a little 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.849
 minutes to glue fully grabbed 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:19.510
 glue dried up now with scissors I 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.610
 I push the middle neatly and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.579
 neatly destroy 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.310
 I bend these pieces are cut and and here 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.500
 this way the bud is made 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.739
 dandelion 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.780
 in order to fix the bud and 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.319
 I will use the stalk 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.109
 glue moment 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.780
 well that's all my duvan checks they are ready 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.880
 such miniature are inconvenient 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.790
 decorate postcards and or some 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.310
 small compositions such duvan checks 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.250
 you can do less 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.040
 I increase the width of the strip and the width 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.389
 fringe so you can achieve 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.549
 large volumetric color 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.920
 for quite small for some 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.000
 small compositions I hope you 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.739
