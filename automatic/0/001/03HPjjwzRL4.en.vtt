00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
I did not enjoy this as much as I

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.920 
I did not enjoy this as much as I
thought<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.020> would<00:00:17.449> particularly<00:00:18.449> because<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
thought I would particularly because of

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.460 
thought I would particularly because of
the<00:00:18.990> first<00:00:19.230> two<00:00:19.410> issues<00:00:20.600> after<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.080> first<00:00:22.289> two

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the first two issues after the first two

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.820 
the first two issues after the first two
issues<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:23.160> okay<00:00:23.820> um<00:00:24.230> like<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> fights<00:00:25.619> are

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
issues it's okay um like the fights are

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.210 
issues it's okay um like the fights are
fun<00:00:25.949> everything<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.300> them<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:28.099> see<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
fun everything but I them I see the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.620 
fun everything but I them I see the
first<00:00:29.400> two<00:00:29.519> issues<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:29.939> trying<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> set<00:00:30.510> up

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
first two issues really trying to set up

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.200 
first two issues really trying to set up
this<00:00:30.779> whole<00:00:30.990> iron<00:00:31.650> man's<00:00:32.040> gone<00:00:32.309> rogue<00:00:32.700> thing

this whole iron man's gone rogue thing
and<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:34.260> think<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:35.130> really<00:00:35.399> clunky

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and I think it's really really clunky

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.560 
and I think it's really really clunky
and<00:00:35.820> doesn't<00:00:36.239> work<00:00:36.390> um<00:00:37.910> like<00:00:38.910> first<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:39.420> he

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and doesn't work um like first of all he

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.030 
and doesn't work um like first of all he
tries<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> sue<00:00:40.200> these<00:00:40.350> people<00:00:40.710> who<00:00:40.800> stole<00:00:41.010> his

tries to sue these people who stole his

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.299 
tries to sue these people who stole his

armor technology like like basically it

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.940 
armor technology like like basically it
the<00:00:44.700> whole<00:00:44.879> idea<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.210> tries<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> say<00:00:45.989> okay

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
well I knew dunno why it's because the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.499 
well I knew dunno why it's because the
majority<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> time<00:01:53.970> I've<00:01:54.149> seen<00:01:54.299> him<00:01:54.390> in

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
thing yeah just I I don't think it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.030 
thing yeah just I I don't think it
worked<00:02:38.460> um<00:02:39.410> because<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.560> didn't<00:02:40.800> feel<00:02:40.980> like

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
worked um because it didn't feel like

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.370 
worked um because it didn't feel like
that<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.700> felt<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.090> he<00:02:42.480> was<00:02:42.900> doing<00:02:43.020> normal

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
that just felt like he was doing normal

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.200 
that just felt like he was doing normal
Iron<00:02:43.710> Man<00:02:43.890> stuff<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.430> they<00:02:44.700> were<00:02:44.760> trying<00:02:44.970> to

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
Iron Man stuff and they were trying to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.060 
Iron Man stuff and they were trying to
hype<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.770> know<00:02:46.800> this

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
hype it up to be like you know this

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.880 
hype it up to be like you know this
really<00:02:47.460> really<00:02:47.610> edgy<00:02:48.120> kind<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.930> thing<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.350> I

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
really really edgy kind of a thing and I

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.250 
really really edgy kind of a thing and I
just<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.340> don't<00:02:50.580> think<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.000> works<00:02:51.600> like<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
just I don't think it works like that I

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.020 
just I don't think it works like that I
I<00:02:52.320> don't<00:02:52.770> think<00:02:53.040> it'd<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.190> wary<00:02:53.520> well<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.850> might

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
I don't think it'd be wary well it might

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.340 
I don't think it'd be wary well it might
work<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:54.600> they<00:02:54.720> didn't<00:02:54.959> play<00:02:55.170> like

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
work like that but they didn't play like

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.190 
work like that but they didn't play like
that<00:02:55.760> um<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.950> Captain<00:02:59.910> America<00:03:00.420> shows<00:03:00.600> up<00:03:00.840> but

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
that um and Captain America shows up but

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.020 
that um and Captain America shows up but
apparently<00:03:01.800> he<00:03:01.920> can't<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.400> Captain<00:03:02.700> America

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
apparently he can't be Captain America

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.290 
apparently he can't be Captain America
so<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:03.330> he's<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.990> captain<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:05.459> don't<00:03:06.120> know

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
so now he's the captain I I don't know

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.040
