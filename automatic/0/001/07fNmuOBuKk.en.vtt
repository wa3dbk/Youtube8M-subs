Dobbs why the struggles tonight compared

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.800 
Dobbs why the struggles tonight compared
to<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.310> last<00:02:58.400> couple<00:02:58.640> yang<00:02:58.850> was<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.420> lot<00:02:59.660> of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
to the last couple yang was it a lot of

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.030 
to the last couple yang was it a lot of
because<00:02:59.959> North<00:03:00.350> where's<00:03:00.560> up<00:03:00.680> there<00:03:00.860> there

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
because North where's up there there

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
because North where's up there there
wasn't<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.280> safety<00:03:01.640> valve<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:02.239> think<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.570> was<00:03:02.660> a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
wasn't a safety valve I think it was a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.800 
wasn't a safety valve I think it was a
combination<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.860> know<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.220> lot<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.430> things

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
combination you know of a lot of things

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.460 
combination you know of a lot of things
you<00:03:06.160> know<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.489> think<00:03:08.420> sometimes<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.260> know

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
you know I think sometimes you know

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.110 
you know I think sometimes you know
everything<00:03:09.920> points<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> quarterback<00:03:10.760> but

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
everything points to the quarterback but

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.490 
everything points to the quarterback but
I<00:03:11.180> think<00:03:11.450> some<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.810> routes<00:03:12.019> out<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.380> the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
I think some of the routes out on the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.470 
I think some of the routes out on the
perimeter<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:13.459> know<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.640> have<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.030> watch<00:03:14.209> the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
perimeter you know I have to watch the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.750 
perimeter you know I have to watch the
film<00:03:14.720> they're<00:03:14.900> really<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.830> know<00:03:15.950> comment

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
film they're really you know comment

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.490 
film they're really you know comment
further<00:03:16.970> on<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.299> but<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.170> know<00:03:18.200> there's<00:03:18.440> a

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
further on that but you know there's a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.870 
further on that but you know there's a
couple<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:18.890> times<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.310> didn't<00:03:19.549> think<00:03:19.640> we're

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
couple of times I didn't think we're

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.060 
couple of times I didn't think we're
real<00:03:20.120> crisp<00:03:20.420> on<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.750> perimeter<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.230> it's<00:03:21.920> a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
real crisp on the perimeter and it's a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.100 
real crisp on the perimeter and it's a
combination<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.790> all<00:03:22.940> 11<00:03:23.420> people<00:03:23.750> working

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
combination of all 11 people working

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.170 
combination of all 11 people working

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
point is you can't get that one yard

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.399 
point is you can't get that one yard
kind<00:03:52.549> of<00:03:52.640> maybe<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.180> statement<00:03:53.720> sure<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.290> know

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
it's a situation where its third and one

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.420 
it's a situation where its third and one
you<00:03:57.260> know<00:03:57.379> you<00:03:57.440> have<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.709> be<00:03:57.920> able<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.190> come<00:03:58.400> up

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
you know you have to be able to come up

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.949 
you know you have to be able to come up
and<00:03:58.790> that's<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.180> know<00:03:59.209> we<00:03:59.420> always<00:03:59.540> talk<00:03:59.930> about

there's four to six plays in a game that

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.789 
there's four to six plays in a game that
could<00:04:02.329> be<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.599> difference<00:04:02.629> you<00:04:03.620> know<00:04:03.680> between

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
could be the difference you know between

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.160 
could be the difference you know between
winning<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.579> losing<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.450> obviously

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
winning and losing and and obviously

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.809 
winning and losing and and obviously
that<00:04:06.290> was<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.650> critical<00:04:06.980> play<00:04:07.430> at<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.610> critical

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
that was a critical play at a critical

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.589 
that was a critical play at a critical
stage<00:04:08.030> in<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.540> game<00:04:09.849> coach<00:04:10.849> as<00:04:11.090> much<00:04:11.329> as<00:04:11.480> you

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
stage in the game coach as much as you

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.330 
stage in the game coach as much as you
heard<00:04:11.750> right<00:04:12.079> now<00:04:12.290> could<00:04:12.680> this<00:04:12.799> still<00:04:13.160> be

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
heard right now could this still be

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.270 
on the turnovers you know that our
defense<00:04:56.750> was<00:04:56.870> able<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.289> generate<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.979> thought

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
defense was able to generate I thought

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.210 
defense was able to generate I thought
that<00:04:58.520> was<00:04:58.700> key<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.510> know<00:04:59.630> one<00:04:59.810> of<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.960> key<00:05:00.229> you

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
thought we ran around we made some

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.860 
thought we ran around we made some
critical<00:05:09.860> plays<00:05:10.099> and<00:05:10.370> we<00:05:10.490> needed<00:05:10.699> to<00:05:10.820> just<00:05:11.240> you
