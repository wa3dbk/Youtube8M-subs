talking<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.200> Harley<00:01:25.560> service<00:01:26.220> department

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
talking to the Harley service department

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.580 
talking to the Harley service department
and<00:01:27.590> they<00:01:28.590> said<00:01:28.619> oh<00:01:29.689> they<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.960> rattled<00:01:31.409> like

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and they said oh they just rattled like

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.070 
and they said oh they just rattled like
that<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.450> don't<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.600> so

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
that I don't think so

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.219 
that I don't think so
I<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:35.009> Harley<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.640> needs<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> step<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I think Harley there needs to step up to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.899 
I think Harley there needs to step up to
the<00:01:37.259> plate<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.520> bit<00:01:38.729> better

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the plate and do a little bit better

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.200 
the plate and do a little bit better
milling<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.659> something<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.789> these<00:01:41.789> parts

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
milling or something because these parts

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.120 
milling or something because these parts
are<00:01:42.390> basically<00:01:43.080> going<00:01:43.320> back<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.830> they're<00:01:43.979> out

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
are basically going back and they're out

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.289 
are basically going back and they're out
another<00:01:44.460> $800

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
another $800

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
another $800
it's<00:01:48.299> actually<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> bunch<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.500> crap<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.979> pay

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it's actually a bunch of crap you pay

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.930 
it's actually a bunch of crap you pay
for<00:01:50.220> something<00:01:50.580> american-made<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:52.940> think

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
for something american-made and I think

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.430 
for something american-made and I think
they<00:01:54.090> ought<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:55.050> better<00:01:55.259> on

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
they ought to do a little bit better on

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.789 
they ought to do a little bit better on
their<00:01:56.600> machining<00:01:57.600> department<00:01:58.110> or<00:01:58.229> something

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
their machining department or something

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.259 
their machining department or something
this<00:01:59.069> is<00:01:59.280> unacceptable<00:02:00.259> Thanks
