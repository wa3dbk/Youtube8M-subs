 August 2012 with the aim of creating 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.490

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.539
 it seeks to meet the demand for hives 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.600
 of beekeepers increased production of 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.070
 nectar and pollen through the basal method 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.559

 Marshall indicated that this project is a 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.660
 longing to have a 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.690
 condition of quality genetics in a 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.790
 that is natural and tropicalized stressed 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.860
 it also has the purpose of renewing 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.470
 a new class of poultry farmers among the

 institution with the Tabasco countryside has 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.380
 been a link to rescue a

 bee tradition that has existed in the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.490
 concrete needle entity that will be at 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.770
 pending to identify the potential 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.930
 to develop in science and technology 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.520
 from the sector to the labor projector 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.220

 interest in beekeeping Carlos Alberto 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.149
 Gutiérrez Cortez said he will present the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.830
 project to be analyzed in the 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.170
 windows of the central offices 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.690
 with investment value at 3.5 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.100
 million pesos the presentation of the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.259
 project was the responsibility of the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.330
 researchers ernesto tanús sanchez and 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.550

 ignacio lastra marín 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.320
 to specify that the challenge of 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.900
 project is to adapt it to conditions 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.580
 humid tropics as it is more prone to 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.070
 manifestations of pests and diseases 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.130
 and therefore difficult to diagnose and 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.810
 predict weather conditions 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.670
 He said the state government 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.120
