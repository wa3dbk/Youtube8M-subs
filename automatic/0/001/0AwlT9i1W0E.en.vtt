00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
now and part of the reason for these is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.700 
now and part of the reason for these is
one<00:02:05.120> he's<00:02:05.630> got<00:02:05.780> these<00:02:05.930> kind<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.260> dinky<00:02:06.470> little

release<00:02:09.979> they<00:02:10.429> work<00:02:10.580> just<00:02:10.610> fine<00:02:11.000> they<00:02:11.209> support

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
release they work just fine they support

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.240 
release they work just fine they support
him<00:02:11.720> but<00:02:12.260> they<00:02:12.440> are<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.620> little<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> small

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
him but they are a little on the small

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.790 
him but they are a little on the small
side<00:02:13.280> also<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:14.690> ever<00:02:14.720> got<00:02:15.110> Orion<00:02:15.710> and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
side also if you ever got Orion and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.410 
side also if you ever got Orion and
hegemon<00:02:16.220> next<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.550> each<00:02:16.640> other

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
hegemon next to each other

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.580 
hegemon next to each other
you'll<00:02:17.510> see<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.720> Megatron's<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.290> little

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
you'll see that Megatron's a little

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.360 
you'll see that Megatron's a little
shorter<00:02:18.950> than<00:02:19.150> Optimus<00:02:20.150> here<00:02:20.709> which<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:22.280> I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
shorter than Optimus here which and I

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.460 
shorter than Optimus here which and I
and<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.640> don't<00:02:22.700> think<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:24.020> should<00:02:24.200> be<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
and I don't think that should be the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.260 
and I don't think that should be the
case<00:02:24.650> really<00:02:25.190> I'm<00:02:25.430> okay<00:02:25.670> with<00:02:25.819> like<00:02:26.030> Optimus

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
case really I'm okay with like Optimus

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.640 
case really I'm okay with like Optimus
being<00:02:26.569> shorter<00:02:26.870> than<00:02:26.989> Megatron<00:02:27.380> like<00:02:27.530> it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
being shorter than Megatron like it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.449 
being shorter than Megatron like it
happened<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.069> animated<00:02:28.430> but<00:02:30.310> like<00:02:31.310> you

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
happened in the animated but like you

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.890 
happened in the animated but like you
know<00:02:31.550> these<00:02:31.790> guys<00:02:32.120> look<00:02:32.450> good<00:02:32.660> together

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
know these guys look good together

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.670 
know these guys look good together
aesthetically<00:02:33.709> but<00:02:35.350> there's<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> height

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
aesthetically but there's the height

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.180 
aesthetically but there's the height
difference<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.650> feet<00:02:39.860> are<00:02:39.890> meant<00:02:40.100> to

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
difference and the feet are meant to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.830 
difference and the feet are meant to
address<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.640> now<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.150> swap<00:02:41.390> out<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.660> heads

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
address that now to swap out the heads

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.300 
address that now to swap out the heads
it's<00:02:42.020> very<00:02:42.200> simple<00:02:42.530> I'm<00:02:42.590> gonna<00:02:42.800> put<00:02:42.980> this<00:02:43.100> head

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
it's very simple I'm gonna put this head

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.590 
it's very simple I'm gonna put this head
on<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.730> show<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.940> what<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.120> looks<00:02:44.269> like

the<00:02:51.140> two<00:02:51.290> halves<00:02:51.470> apart<00:02:51.830> make<00:02:52.040> sure<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.250> don't

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
the two halves apart make sure you don't

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.920 
the two halves apart make sure you don't
lose<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.640> screw<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.239> very<00:02:53.420> easy<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.720> fall

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
lose that screw it is very easy to fall

got<00:03:03.739> autofocus<00:03:04.250> on<00:03:09.040> there<00:03:10.040> we<00:03:10.130> go<00:03:10.540> swap<00:03:11.540> around

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
got autofocus on there we go swap around

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.420 
got autofocus on there we go swap around
so<00:03:11.900> much<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:12.830> just<00:03:13.010> put<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.280> two

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
so much and then you just put the two

so much and then you just put the two
heads<00:03:13.640> together<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:15.500> screw<00:03:16.069> it<00:03:16.190> back<00:03:16.340> on

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.300 

and<00:03:24.909> there<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.209> go<00:03:25.540> now<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.099> fire<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.219> her

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
and there you go now the fire of her

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.729 
and there you go now the fire of her
head<00:03:27.549> I<00:03:27.730> find<00:03:28.060> fits<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.989> little<00:03:29.140> looser<00:03:29.560> than

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
head I find fits a little looser than

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.160 
head I find fits a little looser than
the<00:03:30.549> original<00:03:30.969> head<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.420> came<00:03:31.599> stock<00:03:31.959> on

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
the original head that came stock on

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.800 
the original head that came stock on
hegemon<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.250> may<00:03:33.700> go<00:03:33.849> I'll<00:03:34.180> probably<00:03:34.450> stick

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
hegemon I may go I'll probably stick

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.640 
hegemon I may go I'll probably stick
with<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.049> stock<00:03:35.290> head<00:03:37.200> but<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.290> does<00:03:38.439> it<00:03:38.620> does

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
with the stock head but it does it does

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.319 
with the stock head but it does it does
give<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.129> couple<00:03:39.489> options<00:03:39.609> in<00:03:39.970> facial

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
give you a couple options in facial

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.990 
give you a couple options in facial
expression<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.640> wouldn't<00:03:42.909> have

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
expression that you wouldn't have

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.319 
expression that you wouldn't have
otherwise<00:03:43.090> had<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:45.069> if<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.609> foot<00:03:45.819> extensions

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
otherwise had and if the foot extensions

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.619 
otherwise had and if the foot extensions
are<00:03:46.450> actually<00:03:48.299> cooler<00:03:49.299> than<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.540> originally

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
are actually cooler than I originally

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.030 
are actually cooler than I originally
thought<00:03:49.930> when<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.290> originally<00:03:50.409> saw<00:03:50.769> these<00:03:50.950> I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
thought when I originally saw these I

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.920 
thought when I originally saw these I
thought<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.340> were<00:03:51.400> gonna<00:03:51.549> have<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.760> pop<00:03:52.090> to

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
thought you were gonna have to pop to

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.569 
thought you were gonna have to pop to
pop<00:03:52.959> these<00:03:53.439> feet<00:03:53.680> off<00:03:53.829> at<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.099> ball<00:03:54.280> joint

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
pop these feet off at the ball joint

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.520 
pop these feet off at the ball joint
here<00:03:54.879> and<00:03:54.909> snap<00:03:55.299> these<00:03:55.480> on<00:03:55.689> and<00:03:55.930> that's<00:03:56.379> not

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
here and snap these on and that's not

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.080 
here and snap these on and that's not
the<00:03:56.709> case<00:03:56.889> at<00:03:57.069> all<00:03:57.189> the<00:03:57.400> way<00:03:57.519> these<00:03:57.700> work<00:03:57.970> is

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
the case at all the way these work is

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.550 
the case at all the way these work is
you<00:03:58.150> just<00:03:58.389> take<00:03:58.599> basically<00:03:58.989> take<00:03:59.230> his<00:03:59.349> foot

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
you just take basically take his foot

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.449 
you just take basically take his foot
without<00:04:00.310> any<00:04:01.470> modification<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:02.950> you

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
without any modification to it and you

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.949 
without any modification to it and you
just<00:04:03.639> slide<00:04:03.909> it<00:04:04.120> right<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.419> through<00:04:04.599> here<00:04:04.629> and

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
just slide it right in through here and

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.990 
just slide it right in through here and
then<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.799> little<00:04:06.010> post<00:04:06.400> right<00:04:06.609> here<00:04:06.639> pegs

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
then this little post right here pegs

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.879 
then this little post right here pegs
into<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.269> bottom<00:04:07.480> of<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.569> foot<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.500> kind<00:04:08.829> of

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
into the bottom of the foot and kind of

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.649 
into the bottom of the foot and kind of
see<00:04:08.980> how<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.159> locks<00:04:09.400> in<00:04:09.609> and<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:10.269> just<00:04:10.299> locks

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
see how that locks in and it just locks

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.179 
see how that locks in and it just locks
right<00:04:10.810> on<00:04:10.989> it's<00:04:11.169> that<00:04:11.349> simple<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.829> don't<00:04:11.980> have

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
right on it's that simple you don't have

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.369 
right on it's that simple you don't have
to<00:04:12.310> transform<00:04:12.790> Megatron<00:04:13.329> you<00:04:13.989> don't<00:04:14.169> have<00:04:14.260> to

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
to transform Megatron you don't have to

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.659 
to transform Megatron you don't have to
remove<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.889> feet

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
remove the feet

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.699 
remove the feet
he's<00:04:16.209> non<00:04:16.449> transformable<00:04:17.139> with<00:04:17.289> these<00:04:17.440> feet

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
he's non transformable with these feet

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.020 
he's non transformable with these feet
on<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.099> again<00:04:18.340> since<00:04:18.519> they<00:04:18.639> just<00:04:18.820> pop<00:04:19.000> right

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
on but again since they just pop right

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.719 
on but again since they just pop right
on<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:19.539> off<00:04:19.660> it's<00:04:20.590> much<00:04:21.280> less<00:04:21.519> of<00:04:21.639> an

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
on and off it's much less of an

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.100 
on and off it's much less of an
inconvenience<00:04:22.210> than<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.449> expected

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
inconvenience than I expected

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.279 
inconvenience than I expected
Shea<00:04:24.009> just<00:04:24.190> pop<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.490> one<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:24.900> pop<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.139> one

Shea just pop this one on pop that one
on<00:04:27.570> just<00:04:28.570> like<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:29.169> then<00:04:29.650> when<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.830> have

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
on just like that and then when you have

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.750 
on just like that and then when you have
him<00:04:30.070> stand<00:04:30.310> up<00:04:31.440> now<00:04:32.440> he<00:04:32.500> is<00:04:32.889> more<00:04:33.220> of<00:04:33.460> an<00:04:33.580> eagle

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
him stand up now he is more of an eagle

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.360 
him stand up now he is more of an eagle
equal<00:04:34.599> height<00:04:34.750> with<00:04:35.650> Orion<00:04:38.099> there's<00:04:39.099> still

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
equal height with Orion there's still

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.230 
equal height with Orion there's still
you<00:04:39.400> know<00:04:39.639> there's<00:04:39.820> still<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> few

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
you know there's still a few

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.649 
you know there's still a few
inconsistencies<00:04:40.810> like<00:04:41.340> Ryan<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:42.490> still<00:04:42.760> front

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
inconsistencies like Ryan is still front

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.490 
inconsistencies like Ryan is still front
to<00:04:43.840> back<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.289> overall<00:04:44.770> generally<00:04:45.280> bulkier

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
to back and overall generally bulkier

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.540 
to back and overall generally bulkier
but<00:04:49.139> but<00:04:50.139> they<00:04:50.590> look<00:04:50.860> much<00:04:51.070> better<00:04:51.280> together

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
but but they look much better together

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.580 
but but they look much better together
on<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.849> shelf<00:04:52.180> when<00:04:52.360> next<00:04:52.539> to<00:04:52.720> each<00:04:52.810> other<00:04:52.960> they

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
on a shelf when next to each other they

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.860 
on a shelf when next to each other they
there<00:04:54.130> have<00:04:54.250> even<00:04:54.550> height<00:04:54.669> and<00:04:55.090> they<00:04:55.630> look<00:04:55.810> a

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
there have even height and they look a

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.159 
there have even height and they look a
lot<00:04:56.020> cooler<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.940> just<00:04:58.300> kind<00:04:58.479> of<00:04:58.539> like<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.050> said

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
lot cooler it just kind of like I said

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.779 
lot cooler it just kind of like I said
Megatron<00:04:59.560> gets<00:04:59.590> more<00:04:59.919> fully<00:05:00.159> formed<00:05:00.490> feet

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
Megatron gets more fully formed feet

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.950 
Megatron gets more fully formed feet
maybe<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:01.840> little<00:05:02.289> on<00:05:02.409> the<00:05:02.500> large<00:05:02.740> size<00:05:03.070> but

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
maybe a little on the large size but

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.540 
maybe a little on the large size but
less<00:05:04.960> on<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.260> large<00:05:05.500> side<00:05:05.800> then<00:05:06.099> I<00:05:06.190> think<00:05:06.400> his

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
less on the large side then I think his

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.300 
less on the large side then I think his
previous<00:05:06.970> feet<00:05:07.150> were<00:05:07.270> on<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.510> small<00:05:07.780> side<00:05:08.310> and

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
previous feet were on the small side and

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.500 
previous feet were on the small side and
he<00:05:09.400> just<00:05:09.550> kind<00:05:09.699> of<00:05:09.729> helps<00:05:09.940> his<00:05:10.030> legs<00:05:10.270> look<00:05:10.479> a

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
he just kind of helps his legs look a

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.469 
he just kind of helps his legs look a
little<00:05:10.659> bit<00:05:10.810> more<00:05:11.400> more<00:05:12.400> menacing<00:05:12.610> more<00:05:13.120> more

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
little bit more more menacing more more

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.330 
little bit more more menacing more more
powerful<00:05:14.050> just<00:05:14.650> because<00:05:14.889> he<00:05:14.979> doesn't<00:05:15.130> have

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
powerful just because he doesn't have

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.499 
powerful just because he doesn't have
those<00:05:15.460> flat<00:05:15.789> little<00:05:15.940> feet<00:05:16.210> anymore<00:05:18.389> so<00:05:19.389> yeah

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
those flat little feet anymore so yeah

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.420 
those flat little feet anymore so yeah
that's<00:05:20.380> that's<00:05:20.500> really<00:05:20.800> all<00:05:20.919> there<00:05:21.070> is<00:05:21.099> to<00:05:21.310> it

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
that's that's really all there is to it

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.909 
that's that's really all there is to it
different<00:05:21.820> heads<00:05:21.970> different<00:05:22.750> feet<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.199> lets

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
different heads different feet and lets

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.409 
different heads different feet and lets
them<00:05:24.009> stand<00:05:24.340> on<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.550> scale<00:05:24.669> with<00:05:24.970> Orion

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
them stand on the scale with Orion

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.210 
them stand on the scale with Orion
I've<00:05:25.960> actually<00:05:26.409> do<00:05:26.500> have<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.740> render<00:05:27.009> form

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
I've actually do have the render form

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.990 
I've actually do have the render form
head<00:05:27.599> on<00:05:28.599> here<00:05:28.900> right<00:05:29.080> now<00:05:29.259> on<00:05:29.979> a<00:05:30.039> Ryan<00:05:30.340> so<00:05:30.970> I

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
head on here right now on a Ryan so I

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.980 
head on here right now on a Ryan so I
guess<00:05:31.300> it<00:05:31.389> makes<00:05:31.479> sense<00:05:31.659> they've<00:05:31.840> got

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
guess it makes sense they've got

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.290 
guess it makes sense they've got
third-party<00:05:32.529> add-ons<00:05:32.830> on<00:05:33.029> hegemon<00:05:34.029> as<00:05:34.150> well

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
third-party add-ons on hegemon as well

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.370 
third-party add-ons on hegemon as well
but<00:05:35.200> yeah<00:05:35.950> they<00:05:36.130> look<00:05:36.250> really<00:05:36.490> nice<00:05:36.610> together

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
but yeah they look really nice together

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.670 
but yeah they look really nice together
and<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.860> was<00:05:38.010> really<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:39.140> extent<00:05:40.140> of<00:05:40.350> the

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
and that was really the extent of the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.330 
and that was really the extent of the
kids<00:05:40.860> purpose<00:05:41.220> so<00:05:42.050> job<00:05:43.050> mission<00:05:43.890> accomplished

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
kids purpose so job mission accomplished

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.180 
kids purpose so job mission accomplished
I<00:05:44.460> guess<00:05:44.610> that<00:05:44.730> we're<00:05:44.880> going<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.060> say<00:05:46.190> yeah

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
I guess that we're going to say yeah
