does not show his feet though he's got

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.510 
does not show his feet though he's got
like<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> big<00:00:30.439> drape<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.710> something<00:00:32.099> over<00:00:32.340> him

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so I mean does not show anything there's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.620 
so I mean does not show anything there's
a<00:00:34.950> part<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.790> back<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.210> looks<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:36.480> he

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
a part in the back that looks like he

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.139 
a part in the back that looks like he
can<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.870> his<00:00:36.930> tail<00:00:37.170> covered<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.149> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
can have his tail covered up so you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.260 
can have his tail covered up so you
don't<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> also<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.770> eyes<00:00:41.270> you

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
don't know that and also the eyes you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.940 
don't know that and also the eyes you
could<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> eyes<00:00:42.960> look<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
could think the eyes look like a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.479 
could think the eyes look like a
snake-like<00:00:44.730> pythor's<00:00:45.539> eyes<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.320> there

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
snake-like pythor's eyes right there

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.190 
snake-like pythor's eyes right there
Python<00:00:47.489> Python<00:00:47.670> eyes<00:00:48.149> are<00:00:48.450> pink<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
Python Python eyes are pink and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.450 
Python Python eyes are pink and
oval-shaped

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
oval-shaped

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.200 
oval-shaped
this<00:00:51.300> mysterious<00:00:51.930> stranger<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:53.579> pointed

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
this mysterious stranger is more pointed

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.549 
this mysterious stranger is more pointed
in<00:00:54.390> red<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> mean<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.699> don't<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.170> pythor

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
in red so I mean I don't know and pythor

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.760 
in red so I mean I don't know and pythor
also<00:00:58.949> has<00:00:59.070> his<00:00:59.219> long<00:00:59.609> neck<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> mean<00:01:01.440> maybe

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
also has his long neck so I mean maybe

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.270 
also has his long neck so I mean maybe
that<00:01:02.010> could<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.399> curve<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> hood<00:01:04.280> but

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that could like curve up in the hood but

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.149 
that could like curve up in the hood but
I<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:06.600> pythor<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.530> returning<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I think pythor will be returning in

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
I think pythor will be returning in
episode<00:01:08.520> 30<00:01:08.880> when<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> said<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> ninja<00:01:10.290> will

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
episode 30 when it said the ninja will

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
episode 30 when it said the ninja will
be<00:01:10.530> running<00:01:10.770> into<00:01:12.200> an<00:01:13.200> enemy<00:01:14.010> underground<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
be running into an enemy underground and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.929 
be running into an enemy underground and
the<00:01:15.479> enemy<00:01:15.780> assists<00:01:16.290> them<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.710> don't<00:01:17.580> know<00:01:17.729> why

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the enemy assists them I don't know why

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.270 
the enemy assists them I don't know why
he<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.210> assist<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.380> Hythe<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.159> is

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
he would assist them but at Hythe or is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.740 
he would assist them but at Hythe or is
the<00:01:20.400> only<00:01:20.549> enemy<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.090> would<00:01:21.299> think<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the only enemy that I would think of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
the only enemy that I would think of
because<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:23.040> never<00:01:23.220> knew<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:23.520> happened<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because we never knew what happened to

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
because we never knew what happened to
him<00:01:24.030> after<00:01:24.590> he<00:01:25.590> got<00:01:26.009> devoured<00:01:26.640> by<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> great

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
him after he got devoured by the great

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.440 
him after he got devoured by the great
devourer<00:01:27.450> supposedly<00:01:28.640> we<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.790> Sensei<00:01:30.240> came

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
devourer supposedly we know Sensei came

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.940 
devourer supposedly we know Sensei came
out<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.780> great<00:01:30.960> devourer<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.770> about

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
out of the great devourer but what about

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.830 
out of the great devourer but what about
pythor<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:34.070> mean<00:01:35.070> maybe<00:01:35.610> maybe<00:01:36.360> pythor

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
pythor so I mean maybe maybe pythor

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.899 
pythor so I mean maybe maybe pythor
ain't<00:01:36.990> coming<00:01:37.229> back<00:01:37.259> at<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:38.579> don't<00:01:38.759> know

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
ain't coming back at all we don't know

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.999 
ain't coming back at all we don't know
but<00:01:39.240> pythor<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> big<00:01:40.409> thought<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.390> but<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
but pythor is the big thought here but I

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.560 
but pythor is the big thought here but I
think<00:01:44.009> he'll<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.280> coming<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.700> at<00:01:44.880> episode<00:01:45.299> 30

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
think he'll be coming back at episode 30

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.980 
think he'll be coming back at episode 30
but<00:01:46.409> very<00:01:47.399> slight<00:01:47.759> chance<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> he<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.720> be

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
but very slight chance that he could be

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.370 
but very slight chance that he could be
the<00:01:49.799> mysterious<00:01:50.340> stranger<00:01:50.549> though<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.540> mean

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the mysterious stranger though so I mean

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219 
the mysterious stranger though so I mean
I<00:01:52.470> could<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.860> him<00:01:53.040> easily<00:01:53.579> plotting<00:01:54.329> finding

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
I could see him easily plotting finding

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.709 
I could see him easily plotting finding
his<00:01:55.350> ways<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> plot<00:01:55.950> against<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.399> ninja<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
his ways to plot against the ninja so

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.080 
his ways to plot against the ninja so
then<00:01:57.930> he<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.619> start<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.159> win<00:01:59.399> again<00:01:59.729> get

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
then he can like start to win again get

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.370 
then he can like start to win again get
like<00:02:00.799> on<00:02:01.799> part<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.460> ruling<00:02:02.909> or<00:02:03.030> something<00:02:03.450> but

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
like on part of ruling or something but

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.160 
like on part of ruling or something but
I<00:02:04.649> could<00:02:04.979> see<00:02:05.159> pythor<00:02:05.579> doing<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.329> we

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
I could see pythor doing that but we

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
I could see pythor doing that but we
really<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.799> know<00:02:08.009> yet<00:02:08.220> until<00:02:08.550> we<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
really don't know yet until we see it so

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.450 
really don't know yet until we see it so
do<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.440> think<00:02:10.770> pythor<00:02:11.160> will<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.580> returning

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460
