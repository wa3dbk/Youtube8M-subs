00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 welcome to my fifa 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.690
 15 career video 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.760
 No that's not much of the 15th and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.010
 it should just go here just for that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.170
 that I am for the fifa 15km mode 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.880
 wish and what you maybe too 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.770
 for the fifa 15 career mode wishes 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.240
 if you like it like to load one 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.930
 Thumbs up there would be me very much 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 looking forward 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.390
 and yes we start right in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.670
 first case first with the club 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.859
 I've been looking for out here 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.279
 I have in the livestream times so for me 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.130
 discovered and I find the psv a very 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 young and very good team is and 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.070
 that you are very very good actually 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.350
 also for such a nice career 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.809
 could use and there you are as 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.020
 first asked what is your dream team 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.629
 with her at fifa 15's career 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.789
 but I also want to start some mode 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.739
 you want team for fifa 15 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 See career mode in a let's play 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.920
 on our channel that would open me up 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.079
 every case is very interesting 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.239
 it still like the comments paint what 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.590
 you defend and justify your dream teams 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.480
 That's just why you want one 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.460
 So not only do certain clubs play 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.229
 because maybe your favorite club 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.030
 but maybe because he is 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.530
 a certain one in a certain way 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.520
 maybe also interesting for you 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.200
 writes that just like the times 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.040
 comments I would like that one 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.770
 bit 'even now perhaps than yes 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 Use as survey to see which one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.920
 I finally join the fifa 15 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.560
 take career mode maybe I'll take 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 also several i thought psv would be 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 it's very interesting if mine 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.680
 The young team has the reason 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.420
 can build on and very strong 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 can develop and there I think there 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 You can play several varieties seasonally 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.170
 the league is not all of them 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.729
 strongest and biggest but I think so 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.350
 You can do that very well next to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.970
 jump board for his team and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.000
 build it up there and then send 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.909
 at some point the games go elsewhere only 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.350
 that would be very interesting if 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.850
 one then another club investigated 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.049
 and then he says, since I have the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.790
 one or two good players 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.130
 I then set up the hole now 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.950
 I also want my club to another 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.530
 I'll talk about that for me 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.630
 fifa 15 career mode i wish 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.660
 I wish for the career mode that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.390
 So you can finally do some training 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.650
 do not train his dexterity 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.010
 but that the players are specific 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.140
 Training goals do not have one, the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.819
 player who has no good potential 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.130
 can not grow but you say 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.480
 Young try to work on that and that 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.280
 then you will become a good player 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.190
 you actually made a right one 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.590
 make group a world star 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.620
 even if he is not so to speak 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.180
 a supertalent is so that one 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 still from some such hans 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.320
 and French let's say the total you 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.319
 After a few years of good training 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.540
 then somehow something like yes 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.040
 thomas mÃ¼ller rauskriegt or something like that 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.870
 For example, we are very happy for myself 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.330
 interesting and for that you would need 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.709
 Career mode a good environment that one 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.230
 the environment can handle the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.540
 training places that you can improve 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.500
 can that you can revalue that 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.989
 you also different employees 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.060
 can hire coach for goalkeeper for 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.010
 for the field players that one 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.380
 design training plans and so on 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.239
 I would be very happy if that was one 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.100
 purely came around with here and you so 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.570
 the team can build and also 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.610
 can specifically train on certain 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.590
 skills eg and has a very 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.989
 young fast team but that's missing 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.670
 it somehow still so combinatorics 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.130
 Matching to standards, etc 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.900
 stop experience that you instead of just 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.500
 do you run a lot and then you should 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.150
 real quick 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.709
 no, that you can say directly 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.720
 Okay we can work on the standards 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.040
 for example or at the match and 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.590
 so on that the crew then 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.140
 then trained particularly strong 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.519
 that would be one of my wishes that me 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.390
 you guys here in this video first 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.060
 would like to present 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.010
 and there you too are asked now 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.780
 I like your wishes and your ideas 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.090
 for the career mode in the comments 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.489
 there and then it should be the first time 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.290
 been for this video and in 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.450
 I will then open another video 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.040
