total game time for a 70 round game

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.840 
total game time for a 70 round game
would<00:04:27.620> be<00:04:27.650> at<00:04:28.070> least<00:04:28.580> 18<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.690> 20<00:04:30.020> hours<00:04:30.580> but<00:04:31.580> if

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
would be at least 18 to 20 hours but if

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.120 
would be at least 18 to 20 hours but if
you're<00:04:32.300> sitting<00:04:32.600> in<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.780> glitch<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.380> suppose<00:04:33.410> it

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
you're sitting in a glitch I suppose it

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.450 
you're sitting in a glitch I suppose it
would<00:04:34.220> take<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.610> few<00:04:34.910> days<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.240> get<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.810> level<00:04:35.990> 70

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
would take a few days to get to level 70

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.040 
would take a few days to get to level 70
that's<00:04:37.460> why<00:04:37.670> I<00:04:37.700> think<00:04:38.180> each<00:04:38.330> game<00:04:38.690> should<00:04:38.900> have

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
that's why I think each game should have

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.920 
that's why I think each game should have
a<00:04:39.080> 24<00:04:39.680> hour<00:04:39.800> time<00:04:40.190> limit<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:41.090> way<00:04:41.330> these

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
a 24 hour time limit that way these

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.440 
a 24 hour time limit that way these
people<00:04:42.380> with<00:04:42.830> no<00:04:43.010> game<00:04:43.370> we're<00:04:43.970> sitting<00:04:44.360> in

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
people with no game we're sitting in

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.690 
people with no game we're sitting in
glitches<00:04:44.930> for<00:04:45.110> days<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.620> days<00:04:45.830> would<00:04:46.490> not

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
glitches for days and days would not

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.360 
glitches for days and days would not
have<00:04:46.970> their<00:04:47.210> games<00:04:47.480> counted<00:04:48.020> at<00:04:48.140> this<00:04:48.830> point<00:04:49.130> I

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
have their games counted at this point I

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.570 
have their games counted at this point I
want<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.880> make<00:04:49.940> clear<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.720> no<00:04:51.260> glitch<00:04:51.680> or<00:04:52.010> mod

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
want to make clear that no glitch or mod

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.840 
want to make clear that no glitch or mod
or<00:04:52.940> hack<00:04:53.450> was<00:04:53.990> used<00:04:54.290> during<00:04:54.380> our<00:04:54.770> game<00:04:55.040> as<00:04:55.250> you

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
or hack was used during our game as you

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.610 
or hack was used during our game as you
can<00:04:56.000> see<00:04:56.210> in<00:04:56.330> our<00:04:56.420> video<00:04:56.600> George<00:04:57.410> isn't

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
can see in our video George isn't

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.070 
can see in our video George isn't
glitched<00:04:58.010> he's<00:04:58.580> walking<00:04:59.000> around<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.600> then

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
glitched he's walking around and then

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.860 
glitched he's walking around and then
sent<00:05:00.410> away<00:05:00.620> with<00:05:00.800> an<00:05:00.950> upgraded<00:05:01.430> VR<00:05:01.730> 11<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:02.720> can

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
sent away with an upgraded VR 11 you can

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.480 
sent away with an upgraded VR 11 you can
also<00:05:03.080> see<00:05:03.470> we<00:05:03.620> both<00:05:03.800> start<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.340> round

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
also see we both start the round

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.670 
also see we both start the round
together<00:05:04.730> so<00:05:05.600> neither<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:05.990> us<00:05:06.140> are<00:05:06.290> starting

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
together so neither of us are starting

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.340 
together so neither of us are starting
out<00:05:06.800> around<00:05:07.430> in<00:05:07.700> a<00:05:07.790> glitch<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.930> would<00:05:09.080> trust

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
out around in a glitch and I would trust

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.440 
out around in a glitch and I would trust
that<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.740> two<00:05:09.920> player<00:05:10.220> scores<00:05:10.670> on<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.210> round

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
that the two player scores on the round

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.590 
that the two player scores on the round
survive<00:05:11.870> leaderboard<00:05:12.470> are<00:05:12.680> legit<00:05:13.280> if<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:14.420> get
