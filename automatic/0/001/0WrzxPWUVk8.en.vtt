rebound<00:01:19.409> shot<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.920> therefore<00:01:20.340> I'm<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.820> gonna

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
rebound shot so therefore I'm just gonna

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
rebound shot so therefore I'm just gonna
call<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> skill<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.380> even<00:01:22.500> though<00:01:22.650> if

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
call it as a skill go but even though if

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.200 
call it as a skill go but even though if
you<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.100> think<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> skill<00:01:23.820> goal<00:01:24.030> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you don't think it is a skill goal this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.999 
you don't think it is a skill goal this
one<00:01:24.420> definitely<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.080> fantastic<00:01:25.530> finish

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
one definitely is a fantastic finish

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
one definitely is a fantastic finish

time<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.579> went<00:01:50.729> over<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.149> crossbar<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.780> that

time it went over the crossbar and that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.410 
time it went over the crossbar and that
is<00:01:52.409> how<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> game<00:01:52.649> ended<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.369> am<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.060> paying<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770 
really really fun game we're a little
bit<00:01:56.189> dominating<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:56.880> watching<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> game<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
bit dominating at watching of the game a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
bit dominating at watching of the game a
chance<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> slice<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> went<00:01:59.280> came<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.610> the

box<00:03:59.100> we<00:03:59.549> went<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.940> skin<00:04:00.180> with<00:04:00.299> as<00:04:00.420> well<00:04:00.570> we

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
box we went to the skin with as well we

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.539 
box we went to the skin with as well we
beat<00:04:00.900> most<00:04:01.079> of<00:04:01.260> his<00:04:01.380> offense<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:01.980> we<00:04:02.160> do<00:04:02.340> make

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
beat most of his offense and we do make

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.819 
beat most of his offense and we do make
it<00:04:02.700> 3-1<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.810> maybe<00:04:04.079> could<00:04:04.380> say<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.590> we

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
it 3-1 and you maybe could say that we

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.500 
it 3-1 and you maybe could say that we
could<00:04:05.010> call<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.370> as<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.579> sombrero<00:04:05.910> flake<00:04:06.299> goal

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
could call this as a sombrero flake goal

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.240 
could call this as a sombrero flake goal
but<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.780> my<00:04:06.900> opinion<00:04:07.019> it<00:04:07.500> isn't<00:04:07.890> really<00:04:08.070> one

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
but in my opinion it isn't really one

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.009 
but in my opinion it isn't really one
just<00:04:08.760> because<00:04:08.850> my<00:04:09.150> opponent<00:04:09.630> cleared<00:04:09.870> away

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
just because my opponent cleared away

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.870 
just because my opponent cleared away
from<00:04:10.320> that<00:04:10.410> corner<00:04:10.739> but<00:04:11.340> then<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.489> few<00:04:11.670> minutes

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
from that corner but then a few minutes

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.220 
from that corner but then a few minutes
say<00:04:12.030> we<00:04:12.209> got<00:04:12.329> another<00:04:12.630> attempt<00:04:13.019> with<00:04:13.140> the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
say we got another attempt with the

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.140 
say we got another attempt with the
sombrero<00:04:13.590> flake<00:04:13.890> with<00:04:14.070> code<00:04:14.250> rato<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.609> lovely

we scored before as a set was already

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.930 
we scored before as a set was already
like<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.260> proper<00:04:25.590> some<00:04:25.860> very<00:04:26.039> illegal<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:26.729> was

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
like a proper some very illegal so I was

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.510 
like a proper some very illegal so I was

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
kind of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.950 
kind of
it<00:04:27.550> about<00:04:27.819> that<00:04:28.030> one<00:04:28.210> but<00:04:28.360> towards<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.750> end<00:04:28.810> of

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
it about that one but towards the end of

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.990 
it about that one but towards the end of
the<00:04:29.020> game<00:04:29.110> my<00:04:29.830> opponent<00:04:30.099> also<00:04:30.520> just<00:04:30.729> assigned

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
the game my opponent also just assigned

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.760 
the game my opponent also just assigned
to<00:04:31.090> play<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:32.050> where<00:04:32.319> it's<00:04:32.440> just<00:04:32.500> random

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
to play so so where it's just random

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.980 
to play so so where it's just random
slide<00:04:33.129> take<00:04:33.340> us<00:04:33.490> all<00:04:33.610> over<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.910> place<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.389> can

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
slide take us all over the place I can

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.540 
slide take us all over the place I can
see<00:04:35.169> as<00:04:35.319> well<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.650> my<00:04:35.830> opponent<00:04:36.069> ended<00:04:36.460> up

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
see as well that my opponent ended up

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.040 
see as well that my opponent ended up
actually<00:04:36.729> erase<00:04:37.210> quitting<00:04:37.659> and<00:04:37.810> now<00:04:37.990> you

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
actually erase quitting and now you

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.360 
actually erase quitting and now you
probably<00:04:38.349> could<00:04:38.560> have<00:04:38.590> seen<00:04:38.830> from<00:04:39.009> the<00:04:39.129> stats

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
probably could have seen from the stats

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.399 
probably could have seen from the stats
we're<00:04:39.970> absolutely<00:04:40.120> dominating<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.139> a<00:04:41.199> lot

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
we're absolutely dominating that a lot

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.170 
we're absolutely dominating that a lot
of<00:04:41.500> chances<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:41.949> in<00:04:42.220> general<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.759> maybe<00:04:42.970> could

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
of chances in in general and maybe could

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.969 
of chances in in general and maybe could
have<00:04:43.240> scored<00:04:43.479> a<00:04:43.599> few<00:04:43.780> more<00:04:43.990> goals<00:04:44.139> but<00:04:44.710> anyway

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
have scored a few more goals but anyway

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.409 
have scored a few more goals but anyway
we<00:04:45.099> move<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.550> scalars<00:04:45.879> up<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.120> can<00:04:46.240> see

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
we move it to the scalars up you can see

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.760 
we move it to the scalars up you can see
right<00:04:46.449> there<00:04:46.810> we<00:04:46.930> have<00:04:47.020> five<00:04:47.199> games<00:04:47.470> left<00:04:47.560> with

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
right there we have five games left with

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.439 
right there we have five games left with
God<00:04:48.039> rato<00:04:48.250> but<00:04:48.789> we<00:04:48.879> actually<00:04:49.000> might<00:04:49.270> see

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
God rato but we actually might see
