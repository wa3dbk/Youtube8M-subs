00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
happen so we're starting off for now

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.870 
happen so we're starting off for now
still<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.759> winning<00:01:22.159> okay<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.580> tied

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.100 

most<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> games<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:27.960> but

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
most of the games on you want to get but

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.980 
most of the games on you want to get but
I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.530> there<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.130> ball<00:01:29.990> free-for-all

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I think there is a ball free-for-all

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080 
I think there is a ball free-for-all
except<00:01:31.650> everyone<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:32.909> even<00:01:32.970> think

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
except everyone and I don't even think

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.310 
except everyone and I don't even think
that<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> good<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.960> game

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
just found this spot this game i had

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.070 
just found this spot this game i had
never<00:01:48.460> used<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.850> spot<00:01:49.210> before<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.690> game<00:01:49.930> i

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
never used that spot before this game i

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.890

think<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.000> game<00:01:52.180> i'm<00:01:52.360> thinking<00:01:52.750> of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
think this is a game i'm thinking of

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.170 
think this is a game i'm thinking of
what<00:01:53.770> was<00:01:54.160> that<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> little<00:01:54.820> behind<00:01:54.910> that

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
what was that but a little behind that

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.130 
what was that but a little behind that
doorway<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:57.009> may<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.280> hey<00:01:58.240> I'm<00:01:58.660> pretty<00:01:58.869> sure<00:01:59.110> I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
doorway and may I hey I'm pretty sure I

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.450 
doorway and may I hey I'm pretty sure I
remember<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.530> game<00:01:59.560> now<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.040> it<00:02:00.130> comes<00:02:00.310> of

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
remember the game now and it comes of

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.780 
remember the game now and it comes of
items<00:02:00.790> yes<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.960> end<00:02:04.530> um<00:02:05.550> dodged<00:02:06.550> some

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
items yes in the end um dodged some

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.999 
items yes in the end um dodged some
bullets<00:02:06.940> there<00:02:07.539> took<00:02:07.960> myself<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.560> corner

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
bullets there took myself in this corner

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.910 
bullets there took myself in this corner
I<00:02:09.220> think<00:02:09.910> why<00:02:10.149> about<00:02:10.810> Harrier<00:02:11.410> just<00:02:11.709> picked

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
I think why about Harrier just picked

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.600 
I think why about Harrier just picked
off<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.190> kid<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.430> was<00:02:12.550> shooting<00:02:12.910> at<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.570> I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
off the kid that was shooting at so I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.460 
off the kid that was shooting at so I
didn't<00:02:15.610> know<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.940> when<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.959> happens<00:02:17.110> when

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
didn't know that when it happens when

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.650 
didn't know that when it happens when
the<00:02:17.530> game<00:02:17.709> was<00:02:17.739> taking<00:02:18.130> place<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.850> now<00:02:19.630> I

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
the game was taking place but you now I

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.780 
the game was taking place but you now I
realized<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.190> would<00:02:21.280> have<00:02:21.700> moved

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
realized it and so I would have moved

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.730 
realized it and so I would have moved
out<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.030> their<00:02:22.150> lot<00:02:22.420> sooner

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.490 

Oh

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
Oh

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.230 
Oh
I<00:02:29.620> think<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.370> might<00:02:30.550> have<00:02:30.580> been<00:02:30.730> trying<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:31.210> a

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
I think I might have been trying for a

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.420 
I think I might have been trying for a
nuke<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.690> game<00:02:32.020> with<00:02:32.320> halo<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.010> hairier

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
nuke this game with halo and I hairier

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.920 
nuke this game with halo and I hairier
but<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:38.470> think<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.710> get<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.100> hi<00:02:39.670> I'm<00:02:39.930> nukes

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
but I don't think I get it hi I'm nukes

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.980 
but I don't think I get it hi I'm nukes
are<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.380> overrated<00:02:41.770> like<00:02:42.780> they're<00:02:43.780> just

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
not worth going for because it's not a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.320 
not worth going for because it's not a
guaranteed<00:02:46.450> thing<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.320> get<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.709> and

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
thing is probably the best idea I think

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.060 
thing is probably the best idea I think
I<00:05:51.190> first<00:05:51.820> seen<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.210> with<00:05:52.540> CNN<00:05:53.020> first<00:05:53.740> time<00:05:53.920> I've

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
I first seen it with CNN first time I've

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.330 
I first seen it with CNN first time I've
seen<00:05:54.310> all<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.900> claymores<00:05:56.410> scavenger<00:05:57.100> and

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
seen all the claymores scavenger and

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.810 
seen all the claymores scavenger and
it's<00:05:58.270> it's<00:05:59.230> ideal<00:05:59.680> for<00:05:59.710> free<00:06:00.130> for<00:06:00.340> all<00:06:00.430> because

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
it's it's ideal for free for all because

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.840 
it's it's ideal for free for all because
you<00:06:01.530> really<00:06:02.530> can't<00:06:02.560> there's<00:06:03.340> you<00:06:03.550> don't<00:06:03.700> have

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
you really can't there's you don't have

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.850 
you really can't there's you don't have
teammates<00:06:04.180> to<00:06:04.330> watch<00:06:04.510> your<00:06:04.720> back<00:06:04.900> so<00:06:05.260> the<00:06:05.710> idea

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
teammates to watch your back so the idea

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.770
