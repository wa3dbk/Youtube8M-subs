00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.389
 our first diary is 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.920
 today I made this image in photoshop is 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.130
 very simple, we can make the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.960
 assembly but I preferred to print and I 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.250
 I'll leave more from there on the blog for you 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.830
 dear you want it and use it there, then it's just 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.039
 cut like this and covered the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.230
 contact and transparent is only the present 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.429
 contact only to cover the part of the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.300
 front 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.300
 thus 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.110
 and just cut what's left of the contact 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.820
 is ready let's prepare the ink 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.180
 I do not have a container mix a 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.920
 silver ink league is even matte 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.360
 choose this kitchen and I'll mix it 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.829
 half of what I put of ink 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:09.460
 detergent and now we just have to move people 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:11.770
 already start using with the help of a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.290
 brush over the contact is only one 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.300
 kind of a heart toy or image that you 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.840
 they did it just for us to fulfill 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.840
 to leave the mystery behind this 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.890
 scratch card and pratinha amorim and then 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.039
 that we finish 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.770
 just wait and stay and give your love to 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.940
 they will sky discuss his prize well 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.330
 little is not 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.330
 I loved it 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.710
 to get an idea we will use 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.509
 the old magazines know and pick up with whom 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.190
 more info fininha do tempo you 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.250
 choose I 'll choose to make one 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.930
 the travel theme but it can be 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.549
 that what you want you 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.619
 have been collecting money to buy 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.630
 a car a house to dig and you 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.909
 choose a theme I chose to travel and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.209
 cuts on everything related to the trip took 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.760
 a pot and made a small hole can hold up 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.800
 this pot lid using super bonder 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.080
 but I preferred not because then it goes 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.280
 be very difficult to remove the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.500
 money is not 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.630
 and with the help of a glue or trimming 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.040
 so that not putting all 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.130
 images I start with the bigger ones and then 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.610
 20 in small boxes on top 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.610
 cool 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.200
 good after we put all the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.140
 images that we chose is just cover 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.180
 with gentle contact if you put the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.400
 I made it as a whole contact 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.410
 It ended up jamming a little bit with a taxi. 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.590
 good to cut the small pieces and putting 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.260
 few is not falling for you 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.480
 not err I messed up but gave 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.520
 to fix and these people cover the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.850
 images do not come out but the 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.459
 criterion of you saw and ready love 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.300
 now just deliver pro love and button 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.130
 It will go a long way to give an incentive. 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.620
 good for our last fofurice today 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.959
 we will use a non-woven fabric that 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.880
 You want it that way because you 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.910
 prefer to know and just cut a 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.410
 square I chose gray that today stands 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.750
 well neutral and for male 4 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.420
 usually gets cooler, more neutral 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.100
 right, and these people cut out pretty square and 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.459
 to attach or sew the ends of the 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.110
 cushion good but I chose that line 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.540
 thickens which I prefer but can use 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.220
 hot glue also the sewing machine 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.750
 in the hand it is up to you 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.070
 I chose this thicker line to pretend 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.840
 hand even though I think the simplest 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.090
 and easier the ball and just going normal wando 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.900
 until the two parts and in the end the people 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.669
 leave a side for us to turn the fabric 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.039
 contrary to what will be the side that the 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:38.310
 people will actually use it then it will 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:40.920
 stay like this not seem sewing ok 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.810
 the pump had a fault can be blanket 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.120
 acrylic or any type of foam that 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.250
 You guys have made me a felt refill. 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.280
 which is easier to take to wash 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.500
 and we are going to arrest these as part of 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.840
 left with veil and then we can give people 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.390
 take to wash when needed someone 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.850
 Then we'll take the Velcro piece. 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.300
 glue one on the outside and one inside 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.930
 way he saw his mother with the help of 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.440
 Hot glue is really just putting us 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.390
 and holding the former from the outside and the 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:25.020
 according to the people put inside to 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:27.210
 not show up and ready to go 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.190
 let's decorate it now I chose one 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.950
 lace a rope that you are in 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.630
 homes should know if they are sad and 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.060
 I am writing it with hot glue 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.920
 The word you prefer is the 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.390
 I preferred that speed that I think 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.800
 It's all about a Valentine's Day. 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.840
 huh 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.620
 and it's very cute, it's just the people 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.620
 bypassing 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.300
 and holding on to the rope and look that 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.300
 simple loves 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.990
 If I loved you, I'd just like to take the 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.180
 Too much hot glue not to leave 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.990
 nothing showing up and we'll make the 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.240
 ready 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.580
 look at that end that waited too 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.530
 disgusted a super kiss and until the 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.530
 the next day and there
