00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
eight to ten - eleven - twelve

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.660 
eight to ten - eleven - twelve
and<00:01:49.750> then<00:01:49.960> up<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.799> high<00:01:50.950> E<00:01:50.979> string<00:01:51.219> you're

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
and then up on the high E string you're

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.749 
and then up on the high E string you're
going<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.030> play<00:01:52.320> eleven<00:01:53.320> I<00:01:53.500> mean<00:01:53.890> ten<00:01:54.189> my<00:01:54.579> bet

going to play eleven I mean ten my bet
ten<00:01:55.210> twelve<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.310> zero<00:01:58.090> three<00:01:58.509> five<00:01:58.750> six<00:01:59.560> seven

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
ten twelve so zero three five six seven

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.139 
ten twelve so zero three five six seven
five<00:02:00.610> seven<00:02:01.119> five<00:02:01.659> seven<00:02:02.170> eight<00:02:02.740> nine<00:02:03.280> nine

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.460 
little useful so say you're listening to
a<00:02:27.489> song<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.690> happens<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:28.989> be<00:02:29.049> an<00:02:29.200> E

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
a song and it just happens to be an E

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.710 
a song and it just happens to be an E
you<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:29.950> tell<00:02:30.280> by<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:30.970> kind<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.180> playing<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
you can tell by just kind of playing the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.360 
you can tell by just kind of playing the
E<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.500> sounds<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.760> fits<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:35.370> tune

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
E and if it sounds like it fits the tune

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.330 
E and if it sounds like it fits the tune
I<00:02:36.640> guess<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.930> could<00:02:38.080> say<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.410> an<00:02:38.500> E<00:02:38.680> it's

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
I guess you could say it's an E it's

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.559 
I guess you could say it's an E it's
really<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.910> hard<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.209> figure<00:02:40.330> out<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
really not that hard to figure out the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.250 
really not that hard to figure out the
key<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.840> song

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
key of a song

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.100 
key of a song
so<00:02:41.890> basically<00:02:42.760> if<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.209> sounds<00:02:43.480> bluesy<00:02:43.840> just

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
so basically if it sounds bluesy just

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.140 
so basically if it sounds bluesy just
kind<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.380> start<00:02:44.560> playing<00:02:44.799> away<00:02:44.980> at<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.549> just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
kind of start playing away at this just

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.059 
kind of start playing away at this just
completely<00:02:46.480> improvised<00:02:47.200> once<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.590> practice

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
completely improvised once you practice

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.670 
completely improvised once you practice
the<00:02:48.340> scale<00:02:48.549> enough<00:02:49.239> times<00:02:49.510> it'll<00:02:49.900> really<00:02:50.170> come

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the scale enough times it'll really come

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.890 
the scale enough times it'll really come
easy<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.099> so<00:02:51.849> I'm<00:02:52.180> just<00:02:52.299> gonna<00:02:52.420> kind<00:02:52.720> of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
easy to you so I'm just gonna kind of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.720 
easy to you so I'm just gonna kind of
improvise<00:02:53.530> here<00:02:53.560> for<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.010> second<00:02:54.340> just<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.579> show

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
improvise here for a second just to show

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:12.870 
improvise here for a second just to show
you<00:02:54.790> what<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.120> might<00:02:55.239> sound<00:02:55.420> like

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.920 

alright<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.150> was<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.540> completely

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
alright so that was just completely

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.840 
alright so that was just completely
improvised<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.480> what<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.570> can<00:03:17.720> do<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.850> you

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
improvised and what you can do is you

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.630 
improvised and what you can do is you
can<00:03:19.970> bring<00:03:20.300> up<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.050> shape<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.890> scale<00:03:22.310> and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
can bring up the shape of the scale and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.350 
can bring up the shape of the scale and
play<00:03:23.270> it<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:24.650> any<00:03:24.950> other<00:03:25.100> key<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:25.700> say<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:26.180> it's

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
play it in any other key so say if it's

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.560 
play it in any other key so say if it's
not<00:03:26.510> me<00:03:26.990> and<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.970> kind<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.240> play<00:03:29.450> along

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
not me and you just kind of play along

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.430 
not me and you just kind of play along
and<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:29.990> figure<00:03:30.200> out<00:03:30.320> that<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.040> a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and you figure out that it's a and a

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.140 
and you figure out that it's a and a
what<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.530> can<00:03:33.650> do<00:03:33.800> is<00:03:34.040> pretend<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:34.970> is

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
what you can do is pretend that this is

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.590 
what you can do is pretend that this is
your<00:03:35.180> open<00:03:35.600> E<00:03:35.750> string<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.320> play<00:03:36.770> up<00:03:37.370> until<00:03:38.210> you

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
your open E string and play up until you

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.200 
your open E string and play up until you
would<00:03:38.750> be<00:03:38.930> back<00:03:39.140> at<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.440> fifth<00:03:39.680> fret<00:03:39.740> so<00:03:40.550> for

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
would be back at the fifth fret so for

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.620 
would be back at the fifth fret so for
or<00:03:41.510> for<00:03:41.720> say<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:43.100> I'll<00:03:43.250> be<00:03:43.460> right<00:03:43.700> here<00:03:44.150> at<00:03:44.330> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
or for say and I'll be right here at the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.450 
or for say and I'll be right here at the
10th<00:03:44.930> fret<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.440> then<00:03:45.740> you<00:03:45.830> can<00:03:45.980> just<00:03:46.130> move<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
10th fret and then you can just move the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.460 
10th fret and then you can just move the
scale<00:03:46.730> shape<00:03:46.970> up<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.300> there<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:47.750> it'll<00:03:48.320> sound

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
scale shape up to there so it'll sound

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:01.540 
scale shape up to there so it'll sound
like<00:03:48.560> this<00:03:59.050> so<00:04:00.050> that's<00:04:00.890> an<00:04:01.040> easy<00:04:01.130> way<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.370> do

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
like this so that's an easy way to do

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.650 
like this so that's an easy way to do
that<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:01.970> an<00:04:02.860> easy<00:04:03.860> way<00:04:04.070> to<00:04:04.130> add<00:04:04.970> multiple

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
that and an easy way to add multiple

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.570 
that and an easy way to add multiple
scales<00:04:06.110> instead<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.710> just<00:04:06.860> one<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.310> song

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
scales instead of just one to a song

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.320 
scales instead of just one to a song
you're<00:04:07.760> improvising<00:04:07.970> too<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:08.750> if<00:04:09.020> you're<00:04:09.170> in<00:04:09.260> E

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
you're improvising too so if you're in E

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.550 
you're improvising too so if you're in E
so<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.450> don't<00:04:11.630> have<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.900> just<00:04:12.080> stay<00:04:12.260> in<00:04:12.410> that

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
so you don't have to just stay in that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.670 
so you don't have to just stay in that
one<00:04:12.800> scale<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.430> way<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:14.240> figure<00:04:14.630> out<00:04:14.780> other<00:04:15.290> than

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
one scale a way to figure out other than

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.310 
one scale a way to figure out other than
like<00:04:16.160> keys<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:16.880> can<00:04:16.940> play<00:04:17.180> in<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.930> simply

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
like keys you can play in is to simply

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.920 
like keys you can play in is to simply
take<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.190> ten<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:19.760> twelve<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.420> B<00:04:20.630> string

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
take the ten and twelve of the B string

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.810 
take the ten and twelve of the B string
so<00:04:21.260> high<00:04:22.010> e<00:04:22.360> B<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:24.160> then<00:04:25.160> figure<00:04:25.490> out<00:04:25.610> where

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
so high e B and then figure out where

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.270 
so high e B and then figure out where
that<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.150> on<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.540> E<00:04:26.570> string<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:27.860> believe

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
that is on the E string and I believe

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.870 
that is on the E string and I believe
that's<00:04:28.490> seven<00:04:29.300> five<00:04:29.510> and<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:31.310> can<00:04:31.340> go<00:04:31.640> ahead

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
that's seven five and you can go ahead

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:41.029 
that's seven five and you can go ahead
and<00:04:32.120> play<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.420> scale<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:33.020> shape

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.230 

yeah<00:04:41.849> but<00:04:42.779> anyways<00:04:43.699> you<00:04:44.699> can<00:04:44.849> do<00:04:44.999> that<00:04:45.150> in

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
yeah but anyways you can do that in

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.450 
yeah but anyways you can do that in
Reverse<00:04:45.539> as<00:04:45.749> well<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.349> can<00:04:46.499> play<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:47.279> high

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
Reverse as well you can play the high

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.450 
Reverse as well you can play the high
e-string<00:04:48.020> 1012<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.349> last<00:04:49.979> set<00:04:50.159> up<00:04:50.279> where<00:04:50.430> the

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
e-string 1012 and last set up where the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:05:00.969 
e-string 1012 and last set up where the
B<00:04:50.669> string<00:04:50.969> is<00:04:51.119> and<00:04:52.020> then<00:04:52.860> play<00:04:53.099> that<00:04:53.129> there<00:04:59.689> and

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
B string is and then play that there and

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.409
