00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.280
 multitherm euro the extremely thin and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.280
 fire protection safe 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.280
 thermal insulation composite system 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.880
 his beginning takes the revolution in 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.430
 the thermal insulation with a miracle substance 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.380
 he looks as if he came from another 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.439
 star 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.200
 aerogels the blue shimmering aerogels 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.969
 not only are they visually intriguing 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.219
 also have properties that 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.170
 no other material on earth 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.090
 can offer 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.489
 and in fact, this is a miracle 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.870
 like so many innovations his 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.870
 origin in space 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.089
 Aerogels afford ultralight 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.280
 Highly efficient isolators and extreme 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.530
 Fine filters in modern satellites and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.469
 probes make an important contribution to the 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.420
 exploration of our universe 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.630
 Now this high-tech material is holding 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.880
 moving into our everyday life 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.490
 thanks to the latest production technology 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.470
 Aerogels are now the basis of a 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.470
 new super insulation for building 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.590
 but what is actually an e-mobile one 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.950
 yes yes it is true 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.410
 an aerogels around a gel a gel is in 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.420
 principle nothing more than an ultra 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.180
 fine sponge in its fine pores 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.280
 water is evaporated that evaporates 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.170
 water in a gel then it shrinks 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.910
 and the pore structure is falling 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.580
 together 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.100
 Aero gel is created by putting in one 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.560
 elaborate chemical process the gel 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.990
 the pores dry so well 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.050
 structure is maintained and that 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.360
 its original shape keeps its original shape 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.760
 Aero gel is only made of air 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.660
 and from a microscopic one 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.660
 pore structure 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.780
 the unimaginably fine micro pores in the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.400
 aerogels are up to 1000 times 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.130
 thinner than a spin colors 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.980
 this results in an aero gel 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.340
 Material share of less than one percent 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:28.990
 So the rest is just over 99 percent only 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:31.660
 air the fine structure inside the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.410
 Bird is also the secret of 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.660
 incredible insulating effect in 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 conventional insulation materials can become 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.010
 the air molecules trapped inside 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.170
 still moving and bumping against each other 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.170
 and so transport heat 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.920
 in one, the pore structure is like that 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.290
 fall that the scope of the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.840
 air molecules is extremely restricted 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.880
 in the thin and tight-knit structure 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.780
 the particles have no possibility 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.540
 to touch each other 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.920
 An exchange of heat and cold 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.340
 no longer possible 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.790
 the aero becomes the super isolator of the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.519
 neither cold nor heat conducts the ideal 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.519
 material for a new high-tech 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.519
 building insulation 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:30.070
 but how does the brittle glassy become 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.360
 Airgel a functional and easy to use 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.360
 processing insulation board 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.120
 with multitherm euro it is now 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.550
 succeeded a insulation board on euro basis 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.130
 to develop the advantages of this 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.440
 Wonderful fabric with the requirements 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:55.980
 an easy-to-use insulation board 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:58.220
 connects the airgel as 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.330
 fine granules in a unique 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.540
 manufacturing process into a special 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.370
 developed nasty incorporated 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.720
 This process creates a thin one 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.730
 and flexible insulation board multitherm aero 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.800
 can be processed as easily as 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.420
 a conventional heat insulation and 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.489
 at the same time offers completely new 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.419
 freedom in the use of a 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.419
 thermal insulation composite system 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:42.690
 multi- speed is extremely thin multitherm 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:47.250
 aero is flexible multitherm aero is 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:50.340
 fireproof and heat resistant multitherm 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.520
 aero is water repellent and still 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:05:04.440
 vapor permeable multitherm aero is 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:06.180
 sound-absorbing with a sensational 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.000
 rating value of thermal conductivity 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.740
 lambda is equal to zero 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.040
 018 are already a few centimeters 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.470
 thin plates for high efficiency 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.480
 Thermal insulation just where everyone 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.330
 millimeter counts can be 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.960
 multitherm aero the space loss extremely 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.960
 to reduce 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.440
 through the construction of several layers 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.130
 The insulation panels of 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.990
 multi-speed flexible so can the 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.120
 Heat insulation finally like a second 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.430
 also on round building forms 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.230
 be adjusted 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.120
 also the character of historical facades 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.560
 thanks to masonry following 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.560
 stay attached 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.330
 the combination of flammable fleece 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.919
 and the super insulator aerogels met 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.710
 highest requirements for fire protection 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:19.500
 and offers maximum security for 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:21.210
 Residential building the nanostructure of the aero 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.160
 Gels offers even fine ones 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.580
 Water droplets no possibility 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.070
 to dump and make multitherm absolute 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.780
 water repellent 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:34.160
 At the same time, water vapor can be used easily 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.160
 escape through the insulation 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.700
 already a few centimeters multitherm 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.070
 Aero can reduce the perceived noise level 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.199
 Halved by traffic noise and so the 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.199
 additionally increase living quality
