pin plug which left me a little bit of
this<00:01:23.970> may<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.080> prior<00:01:25.320> years

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
this may because I know in prior years

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.890 
this may because I know in prior years
it<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> same<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.119> now<00:01:27.299> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
back to the 10 pin plug I wanted to say

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120 
back to the 10 pin plug I wanted to say
something<00:02:04.259> about<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.009> thought

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
something about this because I thought

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.210 
something about this because I thought
it<00:02:05.250> was<00:02:05.310> noteworthy<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:07.350> instructions<00:02:07.950> in

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
it was noteworthy in the instructions in

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
it was noteworthy in the instructions in
the<00:02:09.030> instructions<00:02:09.450> themselves<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.560> says

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the instructions themselves that it says

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.949 
the instructions themselves that it says
that<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.459> unit<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:11.970> take<00:02:12.000> high<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.780> low

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
it's taking a low level audio wavelets

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790 
it's taking a low level audio wavelets

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.540 
here and you got another one over there
good<00:03:37.709> luck<00:03:37.860> with<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.280> what's<00:03:38.400> your

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
good luck with that and what's your

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.000 
good luck with that and what's your
mountainous<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.450> back<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.010> speaker

itself<00:03:41.340> you're<00:03:42.060> going<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.239> need<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.420> extend

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
itself you're going to need to extend

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.620 
itself you're going to need to extend
these<00:03:42.810> now<00:03:43.709> they<00:03:44.220> did<00:03:44.489> coordinate<00:03:45.209> these<00:03:45.360> just

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
these now they did coordinate these just

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.330 
these now they did coordinate these just
like<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.780> regular<00:03:45.959> car<00:03:46.470> or<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.680> marine<00:03:46.860> stereo

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
negative solid is your positive and on

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.180 
negative solid is your positive and on
the<00:04:03.330> woofer<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:04.380> have<00:04:04.590> two<00:04:04.890> sets<00:04:05.130> of

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
the woofer you have two sets of

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.580 
the woofer you have two sets of
terminals<00:04:05.750> gold-plated<00:04:08.780> yeah<00:04:09.780> gold-plated

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
terminals gold-plated yeah gold-plated

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.310 
terminals gold-plated yeah gold-plated
not<00:04:10.709> brass<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:12.450> would<00:04:12.570> put<00:04:12.720> one<00:04:12.750> here<00:04:13.110> one

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
not brass and you would put one here one

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.520 
not brass and you would put one here one
here<00:04:13.350> each<00:04:13.950> one<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.340> these<00:04:15.140> terminals<00:04:16.140> is

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
here each one of these terminals is

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.520 
here each one of these terminals is
one-and-a-half<00:04:17.459> ohms<00:04:18.000> by<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.419> way<00:04:18.600> so<00:04:19.169> when

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
one-and-a-half ohms by the way so when

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.259 
one-and-a-half ohms by the way so when
you<00:04:19.620> put<00:04:19.799> these<00:04:19.950> two<00:04:20.100> together<00:04:20.220> it's<00:04:20.700> going<00:04:21.180> to

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
you put these two together it's going to

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.029 
you put these two together it's going to
internally<00:04:21.900> bridge<00:04:22.109> at<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.350> amplifier<00:04:22.770> and

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
internally bridge at the amplifier and

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.580 
internally bridge at the amplifier and
give<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.520> three<00:04:24.180> ohm<00:04:24.419> load<00:04:24.810> at<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
give you a three ohm load at the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.560 
give you a three ohm load at the
amplifier<00:04:26.070> by<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.340> way<00:04:26.550> okay

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
amplifier by the way okay

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.530 
amplifier by the way okay
so<00:04:28.260> that's<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.310> way<00:04:29.430> that's<00:04:29.670> going<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.000> go<00:04:30.120> now

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
so that's the way that's going to go now

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.380 
so that's the way that's going to go now
I<00:04:30.870> would<00:04:31.710> not<00:04:31.860> recommend<00:04:32.070> wiring<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.180> thing

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
I would not recommend wiring this thing

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.180 
I would not recommend wiring this thing
any<00:04:33.600> differently<00:04:34.050> then<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.650> factory<00:04:34.980> does

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
any differently then the factory does

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.040 
any differently then the factory does
because<00:04:35.580> if<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:35.820> lower<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.270> impedance<00:04:36.810> this

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
because if you lower the impedance this

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.900 
because if you lower the impedance this
amplifier<00:04:37.590> it's<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:38.040> just<00:04:38.280> just<00:04:38.550> don't<00:04:38.760> think

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
amplifier it's I just just don't think

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.460 
amplifier it's I just just don't think
it'd<00:04:38.970> get<00:04:39.060> hack<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.450> don't<00:04:39.960> mess<00:04:40.140> with<00:04:40.170> it

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
it'd get hack it don't mess with it

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.990 
it'd get hack it don't mess with it
leave<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:40.830> be<00:04:40.980> if<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.250> want<00:04:41.430> more<00:04:41.550> power<00:04:41.670> get

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
leave it be if you want more power get

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.850 
leave it be if you want more power get
yourself<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.270> bigger<00:04:42.450> amplifier<00:04:42.930> because<00:04:43.710> in

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
yourself a bigger amplifier because in

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.490 
yourself a bigger amplifier because in
my<00:04:44.040> opinion<00:04:44.460> this<00:04:44.910> will<00:04:45.150> four<00:04:45.330> here<00:04:45.600> which<00:04:46.260> is

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
my opinion this will four here which is

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.330 
my opinion this will four here which is
the<00:04:46.740> KFC<00:04:47.190> W<00:04:48.150> 250<00:04:48.780> mrw<00:04:49.200> is<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.620> 10<00:04:49.890> inch<00:04:50.040> woofer

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
the KFC W 250 mrw is a 10 inch woofer

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.340 
the KFC W 250 mrw is a 10 inch woofer
this<00:04:50.610> one<00:04:50.790> here<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.180> personally<00:04:51.930> think<00:04:52.140> will

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
this one here I personally think will

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.290 
this one here I personally think will
take<00:04:52.380> much<00:04:53.010> more<00:04:53.280> power<00:04:53.490> than<00:04:53.730> this<00:04:53.820> amplifier

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
take much more power than this amplifier

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.420 
take much more power than this amplifier
can<00:04:54.660> provide<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.170> it<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.710> excursion<00:04:56.190> on<00:04:56.280> this

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
can provide to it the excursion on this

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.070 
can provide to it the excursion on this
thing<00:04:56.610> is<00:04:56.790> very<00:04:57.000> nice<00:04:57.240> this<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.510> nice<00:04:57.810> stiff

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
accident I've never actually even

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.790 
accident I've never actually even
cracked<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.620> basket<00:05:05.070> which<00:05:05.220> is<00:05:05.250> very<00:05:05.640> cool<00:05:05.880> I

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
cracked the basket which is very cool I

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.750 
cracked the basket which is very cool I
don't<00:05:07.800> know<00:05:07.950> if<00:05:08.010> we<00:05:08.130> could<00:05:08.280> see<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.580> very

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
don't know if we could see this very

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.930 
don't know if we could see this very
well<00:05:08.910> but<00:05:09.290> these<00:05:10.290> are<00:05:10.470> all<00:05:10.650> covered<00:05:11.340> all<00:05:11.700> the

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
well but these are all covered all the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.550 
well but these are all covered all the
tinsel<00:05:12.240> weeds<00:05:12.570> going<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.110> voice<00:05:13.260> coil

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
tinsel weeds going to the voice coil

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.260 
tinsel weeds going to the voice coil
they're<00:05:14.130> not<00:05:14.370> running<00:05:14.610> through<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.000> spider

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
they're not running through the spider

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.270 
they're not running through the spider
so<00:05:15.630> they're<00:05:15.840> very<00:05:16.080> nice<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.860> little<00:05:16.950> extra

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
so they're very nice the little extra

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.270 
so they're very nice the little extra
slack<00:05:17.580> I<00:05:17.880> like<00:05:18.390> what<00:05:18.540> I<00:05:18.570> see<00:05:18.870> here<00:05:19.290> I<00:05:19.410> liked<00:05:20.070> the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
slack I like what I see here I liked the

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.100 
slack I like what I see here I liked the
stainless<00:05:20.670> hardware<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.120> liked<00:05:21.540> all<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:21.930> on

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
stainless hardware I liked all this on

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.410 
stainless hardware I liked all this on
the<00:05:22.200> bottom<00:05:22.350> I<00:05:22.590> like<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.860> way<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.420> magnet

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
the bottom I like the way the magnet

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.880 
the bottom I like the way the magnet
structure<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:24.990> everything<00:05:25.080> is<00:05:25.410> all<00:05:25.590> sealed

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890

up<00:05:26.070> very<00:05:26.280> well<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.760> like<00:05:27.330> in<00:05:27.660> here<00:05:28.410> it<00:05:28.650> seems<00:05:28.950> to

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
up very well I like in here it seems to

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.340 
up very well I like in here it seems to
be<00:05:29.130> rather<00:05:29.490> well<00:05:29.870> maybe<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.930> little<00:05:31.080> bit<00:05:31.260> of

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
be rather well maybe a little bit of

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.840 
be rather well maybe a little bit of
venting<00:05:31.620> which<00:05:31.740> of<00:05:31.920> course<00:05:31.950> everywhere<00:05:32.700> for

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
venting which of course everywhere for

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.750 
venting which of course everywhere for
needs<00:05:33.120> on<00:05:33.450> the<00:05:34.110> top<00:05:34.350> very<00:05:34.740> aesthetically<00:05:35.310> nice

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
needs on the top very aesthetically nice

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.290 
needs on the top very aesthetically nice
to<00:05:36.150> see<00:05:36.390> I<00:05:36.660> think<00:05:36.960> it's<00:05:37.320> very<00:05:37.440> pretty<00:05:38.300> the

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
to see I think it's very pretty the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.420 
to see I think it's very pretty the
overall<00:05:39.720> cut<00:05:39.960> out<00:05:40.080> with<00:05:40.290> on<00:05:40.470> this<00:05:40.620> sucker<00:05:41.160> is

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
overall cut out with on this sucker is

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.060 
overall cut out with on this sucker is
not<00:05:41.670> an<00:05:41.790> 1/8<00:05:42.180> inch<00:05:42.560> so<00:05:43.560> that<00:05:43.740> would<00:05:43.860> be<00:05:43.950> the

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
not an 1/8 inch so that would be the

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.450 
not an 1/8 inch so that would be the
hole<00:05:44.220> size<00:05:44.460> for<00:05:44.700> this<00:05:45.560> typical<00:05:46.560> depth<00:05:47.010> you

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
hole size for this typical depth you

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.360 
hole size for this typical depth you
know<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.990> didn't<00:05:48.990> measure<00:05:49.140> it<00:05:49.260> but<00:05:49.800> perhaps<00:05:50.100> I

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
know I didn't measure it but perhaps I

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.180 
know I didn't measure it but perhaps I
will<00:05:50.430> or<00:05:50.820> add<00:05:51.060> it<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.480> description<00:05:52.190> or

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
will or add it to the description or

for<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.280> hell<00:05:56.400> of<00:05:56.430> it<00:05:56.580> but<00:05:57.390> I<00:05:57.600> like<00:05:58.820> it's<00:05:59.820> a

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
for the hell of it but I like it's a

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.400
