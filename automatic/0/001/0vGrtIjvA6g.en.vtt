00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.170
 and the self world so here I am from 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.370
 back them so I 'll tell you I have 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.929
 not seen this video for a while 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.869
 because already I was concerned about 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.300
 course and jousse saw that finally these are these 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.760
 lately I had not really 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.490
 time to make two videos nor the utility 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.670
 to redo since my city was a little 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 in a little bit of pause what are we going to say on 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.870
 will say that like that 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.000
 and suddenly I stopped a little 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.270
 for a little while and saw that I 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.050
 no I 'm not either is not no 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.390
 plus a lot of two people who 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.680
 follow me we'll shoot beats I 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.539
 did not see the point of making a video 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.960
 by day or something like that yes 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.719
 so here is excuse me if you are 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 disappointed in me or whatever it is 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 not so voluntary as you may have been 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.719
 see in the title normally makes a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.210
 video tricks so i'm going to talk to you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.260
 of a trick I finally have that I 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.549
 know me I do not know if you 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.900
 know you so it's a little 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.920
 known as trick but I 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.110
 did not know before 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.750
 in fact I discovered it's not great 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 a long time ago and there is a friend who told me 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 where she comes from we try this and touba du 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.740
 we tried it and it works 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.460
 really and it's super convenient so 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.200
 it's the trick of turnips and yes so 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.659
 do not say where was I know 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.130
 nothing and my crossing all of a sudden you 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.939
 try you have my faith tinchant is not 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.439
 so that's the turnip thing for 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.409
 those who do not know it's actually so 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.700
 it's best if you or I go 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.409
 tell you when she comes for that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.850
 so see these slabs to the one who sells 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.490
 turnips she comes every Sunday 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.950
 so Indian morning until noon from 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.130
 from 2010 she is no longer there so if you 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.780
 put your clock around 7 8 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.979
 hours 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.390
 it's good when you have the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.409
 time to buy so you do not actually 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.280
 we must listen well until the end 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.469
 because you do not have to do anything 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.270
 what an I'm going I'm fine 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.950
 started i'm going to get there 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.240
 on you if you want to fill your 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.340
 pockets and you make a maximum of 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.880
 bells you must have warm yourself 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.140
 160000 bell 160000 it's really 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.120
 you have to have pils 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.120
 if you want to fill your pockets with 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.220
 turnips and have the maximum of bells 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.870
 after you can take more turnips 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.430
 and make several trips in the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.730
 other cities here do in several 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.370
 once done buy more than your loved ones 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.440
 here I am trying to be clear and precise 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.370
 in explanations it's complicated 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.210
 so that was after then so you buy 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.920
 so you only have what you want so 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.420
 personally had with three packs of 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.500
 99 country bell 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.330
 I managed to make a million 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.340
 bells 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.680
 so I went from 300 micro jade in 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.900
 done at a million klaus so is you 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.710
 see a bit that the trick is a trick 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.350
 concrete so then you buy yourself 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.290
 have nana and I already told you and 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.940
 you go to another city 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.230
 all that in a friend's city or if 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.340
 you have a second 3ds with a 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.030
 second game you go into your 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.850
 second life 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.350
 that you understood me then so 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.000
 you will sell at home to sales and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.070
 keys this is the best because mish 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.540
 melo and take less looking what and 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.970
 so you go to the terror claim 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.340
 pardon retouching you resell all that 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.080
 and there you have 5 x 5 x the number of 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.720
 clausade that you had what as I 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.970
 you told me me with 3,5 microchip I 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.820
 I got a million what happened 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.130
 I have the little piggy bank and everything 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.040
 so I hope that you will have 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.540
 helped so you did not really know 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.720
 great tips for making bells 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.250
 a little for free what makes it a little bit 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.660
 after if you just say these dates 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.830
 rich or whatever bar and 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.540
 expensive 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.180
 it's an error of an animal crossing 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.459
 guard finally here it may not have been 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.360
 a voluntary error but in any case 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.250
 it's really super convenient so that's it 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.230
 in Switzerland when you could see it down 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.100
 it's new I made new 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.100
 first audience 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.100
 I did that I try to go fast because 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.710
 that I have a memory that is a bit of a 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.430
 little filled with my phone I already had 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.640
 Fountain 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:33.280
 I did too I hurry up an arch 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.170
 illuminated like that I did I'm in 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.550
 shutting down because there 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.830
 it was a bit of a mess you could not 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.360
 see that I do some traits but to 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.860
 from here my paths are pretty good 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.680
 but not dull 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:49.060
 this is my head lighthouse the new bankrupt 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.919
 the arrival is some time but they 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.560
 were not before loose a position of 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.190
 Police not modern lot to wooden one 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:02.260
 with boards all the red climb 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.700
 this is my other house that I have 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.560

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.860
