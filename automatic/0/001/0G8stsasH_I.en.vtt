 with time all here now at 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.550
 virtual drive as you can see 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.000
 has just been mounted you do 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.770
 right of administration wants you is 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.310
 proposed so you do yes otherwise 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.390
 the installation will not be able to start 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.780
 you do yes then you do 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.830
 french language is more preferable in 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.100
 French here is then next 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.990
 I accept normal next is now 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.340
 the installation starts at least I 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.610
 cut the video and we're just 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.750
 after the installation is finished you 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.740
 uncheck launch the game you do not 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.110
 pick up or close now 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.100
 so before I go on I give you 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.910
 a small precision 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.830
 so to play this game you have to 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.600
 imperatively disconnect from the internet 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.630
 otherwise you can not play that's it 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.630
 it's very simple so now we 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.400
 let's continue the installation because 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.040
 it's not over you go in the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.190
 virtual drive here next you go 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.510
 in firelight do a double click for 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.400
 the moment we try to side now 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:17.320
 you go to your hard drive 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:21.489
 okay in program files 86 you 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.070
 go to be case here you 're doing a 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.540
 double click and now you put 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:33.310
 this sides and you launch the file 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.530
 so the application so let's talk 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.970
 wait a little bit long enough 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.590
 when you can not do that I 'm going 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.200
 poor application files 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.239
 vincent because there is enough music 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.989
 horrible a shape I do not like so we're going 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.140
 wait a little bit like karting key 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.600
 so as in every weekend there are 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.070
 always a pretty horrible loud music 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.209
 I do not like at all you will see 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.130
 why so it's long enough that you 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.210
 mean I do not know why 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.210
 you expect a little 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.070
 and so when I told him we can not 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.049
 not play without the connection finally have to 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.700
 to disconnect 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.480
 I do not know why it's 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.669
 like this, he finally opened 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.070
 but a little bit of time finally maybe 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.380
 it will take less time than that 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.280
 so now to open the file 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.040
 of applications here be careful 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.250
 ears 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.050
 so that's not very fine you 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.300
 have generate generate you 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.250
 choose the key you have copied 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.960
 then you go to the files 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.660
 the application and you paste everything 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.820
 just the key here and you do 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.950
 go on 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.460
 now here is the game so start so 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.650
 still for you it will be black screen 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.270
 so here I am going to leave I'm going to do 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:07.729
 against them you're here and I'm going to stop 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.020
 these horrible music so voices 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.120
 the installation is complete 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.650
 so as you can see that 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.110
 works I the same facts live 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.880
 so me it was black screen 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.740
 this is normal because it is no 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.310
 software that I use to do the 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.180

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.850
