well<00:01:30.030> from<00:01:30.180> when<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> kid<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.409> almost

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
well from when I was a kid we almost

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.929 
well from when I was a kid we almost
never<00:01:31.829> had<00:01:32.100> them<00:01:32.280> every<00:01:32.490> once<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.820> while<00:01:32.909> I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.069 
guess we'd go to someone's house maybe
and<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.590> would<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.840> maybe<00:01:36.840> we

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and they would have one or maybe we

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.730 
and they would have one or maybe we
would<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.880> at<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> special<00:01:40.500> special

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
you know thin may normally not be a good
thing<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.299> these<00:02:07.020> guys<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.290> always<00:02:07.740> sort<00:02:07.979> of

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
thing but these guys have always sort of

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.900 
thing but these guys have always sort of
treated<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.030> exquisitely<00:02:09.899> thin

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
treated it as like it's exquisitely thin

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.140 
treated it as like it's exquisitely thin
so<00:02:11.910> that's<00:02:12.090> kind<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.390> nice<00:02:12.540> pattern

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
so that's kind of a nice pattern

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.149 
so that's kind of a nice pattern
design<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.689> goes<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.049> a<00:02:14.079> clock<00:02:14.319> there<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.829> think

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
design it goes to a clock there I think

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.860 
design it goes to a clock there I think
