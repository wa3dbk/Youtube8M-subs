from your main character to RL or

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.220 
from your main character to RL or
whether<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.390> bugged<00:00:42.750> at<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> moment

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.869 
whether it's just bugged at the moment
and<00:00:43.320> they've<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.890> implemented<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.579> properly

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
but this will be an interesting change

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930 
but this will be an interesting change
