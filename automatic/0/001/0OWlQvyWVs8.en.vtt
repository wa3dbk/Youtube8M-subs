00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
brains for everything so go look at the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.510 
brains for everything so go look at the
brains<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> arrows<00:01:06.380> same<00:01:07.520> hasn't

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
brains for the arrows same hasn't

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.420 
brains for the arrows same hasn't
changed<00:01:08.939> since<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.360> last<00:01:09.390> video<00:01:10.430> there's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430

changed since the last video there's
nothing<00:01:11.760> about<00:01:11.970> age<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.530> increases<00:01:13.530> their

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
nothing about age is increases their

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.640 
nothing about age is increases their
account<00:01:14.100> once<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.320> increase<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> done

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
account once it's increase it done

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.320 
account once it's increase it done

increasing the air ok who destroys us

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
increasing the air ok who destroys us
all<00:01:18.509> ok<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.280> let's<00:01:20.310> look<00:01:20.580> at<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> brain

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
all ok so now let's look at the brain

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.260 
all ok so now let's look at the brain
for<00:01:21.890> crossbow<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:24.619> one<00:01:25.619> equipped<00:01:26.270> global

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
for crossbow so one equipped global

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.890 
for crossbow so one equipped global
arrow<00:01:27.479> count<00:01:27.840> equals<00:01:28.170> zero<00:01:29.329> then<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:31.250> or<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
arrow count equals zero then a or if the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.690 
arrow count equals zero then a or if the
arrow<00:01:34.140> count<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.590> greater<00:01:34.619> than<00:01:35.040> zero<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.400> mean

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
arrow count is greater than zero I mean

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.780 
arrow count is greater than zero I mean
when<00:01:36.479> right<00:01:36.720> triggers<00:01:37.110> hey<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.920> enables<00:01:38.490> fire

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
when right triggers hey it enables fire

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.830 
when right triggers hey it enables fire
arrow<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.509> increase<00:01:39.869> by<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> then

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
arrow to increase by one and and then

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.060 
arrow to increase by one and and then
after<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.500> takes<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.720> arrow<00:01:45.720> count<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
after that it takes one arrow count is

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.600 
after that it takes one arrow count is
decreased<00:01:47.549> by<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> make

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
decreased by one and so so got to make

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.760 
decreased by one and so so got to make
sure<00:01:50.640> there's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.149> different<00:01:51.630> fire<00:01:51.780> an<00:01:52.530> arrow

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
sure there's a different fire an arrow

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.429 
sure there's a different fire an arrow
count<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.189> different<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.380> just

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
count or different this one it's just

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.090 
count or different this one it's just
right<00:01:55.799> trigger<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.460> pressed<00:01:57.140> equals<00:01:58.140> sword

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
right trigger is pressed equals sword

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.540 
right trigger is pressed equals sword
increased<00:01:59.850> by<00:01:59.969> one

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
increased by one

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.090 
increased by one
and<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.540> there's<00:02:02.930> nothing<00:02:03.170> really<00:02:03.590> complex

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
and so there's nothing really complex

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.970 
and so there's nothing really complex
about<00:02:04.370> that<00:02:04.810> just<00:02:05.810> make<00:02:06.230> sure<00:02:06.260> you<00:02:06.500> have

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
about that just make sure you have

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.690 
about that just make sure you have
something<00:02:07.520> like<00:02:07.760> store<00:02:07.940> Danza<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:10.190> now<00:02:10.369> we'll

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
something like store Danza and now we'll

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.770 
something like store Danza and now we'll
get<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.060> brain<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.330> my<00:02:11.750> character<00:02:13.780> so

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
get to the brain of my character so

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
get to the brain of my character so
scroll<00:02:15.710> down<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.810> same<00:02:18.080> set<00:02:18.500> to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
scroll down this is the same set to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.750 
scroll down this is the same set to
display<00:02:19.100> how<00:02:19.430> many<00:02:19.580> arrows<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.000> have<00:02:20.150> there

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
okay so there's my throwing system and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.280 
okay so there's my throwing system and
121<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.410> throw<00:02:30.740> staff<00:02:35.020> all<00:02:36.020> right

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
121 and so so you throw staff all right

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.140 
121 and so so you throw staff all right
so<00:02:37.160> line<00:02:37.370> 35<00:02:37.910> uh<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.980> global<00:02:40.910> fire<00:02:41.210> arrow<00:02:41.540> is

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
so line 35 uh so global fire arrow is

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.970 
so line 35 uh so global fire arrow is
greater<00:02:44.150> than<00:02:44.420> zero<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:45.110> will<00:02:45.170> shoot<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
greater than zero it will shoot in the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.190 
greater than zero it will shoot in the
direction<00:02:46.220> I'm<00:02:46.550> looking<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.240> then<00:02:47.900> after

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
direction I'm looking and then after

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.830 
direction I'm looking and then after
that<00:02:48.350> it'll<00:02:49.210> global<00:02:50.210> fire<00:02:50.390> arrow<00:02:50.600> is

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
that it'll global fire arrow is

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.020 
that it'll global fire arrow is
decreased<00:02:51.230> by<00:02:51.380> one<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:54.640> pretty<00:02:55.640> much<00:02:55.850> you

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
decreased by one so so pretty much you

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.570 
decreased by one so so pretty much you
just<00:02:56.090> means<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:56.750> far<00:02:57.020> an<00:02:57.170> arrow<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:58.250> then

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
just means so far an arrow and then

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.580 
just means so far an arrow and then
after<00:02:58.910> your<00:02:59.060> 5<00:02:59.210> that's<00:02:59.750> single<00:03:00.020> arrow<00:03:00.140> it'll

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
after your 5 that's single arrow it'll

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.200 
after your 5 that's single arrow it'll
just<00:03:00.800> stick<00:03:01.010> lease<00:03:01.160> about<00:03:01.430> one<00:03:01.580> simple

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
just stick lease about one simple

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.750 
just stick lease about one simple
straightforward<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:06.640> next<00:03:07.640> line

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
straightforward and so and so next line

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.979 
straightforward and so and so next line
is<00:03:08.090> for<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.420> sword<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.500> global<00:03:10.340> sword<00:03:11.150> greater

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
is for the sword so global sword greater

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.060 
is for the sword so global sword greater
than<00:03:12.320> zero<00:03:12.730> means<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.940> attack<00:03:14.739> just<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.860> normal

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
than zero means I attack just a normal

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.320 
than zero means I attack just a normal
melee<00:03:16.670> attack<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.420> any<00:03:17.660> sort<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:19.000> since<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
melee attack of any sort and since the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.870 
melee attack of any sort and since the
sword<00:03:20.690> just<00:03:21.590> doesn't<00:03:22.250> have<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.400> be<00:03:22.580> equipped

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
sword just doesn't have to be equipped

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.420 
sword just doesn't have to be equipped
for<00:03:23.209> art<00:03:23.420> for<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.260> right<00:03:24.470> trigger<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.920> work<00:03:25.130> it

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
for art for the right trigger to work it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.670 
for art for the right trigger to work it
makes<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:26.690> no<00:03:26.989> matter<00:03:27.140> what<00:03:27.320> when

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
makes it so no matter what when

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.590 
makes it so no matter what when
everybody<00:03:27.980> writes<00:03:28.100> for<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.550> I'm<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.850> lie<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
everybody writes for you I'm a lie and

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.620 
everybody writes for you I'm a lie and
so<00:03:29.860> but<00:03:30.860> if<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.070> do<00:03:31.130> have<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.370> sword<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:31.970> my<00:03:32.450> hand

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
so but if I do have a sword in my hand

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.990 
so but if I do have a sword in my hand
then<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.590> swings<00:03:33.830> a<00:03:33.980> sword<00:03:34.010> found<00:03:34.910> the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
then it swings a sword found the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.030 
then it swings a sword found the
crossbow<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.600> just<00:03:35.810> swings<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.590> cross<00:03:36.770> but<00:03:36.980> I

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
crossbow it just swings the cross but I

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.280 
crossbow it just swings the cross but I
like<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.220> melee<00:03:37.580> weapon<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:38.120> it's<00:03:38.750> crucial

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
like a melee weapon and it's crucial

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.800 
like a melee weapon and it's crucial
that<00:03:39.320> line<00:03:40.010> 35<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:41.060> above<00:03:41.540> line<00:03:42.050> 38<00:03:42.760> and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
that line 35 is above line 38 and

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.130 
that line 35 is above line 38 and
because<00:03:44.810> if<00:03:45.850> line<00:03:46.850> 35<00:03:47.300> is<00:03:47.540> executing<00:03:48.110> that

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
because if line 35 is executing that

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.850 
because if line 35 is executing that
means<00:03:48.470> shooting<00:03:48.970> then<00:03:49.970> y<00:03:50.570> ou<00:03:50.600> skip<00:03:51.230> line<00:03:51.470> 38

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
means shooting then y ou skip line 38

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.010 
means shooting then y ou skip line 38
because<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.550> cannot<00:03:52.790> have<00:03:53.000> two<00:03:53.270> moves<00:03:53.660> at<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
because you cannot have two moves at the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.390 
because you cannot have two moves at the
exact<00:03:54.290> same<00:03:54.470> time<00:03:55.270> and<00:03:56.270> so<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:57.800> makes<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.160> so

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
exact same time and so that makes it so

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.960 
exact same time and so that makes it so
it<00:03:58.970> doesn't<00:03:59.530> execute<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.130> melee<00:04:01.550> right<00:04:01.820> after

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
it doesn't execute the melee right after

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.270 
it doesn't execute the melee right after
you<00:04:02.120> shoot<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.720> tap<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:03.769> if<00:04:03.860> you're<00:04:03.980> able<00:04:04.100> to

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
you shoot and tap so if you're able to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.120 
you shoot and tap so if you're able to
shoot<00:04:04.430> you'll<00:04:04.670> shoot<00:04:04.910> if<00:04:05.209> you're<00:04:05.989> not<00:04:06.080> able<00:04:06.260> to

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
shoot you'll shoot if you're not able to

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.880 
shoot you'll shoot if you're not able to
shoot<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.610> will<00:04:07.760> go<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.269> melee<00:04:08.620> attack<00:04:09.620> and

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
shoot it will go to the melee attack and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.700 
shoot it will go to the melee attack and
they<00:04:10.280> just<00:04:10.430> cancel<00:04:10.760> each<00:04:10.850> other<00:04:10.940> out<00:04:11.290> so<00:04:12.290> see

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
they just cancel each other out so see

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.920 
they just cancel each other out so see
more<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.430> can<00:04:13.730> just<00:04:13.820> punch<00:04:14.000> around<00:04:14.180> punch
