00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:10.100
 well we are in utrecht today and we one 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.850
 guest taken today in the what we are going 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.590
 here today now 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.060
 well we are going to see if we can beer 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.260
 buy because I believe false 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.730
 identification 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.950
 what I made last week is me 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.830
 24 so she goes 24 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.260
 yes think yourself and luck 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.940
 well this is always meanwhile 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.470
 they know the rules quite a bit 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.240
 supermarket is think that is still difficult 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.039
 and what if we get caught 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.670
 or well what if you get caught 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.739
 to become 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.480
 yes I have a press watch with me 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.949
 so that does not always have many problems 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.510
 I also think you give one 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.679
 credible as she does 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.949
 24 year old 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.949
 no idea no idea really not yes you know 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.359
 he never left cashiers but well in and 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.550
 perhaps the brand is curious 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.550
 whether it is somewhat credible 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.629
 yes it really says it is here it 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.579
 script there well I'm curious if it 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.409
 will succeed later just now inside 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.760
 go to the supermarket and there we go 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.999
 now just find out if it works or 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.030
 not 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.560
 well supermarket a yes i walked to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.539
 inside and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.030
 parting with the beer and on the shelf 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.740
 Bavaria beer out and well eh tot 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.390
 so far everything went well 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.310
 but when I stood in line then 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.359
 she looked at the two of them differently 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.359
 behind you hear it there 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.549
 but finally when i said no then 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.930
 it all went well and well 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.600
 just checkout 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.100
 after my my just taking it to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.840
 my idea i actually only go to the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.740
 date of birth and not whether it is real 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.479
 used to be 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.229
 so yes that was very simple and how 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.380
 it went really well without without 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.690
 some problems and yes so they asked 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.000
 indeed on but the 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.280
 yes she did not want extra we study or something 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.899
 no not that but once you become a pilot 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.700
 you were 24 until 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.110
 apparently yes when planning here more often 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.320
 make use of 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.690
 well you out if it is that easy 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.220
 maybe hey i say on to the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.350
 next supermarket 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.110
 yes supermarket two after you almost the same 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.840
 story went easy 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.310
 only yes that was indeed yes yes anyway 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.360
 slightly higher expectations because you 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.489
 thinks yes the first can still have one 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.890
 coincidence but the second yes 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.440
 twice goes well then such works 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.540
 website that really is 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.540
 and yes I have to go in there too 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.730
 and a house grabbed my pier 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.860
 walked to the cash desks looked at my idea 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.140
 otherwise I have nothing to worry about 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.239
 and well that could just pay and 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.920
 we run through the counter on it 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.920
 two style we have two super market 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.269
 always had with albert heijn 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.310
 is it pure luck yes just again 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.290
 succeeded and it was hard of it 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.970
 cupcakes mother from this wrong or 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.110
 Egg was just very easy 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.130
 yeah actually just went whole 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.180
 easy it 's just an issue 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.760
 from one 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.019
 idea printed on a piece of paper 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.879
 and 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.819
 so come take it so no it was difficult 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.370
 it not really to find out or 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.620
 indeed succeed now go to supermarket 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.799
 3 and if that works 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.569
 well then well then it really is 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.700
 maybe she should check them better 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.459
 yes the very last supermarket were the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.319
 Expectations high because you like 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.609
 it succeeds three times yes then it is anyway 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.340
 really 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.709
 and then it just works and that third party 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.169
 supermarket chain really 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.150
 and just as good at her so I thought 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.099
 yes it will work 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.650
 also naturally found room people outside 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.470
 so with a camera, just like one 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.049
 a bit suspicious I think I just stayed 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.959
 furthermore just looked for a little longer 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.120
 than normal and then sank Checkout 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.739
 the very last superman how did it go 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.260
 it went harder than the other or 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.849
 probably just very easy and went 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.280
 it all from so well they looked one 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.139
 somewhat questionable but in the end 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.879
 guests anyway so it didn't work 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.040
 difficult no here again in the 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.349
 stock your beer 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.890
 proved that you still have a false idea 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.460
 to bow 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.460
