00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
I think there was a bit of a glitch in

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.010 
I think there was a bit of a glitch in
the<00:00:32.130> whole<00:00:32.369> routing<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.210> scheduling<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the whole routing and scheduling and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.870 
the whole routing and scheduling and
before<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.380> knew<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.590> wasn't<00:00:35.430> gonna<00:00:35.640> come

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
before we knew it wasn't gonna come

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.240 
before we knew it wasn't gonna come
together<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.570> needed<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.250> now

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
together the way we needed it to now

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.190
