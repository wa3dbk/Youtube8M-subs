00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.180
 Is tested 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.439
 G 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.519
 sentence 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.029
 his 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.149
 so 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 St 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.700
 Of course there are not only games to watch at gamescom but there are also games 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.200
 no discussions 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.310
 and now the cellphone postage was 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.060
 so much for the top stood at the Big Ben 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.250
 because there was namely percent radio play Zeitarbeit 2 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.650
 the associated controller namely a bike and I saw that 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.750
 I thought who superstar I have to think that I have to try 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.280
 yes the prayer to appear for the PlayStation 3 so what he plays too 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.870
 and is in baden-wÃ¼rttemberg 80 euros cost appearing the whole in 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.240
 November 18 November or something 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.670
 and 2 Jan there was already my predecessor DS appeared on the b 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.460
 who is quite different from Persian three bags 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.620
 in order to give control actually relatively simple and easy to enter for gas 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.720
 So who knows what sporty 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.729
 steer with the steering wheel and with squares but still jump 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.860
 of course it is of course you have to get to the finish 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.910
 and showers by collecting coins 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.790
 gives way to obstacles outside you see black forest baar jumps or 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.230
 bad enough or if there are fountains over this tour 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.520
 So he has to know what to do with it, I've noticed you can 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.250
 you can still pedal so that percent is in the game and 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.280
 It can not be any faster that this is happening, maybe I will 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 but I came there was a quick change 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 Brock intimidated the difference I noticed now 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 but Schollerer Wolfach like I play these games later from the end 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.550
 So I thought so again via game over the districts no reason that 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.719
 Project advise Nixdorf 2 4 300 sites to include 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.689
 and 2 yes, but I'll continue as cut here 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:09.629
 below are velvet
