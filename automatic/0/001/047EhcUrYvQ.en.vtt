not hdmi its component which is still
high<00:01:06.720> def<00:01:07.190> but<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.610> only<00:01:08.760> downside<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
high def but the only downside to it is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.560 
high def but the only downside to it is
anytime<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.010> TV<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.670> above<00:01:11.970> 37

anytime you have a TV that's above 37
inches<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.890> start<00:01:14.039> using<00:01:14.189> component<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
inches if you start using component you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.120 
inches if you start using component you
start<00:01:15.359> losing<00:01:15.539> a<00:01:15.869> picture<00:01:16.439> quality<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> from

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
start losing a picture quality it from

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.700 
start losing a picture quality it from
how<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.789> it<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.899> wanted<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> get

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
how you see it so when I wanted to get

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
how you see it so when I wanted to get
on<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> play<00:01:20.399> a<00:01:20.430> game<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.060> had<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
on just to play a game I had to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.620 
on just to play a game I had to
unfortunately<00:01:21.899> go<00:01:22.829> through<00:01:23.179> 720p<00:01:24.179> instead<00:01:24.539> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
unfortunately go through 720p instead of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.370 
unfortunately go through 720p instead of
1080p<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.159> I'm<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.509> decided<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
1080p so I'm I decided to get a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.050 
1080p so I'm I decided to get a
different<00:01:28.740> thing<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.130> runs<00:01:29.280> through<00:01:29.549> hdmi

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
different thing that runs through hdmi

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
different thing that runs through hdmi
and<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.450> couldn't<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.810> happier<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:31.920> quality<00:01:32.340> my

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and I couldn't be happier the quality my

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.550 
and I couldn't be happier the quality my
videos<00:01:32.820> might<00:01:33.179> be<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.359> little<00:01:33.719> bit<00:01:33.929> more<00:01:34.079> crisp

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
videos might be a little bit more crisp

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.609 
videos might be a little bit more crisp
as<00:01:34.799> well<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:35.789> a<00:01:35.850> huge<00:01:36.270> difference

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
as well it's not a huge difference

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.739 
as well it's not a huge difference
obviously<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.759> far<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:38.999> for<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.420> personal

use<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.009> much<00:01:41.159> easier<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.640> me<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.939> use

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
use it's so much easier for me to use

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.980 
use it's so much easier for me to use
