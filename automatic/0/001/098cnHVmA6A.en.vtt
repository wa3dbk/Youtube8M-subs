00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.740
 thursday youtube by jim ross here i 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.529
 Welcome you to one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.370
 new look trades today it works 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.830
 to the topic defi for me now in the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.109
 pretty much last eight months 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.830
 pretty big topic that testify 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.529
 personally gained a lot and personally 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.410
 yes today why little trick as it for 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 me a deep worked relatively well 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.199
 so if he's already the last one 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.340
 could have followed it then videos could 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.900
 maybe even from the slides serve 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.920
 I'm in Vancouver I'm in March 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.700
 to vancouver there were about 92 92 5 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:45.660
 kilo and then I'm relatively heavy in the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.770
 gone up to about 105 to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.870
 I changed my training which one 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.070
 act in a separate video and was 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.850
 then as I said safe on the 8th 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.420
 september to germany 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.410
 I came back about 105 kilo 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.910
 actually pretty funny for the first 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.109
 Let's see the scale on three digits 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.739
 to live and now it's up to you 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.860
 November 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.799
 Now I'm about 96 5 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.750
 and I guess that I have to 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.640
 scarce kilo down I must 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.860
 I'm about the same shape as me 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.080
 that is , that is, effectively, I think 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 about two and a half three kilo 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.560
 muscle mass and for me 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.159
 because he actually carries in the dv 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.180
 of course, probably say now 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.500
 some years just have to stop the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.630
 calories do not count mine is natural 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.950
 but the problem is clear to most 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.960
 diets is yes that people are infected 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.100
 not stick to my first 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.320
 layout is always up to date like me 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.689
 take the final result by default three large 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.610
 meals as many do and also 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.020
 they all have about 1000 calories 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.289
 and there in between 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.030
 any snacks between 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.470
 because now I'm the class 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.030
 I am convinced that with timing so 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.679
 important but i just have 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.299
 in between also risks that means me 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.009
 in between, maybe just 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.950
 eat a lot or drink a lot because 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.330
 Otherwise I would feel such a bad teaching 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.220
 and for me, was always in the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.170
 broken cool trick that i'm in 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.970
 end effect mostly the middle meal 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.289
 let it out so that was then 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.340
 a great example is 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.390
 lunch with just under 1000 calories and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.709
 which then simply replaced by 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.940
 several small meals 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.380
 I also have a channel couple recipes 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.840
 the perfectly own either 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.090
 it is different fruit salad 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.530
 for example I have that was one of the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.519
 first snack food will follow in the 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.890
 At the end you can do the little tip 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.599
 do something with vegetables 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.070
 fills up really well so especially these 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.170
 Of course vegetables just almost has 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.160
 No calories just like when you look at yourself 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.480
 with the different fruits 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.190
 busy there are also fruits in the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.079
 end effect of almost only carbohydrates resp 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.290
 fructose is also different 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.540
 types carbohydrate or different heights 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.190
 Carbohydrate content in the fruits and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.400
 for example, the r4 grapefruit or 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.739
 blue or something have you there you have really 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.900
 no calories in it and but it fills the 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.920
 still relatively good 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.079
 that means you try your proteins 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.650
 get his fats in and then feel 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.060
 the rest easy with with clear 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.640
 carbohydrates on or him with food 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.440
 which feels relatively good but just what 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.900
 has little calories and that has for me 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.700
 really extremely good danger works 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.930
 can also vary very well for 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.420
 example just then depending on how you 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.920
 but I worked, for example 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.239
 the nine to five or any one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.489
 Shift work I have a night shift 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.810
 or something that I just then 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.220
 it's not lunch, for example 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.680
 but for example breakfast or 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.959
 just the dinner depending on the conversion 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.940
 then always by smaller ones 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.470
 a little snacks might be easy 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.150
 to prepare a little food box for 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.650
 in between my and snack food is 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.120
 yes , I really have something 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.920
 I do not have to sit down to warm up 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.170
 but I'm just trying 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.319
 to take and eat fast and that 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.540
 I found really good in the trick 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.550
 so this feeling of hunger ends up 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.200
 to bridge this suffering and in the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.190
 end effect then simply the success 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.140
 to have the deep 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.040
 and as I said about now 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.080
 I feel one kilo again 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.300
 reasonably not thick now 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.760
 maybe in the last ddr checks 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.090
 still relatively finished 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.769
 everything on my stomach is just that with me 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.599
 last mazzi strong because of that I am 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.239
 again happy to some extent 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.220
 probably exactly in the sense 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.720
 I hope the video did not help 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.860
 See you in the next video I am 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.630
 Out all the love I hope the video 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.459
 you liked it when you asked me for one 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.500
 want to support companies then give 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.630
 the video like hetfield is best 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.910
 coop's other friends step by step 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.919
 and from the bussche our shop over 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.610
 it really gets a lot of me 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.620
 mean 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.030
 We were in German for the company 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.160
