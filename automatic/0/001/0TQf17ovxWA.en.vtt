what<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.450> scenario<00:00:12.450> I'm<00:00:12.840> using<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
what the scenario I'm using here is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.550 
what the scenario I'm using here is
basically<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.730> don't<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.630> mood<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
basically that you don't have a mood to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.550 
basically that you don't have a mood to
at<00:00:19.650> all<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.789> your<00:00:21.260> computer<00:00:22.260> and

now the reason why I didn't bother doing
this<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:13.140> FileZilla<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this with FileZilla is because I have a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
this with FileZilla is because I have a
router<00:01:16.110> firewall<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.430> well<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.820> Windows

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
router firewall as well as Windows

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.890 
router firewall as well as Windows
Firewall<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:21.030> um<00:01:21.479> it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
Firewall so really it it's um it's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
Firewall so really it it's um it's
alright<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.890> me<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> say<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.759> allow<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
alright for me to say just allow a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.580 
alright for me to say just allow a
program<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.020> feature<00:01:25.229> through<00:01:25.530> Windows

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
program or feature through Windows

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.859 
program or feature through Windows
Firewall<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
Firewall because when you do that it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.399 
Firewall because when you do that it
means<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.070> program<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:30.540> listen<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.140> any

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
means that the program can listen on any

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.100 
means that the program can listen on any
pause<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.700> hijacker<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.630> something

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
pause and it's a hijacker or something

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.469 
pause and it's a hijacker or something
just<00:01:34.650> somehow<00:01:34.890> takes<00:01:35.700> control<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.390> your

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just somehow takes control of your

just somehow takes control of your
computer<00:01:37.079> using<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> program<00:01:38.570> well<00:01:39.680> pretty

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680

it's better to have a much more strict
to<00:01:47.490> rule<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:48.200> Windows<00:01:49.200> Firewall<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.220> only

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
want to say if your port forwarding is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.759 
want to say if your port forwarding is
you<00:02:57.599> just<00:02:57.720> want<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> say<00:02:58.230> allow<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
you just want to say allow the

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.880 
you just want to say allow the
connection<00:02:59.190> no<00:02:59.549> matter<00:02:59.610> what<00:03:00.170> because<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
connection no matter what because you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.190 
connection no matter what because you
know<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.459> bit<00:03:02.610> inconvenient<00:03:03.480> if<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.049> is

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
know it's a bit inconvenient if this is

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.199 
know it's a bit inconvenient if this is
a<00:03:04.230> server<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.129> set<00:03:05.370> up<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:05.970> only

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
a server that you set up and it's only

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.120 
a server that you set up and it's only
going<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.510> do<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.780> if<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.049> secure<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.100> you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
going to do it if it's secure so you

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.199 
going to do it if it's secure so you
just<00:03:08.310> want<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.489> say<00:03:08.700> allow<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.180> connection

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
just want to say allow the connection

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.110 
just want to say allow the connection
then<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.239> want<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> unpick<00:03:13.049> public<00:03:13.739> ok<00:03:14.220> good

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
then you want to unpick public ok good

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.849 
then you want to unpick public ok good
because<00:03:15.359> that's<00:03:15.690> just<00:03:15.930> going<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:16.350> really

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
because that's just going to be really

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.819 
because that's just going to be really
really<00:03:17.190> unsafe<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.349> only<00:03:19.680> want

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
really unsafe you know so you only want

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.160 
really unsafe you know so you only want
domain<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.120> private<00:03:21.750> no<00:03:22.290> public<00:03:23.750> then<00:03:24.750> you

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170
