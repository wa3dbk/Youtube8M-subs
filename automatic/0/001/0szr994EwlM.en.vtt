iTunes<00:00:12.290> U<00:00:12.559> on<00:00:12.770> the<00:00:13.190> iPad<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:13.960> iTunes<00:00:14.960> U<00:00:15.230> is

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:15.850 
iTunes U on the iPad so iTunes U is

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.040 
iTunes U on the iPad so iTunes U is
almost<00:00:16.850> exactly<00:00:17.510> like<00:00:18.110> I<00:00:19.390> books<00:00:20.390> when<00:00:20.930> it

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
almost exactly like I books when it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.499 
almost exactly like I books when it
comes<00:00:21.260> to<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:21.890> format<00:00:22.610> and<00:00:22.820> layout<00:00:22.939> of<00:00:23.270> the

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
comes to the format and layout of the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
of my courses I have only done

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.370 
of my courses I have only done
trigonometry<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:05.510> first<00:01:05.810> tab<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
trigonometry and the first tab is the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.770 
trigonometry and the first tab is the
info<00:01:06.830> tab<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.430> this<00:01:07.940> is<00:01:08.060> where<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.240> just<00:01:08.300> get

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
info tab and this is where I just get

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.530 
info tab and this is where I just get
all<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.260> required<00:01:09.830> info<00:01:10.730> for<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.360> class

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
all of the required info for the class

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.660 
all of the required info for the class
so<00:01:12.200> here's<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.530> overall<00:01:12.680> it's<00:01:13.280> basically

search by section of the class so here's

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.999 
search by section of the class so here's
trigonometric<00:02:07.850> functions<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.110> see

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
trigonometric functions and I can see

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.350 
trigonometric functions and I can see
all<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.489> notes<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.940> teacher<00:02:11.120> has

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
and the quality of these videos are

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.340 
and the quality of these videos are
gonna<00:03:16.400> be<00:03:16.489> completely<00:03:17.120> dependent<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.810> how<00:03:18.290> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
gonna be completely dependent on how the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.440 
gonna be completely dependent on how the
instructor<00:03:18.650> chose<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:20.380> upload<00:03:21.380> them<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
instructor chose to upload them and the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.259 
instructor chose to upload them and the
type<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:24.519> content<00:03:25.519> they<00:03:25.610> choose<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.090> provide

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
type of content they choose to provide

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.259 
type of content they choose to provide
so<00:03:27.200> some<00:03:27.440> teachers<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.280> think<00:03:28.580> actually<00:03:28.790> have

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
so some teachers I think actually have

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.120 
so some teachers I think actually have
lectures<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.870> them<00:03:30.049> standing<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.769> speaking

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
lectures of them standing and speaking

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.470 
lectures of them standing and speaking
to<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.370> class<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.850> looks<00:03:32.030> like<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.269> teacher

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
to the class it looks like this teacher

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.500 
to the class it looks like this teacher
was<00:03:33.700> providing<00:03:34.700> video<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.090> what<00:03:35.269> he<00:03:35.360> was<00:03:35.480> doing

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
was providing video of what he was doing

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.770 
was providing video of what he was doing
on<00:03:35.810> his<00:03:35.840> computer<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.760> pretty<00:03:38.690> much

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
on his computer so that pretty much

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.259 
on his computer so that pretty much
covers<00:03:39.110> it<00:03:39.320> this<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:41.480> that's<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.760> think
