exact same thing only I went up to the
plane<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.940> made<00:00:18.150> sure<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> other<00:00:18.690> three

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
plane I made sure the other three

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.900 
plane I made sure the other three
players<00:00:19.080> were<00:00:19.439> right<00:00:19.680> behind<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.460> then<00:00:20.670> I

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
players were right behind it and then I

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.050 
players were right behind it and then I
hit<00:00:21.180> X<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.769> got<00:00:23.100> us<00:00:23.279> onto<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.609> plane<00:00:23.880> so

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
that maybe one form from one small part

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.340 
that maybe one form from one small part
as<00:02:56.010> well<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.550> one<00:02:57.120> video<00:02:57.510> comment<00:02:57.989> for<00:02:58.170> another
