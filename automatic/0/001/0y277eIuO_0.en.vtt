00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
hey guys I just wanted to show you all a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.150 
hey guys I just wanted to show you all a
fishing<00:00:06.750> bot<00:00:06.960> I've<00:00:07.230> been<00:00:07.470> working<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:07.859> for<00:00:08.130> a

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
fishing bot I've been working on for a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.560 
fishing bot I've been working on for a
world<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.460> warcraft'<00:00:10.429> it's<00:00:11.429> named<00:00:12.179> ultimate

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
world of warcraft' it's named ultimate

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.970 
world of warcraft' it's named ultimate
fish<00:00:12.750> pot<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.460> basically<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.800> bot<00:00:16.800> I've

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
fish pot and basically it's a bot I've

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.109 
fish pot and basically it's a bot I've
designed<00:00:17.460> which<00:00:17.820> works<00:00:19.310> kind<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.400> unlike<00:00:20.789> any

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
designed which works kind of unlike any

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210 
designed which works kind of unlike any
of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.600> other<00:00:21.720> fishing<00:00:22.500> BOTS<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.130> out

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
of the other fishing BOTS that are out

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.920 
of the other fishing BOTS that are out
there<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
there on that you can get on the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.960 
there on that you can get on the
internet<00:00:25.289> you'll<00:00:26.250> find<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> lot<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
internet you'll find that a lot of the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.370 
internet you'll find that a lot of the
ones<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.420> are<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.630> there<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.930> internet

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
ones that are out there on the internet

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
ones that are out there on the internet
work<00:00:28.740> by<00:00:29.160> trying<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.849> manipulate<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:32.690> memory

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
work by trying to manipulate the memory

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.889 
work by trying to manipulate the memory
allocation<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> while<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.340> how

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
allocation for a while which is how

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.280 
allocation for a while which is how
Morden<00:00:36.899> which<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> anti<00:00:37.950> hacking<00:00:39.290> stuff

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
Morden which is the anti hacking stuff

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.389 
Morden which is the anti hacking stuff
that<00:00:41.210> visit<00:00:42.210> producers<00:00:42.719> that's<00:00:43.680> how<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.010> finds

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that visit producers that's how it finds

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.310 
that visit producers that's how it finds
you<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.480> get<00:00:45.629> banned<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:46.079> easily

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you and you can get banned very easily

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
you and you can get banned very easily
by<00:00:47.309> using<00:00:47.850> bots<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.829> work<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.629> so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
by using bots that work with that so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.069 
by using bots that work with that so
yeah<00:00:51.780> I've<00:00:52.559> designed<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.309> new<00:00:53.820> fishing<00:00:54.510> bot

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
yeah I've designed a new fishing bot

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.900 
yeah I've designed a new fishing bot
which<00:00:55.559> works<00:00:55.920> outside<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
which works outside of that and it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.170 
which works outside of that and it
actually<00:00:57.149> works<00:00:57.329> by<00:00:58.579> listening<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> output<00:01:00.059> on

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
actually works by listening to output on

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.110 
actually works by listening to output on
your<00:01:00.300> sound<00:01:00.510> card<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.609> list<00:01:02.609> looking<00:01:03.059> for

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
your sound card and list looking for

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.010 
your sound card and list looking for
pixel<00:01:03.989> changes<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> yeah<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.840> much

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
pixel changes so yeah it's just a much

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.300 
pixel changes so yeah it's just a much
nicer<00:01:07.439> sort<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.159> cleaner<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.880> less<00:01:09.830> less<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
nicer sort of cleaner and less less I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.330 
nicer sort of cleaner and less less I
suppose<00:01:11.820> more<00:01:12.600> secure<00:01:12.930> way<00:01:13.200> more<00:01:14.159> less

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
suppose more secure way more less

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.789 
suppose more secure way more less
dangerous<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> Bob<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.350> World<00:01:16.710> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
dangerous way to Bob in World of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.210 
dangerous way to Bob in World of
Warcraft<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:18.380> yeah<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> thought<00:01:19.680> I'd<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.040> show

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
Warcraft so yeah I thought I'd just show

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
Warcraft so yeah I thought I'd just show
you<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.430> quick<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:21.299> couple<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.900> minutes<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you a quick a couple of minutes of it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.270 
you a quick a couple of minutes of it
doing<00:01:23.009> its<00:01:23.130> thing<00:01:24.350> yeah<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.799> see<00:01:25.979> I'm

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
doing its thing yeah as you can see I'm

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.390 
doing its thing yeah as you can see I'm
just<00:01:26.580> set<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.829> I'm<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.220> actually

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
just set up on I'm just I'm actually

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.490 
just set up on I'm just I'm actually
just<00:01:29.700> underneath<00:01:29.939> dollar<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.659> currently

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
just underneath dollar on I'm currently

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.539 
just underneath dollar on I'm currently
leveling<00:01:33.259> my<00:01:34.259> fishing<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:35.009> druid<00:01:35.220> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
leveling my fishing up on my druid so

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.560 
leveling my fishing up on my druid so
I'm<00:01:35.640> actually<00:01:36.000> catching<00:01:36.270> anything

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
I'm actually catching anything

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.170 
I'm actually catching anything
worthwhile<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.920> figured<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.729> was<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> nice

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
worthwhile but I figured this was a nice

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
worthwhile but I figured this was a nice
quiet<00:01:39.360> quiet<00:01:39.990> spot<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.500> me<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
quiet quiet spot for me to do it and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
quiet quiet spot for me to do it and
that's<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> things<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.700> it's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that's one of the things that it's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
that's one of the things that it's
important<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.420> actually<00:01:45.689> need<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
important you do actually need to have a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.660 
important you do actually need to have a
quiet<00:01:46.560> spot<00:01:47.060> because<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.899> sound<00:01:49.200> card<00:01:49.670> output

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
quiet spot because the sound card output

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.870 
quiet spot because the sound card output
is<00:01:50.909> what<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> bot<00:01:51.479> listens<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:53.640> when

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
is what the bot listens to to know when

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.069 
is what the bot listens to to know when
a<00:01:53.909> fish<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.240> caught<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.899> your

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
a fish is caught so if you're on your

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.980 
a fish is caught so if you're on your
own<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.380> much<00:01:55.530> better<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> I'll<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.780> quiet

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
own it's much better so I'll be quiet

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.859 
own it's much better so I'll be quiet
now<00:01:58.049> I'll<00:01:58.469> start<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> bot<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.820> I'll<00:02:00.659> just

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
now I'll start up the bot and I'll just

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.940 
now I'll start up the bot and I'll just
let<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.110> run<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> couple<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> minutes<00:02:01.860> you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
let it run for a couple of minutes you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:25.820 
let it run for a couple of minutes you
can<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.189> how<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> works

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.740 

so<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.920> can<00:02:27.040> see<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.880> um<00:02:29.220> yeah<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.750> cursor

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
so you can see it um yeah it cursor

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:41.550 
so you can see it um yeah it cursor
changes<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.590> moves<00:02:33.340> about<00:02:33.550> as<00:02:33.730> well<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.470> I'm

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
changes and moves about as well so I'm

00:02:41.560 --> 00:03:28.660 
changes and moves about as well so I'm
not<00:02:41.590> touching<00:02:41.980> anything<00:02:42.040> at<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.490> moment
