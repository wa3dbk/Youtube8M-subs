00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
gooey and sticky and we can mash it into

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:17.270 
gooey and sticky and we can mash it into
almost<00:05:08.190> like<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.910> meatball<00:05:12.740> normal<00:05:13.740> or<00:05:13.860> take

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:27.700 

a<00:05:17.400> little<00:05:18.030> bit<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.360> our<00:05:20.840> secret<00:05:21.840> weapon

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.950 

this<00:05:28.250> is<00:05:28.400> some<00:05:28.580> fish<00:05:29.360> oil<00:05:29.510> from<00:05:30.380> some<00:05:30.650> various

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
this is some fish oil from some various

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.130 
this is some fish oil from some various
species<00:05:32.960> some<00:05:33.680> bunker<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:34.510> some<00:05:35.510> other<00:05:35.660> oily

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
species some bunker and some other oily

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.430 
species some bunker and some other oily
fish<00:05:36.430> we're<00:05:37.430> going<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:37.900> mix<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.020> in<00:05:39.230> there

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
fish we're going to mix that in there

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.780 
fish we're going to mix that in there
and<00:05:40.540> that<00:05:44.620> will<00:05:45.620> almost<00:05:45.830> do<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.280> triple<00:05:46.670> by

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
and that will almost do the triple by

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:55.640 
and that will almost do the triple by
itself

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.070 

you<00:05:56.340> can<00:05:56.460> see<00:05:56.639> now<00:05:56.850> it's<00:05:57.060> starting<00:05:57.449> there<00:05:57.600> it's

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
you can see now it's starting there it's

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.770 
you can see now it's starting there it's
not<00:05:58.290> as<00:05:58.470> dry<00:05:59.270> as<00:06:00.270> it<00:06:00.449> was<00:06:00.630> we<00:06:01.380> can<00:06:01.560> basically

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
not as dry as it was we can basically

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.360 
not as dry as it was we can basically
mold<00:06:03.780> this<00:06:03.990> right<00:06:04.289> now<00:06:04.970> into<00:06:06.530> into<00:06:07.530> balls<00:06:07.770> will

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
mold this right now into into balls will

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.159 
mold this right now into into balls will
probably<00:06:08.789> need<00:06:08.970> just<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.360> little<00:06:09.840> bit<00:06:09.990> more

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
probably need just a little bit more

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.340 
probably need just a little bit more
sand<00:06:11.030> what<00:06:12.030> we<00:06:12.120> want<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.360> do<00:06:12.509> with<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.750> sand<00:06:13.080> is

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
enough that's going to give it a little

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.890 
enough that's going to give it a little
bit<00:06:26.880> of<00:06:27.350> weight<00:06:28.350> to<00:06:28.620> it<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:29.360> with<00:06:30.360> that<00:06:30.510> bottle
