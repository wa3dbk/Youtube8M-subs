applications<00:01:06.780> directly<00:01:07.170> from<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.710> app<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
applications directly from this app the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.219 
applications directly from this app the
attorney<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.180> alright<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.110> then

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
attorney on that alright and then

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.859 
attorney on that alright and then
charging<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.850> basically<00:01:12.180> records<00:01:12.689> every

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
charging it basically records every

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.359 
charging it basically records every
single<00:01:13.140> time<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.320> charge<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.040> guess<00:01:14.189> that's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
single time you charge so I guess that's

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
single time you charge so I guess that's
an<00:01:14.490> interesting<00:01:14.939> thing<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> look<00:01:15.299> at<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.749 
course we got junk I can easily scan for
junk<00:01:39.540> files<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.079> delete<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.310> go<00:01:41.490> or

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
junk files and delete them on the go or

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.270 
junk files and delete them on the go or
right<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:43.200> finally<00:01:43.619> we<00:01:43.740> got<00:01:43.829> memory

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
right now then finally we got memory

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880 
right now then finally we got memory
boostin<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:44.970> slower<00:01:45.299> iPhones<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.229> iPads<00:01:46.350> or

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
boostin for slower iPhones or iPads or

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.060 
boostin for slower iPhones or iPads or
whatnot<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.880> very<00:01:48.450> useful<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.619> did<00:01:49.829> speed

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
whatnot this is very useful it did speed

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.469 
whatnot this is very useful it did speed
up<00:01:50.189> my<00:01:50.310> device<00:01:50.549> quite<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.880> bit<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.329> did

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
up my device quite a bit and it did

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.749 
up my device quite a bit and it did
close<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.320> those<00:01:52.530> useless<00:01:52.890> junk<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
close out all those useless junk that I
