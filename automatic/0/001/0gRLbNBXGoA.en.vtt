00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
got door these are previously wrapped in

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.439 
got door these are previously wrapped in
potato<00:04:21.699> very<00:04:22.330> thinly<00:04:22.690> sliced<00:04:23.020> potato

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.030 

all<00:04:27.449> right<00:04:27.600> we<00:04:27.750> got<00:04:27.900> both<00:04:28.080> those<00:04:28.259> in<00:04:28.410> there<00:04:28.560> now

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
all right we got both those in there now

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.219 
all right we got both those in there now
we're<00:04:29.160> gonna<00:04:29.280> cook<00:04:29.520> them<00:04:29.639> until<00:04:29.820> they're

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
we're gonna cook them until they're

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.629 
we're gonna cook them until they're
golden<00:04:31.229> until<00:04:31.919> they're<00:04:32.040> golden<00:04:32.340> brown<00:04:32.370> on

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
golden until they're golden brown on

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.460 
golden until they're golden brown on
that<00:04:32.669> side<00:04:33.000> until<00:04:33.210> we're<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.419> football<00:04:33.840> and

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
that side until we're a football and

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.909 
that side until we're a football and
hopefully<00:04:35.039> we're<00:04:35.250> not<00:04:35.280> going<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.520> break

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
hopefully we're not going to break

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.189 
hopefully we're not going to break
so<00:04:37.430> they're<00:04:37.999> fully<00:04:38.240> brown<00:04:38.509> on<00:04:38.629> one<00:04:38.659> side<00:04:38.810> and

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
so they're fully brown on one side and

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.749 
so they're fully brown on one side and
they<00:04:39.259> took<00:04:39.439> about<00:04:39.710> probably<00:04:40.310> about<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.490> minute

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
they took about probably about a minute

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.850 
they took about probably about a minute
or<00:04:40.969> so<00:04:41.210> now<00:04:42.050> we're<00:04:42.169> gonna<00:04:42.259> flip<00:04:42.439> it<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:42.710> make

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
or so now we're gonna flip it and make

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.779 
or so now we're gonna flip it and make
sure<00:04:42.889> you're<00:04:43.129> flipping<00:04:43.400> it<00:04:43.460> away<00:04:43.610> from

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
sure you're flipping it away from

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.420 
sure you're flipping it away from
yourself<00:04:43.909> so<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.330> don't<00:04:44.509> burn<00:04:44.689> yourself<00:04:45.430> very

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
yourself so you don't burn yourself very

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.010 
yourself so you don't burn yourself very
very<00:04:46.669> carefully<00:04:47.090> because<00:04:47.210> this<00:04:47.389> can't<00:04:47.810> fall

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
very carefully because this can't fall

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.350 
very carefully because this can't fall
apart<00:04:48.110> easy<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:49.159> if<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:49.460> sticks<00:04:49.939> to<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.120> bottom

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
apart easy so if it sticks to the bottom

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.439 
apart easy so if it sticks to the bottom
of<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:50.719> pan<00:04:50.990> don't<00:04:52.539> try<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:53.569> assembly<00:04:55.449> right

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449
