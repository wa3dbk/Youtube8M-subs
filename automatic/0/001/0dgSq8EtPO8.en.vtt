temperature<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.610> want<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:18.420> had<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.019> set

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
temperature that you want I had this set

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.140 
temperature that you want I had this set
on<00:03:19.379> auto<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.370> determines<00:03:20.640> where<00:03:21.060> it

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
on auto so it just determines where it

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.690 
on auto so it just determines where it
wants<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.420> go<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.680> right<00:03:22.920> now<00:03:23.069> it's<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.400> to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
wants to go so right now it's going to

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.350 
wants to go so right now it's going to
the<00:03:23.879> floor<00:03:24.150> mostly<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.980> floor<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.340> coldest

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.800 

up<00:03:29.900> here<00:03:30.170> would<00:03:30.470> be<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.970> navigation<00:03:31.970> system<00:03:32.000> so

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
up here would be a navigation system so

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.540 
up here would be a navigation system so
the<00:03:33.110> one<00:03:33.260> thing<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.680> car<00:03:33.890> doesn't<00:03:34.250> have<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.520> a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
the one thing this car doesn't have is a

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.030 
the one thing this car doesn't have is a
navigation<00:03:34.850> system

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.180 

it<00:03:41.519> has<00:03:41.670> Homelink<00:03:42.360> my<00:03:43.200> Impala<00:03:43.530> had<00:03:43.739> Homelink

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
it has Homelink my Impala had Homelink

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.020 
it has Homelink my Impala had Homelink
I've<00:03:44.340> never<00:03:44.519> really<00:03:44.790> used<00:03:44.819> it<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.860> it's<00:03:47.849> got

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
I've never really used it and it's got

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.789 
I've never really used it and it's got
the<00:03:48.150> same<00:03:48.330> thing<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.690> my<00:03:48.840> pal<00:03:49.110> has<00:03:49.349> as<00:03:49.590> well

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
the same thing that my pal has as well

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.550 
the same thing that my pal has as well
it's<00:03:50.099> got<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.459> compass<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.019> also<00:03:52.200> has<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
it's got the compass and it also has the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.050 
it's got the compass and it also has the
mile<00:03:52.680> per<00:03:52.830> gallon<00:03:52.860> gauge<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.549> unfortunately

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
mile per gallon gauge but unfortunately

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.180 
mile per gallon gauge but unfortunately
that<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.200> cluster<00:03:55.409> which<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:56.010> don't

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that is in the cluster which I don't

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.890 
that is in the cluster which I don't
like<00:03:56.870> in<00:03:57.870> Japan<00:03:58.709> there<00:03:59.160> was<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.480> oil<00:04:00.480> pressure

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
like in Japan there was a oil pressure

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.520 
like in Japan there was a oil pressure
gauge<00:04:01.290> there<00:04:02.010> I'd<00:04:02.370> rather<00:04:02.549> have<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.959> there

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.890 

and<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.160> still<00:04:07.400> has<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.550> factory<00:04:07.820> speakers<00:04:08.570> I

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
and it still has the factory speakers I

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.189 
and it still has the factory speakers I
really<00:04:09.440> like<00:04:09.650> them

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:23.379 

onto<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.289> backs

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:30.189 

room<00:04:24.229> is<00:04:24.409> okay<00:04:27.249> but<00:04:28.249> you<00:04:28.639> know<00:04:29.509> I<00:04:29.659> sat<00:04:29.780> back

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
room is okay but you know I sat back

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.700 
room is okay but you know I sat back
there<00:04:30.349> it's<00:04:30.439> actually<00:04:30.590> pretty<00:04:30.919> comfortable

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
there it's actually pretty comfortable

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.429 
there it's actually pretty comfortable
with<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.949> being<00:04:34.159> the<00:04:34.400> wagon<00:04:34.969> we<00:04:38.439> can't

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:39.439 
with this being the wagon we can't

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.989 
with this being the wagon we can't
really<00:04:39.590> see<00:04:39.919> it<00:04:40.039> but<00:04:40.249> there's<00:04:40.490> actually<00:04:40.699> a

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:40.999 
really see it but there's actually a

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:42.879 
really see it but there's actually a
speaker<00:04:41.509> right<00:04:41.779> there<00:04:42.110> it's<00:04:42.439> a<00:04:42.499> factory

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
speaker right there it's a factory

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.950 
speaker right there it's a factory
subwoofer<00:04:43.389> that's<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.539> difference<00:04:44.900> between

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
subwoofer that's the difference between

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.529 
subwoofer that's the difference between
the<00:04:45.319> sedan<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:45.979> wagon<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:46.699> the<00:04:46.999> wagon<00:04:47.389> has

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
the sedan and the wagon is the wagon has

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.239 
the sedan and the wagon is the wagon has
a<00:04:47.569> nine<00:04:47.870> speaker<00:04:48.349> right<00:04:48.620> here<00:04:48.729> is<00:04:50.199> a<00:04:51.249> hidden

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:52.249 
a nine speaker right here is a hidden

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.360 
a nine speaker right here is a hidden
floor<00:04:52.729> which<00:04:53.409> I'll<00:04:54.409> show<00:04:54.710> in<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.919> later<00:04:55.069> video

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
floor which I'll show in a later video

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.610 
floor which I'll show in a later video
and<00:04:55.699> we<00:04:55.759> have<00:04:55.879> better<00:04:56.090> light<00:04:56.449> IVA<00:04:57.409> tonneau

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
and we have better light IVA tonneau

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.629 
and we have better light IVA tonneau
cover<00:04:57.979> which<00:04:58.599> I<00:04:59.599> fixed<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.289> was<00:05:01.189> a<00:05:01.219> screw<00:05:01.520> that

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
cover which I fixed it was a screw that

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.159 
cover which I fixed it was a screw that
fell<00:05:01.819> out<00:05:01.849> here<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.330> I<00:05:02.389> replaced<00:05:02.779> it

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
fell out here and I replaced it

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.890 
fell out here and I replaced it
this<00:05:03.949> was<00:05:04.189> also<00:05:04.400> missing<00:05:04.879> up<00:05:05.029> top<00:05:05.270> here<00:05:05.750> I

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
this was also missing up top here I

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.939 
this was also missing up top here I
replaced<00:05:06.439> that<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:10.120> have<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.330> HESI<00:05:12.169> pairs<00:05:12.560> uh

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
replaced that I have the HESI pairs uh

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.659 
replaced that I have the HESI pairs uh
which<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.550> like<00:05:14.710> now<00:05:15.710> one<00:05:15.919> thing<00:05:16.129> I<00:05:16.279> didn't<00:05:16.550> talk
