00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:13.589
 and eye 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.470
 to me 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.650
 would do that I said that the paper does not 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.650
 eat 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.120
 I can not allow texts to be recited 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.000
 satanic in the sanctity of my table net 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.020
 arise the wise men belong to the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.200
 Christianity 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.200
 then agree it's more this 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.540
 so better anyway for 1 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.540
 minute 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.540
 Y 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.039
 but we did it with TV 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.840
 patience 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.909
 mariah we do not have money for acid 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.909
 sulfuric 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.830
 7 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.830
 you have the night 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.400
 decomposes 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:53.320
 I would be holy you did not like it 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:56.030
 it's also the cross age was before that 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.950
 I have been spearing 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.580
 as if you're going to give them a chess set to 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.580
 the kids know they do not like to think 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 that 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.519
 gave away 10 golden butterflies my house is 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.379
 infested with them and why he did not let me 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.690
 are the next two sure that that 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.650
 gift like 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.650
 this is worth 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.230
 Thank you 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.530
 do you want a Serbian street or the gift 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.530
 perfect 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.260
 here 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.760
 today 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.560
 of the artist 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.400
 to my friend 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.400
 to me 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.930
 you had 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:22.050
 to these channels 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
 Y 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.160
 the bonds are also nuclear bombs 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.860
 gender 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.010
 Moving on we will improve 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.330
 opportunities to georg nobody thinks from 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.130
 creations shirt left with the 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.450
 verification of forms and that is counted 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.019
 what you see that is being a bit 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.030
 We were stingy and we could have a night of 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.680
 rampant sex in addition to buying 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.750
 a thing of filters 267 meters 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.340
 Rope waiting for him was totally naked 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.180
 we could throw in excess because it can 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.650
 do everything you want 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.140
 involves constant whip that I will have 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.140
 placed will be a night 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:41.490
 Bible 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.610
 it becomes a black 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.780
 the valve vowel for the way you should 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.780
 do that with the carols 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.289
 without moment with this scene the option of 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.419
 to gain the prominence I deserve that you 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.529
 do you think you're delaying the 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.729
 site that corresponds to me 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:08.729
 shut up rudolf not how dare you 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.470
 I'm already because always command would be 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.780
 acquired evident 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.400
 3 are the fundamental equations in the 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.130
 physics and doctrine that describe the 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.690
 phenomenon of universal gravitation the 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.040
 first affirms that the force 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.020
 gravitational between two bodies is 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.850
 proportional to the product of its masses and 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.520
 inversely proportional to the square of 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.260
 its distance the second the potential 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.730
 gravitational of a certain point is 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.440
 equal to the mass multiplied by the 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.710
 subtraction I started and divided by the distance 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.830
 r 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.650
 and the third one is finally the call 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.510
 equation of position you have understood 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.970
 all right 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.250
 but when you have understood him 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.870
 I'll stop talking until that happens 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.060
 being for me a being unable to say 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:57.050
 a sentence worthy of being heard 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.050
 a moment only convinces me if you shut up 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.889
 do not worry, pink was going to fix the 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:08.120
 battering that has caused yellow 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:15.430
 it's the war what rural people say 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:15.430
 but happy christmas 2013
