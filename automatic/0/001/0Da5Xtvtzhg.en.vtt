00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello very good everyone I'm credit what 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.839
 such are you I hope you are very well and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.910
 well we are in a new video this time 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.820
 I'm going to teach how to get out of raid with the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.440
 clichÃ© I'm there to get out of a big 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.120
 number of maps 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.180
 first you will need the game mode 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 if it is that already if you do not have it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.550
 good 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.350
 I'll leave it here in an annotation and in the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 description the video where he taught 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.490
 put the game world and touch the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.699
 adjustments to be able to continue note all the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.699
 maps 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.090
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.180
 good to let go a little bit 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.350
 bots without killing any clear because if 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.480
 we kill some 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.480
 the bichi does not work and we have to start 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.760
 again and good for here comes another 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.989
 well there it stays so then a 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.570
 simple the flag we have team of 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.760
 mercenaries or fb and whatever and 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.480
 reappears we have the flag and we go 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.100
 running to the place where we want 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.760
 leave it so that the bots are there as 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.659
 is what they do when you can take the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.390
 flag is not good like that with dreams 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.000
 Up there 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.200
 is the gray that is in this game I go 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 to place here 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.600
 Team changes as we teach 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.280
 any class and we go to the area where 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.830
 we have to follow them 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.520
 let's go to this area corresponds to search 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.610
 instructed by team is answered here from 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.860
 raid this area that you see here on the map 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.310
 and we put here this area where 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.580
 we are looking a little bit up 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.900
 we give to change equipment 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.320
 fbi cojemos class does not reappear 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.560

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.580

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.200
 from team to efe we take him class and now 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.360
 when we have to reappear there are three 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.250
 times so now we offer and 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.380
