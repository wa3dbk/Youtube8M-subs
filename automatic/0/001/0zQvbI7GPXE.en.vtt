00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.860
 with this to make videos I do not name them 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.469
 because there are several of them which gives me a lot 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.870
 taste, you know, I'm a procrastinator 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.079
 what else am I recording videos 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
 and Well let's start with my 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.620
 favorites 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.739
 well one of my super favorites 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.440
 of psuv is that this is an enamel to me 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.239
 I really like to buy these sizes that 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 are the little ones there are also bigger 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.390
 of he did but I like these 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.879
 because they deserve more practical I like 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.339
 You know, I do not paint my nails a lot 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.110
 then sometimes I get to dry and so 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.170
 dry positions let's say I do not 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.990
 they hurt so much this color I love 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:18.000
 I always buy it I say it today and then 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.490
 I have it is the 026 East salmon I 've 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.950
 already asked to go to put and this is already 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.500
 will tell of these I want to try 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.679
 some treatments and the dryer because 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.600
 I've heard they're pretty good like that 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:34.380
 that's good, I'm just going to try them 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.320
 but I'll already be telling you another one of my 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.200
 favorites and beezus are 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.240
 and these two labials are all 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.300
 lipsticks say let's say they're the same 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.520
 they do not have lines but from my very 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.850
 humble point of view these two are 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.510
 mates this is orange and this is a plus 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.510
 to this is the 130 this is 36 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.890
 This is going to be the dream of this 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.330
 is the 130 this is the one that I bring in the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:10.259
 lips to me I love this color 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.520
 and this is the 36 that you already know super 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.060
 hot is super strong 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.880
 and to me the reason why I like it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.330
 these two colors is because I feel that 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.420
 last quite good on the lips and the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.420
 colors are very nice there is another one of these 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.070
 that I love that is tone 46 not what 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.380
 I have here because I have it in house 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.550
 my parents but it's also a very 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.340
 nice it's like for me these shades that 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.170
 you put them on and you look makeup but 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.200
 without looking so flashy because that's good 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.240
 yes they are super flashy 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.480
 another one of my super visu favorites is 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.680
 this quartet and it's number 17 I 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.650
 love I love I love this is the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.170
 only quartet and I think it's the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.120
 few shadows that I have finished 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.070
 always always at the beginning always what 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.010
 I bought because I liked it, it was already 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.290
 I had here I finished it 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.599
 twice and I'll buy it again 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.819
 love the colors are super cute 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.860
 with this is perfect to make a look 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.920
 I really like full tones 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.269
 neutral but I like them to be 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.819
 Different from each other 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.099
 I do not like that they are so alike 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.159
 already made them a look with this 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.230
 palette is going to be a daily look I hope in 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.659
 soon this video also another of my 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.819
 favorites are the brushes here I'm missing 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.189
 in all of the ones I like the most but 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.010
 I have them in my parents' house 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:42.140
 and good are others that are for 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.299
 shadows that you know themselves I apply and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.700
 diffuses and good of which I have here 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.150
 is double fiber I like how you see 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.989
 right now I used it with the blush I like 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.329
 quite this is number one this is me 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.450
 love I love I love this is the 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:03.769
 number 20 right now use it for the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.500
 eyebrows is a square flat and I like it 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.510
 the thickness to seal the outline and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.180
 other 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.439
 that he used a lot is this this is the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.959
 number 7 that this is angular and this one the 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.910
 use mainly for the contour and what 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.270
 What I like about this brush is that it is 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.400
 precise but at the same time it helps me 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.710
 they blurring made the outline that 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.070
 I do not even think it's discreet according to 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.080
 giovanna I did with this brochita other 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.130
 of my favorite products is this that 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.900
 is the visu mascara is very good for the 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.389
 Beach 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.550
 for the beach to the pool very 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.900
 a day that I do not want to be lowered 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.940
 eyelashes shape of the world this this is not 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.360
 works lashes to all those that 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.669
 say there are all the masks of 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.729
 eyelashes they lower them this I can them 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.130
 ensure that they are not long and 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.740
 long there is not much volume but the 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.310
 long and good now we go with the 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.490
 star of my jewelery collection and 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.560
 obviously this one is I love in 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.050
 these color palettes of my land 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.330
 here I have four more missing the one of puebla 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.750
 if I have it but this one that I am my 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.480
 part 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.850
 I can tell you that I love them I like it 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.670
 a lot that bring shades that bring 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.800
 blushes the chocolates I like those of 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.320
 visu but I use more those that come in 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.380
 these palettes the colors that come in 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.710
 these palettes the best ones themselves have to 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.320
 selling as singles and shadows 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.550
 they are also from the individual shadows 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.620
 that the legend tells that the works 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.170
 individual and comment better than 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.820
