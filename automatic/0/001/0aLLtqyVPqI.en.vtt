00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
even though the program itself is more

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.709 
even though the program itself is more
complicated<00:06:29.860> to<00:06:30.159> use<00:06:30.190> and<00:06:30.580> the<00:06:30.639> other<00:06:30.729> one<00:06:30.909> go

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
complicated to use and the other one go

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:43.200 
complicated to use and the other one go
figure<00:06:32.009> go<00:06:33.009> figure<00:06:33.340> and<00:06:41.639> ok<00:06:42.639> if<00:06:42.849> you<00:06:43.000> know

going to be okay so this it's been a

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.219 
going to be okay so this it's been a
little<00:06:48.819> bit<00:06:48.909> of<00:06:49.029> an<00:06:49.210> update<00:06:49.360> just<00:06:49.839> a<00:06:49.960> really

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229
