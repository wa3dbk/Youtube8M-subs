00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.380
 good people good people and welcome to 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.460
 one of the first chapters of 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.460
 tutorial I'm going to do 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.980
 to teach to make you all here 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.660
 we are in another world this world level 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.850
 I have my house my house my sheep 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.720
 in sugar cane some explosions that 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.660
 they have made the clippers and I have now in 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.930
 this tutorial I will teach how to do 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.540
 scissors and buckets and what are they for? 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.340
 one to the new ones 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.240
 the first thing to see 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.240
 we are to the iron that I'm going to get this 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.230
 and now yes 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.609
 let's go to a fretting table 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 to make the scissors you have to put two 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.760
 in iron drop in this form and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.000
 we take out the scissors 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.890
 and to be a bucket 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.430
 you have to put it iron ingot in 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.420
 this form 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.890
 and we take out a bucket 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.680
 bout 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.860
 for the new ones you will not know what this does 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.860
 but the bucket first leaves you 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.240
 and that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 uff 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.990
 water without gravity without gravity beam 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.080
 there 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.900
 with the bucket 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.980
 you can take the light out of the water and put it 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.010
 in 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.070
 to any side 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.020
 I hate anger without gravity 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.940
 already 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 and here and there we have nothing left 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.610
 and the scissors is to get more wool from 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.510
 the sheep because when you kill them 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.860
 I'm going to give you an example 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.380
 and do not run away and want to escape to 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.630
 the treacherous sheep 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.470
 as an example and this is going to be my 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.560
 victims get ready get ready get ready 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:16.760
 As you can see, he only takes out one wool but with the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.650
 cupper with scissors 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.159
 we click right and take out 3 wool 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.770
 the peeled ones but when I eat to see if 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.950
 eat 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.629
 when you eat grass 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.629
 no wheat pasture 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.390
 they do not eat weird to see if we put another 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.390
 friend 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.760
 but when they eat grass I started like that 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.260
 yes when they eat they will return their wool 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.579
 there they saw people wool 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.159
 and this has been a short tutorial just 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.010
 I wanted to explain why what they are 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.650
 the scissors how they were made and also the 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.970
 bucket and how it was made and also another 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.709
 thing the bucket can also serve for 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.500
 collect lava if they want to take a 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:21.489
 side by side they can grab it with the 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.489
 bucket just like water take it and 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.190
 initial or anywhere but this continues 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.310
 very dangerous lava is not a game 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.250
 after that maddie theme of how that 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.490
 when you drop all the objects the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.990
 lava destroys it is depending on which 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.780
 objects be because there are some more 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.940
 resistant as the diamond we think 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.480
 that iron too 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.110
 go this has been my this been my first 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.790
 very short video and I was not doing 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.939

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.910
