hey<00:00:42.820> guys<00:00:43.059> I'm<00:00:43.390> going<00:00:43.660> to<00:00:43.690> teaching<00:00:44.260> you<00:00:44.559> how

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
hey guys I'm going to teaching you how

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.939 
hey guys I'm going to teaching you how
to<00:00:45.219> do<00:00:45.399> a<00:00:45.550> back<00:00:45.789> tuck<00:00:45.969> on<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.600> trampoline<00:00:47.140> now

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
to do a back tuck on the trampoline now

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.099 
to do a back tuck on the trampoline now
I<00:00:47.979> know<00:00:48.280> most<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.850> you<00:00:49.000> probably<00:00:49.210> don't<00:00:49.839> have<00:00:49.989> a

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
I know most of you probably don't have a

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.290 
I know most of you probably don't have a
trampoline<00:00:50.530> but<00:00:51.280> that's<00:00:51.460> okay<00:00:51.820> because<00:00:52.000> the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
trampoline but that's okay because the

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.750 
trampoline but that's okay because the
steps<00:00:52.570> are<00:00:52.809> exactly<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.500> same<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.549> ground

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
steps are exactly the same on the ground

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.579 
steps are exactly the same on the ground
as<00:00:54.940> they<00:00:55.269> are<00:00:55.390> on<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.659> trampoline<00:00:56.260> but<00:00:56.289> you're

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
as they are on the trampoline but you're

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.810 
as they are on the trampoline but you're
just<00:00:56.739> not<00:00:56.860> going<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.369> jump<00:00:57.579> in<00:00:57.729> the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
just not going to do the jump in the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.609 
just not going to do the jump in the
beginning<00:00:58.089> but<00:00:58.989> if<00:00:59.049> you're<00:00:59.170> doing<00:00:59.289> it<00:00:59.500> on<00:00:59.589> the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
beginning but if you're doing it on the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.020 
beginning but if you're doing it on the
grass<00:00:59.920> you're<00:01:00.219> most<00:01:00.430> likely<00:01:00.640> going<00:01:00.909> to<00:01:00.969> want

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
grass you're most likely going to want

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.329 
grass you're most likely going to want
to<00:01:01.239> have<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.449> spot<00:01:01.930> because<00:01:02.680> you<00:01:03.010> might<00:01:03.159> not

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
to have a spot because you might not

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:04.529 
to have a spot because you might not
feel<00:01:03.489> comfortable<00:01:03.549> but<00:01:04.180> if<00:01:04.269> you<00:01:04.330> feel

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
feel comfortable but if you feel

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.420 
feel comfortable but if you feel
comfortable<00:01:05.019> go<00:01:05.680> ahead<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.070> try<00:01:06.190> it<00:01:06.250> by

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
comfortable go ahead and try it by

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.880 
comfortable go ahead and try it by
yourself<00:01:08.009> so<00:01:09.009> let's<00:01:09.520> just<00:01:09.759> get<00:01:09.880> right<00:01:10.060> into<00:01:10.119> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
yourself so let's just get right into it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.040 
yourself so let's just get right into it
for<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.920> back<00:01:12.250> tough<00:01:12.610> one<00:01:13.390> school<00:01:13.750> you're<00:01:13.899> going

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
for a back tough one school you're going

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.450 
for a back tough one school you're going
to<00:01:14.140> want<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.500> your<00:01:14.649> back<00:01:14.770> handspring<00:01:17.460> you're

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
to want is your back handspring you're

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.800 
to want is your back handspring you're
going<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.670> let<00:01:18.819> it<00:01:18.850> consistent<00:01:19.569> on<00:01:19.690> the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
going to let it consistent on the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.169 
going to let it consistent on the
trampoline<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:21.340> would<00:01:21.490> really<00:01:21.729> help<00:01:22.000> if

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
trampoline and it would really help if

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.020 
trampoline and it would really help if
you<00:01:22.240> had<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.479> consistent<00:01:23.080> on<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.289> grass<00:01:23.530> also

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you had a consistent on the grass also

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.660 
you had a consistent on the grass also
so<00:01:25.030> first<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.470> want<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.740> stretch<00:01:27.039> because<00:01:27.520> you

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
so first you want to stretch because you

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.950 
so first you want to stretch because you
don't<00:01:27.909> want<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.119> pull<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.299> muscle<00:01:28.509> or<00:01:28.780> hurt

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
don't want to pull a muscle or hurt

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.350 
don't want to pull a muscle or hurt
anything<00:01:29.289> so<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> couple<00:01:30.670> simple<00:01:30.880> stretches

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
anything so a couple simple stretches

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.949 
anything so a couple simple stretches
you<00:01:31.450> can<00:01:31.509> do<00:01:31.780> are<00:01:32.110> an<00:01:32.649> overshadow<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:36.959> regular

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
you can do are an overshadow a regular

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.330 
you can do are an overshadow a regular
straddle<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:38.799> stretch<00:01:38.979> through<00:01:39.310> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
straddle and just stretch through the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.570 
straddle and just stretch through the
sides<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.259> middle<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:42.250> make<00:01:42.369> sure<00:01:42.489> to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
sides in the middle and make sure to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.580 
sides in the middle and make sure to
hold<00:01:42.759> them<00:01:42.879> for<00:01:43.030> at<00:01:43.119> least<00:01:43.209> 15<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.810> 30<00:01:44.020> seconds

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
hold them for at least 15 to 30 seconds

00:01:44.590 --> 00:02:00.219 
hold them for at least 15 to 30 seconds
and<00:01:45.300> then<00:01:46.300> your<00:01:46.509> splits<00:01:47.459> both<00:01:48.459> sides

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.709 

so<00:02:00.799> it's<00:02:01.340> really<00:02:01.850> important<00:02:02.329> to<00:02:02.420> have<00:02:02.509> strong

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
so it's really important to have strong

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.440 
so it's really important to have strong
app<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.469> be<00:02:03.590> able<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.860> give<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.039> back<00:02:04.219> to<00:02:04.490> because

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
app to be able to give a back to because

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.660 
app to be able to give a back to because
you<00:02:05.600> need<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.930> really<00:02:06.170> pull<00:02:07.100> your<00:02:07.310> knees<00:02:07.490> in

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
you need to really pull your knees in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.969 
you need to really pull your knees in
quick<00:02:07.969> or<00:02:08.300> you're<00:02:09.170> not<00:02:09.349> going<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.619> be<00:02:09.709> able<00:02:09.800> to

quick or you're not going to be able to
flip<00:02:10.129> over<00:02:10.369> quick<00:02:10.789> or<00:02:11.060> you're<00:02:11.569> not<00:02:11.690> even<00:02:11.989> going

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140 
flip over quick or you're not even going
to<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.319> able<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.620> flip<00:02:12.769> over<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.400> I'm<00:02:13.879> going<00:02:14.090> to

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
arms if you won't rotate quick enough so

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.180 
arms if you won't rotate quick enough so
that's<00:03:27.019> really<00:03:27.410> important<00:03:27.859> to<00:03:27.889> throw<00:03:28.100> your

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
that's really important to throw your

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.490 
that's really important to throw your
arms<00:03:28.459> up<00:03:28.639> and<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.569> get<00:03:29.720> used<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.380> can

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
arms up and to get used to that you can

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.750 
arms up and to get used to that you can
either<00:03:30.590> do<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:30.799> really<00:03:31.190> aggressive<00:03:31.400> back

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
either do a really aggressive back

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.720 
either do a really aggressive back
handspring<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:36.190> or<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.459> could<00:03:37.579> do<00:03:37.700> a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
handspring like this or you could do a

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.990 
handspring like this or you could do a
back<00:03:37.970> layout<00:03:38.500> which<00:03:39.500> i<00:03:39.680> think<00:03:39.739> is<00:03:40.069> much<00:03:40.370> easier

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
back layout which i think is much easier

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.509 
back layout which i think is much easier
to<00:03:41.030> do<00:03:41.329> then<00:03:41.739> back<00:03:42.739> tuck<00:03:43.040> because<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.340> don't

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
to do then back tuck because you don't

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.220 
to do then back tuck because you don't
need<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.670> worry<00:03:43.849> about<00:03:43.880> your<00:03:44.239> knees<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:45.139> if

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
they can catch their body so they don't

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
they can catch their body so they don't
over<00:06:17.000> rotate<00:06:17.390> or<00:06:17.570> under<00:06:17.870> rotate<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:19.610> one<00:06:20.390> more

over rotate or under rotate and one more

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.810 
over rotate or under rotate and one more
thing<00:06:20.750> before<00:06:20.780> I<00:06:21.170> do<00:06:21.290> the<00:06:21.530> top<00:06:21.740> you<00:06:22.520> do<00:06:22.640> not

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820

handspring you want to flip upwards

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.440
