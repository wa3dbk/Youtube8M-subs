00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the first thing you want to do is you

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.230 
the first thing you want to do is you
want<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.950> wet<00:00:11.160> out<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> filter<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.150> we're

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
want to wet out the filter so we're

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240 
want to wet out the filter so we're
gonna<00:00:12.360> wet<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.570> filter<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.259> we're<00:00:13.710> gonna<00:00:13.830> pre

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
gonna wet the filter and we're gonna pre

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.279 
gonna wet the filter and we're gonna pre
warm<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.630> device

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
warm the device

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.970 
warm the device
now<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.490> Chemex<00:00:18.420> takes<00:00:18.660> about<00:00:18.869> 400<00:00:19.619> mils<00:00:19.800> of

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
now this Chemex takes about 400 mils of

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.630 
now this Chemex takes about 400 mils of
water<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.910> I've<00:00:21.029> got<00:00:21.300> 24<00:00:22.050> grams<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.100> coffee<00:00:23.310> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
water so I've got 24 grams of coffee and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.450 
water so I've got 24 grams of coffee and
that<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:24.510> roughly<00:00:24.930> 6<00:00:25.170> grams<00:00:25.439> per<00:00:25.650> 100<00:00:25.769> we're

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
that is roughly 6 grams per 100 we're

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.980 
that is roughly 6 grams per 100 we're
going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> put<00:00:26.820> our<00:00:26.939> coffee<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> filter

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
going to put our coffee in the filter

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.419 
going to put our coffee in the filter
and<00:00:28.349> we'll<00:00:28.769> give<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.980> bit<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> shake<00:00:29.400> so

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and we'll give it a bit of a shake so

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.659 
and we'll give it a bit of a shake so
it's<00:00:29.730> level<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:31.219> the<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.550> we've<00:00:32.640> done

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it's level and the way that we've done

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.299 
it's level and the way that we've done
this<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.930> either<00:00:34.170> way<00:00:34.649> your<00:00:34.980> device

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
this one you can either way your device

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.250 
this one you can either way your device
as<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.660> weigh<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.079> your

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
as you go or you can weigh out your

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.900 
as you go or you can weigh out your
water<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.070> want<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> try<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
water you really want to try and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180 
water you really want to try and
maintain<00:00:39.090> accurate<00:00:40.020> levels<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.649> water<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
maintain accurate levels of water to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920 
maintain accurate levels of water to
coffee<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.270> thing<00:00:42.450> we're<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> do

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
coffee the first thing we're going to do

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.200 
coffee the first thing we're going to do
is<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.710> need<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> bloom<00:00:44.309> our<00:00:44.579> coffee

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
is we need to bloom our coffee

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.900 
is we need to bloom our coffee
now<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.780> blooming<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.770> blooming<00:00:47.430> allows

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
now what blooming is is blooming allows

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.450 
now what blooming is is blooming allows
the<00:00:48.780> carbon<00:00:49.230> dioxide<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> develops<00:00:50.309> in

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the carbon dioxide that develops in

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
the carbon dioxide that develops in
beans<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> roast<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.079> escape<00:00:52.379> carbon

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
beans when you roast it to escape carbon

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.090 
beans when you roast it to escape carbon
dioxide<00:00:53.699> forces<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> water<00:00:54.780> away<00:00:55.020> from<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
dioxide forces the water away from the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.700 
dioxide forces the water away from the
coffee<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.760> doesn't<00:00:57.539> allow<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.140> actually

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
coffee and doesn't allow it to actually

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.740 
coffee and doesn't allow it to actually
brew<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.309> you'll<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.609> very<00:00:59.750> inconsistent

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
brew so you'll get very inconsistent

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.510 
brew so you'll get very inconsistent
brewing<00:01:01.050> results<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> don't<00:01:02.010> bloom<00:01:02.309> your

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
brewing results if you don't bloom your

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880 
brewing results if you don't bloom your
coffee<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.329> all<00:01:03.570> you're<00:01:03.780> aiming<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
coffee so all you're aiming to do is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.100 
coffee so all you're aiming to do is
just<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> completely<00:01:05.760> saturate<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.630> grinds

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
just to completely saturate the grinds

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
just to completely saturate the grinds
and<00:01:07.229> once<00:01:07.740> we've<00:01:07.920> done<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and once we've done that we're going to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.590 
and once we've done that we're going to
fill<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> cone<00:01:09.869> without<00:01:10.200> water<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.890> good

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
fill up the cone without water a good

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
fill up the cone without water a good
idea<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:12.990> try<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> circular

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
idea is to try and have a circular

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
idea is to try and have a circular
pouring<00:01:15.060> motion<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:16.229> moves<00:01:16.500> from<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
pouring motion that moves from the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.130 
pouring motion that moves from the
inside<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> outside<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.810> want<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
inside to the outside you want to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.230 
inside to the outside you want to
attract<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.220> avoid<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> way<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
attract I and avoid going all the way to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
attract I and avoid going all the way to
the<00:01:21.420> outside<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.500> create

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the outside because it can create

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.070 
the outside because it can create
channeling<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> reason<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.810> want

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
channeling but the reason that you want

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.499 
channeling but the reason that you want
to<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.799> circular<00:01:26.580> motion<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> creates

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
to have a circular motion is it creates

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.929 
to have a circular motion is it creates
some<00:01:27.750> turbulence<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.920> make<00:01:29.189> sure<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.729> wet

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
some turbulence that make sure you wet

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
some turbulence that make sure you wet
out<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> those<00:01:30.630> grinds<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.770> you're

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
out all of those grinds so you're

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.219 
out all of those grinds so you're
looking<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.490> dome<00:01:32.790> shape<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.200> your

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
looking for a dome shape in your in your

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.859 
looking for a dome shape in your in your
grinds<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.340> finishes<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.299> roughly

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
grinds as it finishes that roughly

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.990 
grinds as it finishes that roughly
matches<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> shape<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.220> filter<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
matches the shape of the filter so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.700 
matches the shape of the filter so
obviously<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.479> quite<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> steep<00:01:40.200> cone<00:01:40.500> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
obviously this is quite a steep cone so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.639 
obviously this is quite a steep cone so
you<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:40.950> want<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.720> more<00:01:42.720> domed<00:01:43.110> finish

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you would want a more domed finish

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.889 
you would want a more domed finish
something<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> siphon<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.420> has<00:01:45.630> quite<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
something like a siphon that has quite a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.530 
something like a siphon that has quite a
flat<00:01:46.229> one<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.530> want<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> much<00:01:47.040> flatter<00:01:47.490> dome<00:01:48.299> on

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
flat one you want a much flatter dome on

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.080 
flat one you want a much flatter dome on
the<00:01:48.570> finish<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.530> stirring<00:01:50.130> process<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.850> end

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the finish that stirring process to end

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.460 
the finish that stirring process to end
is<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.810> those<00:01:51.960> grinds
