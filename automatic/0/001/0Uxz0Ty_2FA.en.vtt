00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.890 

a<00:03:13.230> digital<00:03:13.830> source<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:15.110> 1/2<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:18.420> one<00:03:18.720> is

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
a digital source of 1/2 and this one is

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.110 
a digital source of 1/2 and this one is
just<00:03:19.050> moving<00:03:19.350> underneath<00:03:19.860> again<00:03:20.700> whenever

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
just moving underneath again whenever

two ways of which can expand some books
see<00:04:09.540> after<00:04:10.440> you've<00:04:10.620> got<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.920> basic<00:04:10.950> three

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
see after you've got the basic three

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.260 
see after you've got the basic three
throws<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:13.580> three<00:04:14.580> throws<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.060> three

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
captures you should then move on to say

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.160 
captures you should then move on to say
four<00:04:18.660> or<00:04:18.690> five<00:04:19.020> balls<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.620> seven<00:04:19.980> and<00:04:20.160> ten<00:04:20.370> but

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
four or five balls and seven and ten but

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.690 
four or five balls and seven and ten but
personally<00:04:22.170> I<00:04:22.200> think<00:04:22.380> that's<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:23.070> rather

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
personally I think that's a rather

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.370 
personally I think that's a rather
boredom<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.780> doesn't<00:04:24.990> help

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
boredom it doesn't help

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.430 
boredom it doesn't help
that's<00:04:25.620> only<00:04:25.830> my<00:04:26.370> opinion<00:04:27.030> I'm<00:04:27.660> sure<00:04:27.870> I'm<00:04:28.380> sure

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
that's only my opinion I'm sure I'm sure

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.180 
that's only my opinion I'm sure I'm sure
it<00:04:28.740> works

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
it works

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.300 
it works
but<00:04:29.700> I<00:04:29.730> water<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.240> what<00:04:30.660> people<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.200> with<00:04:32.130> way<00:04:32.280> I

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
but I water of what people I with way I

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.880 
but I water of what people I with way I
learned<00:04:32.700> which<00:04:33.180> is<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.420> basically<00:04:33.740> one<00:04:34.740> so

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
learned which is just basically one so

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.310 
learned which is just basically one so
once<00:04:35.490> I've<00:04:35.610> got<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.090> three<00:04:36.450> throws<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.230> he

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
once I've got the three throws and he

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.340 
once I've got the three throws and he
catches<00:04:37.500> now<00:04:37.910> just<00:04:38.910> basically<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.990> keep<00:04:40.140> on

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
catches now just basically you keep on

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.160 
catches now just basically you keep on
good<00:04:40.850> okay<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.390> it's<00:04:42.540> going<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.750> take<00:04:42.960> some

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
good okay and it's going to take some

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.110 
good okay and it's going to take some
time<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.590> go<00:04:43.650> take<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> little<00:04:44.010> bit<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.160> work<00:04:44.370> but

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
time to go take a little bit of work but

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.230 
time to go take a little bit of work but
you<00:04:45.270> will<00:04:45.300> get<00:04:46.050> there<00:04:46.260> eventually<00:04:47.030> just<00:04:48.030> about
