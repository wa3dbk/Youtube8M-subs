00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.109
 or the one that also came to the first 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.670
 kitchen this time I'm going to show you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.910
 how to make this delicious recipe 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.769
 original in mole with white rice I hope 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.049
 what they like 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.849
 The first thing I'm going to do is in a bowl 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.029
 with a little water I'm going to add 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.359
 half a teaspoon of salt and the juice of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.359
 Half lemon 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.130
 and then I'm going to cut my eggplants and 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.380
 I'm going to cut them along more or 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.380
 minus half a finger thick 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.180
 I submerge it in the water and I'm going to leave it 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.770
 stand about 5 minutes this 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.710
 will help us to maximize the o 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.210
 take away that markito that sometimes not 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.820
 they always come out but sometimes they do come out 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.310
 yellow then this will help us 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.500
 for the arrocito I already put in a pan 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.660
 two teaspoons of oil 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.270
 I'm going to add a quarter of chopped soy 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.700
 together with a well chopped stir I'm going to 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.140
 move until it is transparent it 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.140
 put the onion transparent 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.690
 I'm going to add the rice that is resting 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.450
 for 4 hours and the reits very well 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.970
 until the little water came out more or less 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.080
 transparent and it does not come out so much 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.140
 white we move a couple of minutes 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.520
 until the rice and cough is released 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.520
 see a little more white 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.079
 since rice is ready I'm going to 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.150
 add water that I already have two hot 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.400
 cups and a half 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.920
 I'm also going to add a cup of 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.530
 these great quotes that has half 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.820
 of frozen lot and half of 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.820
 carrots with pea 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.159
 we move and once it boils 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.159
 again I'll leave it on a low flame 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.750
 a tip so that the arrocito we stay 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.930
 whiter is to add the juice of medium 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.930
 lemon 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.740
 to season I'm going to add a 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.450
 teaspoon of salt 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.450
 and a little pepper 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.700
 since what we have at low flame 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.930
 I'm going to cover it and we're going to leave it until 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.930
 absorb all the water 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.860
 for the mole I bought from those who already 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.690
 sold in seed stores 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.540
 You can also find them in 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.980
 any super where are the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.859
 olives and all those things 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.360
 the only thing I did was add water 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:52.320
 hot to make it more 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.050
 like sauce type and it can be checking 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.790
 the taste if you like it with a little more 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.010
 of salt what is sweeter because it 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.790
 you can add with a few teaspoons of 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.790
 brown sugar 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.280
 this already provides it only lacks a 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.440
 little bit of salt 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.940
 I add it and let it boil a 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.840
 little bit so it will thicken again 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.170
 I like to add enough water because 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.819
 thickens a lot 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.170
 and so I make sure that the 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.170
 desired consistency 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.590
 the Czechs that have already dried well the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.590
 AgÃ¼ita I turn it off and leave it covered 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.640
 in a small glass put a quarter cup 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.740
 olive oil I'll add 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.010
 half a teaspoon of salt a little 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.010
 less 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.950
 a quarter of a teaspoon 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.950
 pepper 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.769
 and we mix it very well 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:01.069
 and this mixture I'll start 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.069
 varnish the aubergines on both sides 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.150
 on a hot comal and I'll start 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.920
 put the aubergines and I'll leave them 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.920
 three minutes on each side 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.239
 to present my dish I will place in 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.800
 a container can use a cup 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.650
 or any container if of this type 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.090
 I'm going to crush the rice 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.990
 and he turned it 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.990
 on the plate 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.659
 in this way is very flirtatious 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.080
 bringing a couple of the aubergines in 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:46.090
 the plate 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.090
 and the bathrooms with the mole sauce 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.810
 finally I put a little sesame 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.810
 over 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.110
 I also added a little salad 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.530
 I did with grated carrots like that 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.080
 strips a cucumber and tomatito nothing more 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.640
 the garnish with lemon and well so 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.400
 I have this recipe I hope you have them 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.140
 liked they are super rich if it was like that 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.100
 then the 'null share it and subscribe 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.100
 towards the channel until soon
