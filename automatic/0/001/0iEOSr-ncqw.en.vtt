00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.100
 fan box co.com this link verdi under 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.470
 windows i made it for windows 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.769
 because i have windows on it then if it is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.989
 This symbol is finished on the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.180

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.410
 Write then loaded now 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.559
 So, something like that does not happen 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 the right file because I already have it 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.940
 downloaded 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 That's why I do not need it again 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.960
 download and that is if you 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.350
 you have this file on the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:04.290
 desktop opens her iphone box and it 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.770
 must be very important that heike racing 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.320
 on multitasking for iphone im 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.189
 background does not work otherwise it goes there 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.640
 it does not have to be completely closed 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.560
 become 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.340
 in basel if you have iphone loaded 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.939
 and the boxer has realized this one is here 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.509
 fun box classic top left pushes her 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.979
 then you see the user 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.979
 applications because you push it again 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.900
 then try the tricky basin 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.560
 then you see a folder called 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.770
 documents pressed on it again then 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.570

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.970

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.530

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.040
 shut down 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.890
