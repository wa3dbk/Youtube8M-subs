00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
that I absolutely detest but the figure

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.929 
that I absolutely detest but the figure
is<00:00:21.200> one<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:21.590> I<00:00:21.680> kind<00:00:22.189> of<00:00:22.250> actually<00:00:22.369> recommend

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
is one that I kind of actually recommend

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.089 
is one that I kind of actually recommend
so<00:00:23.210> let's<00:00:23.360> take<00:00:23.540> a<00:00:23.570> look<00:00:23.779> at<00:00:23.930> him<00:00:24.050> he<00:00:24.650> stands

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
so let's take a look at him he stands

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.510 
so let's take a look at him he stands
about<00:00:26.410> seventeen<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:27.770> a<00:00:27.890> half<00:00:28.130> centimeters

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
about seventeen and a half centimeters

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.139 
about seventeen and a half centimeters
tall<00:00:29.029> which<00:00:29.329> puts<00:00:29.599> him<00:00:29.810> at<00:00:30.079> about<00:00:30.970> almost<00:00:31.970> 7

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
tall which puts him at about almost 7

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.420 
tall which puts him at about almost 7
inches<00:00:32.540> tall<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.320> top<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:33.710> his<00:00:33.890> hair<00:00:34.130> there

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
inches tall to the top of his hair there

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.549 
inches tall to the top of his hair there
so<00:00:34.940> definitely<00:00:35.360> has<00:00:35.480> some<00:00:35.570> decent<00:00:35.750> size<00:00:36.079> comes

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
so definitely has some decent size comes

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.440 
so definitely has some decent size comes
with<00:00:36.770> his<00:00:36.980> little<00:00:37.160> lightning<00:00:37.670> sword<00:00:38.000> which<00:00:38.300> is

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
with his little lightning sword which is

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.730 
with his little lightning sword which is
translucent<00:00:38.840> plastic<00:00:39.110> mine's<00:00:39.590> a<00:00:39.710> little

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
translucent plastic mine's a little

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.800 
translucent plastic mine's a little
warped<00:00:40.190> but<00:00:40.400> some<00:00:40.700> hot<00:00:40.850> water<00:00:41.030> will<00:00:41.330> fix<00:00:41.600> that

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
warped but some hot water will fix that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.930 
warped but some hot water will fix that
nice<00:00:42.410> yellow<00:00:42.650> color<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.520> he<00:00:43.580> does<00:00:43.760> have

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
nice yellow color to it and he does have

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.940 
nice yellow color to it and he does have
a<00:00:43.970> hand<00:00:44.270> for<00:00:44.330> holding<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.470> that's<00:00:45.830> pretty

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
a hand for holding it so that's pretty

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.020 
a hand for holding it so that's pretty
good<00:00:46.840> put<00:00:47.840> that<00:00:48.050> in<00:00:48.230> there<00:00:48.880> you<00:00:49.880> could

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
good put that in there you could

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.700 
good put that in there you could
probably<00:00:50.270> heat<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.900> hand<00:00:51.110> up<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.410> get<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.620> to

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
probably heat the hand up to get it to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.080 
probably heat the hand up to get it to
hold<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.040> better<00:00:52.310> I<00:00:52.520> don't<00:00:52.670> know<00:00:52.790> for<00:00:53.060> sure

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
hold that better I don't know for sure

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.160 
hold that better I don't know for sure
but<00:00:53.570> I'm<00:00:53.840> guessing<00:00:54.080> it<00:00:54.920> can<00:00:55.100> be<00:00:55.220> done<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:56.600> this

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
but I'm guessing it can be done so this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.770 
but I'm guessing it can be done so this
guy<00:00:57.380> as<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.950> might<00:00:58.130> have<00:00:58.250> guessed<00:00:58.460> has<00:00:59.090> mostly

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
guy as you might have guessed has mostly

standard DC you see parts the legs in

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.630 
standard DC you see parts the legs in
the<00:01:03.020> chest<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.620> arms<00:01:03.890> mostly<00:01:04.460> all

piece up here which can be removed at

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.489 
piece up here which can be removed at
the<00:01:10.850> risk<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.420> ruining<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:11.960> it's<00:01:12.049> not<00:01:12.200> meant

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
the risk of ruining and it's not meant

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:16.209 
the risk of ruining and it's not meant
to<00:01:12.560> be<00:01:12.740> removed<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.369> can<00:01:13.729> come<00:01:14.569> off<00:01:15.219> and

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
to be removed but it can come off and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
work on it you have shading on the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.559 
work on it you have shading on the
cheeks<00:01:27.889> the<00:01:28.039> facial<00:01:28.789> hair<00:01:28.819> is<00:01:29.060> painted<00:01:29.389> well

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
on the hair looks really good this is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.529 
on the hair looks really good this is
sculpted<00:01:34.340> really<00:01:34.609> well<00:01:34.759> it's<00:01:34.969> a<00:01:35.030> nice<00:01:35.210> soft

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
sculpted really well it's a nice soft

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.029 
sculpted really well it's a nice soft
plastic<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.229> doesn't<00:01:36.469> get<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:36.709> way<00:01:36.799> of

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
plastic so it doesn't get in the way of

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.209 
plastic so it doesn't get in the way of
the<00:01:37.159> articulation<00:01:37.939> at<00:01:38.060> all<00:01:38.469> all<00:01:39.469> of<00:01:39.740> his<00:01:39.920> skin

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
the articulation at all all of his skin

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.249 
the articulation at all all of his skin
is<00:01:40.459> uniformly<00:01:41.240> colored<00:01:41.539> they're<00:01:41.959> shading

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
is uniformly colored they're shading

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.590 
is uniformly colored they're shading
throughout<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:43.069> little<00:01:43.819> bit<00:01:43.969> heavy<00:01:44.179> shading

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
throughout a little bit heavy shading

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.090 
throughout a little bit heavy shading
right<00:01:44.719> here<00:01:44.959> but<00:01:45.079> that's<00:01:45.229> probably<00:01:45.649> just<00:01:45.889> on

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
right here but that's probably just on

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.239 
right here but that's probably just on
mine<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.090> there's<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.780> really<00:01:48.139> key<00:01:48.889> thing<00:01:48.920> about

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
mine so there's a really key thing about
