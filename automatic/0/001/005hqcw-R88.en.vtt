00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.140 
it's more awesome and this is for me one
of<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.360> best<00:02:56.799> 40k<00:02:57.799> games<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.400> all<00:02:58.610> time

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
of the best 40k games of all time

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.930 
of the best 40k games of all time
first<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.079> course<00:03:00.110> sand<00:03:01.040> rest<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.489> because<00:03:01.790> you

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
first of course sand rest is because you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.509 
first of course sand rest is because you
can<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:02.660> create<00:03:02.959> gangs<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.440> stuff<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:03.860> the

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
can like create gangs and stuff but the

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.390 
can like create gangs and stuff but the
thing<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.900> they<00:03:06.200> will<00:03:06.530> ever<00:03:06.890> release

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
thing is that if they will ever release

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.530 
thing is that if they will ever release
that<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:08.410> for<00:03:09.730> for<00:03:10.730> iOS<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.239> Android<00:03:11.269> I

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
that for for for iOS and Android I

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.690 
that for for for iOS and Android I
really<00:03:11.810> hope<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.280> straight

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
really hope that it is this straight

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.180 
really hope that it is this straight
port<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.599> you<00:03:14.630> can<00:03:14.750> really<00:03:15.019> create<00:03:15.319> games<00:03:15.620> or

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
port so you can really create games or

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.729 
port so you can really create games or
gangs<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:16.910> stuff<00:03:17.079> you<00:03:18.079> know<00:03:18.200> takes<00:03:18.470> over<00:03:20.739> so

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
called make videos on other devices as

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.380 
called make videos on other devices as
well<00:04:04.870> like<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.950> galaxy<00:04:06.400> s2<00:04:06.489> from<00:04:06.819> last<00:04:07.000> year

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390
