pen you notice that they tie it to the
counter<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.590> way<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> comes<00:01:16.950> back<00:01:17.220> so

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
counter and that way it comes back so

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.520 
counter and that way it comes back so
this<00:01:18.240> gives<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> ability<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.320> if

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
this gives you the ability to do that if

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.550 
this gives you the ability to do that if
you<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> case<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.270> has<00:01:21.840> kind

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you have a case like I do that has kind

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.830 
you have a case like I do that has kind
of<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.799> loop<00:01:23.400> where<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.150> actually<00:01:24.330> put

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of a loop where you can actually put

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.830 
of a loop where you can actually put
your<00:01:25.430> stylus<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.150> definitely<00:01:27.659> don't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
your stylus then you definitely don't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
your stylus then you definitely don't
need<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.740> bungee<00:01:29.189> action<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.970> on

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
need to have that bungee action going on

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.080 
need to have that bungee action going on
you<00:01:30.689> notice<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> case<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you notice that here I have a case and I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
you notice that here I have a case and I
have<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> little<00:01:33.960> loop<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:34.350> here<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.770> would

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
have a little loop right here so I would

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.710 
have a little loop right here so I would
just<00:01:35.520> insert<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.060> right<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
just insert this right here and I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.109 
just insert this right here and I
wouldn't<00:01:36.960> need<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> loop<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:38.850> one

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
wouldn't need the loop but that's one

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.460 
wouldn't need the loop but that's one
feature<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.320> stylus<00:01:40.829> has<00:01:41.659> now<00:01:42.659> this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
feature that this stylus has now this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
feature that this stylus has now this
stylus<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.520> bit<00:01:44.610> different<00:01:44.939> than

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
stylus is a little bit different than

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
stylus is a little bit different than
some<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.869> other<00:01:45.990> slides<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.619> had

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
some of the other slides that we had

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.990 
some of the other slides that we had
we're<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> compare<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.549> I'm<00:01:47.640> gonna<00:01:47.729> pull

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
we're going to compare it I'm gonna pull

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.539 
we're going to compare it I'm gonna pull
a<00:01:48.030> stylus<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:49.100> from<00:01:50.100> another

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
a stylus that I have from another

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.700 
a stylus that I have from another
company<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.229> it's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
company so that we can see because it's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.469 
company so that we can see because it's
it's<00:01:52.979> different<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.579> least<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.880> material<00:01:54.390> that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it's different at least a material that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.300 
it's different at least a material that
you<00:01:54.600> see<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.259> different<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.860> let's<00:01:56.040> pull

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you see here is different so let's pull

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
you see here is different so let's pull
out<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> stylus<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.000> we'll<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> look<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:57.990> this

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
out a stylus and we'll do a look at this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.450 
out a stylus and we'll do a look at this
for<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> second<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.009> traditional

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
for a second so this is a traditional

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
for a second so this is a traditional
stylus<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.409> higher-end<00:02:01.409> stylus

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
stylus it's actually a higher-end stylus

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.370 
stylus it's actually a higher-end stylus
that<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.070> find<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.610> your<00:02:02.700> local<00:02:02.790> big-box

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
that you find in your local big-box

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.850 
that you find in your local big-box
retailers<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:04.649> even<00:02:05.070> online<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:07.590> tip

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
retailers or even online and the tip

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.910 
retailers or even online and the tip
itself<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.700> made<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.509> rubber<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
itself is made out of rubber so it's a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.880 
itself is made out of rubber so it's a
rubber<00:02:11.160> tip<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.840> one<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:12.989> things<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
rubber tip and one of the things that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
rubber tip and one of the things that
you'll<00:02:13.980> find<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.460> you're<00:02:14.580> using<00:02:14.810> styluses

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
you'll find when you're using styluses

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.050 
you'll find when you're using styluses
what<00:02:16.680> makes<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.010> difference<00:02:17.310> between<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
what makes a difference between one and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.809 
what makes a difference between one and
the<00:02:18.360> other<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.840> how<00:02:19.319> sturdy<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.920> rubber<00:02:20.580> tip

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the other is how sturdy this rubber tip

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.170 
the other is how sturdy this rubber tip
is<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.240> how<00:02:21.660> smooth<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.560> writes<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
is and how smooth it writes so the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.050 
is and how smooth it writes so the
hybrid<00:02:24.360> size<00:02:24.800> has<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.830> rubber<00:02:26.160> tip<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:26.910> it's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
hybrid size has a rubber tip but it's

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.270 
hybrid size has a rubber tip but it's
actually<00:02:27.390> inside<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.650> has<00:02:28.980> this

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
actually inside and then it has this

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.420 
actually inside and then it has this
fiber<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.360> outside<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.500> how<00:02:32.190> does<00:02:32.340> that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
fiber on the outside so how does that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.030 
fiber on the outside so how does that
impact<00:02:32.610> writing<00:02:33.300> well<00:02:33.959> it's<00:02:34.500> kind<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.740> hard<00:02:34.800> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
impact writing well it's kind of hard to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.800 
impact writing well it's kind of hard to
illustrate<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> video<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.630> best

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
illustrate that on a video so the best

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.440 
illustrate that on a video so the best
example<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.260> give<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.610> have<00:02:39.390> you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
example I can give you is this have you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.320 
example I can give you is this have you
ever<00:02:39.560> picked<00:02:40.560> up<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.830> pen<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.310> written<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.150> it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
ever picked up a pen and written with it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.610 
ever picked up a pen and written with it
and<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.660> find<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.350> writes<00:02:43.530> very

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
and you find it that it writes very

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.890 
and you find it that it writes very
smooth<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.550> go<00:02:44.730> wow<00:02:44.940> gee<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.300> really<00:02:45.420> like

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
smooth and you go wow gee I really like

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.510 
smooth and you go wow gee I really like
that<00:02:46.080> pen<00:02:46.290> because<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.680> writes<00:02:46.950> nice<00:02:47.250> and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
that pen because it writes nice and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.850 
that pen because it writes nice and
smooth<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.150> ink<00:02:48.330> flows<00:02:48.690> nicely<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.770> then

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
smooth and the ink flows nicely and then

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.080 
smooth and the ink flows nicely and then
you<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.100> these<00:02:50.220> other<00:02:50.400> pens<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.760> as<00:02:50.940> you're

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
you have these other pens that as you're

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.880 
you have these other pens that as you're
writing<00:02:51.300> it's<00:02:51.930> kind<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.230> hard<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> write<00:02:52.739> you

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
writing it's kind of hard to write you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.350 
writing it's kind of hard to write you
know<00:02:52.920> ink<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.400> coming<00:02:53.550> across<00:02:53.760> as<00:02:54.150> you're

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
know ink is coming across as you're

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.690 
know ink is coming across as you're
writing<00:02:54.540> it's<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.380> doesn't<00:02:55.769> flow<00:02:56.130> easily<00:02:56.400> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
writing it's it doesn't flow easily and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.210 
writing it's it doesn't flow easily and
it<00:02:56.790> requires<00:02:57.150> more<00:02:57.239> effort<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.320> with<00:02:58.890> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it requires more effort so with the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.690 
it requires more effort so with the
combination<00:02:59.700> of<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:01.260> rubber<00:03:01.560> inside<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
combination of the rubber inside and

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.060 
combination of the rubber inside and
then<00:03:02.940> this<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:04.080> fiber<00:03:04.350> material<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
then this this fiber material on the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.280 
then this this fiber material on the
outside<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.730> gives<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.660> sturdiness<00:03:07.050> that

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
outside it gives you the sturdiness that

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.410 
outside it gives you the sturdiness that
you<00:03:07.380> want<00:03:07.650> right<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.940> conductive

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
you want right but and the conductive

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.720 
you want right but and the conductive
material<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.440> need<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:11.310> gives<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:11.640> a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
material that you need but gives you a

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.500 
material that you need but gives you a
nice<00:03:12.180> smooth<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.680> gliding<00:03:14.580> stroke<00:03:15.000> as<00:03:15.180> you

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
nice smooth and gliding stroke as you

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.930 
nice smooth and gliding stroke as you
use<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.959> stylus<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.040> important<00:03:17.850> for

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
use the stylus this is important for

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.280 
use the stylus this is important for
those<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.299> who<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.810> draw<00:03:19.079> on<00:03:19.110> your

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
those of you who like to draw on your

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.140 
those of you who like to draw on your
tablets<00:03:19.829> or<00:03:19.980> for<00:03:20.340> those<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.700> who<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.120> to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.370 
write on your tablets so the next thing
I<00:03:23.310> want<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.489> do<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.670> show<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.290> what's<00:03:25.290> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
I want to do is show you what's the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.810 
I want to do is show you what's the
difference<00:03:25.680> as<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:25.980> use<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.579> we'll<00:03:26.790> use

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
difference as you use it and we'll use

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.650 
difference as you use it and we'll use
in<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.329> case<00:03:27.570> an<00:03:27.900> iPad<00:03:28.620> 2<00:03:29.250> retina<00:03:30.239> in<00:03:30.390> this

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
in this case an iPad 2 retina in this

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.910 
in this case an iPad 2 retina in this
example<00:03:30.989> all<00:03:31.350> right<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.530> I'll<00:03:31.590> go<00:03:31.650> ahead<00:03:31.680> and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
example all right so I'll go ahead and

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920 
example all right so I'll go ahead and
start<00:03:32.100> with<00:03:32.280> with<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> traditional<00:03:33.420> stylus

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
start with with the traditional stylus

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.100 
start with with the traditional stylus
and<00:03:34.200> I'll<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.459> ahead<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:36.090> I'm<00:03:36.630> using<00:03:36.810> a

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
and I'll go ahead and I'm using a

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.150 
and I'll go ahead and I'm using a
notability<00:03:37.769> on<00:03:37.980> my<00:03:38.450> iPad<00:03:39.450> retina<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.320> I'll<00:03:40.440> go

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
notability on my iPad retina so I'll go

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.650 
notability on my iPad retina so I'll go
ahead<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.400> write<00:03:41.489> on<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.209> notice<00:03:42.510> how

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
ahead and write on it and you notice how

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.630 
ahead and write on it and you notice how
you<00:03:43.440> know<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> letters<00:03:43.890> come<00:03:44.010> up<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.489> it

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
you know the letters come up and it

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.400 
you know the letters come up and it
skips<00:03:44.910> sometimes<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.690> know<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:46.049> what

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
skips sometimes you know just what

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.060 
skips sometimes you know just what
happens<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:46.769> stylus<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:48.829> I'll<00:03:49.829> go<00:03:49.980> ahead

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
happens with stylus and I'll go ahead

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.729 
happens with stylus and I'll go ahead
again<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.640> write<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.510> word<00:03:51.660> test<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.650> you

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
again and write the word test and you

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:53.840 
again and write the word test and you
and<00:03:52.950> one<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> things<00:03:53.459> just<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.700> highlight

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
and one of the things just to highlight

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.569 
and one of the things just to highlight
you<00:03:54.060> can<00:03:54.090> see<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.420> there's<00:03:54.630> there<00:03:55.200> is

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
you can see that there's there is

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.400 
you can see that there's there is
different<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:57.000> would<00:03:57.510> say<00:03:57.600> thicknesses<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.200> my

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
different I would say thicknesses in my

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.990 
different I would say thicknesses in my
writing<00:03:58.799> based<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.160> pressure<00:03:59.430> sensitivity

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
writing based on pressure sensitivity

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.699 
writing based on pressure sensitivity
that<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.420> get<00:04:00.690> off<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:00.900> using<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.440> stylus

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
that you get off of using the stylus

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.310 
that you get off of using the stylus
right<00:04:02.070> so<00:04:02.610> we<00:04:02.730> have<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.030> example<00:04:03.480> now<00:04:04.110> what

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
right so we have that example now what

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.710 
right so we have that example now what
I'll<00:04:04.410> do<00:04:04.620> is<00:04:04.650> I'll<00:04:04.920> use<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.760> hybrid<00:04:06.030> stylus

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
I'll do is I'll use the hybrid stylus

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.050 
I'll do is I'll use the hybrid stylus
and<00:04:07.310> one<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.459> things<00:04:08.579> I'll<00:04:08.730> tell<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.000> I

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
and one of the things I'll tell you I

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.970 
and one of the things I'll tell you I
don't<00:04:09.360> know<00:04:09.420> if<00:04:09.690> it'll<00:04:10.410> come<00:04:10.560> out<00:04:10.709> on<00:04:10.859> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
don't know if it'll come out on the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.440 
don't know if it'll come out on the
video<00:04:12.260> but<00:04:13.260> notice<00:04:13.500> I'm<00:04:13.650> not<00:04:13.769> skipping<00:04:14.160> it's<00:04:15.120> a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
video but notice I'm not skipping it's a

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.960 
video but notice I'm not skipping it's a
smoother<00:04:16.079> right<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:17.130> I'll<00:04:17.220> write<00:04:17.430> test<00:04:17.700> again

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
smoother right so I'll write test again

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.070 
smoother right so I'll write test again
and<00:04:18.180> again<00:04:18.570> I'm<00:04:18.780> doing<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.140> same<00:04:19.320> thing<00:04:21.080> you

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
and again I'm doing the same thing you

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.860 
and again I'm doing the same thing you
can<00:04:22.470> see<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.830> there's<00:04:23.450> different<00:04:24.450> types<00:04:24.690> of

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
can see that there's different types of

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.330 
can see that there's different types of
strokes<00:04:25.200> based<00:04:25.500> on<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.740> pressure<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.220> I'm

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
strokes based on the pressure that I'm

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.440 
strokes based on the pressure that I'm
applying<00:04:26.580> on<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:26.940> screen

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
applying on the screen

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.190 
applying on the screen
again<00:04:28.110> we'll<00:04:28.230> do<00:04:28.380> tests<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:30.390> I'll<00:04:30.750> bring<00:04:31.080> the

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
again we'll do tests and I'll bring the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.460 
again we'll do tests and I'll bring the
other<00:04:31.230> stylist<00:04:31.710> I'll<00:04:31.830> do<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.070> same<00:04:32.190> thing

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
other stylist I'll do the same thing

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.080 
other stylist I'll do the same thing
and<00:04:34.470> notice<00:04:34.740> how<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:34.860> skipped<00:04:35.220> right<00:04:35.460> I'll<00:04:35.910> take

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
and notice how I skipped right I'll take

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.700 
and notice how I skipped right I'll take
this<00:04:36.240> one<00:04:38.120> notice<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.240> again<00:04:39.750> same<00:04:40.140> hand<00:04:40.410> and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
this one notice that again same hand and

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.200 
this one notice that again same hand and
again<00:04:40.890> I'm<00:04:41.100> not<00:04:41.220> doing<00:04:41.430> anything<00:04:41.580> you<00:04:42.120> know

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
again I'm not doing anything you know

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.640 
again I'm not doing anything you know
sometimes<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.570> got<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.780> push<00:04:43.020> down<00:04:43.230> more<00:04:43.290> and

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
sometimes you got to push down more and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.350 
sometimes you got to push down more and
some<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:43.950> these<00:04:44.010> other<00:04:44.220> styluses<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
some of these other styluses so the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.630 
some of these other styluses so the
conduction<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:46.260> comes<00:04:46.500> from<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.860> rubber<00:04:47.370> is

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
conduction that comes from the rubber is

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.880 
conduction that comes from the rubber is
not<00:04:48.120> always<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:49.050> good<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.680> good

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
not always that good and this is a good

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.330 
not always that good and this is a good
size<00:04:50.100> this<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.540> Wacom<00:04:51.540> Bamboo<00:04:51.840> Stylus<00:04:52.620> so

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
size this is a Wacom Bamboo Stylus so

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.000 
size this is a Wacom Bamboo Stylus so
I'll<00:04:53.730> write<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.180> word<00:04:54.300> test<00:04:54.540> again<00:04:54.890> push<00:04:55.890> it

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
I'll write the word test again push it

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.070 
I'll write the word test again push it
down<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.460> now<00:04:56.670> don't<00:04:57.450> really<00:04:57.690> have<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.900> put<00:04:58.050> a

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
down and now don't really have to put a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.590 
down and now don't really have to put a
lot<00:04:58.260> of<00:04:58.350> pressure<00:04:58.620> here<00:04:59.180> just<00:05:00.180> write<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.570> word

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
lot of pressure here just write the word

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.120 
lot of pressure here just write the word
test<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.410> I'll<00:05:01.560> just<00:05:01.740> do<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:01.860> over<00:05:02.010> again

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
test and I'll just do it over again

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.740 
test and I'll just do it over again
again<00:05:02.780> boring<00:05:03.780> but<00:05:04.040> right<00:05:05.040> swell<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:06.090> overall

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
again boring but right swell so overall

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.950 
again boring but right swell so overall
I'd<00:05:07.020> say<00:05:07.290> that<00:05:07.560> from<00:05:07.920> a<00:05:08.600> smoothness<00:05:09.600> when

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
I'd say that from a smoothness when

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.630 
I'd say that from a smoothness when
you're<00:05:10.080> writing<00:05:10.350> on<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.590> screen

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
you're writing on the screen

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.600 
you're writing on the screen
the<00:05:12.090> hybrid<00:05:12.780> stylists<00:05:13.470> especially<00:05:14.070> with<00:05:14.370> this

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
the hybrid stylists especially with this
