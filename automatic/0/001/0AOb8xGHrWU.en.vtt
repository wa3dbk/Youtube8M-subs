 switzerland thank you austria 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.920

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.580
 encounter European signs 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.670

 customers who pair these on the ground 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.409
 it is nevertheless extremely dangerous 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.800
 to use that driver for up to fifteen minutes 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.479

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.309
 the operation like that 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:15.800
 Hadders are much busier that truck

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.930
 wds 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.560

 salon led rear lights miles from 2261 points 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.339

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:17.619
 observers 

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:21.099
