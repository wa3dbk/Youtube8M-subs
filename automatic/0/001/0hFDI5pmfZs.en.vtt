show<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.140> how<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.350> put<00:02:16.530> those<00:02:16.680> wheels<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.190> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
show you how to put those wheels on and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
show you how to put those wheels on and
I'm<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.240> work<00:02:18.390> with<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> final<00:02:21.320> and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
I'm going to work with the final and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.120 
I'm going to work with the final and
they<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.580> twist<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.620> they'll<00:02:25.620> gradually

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
they just twist on and they'll gradually

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:35.000 
they just twist on and they'll gradually
work<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.930> spindle<00:02:32.060> like<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.920> until<00:02:34.920> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
work up the spindle like so until you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.090 
work up the spindle like so until you
feel<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.250> there's<00:02:35.670> some<00:02:35.880> resistance<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
feel that there's some resistance and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.230 
feel that there's some resistance and
you'll<00:02:38.100> always<00:02:38.280> want<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.670> make<00:02:38.790> sure<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:39.060> put

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
you'll always want to make sure you put

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.970 
you'll always want to make sure you put
on<00:02:39.270> safety<00:02:39.570> glasses<00:02:39.750> before<00:02:40.260> turning<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:40.860> the

is<00:03:02.850> you're<00:03:03.090> pressing<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.750> against<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.170> wheel

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
is you're pressing up against the wheel

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.130 
is you're pressing up against the wheel
you<00:03:05.610> can<00:03:05.640> overcharge<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> wheel<00:03:06.660> which<00:03:06.870> would

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
you can overcharge the wheel which would

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.120 
you can overcharge the wheel which would
be<00:03:07.290> you'll<00:03:07.950> notice<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.489> as<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:09.290> dust<00:03:10.290> ghost<00:03:10.920> or

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
be you'll notice that as a dust ghost or

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.050 
be you'll notice that as a dust ghost or
haze<00:03:11.489> appears<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:12.480> your<00:03:13.380> jewelry<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.880> work

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
haze appears on your jewelry as you work

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.530 
haze appears on your jewelry as you work
your<00:03:15.209> jewelry<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.290> will<00:03:16.940> see<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.060> ghost<00:03:18.269> and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
your jewelry you will see the ghost and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.640 
your jewelry you will see the ghost and
then<00:03:18.630> just<00:03:18.810> keep<00:03:18.930> working<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.320> wheel<00:03:19.470> and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
then just keep working the wheel and

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.220 
then just keep working the wheel and
it'll<00:03:19.739> eventually<00:03:20.040> dissipate<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:21.720> ring<00:03:21.989> I

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
it'll eventually dissipate this ring I

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.830 
it'll eventually dissipate this ring I
haven't<00:03:22.950> done<00:03:23.130> any<00:03:23.610> polishing<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.720> can

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
haven't done any polishing so you can

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.199 
haven't done any polishing so you can
see<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.320> before<00:03:25.470> I've<00:03:26.000> progressed<00:03:27.000> through

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
see the before I've progressed through

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.590 
see the before I've progressed through
to<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.600> Tripoli<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.790> then<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.120> one<00:03:30.299> has<00:03:30.450> had

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
to the Tripoli and then this one has had

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.320 
to the Tripoli and then this one has had
the<00:03:30.720> Tripoli<00:03:31.080> than<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> carnuba<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.330> then

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
the Tripoli than the carnuba and then

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.960 
the Tripoli than the carnuba and then
here<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.959> Tripoli<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.410> carnuba<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.220> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
here the Tripoli the carnuba and the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.690 
here the Tripoli the carnuba and the
blue<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.390> now<00:03:36.930> we'll<00:03:37.080> do<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.230> white<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.769> that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
blue and now we'll do the white and that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.340 
blue and now we'll do the white and that
will<00:03:38.790> really<00:03:39.000> bring<00:03:39.180> up<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.420> finish<00:03:39.750> as<00:03:39.930> well

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
will really bring up the finish as well

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.069 
will really bring up the finish as well
as<00:03:40.500> show<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:41.269> exactly<00:03:42.269> where<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.570> place<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
as show you exactly where to place the

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.009 
as show you exactly where to place the
jewelry<00:03:43.440> when<00:03:43.590> you're<00:03:43.709> polishing<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:45.019> how

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
jewelry when you're polishing and how

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.259 
jewelry when you're polishing and how
quickly<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.620> works<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.430> takes<00:03:47.670> out<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.120> much

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
quickly this works it takes out so much

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.979 
quickly this works it takes out so much
of<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.570> hand<00:03:48.900> motion<00:03:49.860> that's<00:03:50.010> required<00:03:50.430> to

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
of the hand motion that's required to

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.190 
of the hand motion that's required to
achieve<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:53.190> type<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.670> finish<00:03:54.060> it's<00:03:54.989> just

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
achieve that type of finish it's just

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.539 
achieve that type of finish it's just
beautiful<00:03:57.350> as<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.560> wheel<00:03:58.680> spins<00:03:59.040> you'll<00:03:59.340> have

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
beautiful as the wheel spins you'll have

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.949 
beautiful as the wheel spins you'll have
some<00:03:59.820> dust<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.180> will<00:04:00.269> come<00:04:00.450> off<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.660> the

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
some dust that will come off and the

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.690 
some dust that will come off and the
dust<00:04:01.140> collector<00:04:01.410> will<00:04:01.620> capture<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.160> just

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
dust collector will capture that just

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.190 
dust collector will capture that just
make<00:04:02.850> sure<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.239> clear<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.750> out<00:04:03.930> as

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
make sure that you clear that out as

it's<00:04:55.680> better<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.099> let<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.310> go<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:57.500> worry<00:04:58.500> about

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
it's better to let it go and worry about

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.520 
it's better to let it go and worry about
finding<00:04:59.009> it<00:04:59.220> later<00:04:59.990> it's<00:05:00.990> really<00:05:01.319> that<00:05:01.500> easy

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
finding it later it's really that easy

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.149 
finding it later it's really that easy
to<00:05:01.830> use<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:04.020> buffing<00:05:04.349> wheel<00:05:04.500> will<00:05:04.860> be<00:05:04.979> what
