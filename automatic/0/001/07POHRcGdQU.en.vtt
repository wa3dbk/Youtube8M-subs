that<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> wanted<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> show<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> only

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that I wanted to show you is if you only

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.380 
that I wanted to show you is if you only
have<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.220> color<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.090> really

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
have one color and you have a really

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.990 
have one color and you have a really
simple<00:01:33.600> stamp<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.490> too<00:01:35.759> hard

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
simple stamp like this it's not too hard

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.749 
simple stamp like this it's not too hard
to<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.450> some<00:01:36.659> dimension<00:01:37.140> by<00:01:37.590> only<00:01:37.829> using<00:01:37.979> one

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to get some dimension by only using one

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.420 
to get some dimension by only using one
marker<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.600> that's<00:01:39.990> by<00:01:40.259> coloring<00:01:40.799> over<00:01:40.979> top

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
marker and that's by coloring over top

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.210 
marker and that's by coloring over top
of<00:01:41.640> itself<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.270> couple<00:01:42.659> times<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.710> doesn't<00:01:44.100> work

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
of itself a couple times it doesn't work

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.310 
of itself a couple times it doesn't work
when<00:01:44.640> you're<00:01:44.790> doing<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.479> whole<00:01:45.689> lot<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> detail

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
when you're doing a whole lot of detail

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080 
when you're doing a whole lot of detail
necessarily<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.670> hard<00:01:47.970> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
necessarily because it's really hard to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.480 
necessarily because it's really hard to
do<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.840> big<00:01:49.170> bold<00:01:49.409> stamp<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.250> I

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
do but on a big bold stamp like this I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
do but on a big bold stamp like this I
can<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.270> lay<00:01:51.479> down<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:52.020> layer<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> color

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
can just lay down one layer of the color

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.249 
can just lay down one layer of the color
first<00:01:53.090> let<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.180> dry<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.689> second<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.170> why

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and then add just a little bit right

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.209 
and then add just a little bit right
along<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> edge<00:02:01.079> where<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> shadow

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
along the edge where I want the shadow

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.789 
along the edge where I want the shadow
to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.079> saw<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> flowers

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799

to be and as you saw in the flowers
earlier<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.189> got<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.610> pretty<00:02:05.759> good

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
earlier I got some pretty good

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.029 
earlier I got some pretty good
dimensions<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.659> most<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.170> those<00:02:07.320> flowers<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
dimensions on most of those flowers and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.699 
dimensions on most of those flowers and
that's<00:02:08.550> all<00:02:08.729> by<00:02:09.060> using<00:02:09.300> one<00:02:09.810> color<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
that's all by using one color of the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.010 
that's all by using one color of the
marker<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:11.730> go<00:02:11.819> over<00:02:12.060> lighter<00:02:12.569> colors

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
marker you can go over lighter colors

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.670 
marker you can go over lighter colors
multiple

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
multiple

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.699

but<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> e08<00:02:16.079> you<00:02:16.379> really<00:02:16.590> don't

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
but with like the e08 you really don't

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.140 
but with like the e08 you really don't
want<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:16.890> go<00:02:16.980> over<00:02:17.189> it<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.310> million<00:02:17.579> times<00:02:17.700> or

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
want to go over it a million times or

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.610 
want to go over it a million times or
you'll<00:02:18.269> end<00:02:18.329> up<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.689> really<00:02:19.019> muddy<00:02:19.319> dark

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
brown to smooth everything out I'm just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.679 
brown to smooth everything out I'm just
using<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.489> side<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.000> marker<00:02:24.329> to<00:02:24.569> do<00:02:24.659> a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and by the time it dries it's nice and

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.089

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
for the Centers of the flowers I cheated

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.309 
for the Centers of the flowers I cheated
I<00:02:32.579> didn't<00:02:32.849> color<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.480> little<00:02:33.720> circles<00:02:34.140> on

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
I didn't color in the little circles on

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.530 
I didn't color in the little circles on
the<00:02:34.500> flowers<00:02:34.920> instead<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:35.879> took<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.150> strip<00:02:36.420> of

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the flowers instead I took a strip of

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.170 
the flowers instead I took a strip of
paper<00:02:36.689> and<00:02:37.109> I'm<00:02:37.319> using<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.859> same<00:02:38.040> b99<00:02:38.549> marker

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.470 
paper and I'm using that same b99 marker
and<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.560> laid<00:02:41.310> down<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.819> coat<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.269> color

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
and I laid down one coat of the color

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.569 
and I laid down one coat of the color
and<00:02:42.750> now<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.140> laying<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.590> shadow<00:02:43.920> down<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
then going over top of the whole thing

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.550 
then going over top of the whole thing
which<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.970> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> start<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.659> blend<00:02:48.930> out<00:02:49.260> as

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
which is going to start to blend out as

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.619 
which is going to start to blend out as
it<00:02:49.739> dries<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.489> I'm<00:02:51.030> still<00:02:51.239> going<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.420> end<00:02:51.540> up

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
it dries and I'm still going to end up

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.780

makes<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.669> really<00:03:32.819> easy<00:03:32.909> to<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.449> do<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.599> whole

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
makes it really easy to just do a whole

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.689 
makes it really easy to just do a whole
bunch<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.079> flower<00:03:34.290> centers<00:03:34.739> all<00:03:34.949> at<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.489> same

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
bunch of flower centers all at the same

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.979 
bunch of flower centers all at the same
time<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.540> then<00:03:37.230> add<00:03:37.440> them<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.859> my<00:03:38.040> cards

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
time and then add them to my cards

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.379 
time and then add them to my cards
here's<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.199> finished<00:03:40.560> card<00:03:41.129> and<00:03:41.579> with<00:03:42.239> the

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
here's the finished card and with the

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.839 
here's the finished card and with the
flower<00:03:42.659> petals<00:03:43.169> I<00:03:43.409> just<00:03:43.949> curled<00:03:44.579> them<00:03:44.819> a

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
flower petals I just curled them a

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.059 
flower petals I just curled them a
little<00:03:45.209> bit<00:03:45.329> around<00:03:45.599> my<00:03:45.690> finger<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.560> make<00:03:46.919> the

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
little bit around my finger to make the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.830 
little bit around my finger to make the
petals<00:03:47.370> curl<00:03:47.639> forward<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.150> could<00:03:48.269> also<00:03:48.389> curl

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
petals curl forward you could also curl

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.229 
petals curl forward you could also curl
them<00:03:49.019> backwards<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:50.370> popped<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.909> Centers

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
them backwards and I popped the Centers

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.129 
them backwards and I popped the Centers
of<00:03:51.269> them<00:03:51.599> on<00:03:51.780> powertabs<00:03:52.739> which<00:03:53.190> are<00:03:53.930> not<00:03:54.930> as

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
of them on powertabs which are not as

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.629 
of them on powertabs which are not as
thick<00:03:55.379> as<00:03:55.560> most<00:03:55.769> dimensionals<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:56.489> they're

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
thick as most dimensionals but they're

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.280 
thick as most dimensionals but they're
really<00:03:56.819> sticky<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.479> they<00:03:57.599> they<00:03:57.930> just<00:03:58.139> give<00:03:58.260> a

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
really sticky and they they just give a

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.280 
really sticky and they they just give a
really<00:03:58.530> nice<00:03:58.650> effect<00:03:59.040> on<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.599> the<00:04:00.599> strip<00:04:00.989> of

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
really nice effect on this the strip of

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.219 
really nice effect on this the strip of
the<00:04:01.709> mod<00:04:01.889> window<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.790> something<00:04:03.479> I<00:04:03.599> know<00:04:03.659> not

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
the mod window is something I know not

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.259 
the mod window is something I know not
everybody<00:04:04.560> has<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.949> patience<00:04:05.340> for<00:04:05.549> but<00:04:06.120> what

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
everybody has the patience for but what

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.969 
everybody has the patience for but what
I<00:04:06.299> did<00:04:06.569> was<00:04:06.690> punch<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.109> out<00:04:07.169> of<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.379> couple<00:04:07.949> of

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
I did was punch it out of a couple of

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.539 
I did was punch it out of a couple of
colors<00:04:08.159> and<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:09.690> put<00:04:10.260> across<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.560> back<00:04:10.949> of<00:04:11.220> each

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
colors and I put across the back of each

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.300 
colors and I put across the back of each
one<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.849> them<00:04:12.090> some<00:04:12.510> scotch<00:04:12.840> tape<00:04:13.310> just

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
one of them some scotch tape just

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.189 
one of them some scotch tape just
regular<00:04:14.639> old<00:04:14.790> scotch<00:04:15.060> tape<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.540> then<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.959> put

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
regular old scotch tape and then I put

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.649 
regular old scotch tape and then I put
each<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.859> pieces<00:04:17.039> back<00:04:17.789> in<00:04:18.090> in<00:04:18.539> the

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
each of the pieces back in in the

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.539 
each of the pieces back in in the
pattern<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.169> I<00:04:19.199> wanted<00:04:19.560> kind<00:04:20.159> of<00:04:20.250> had<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> do

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
pattern that I wanted kind of had to do

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.969 
pattern that I wanted kind of had to do
some<00:04:20.760> random<00:04:20.970> figuring<00:04:21.719> out<00:04:21.870> where<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.650> wanted

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
some random figuring out where I wanted

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.100 
some random figuring out where I wanted
each<00:04:23.130> piece<00:04:23.400> but<00:04:23.639> I<00:04:23.760> think<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.090> effect<00:04:24.419> was

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
each piece but I think the effect was

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.410 
each piece but I think the effect was
well<00:04:25.349> worth<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.860> time<00:04:26.070> then

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
well worth the time then

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.300 
well worth the time then
spent<00:04:26.690> on<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.170> this<00:04:27.800> is<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.040> horizontal

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
spent on it this is the horizontal

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.900 
spent on it this is the horizontal
version<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.030> same<00:04:29.240> card<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:30.200> just<00:04:30.920> did
