00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.950 
because obviously green that's like the
motif<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.119> lots<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.450> lots<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> creatures

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
motif is just lots and lots of creatures

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
motif is just lots and lots of creatures
and<00:01:40.140> blues<00:01:40.799> motif<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.369> very<00:01:41.549> spell<00:01:41.850> oriented

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and blues motif is very spell oriented

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.109 
and blues motif is very spell oriented
so<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.710> fits<00:01:43.970> it's<00:01:44.970> kind

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
so of all this I think it fits it's kind

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.120 
so of all this I think it fits it's kind
of<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> bioengineering<00:01:46.170> feel<00:01:46.860> or

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
of like a bioengineering feel or

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
of like a bioengineering feel or
genetically<00:01:47.640> engineering<00:01:48.210> feel<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> kind

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
genetically engineering feel and it kind

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
genetically engineering feel and it kind
of<00:01:49.079> makes<00:01:49.229> sense<00:01:49.439> when<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.770> merge<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.280> themes

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
of makes sense when you merge the themes

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.280 
of makes sense when you merge the themes
of<00:01:51.030> green<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.450> blue<00:01:51.600> together<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.140> it's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
of green and blue together so it's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.569 
of green and blue together so it's
actually<00:01:52.530> pretty<00:01:52.680> cool<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
actually pretty cool I think they have a

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.280 
actually pretty cool I think they have a
lot<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> fish<00:01:54.030> people<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.630> crocodile<00:01:55.140> yeah

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
lot of fish people and crocodile yeah

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.959 
lot of fish people and crocodile yeah
like<00:01:55.590> right<00:01:55.799> yeah<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> crocodile<00:01:56.579> human

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
like right yeah the crocodile human

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.760 
like right yeah the crocodile human
who's<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> professor<00:01:58.530> they

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
who's it was like the professor they

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.440 
who's it was like the professor they
just<00:01:58.979> kind<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.579> amphibious

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
just kind of like it amphibious

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.179 
just kind of like it amphibious
human-type<00:02:01.110> looking<00:02:01.530> hiding<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.009> looks

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
human-type looking hiding it looks

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.609 
human-type looking hiding it looks
actually<00:02:02.399> really<00:02:02.880> cool<00:02:03.090> alright<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.990> art<00:02:04.140> so

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
actually really cool alright the art so

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.340 
actually really cool alright the art so
so<00:02:05.219> now<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.520> evolve<00:02:06.149> again<00:02:06.869> these

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
so now we know evolve again these

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.749 
so now we know evolve again these
creatures<00:02:07.619> come<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.489> guys<00:02:08.729> like

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
creatures come in as little guys like

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.540 
creatures come in as little guys like
110<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.840> something<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.979> maybe<00:02:11.370> they

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
110 to something like that maybe they

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.080 
110 to something like that maybe they
have<00:02:11.640> an<00:02:11.730> ability<00:02:11.819> there's<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.450> zero

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
have an ability there's a zero

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.089 
have an ability there's a zero
one<00:02:13.209> flyer<00:02:13.599> for<00:02:14.200> example<00:02:14.560> with<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> Volvo

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
one flyer for example with a Volvo

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.290 
one flyer for example with a Volvo
spoiled<00:02:15.519> it<00:02:15.640> we'll<00:02:15.760> talk<00:02:15.940> about<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.120> later

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
spoiled it we'll talk about that later

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.050 
spoiled it we'll talk about that later
on<00:02:16.569> but<00:02:17.190> evolve<00:02:18.190> could<00:02:18.430> be<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.580> really<00:02:18.849> really

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
on but evolve could be a really really

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.640 
on but evolve could be a really really
cool<00:02:19.150> mechanic<00:02:19.569> if<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.989> really<00:02:20.349> like<00:02:20.470> playing

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
cool mechanic if you really like playing

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.920 
cool mechanic if you really like playing
a<00:02:20.800> lot<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.010> creatures<00:02:21.540> obviously<00:02:22.540> blue<00:02:22.750> gives

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
a lot of creatures obviously blue gives

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
a lot of creatures obviously blue gives
you<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.110> benefit<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.500> having<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.830> lot<00:02:23.920> of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
you the benefit of having a lot of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.470 
you the benefit of having a lot of
counter<00:02:24.220> spells<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.610> control<00:02:25.000> at<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.300> same

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
counter spells and control at the same

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.960 
counter spells and control at the same
time<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.290> I'm<00:02:26.620> expecting<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.400> lot<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.610> tap<00:02:27.790> down

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
time so I'm expecting a lot of tap down

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.250 
time so I'm expecting a lot of tap down
mechanics<00:02:28.510> because<00:02:28.810> you're<00:02:28.989> going<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.140> have

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
mechanics because you're going to have

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.440 
mechanics because you're going to have
so<00:02:29.410> many<00:02:29.530> creatures<00:02:29.769> in<00:02:30.519> blue<00:02:30.879> that's<00:02:31.150> that's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
so many creatures in blue that's that's

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.580 
so many creatures in blue that's that's
just<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.720> way<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.870> go<00:02:32.049> one<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.470> interesting

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
just a way to go one of the interesting

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.930 
just a way to go one of the interesting
things<00:02:33.099> that<00:02:33.190> happened<00:02:33.519> in<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.670> last

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
things that happened in this last

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.759 
things that happened in this last
rotation<00:02:34.269> is<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.690> know<00:02:34.750> bent<00:02:35.080> became<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.500> huge

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
rotation is you know bent became a huge

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.259 
rotation is you know bent became a huge
color<00:02:36.010> combination<00:02:36.459> which<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> white<00:02:36.970> blue

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
color combination which is white blue

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.410 
color combination which is white blue
green<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.980> kind<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.250> adds<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.879> that<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.299> so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
green this kind of adds to that and so

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.180 
green this kind of adds to that and so
maybe<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.930> know<00:02:41.019> fathom<00:02:41.500> mage<00:02:41.620> seems<00:02:42.010> it's

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
maybe you know fathom mage seems it's

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.100 
maybe you know fathom mage seems it's
not<00:02:42.340> really<00:02:42.730> it's<00:02:42.819> kind<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.269> control<00:02:43.690> ecard

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
not really it's kind of a control ecard

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.449 
not really it's kind of a control ecard
but<00:02:44.349> it's<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.500> little<00:02:44.680> expensive<00:02:44.890> for<00:02:45.250> a

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
but it's a little expensive for a

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.550 
but it's a little expensive for a
creature<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.480> there's<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.989> lot<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.200> different

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
creature so there's a lot of different

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.630 
creature so there's a lot of different
ways<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:47.920> could<00:02:48.010> approach<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.459> you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
ways that you could approach this you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.430 
ways that you could approach this you
could<00:02:48.760> try<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.239> put<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.660> mid-range<00:02:50.110> tech

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
could try to put in a mid-range tech

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.140 
could try to put in a mid-range tech
with<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.709> know<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:51.010> ton<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.400> three<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.880> six

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
with you know that ton of three to six

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.390 
with you know that ton of three to six
minute<00:02:52.480> costs<00:02:52.660> creature<00:02:53.110> range<00:02:53.380> but<00:02:54.250> there's

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
minute costs creature range but there's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.830 
minute costs creature range but there's
also<00:02:54.549> something<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.150> know<00:02:55.329> where<00:02:55.690> people

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
also something you know where people

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.539 
also something you know where people
could<00:02:56.079> go<00:02:56.200> back<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.650> know<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.890> Drago

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
could go back to the you know the Drago

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.130 
could go back to the you know the Drago
style<00:02:57.970> playing<00:02:58.329> where<00:02:58.510> people<00:02:58.780> just<00:02:58.870> didn't

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
style playing where people just didn't

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.839 
style playing where people just didn't
play<00:02:59.230> creatures<00:02:59.680> inlaid<00:02:59.920> with<00:03:00.040> game<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.579> drop

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
play creatures inlaid with game and drop

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.640 
play creatures inlaid with game and drop
that<00:03:00.879> from<00:03:01.239> work<00:03:01.390> our<00:03:01.629> advantage<00:03:02.079> there's<00:03:02.560> a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
that from work our advantage there's a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.140 
that from work our advantage there's a
lot<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:02.890> different<00:03:03.310> ways<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.730> can<00:03:03.940> use

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
lot of different ways that you can use

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.449 
lot of different ways that you can use
this<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:05.290> first<00:03:05.530> way<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.920> thought<00:03:06.310> about

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
this the first way that I thought about

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.190 
this the first way that I thought about
using<00:03:06.730> fathom<00:03:07.269> age<00:03:07.390> was<00:03:07.569> actually<00:03:07.930> using

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
using fathom age was actually using

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.990 
using fathom age was actually using
things<00:03:08.470> like<00:03:08.590> common<00:03:09.129> bond<00:03:09.370> or<00:03:09.549> increasing

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
things like common bond or increasing

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.420 
things like common bond or increasing
century<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.319> put<00:03:11.560> counters<00:03:12.010> on<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.280> which

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
century to just put counters on it which

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.890 
century to just put counters on it which
gets<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.790> lot<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:13.000> cards<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.420> get<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.720> big

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
gets you a lot of cards and get to a big

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.390 
gets you a lot of cards and get to a big
creature<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.920> know<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.160> vulnerable

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
creature but you know it's vulnerable

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.979 
creature but you know it's vulnerable
just<00:03:15.849> like<00:03:15.970> any<00:03:16.150> other<00:03:16.239> creature<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.810> fact

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
just like any other creature of the fact

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.449 
just like any other creature of the fact
it<00:03:17.139> doesn't<00:03:17.319> have<00:03:17.470> hexproof<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:18.130> doesn't<00:03:18.340> have

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
it doesn't have hexproof it doesn't have

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.069 
it doesn't have hexproof it doesn't have
evasion<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.970> doesn't<00:03:19.239> protect<00:03:19.510> itself<00:03:19.810> very

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
evasion it doesn't protect itself very

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.800 
evasion it doesn't protect itself very
well<00:03:20.139> but<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.459> for<00:03:21.970> me<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.510> car<00:03:22.690> I'm

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
well but I it for me it's the car I'm

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.270 
well but I it for me it's the car I'm
most<00:03:23.230> looking<00:03:23.410> forward<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.829> trying<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.069> figure

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
most looking forward to trying to figure

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.250 
most looking forward to trying to figure
out<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.430> way<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.609> break<00:03:24.940> because<00:03:25.810> out<00:03:26.019> of<00:03:26.049> all

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
out a way to break because out of all

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.050 
out a way to break because out of all
the<00:03:26.410> mechanics<00:03:26.889> especially<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.489> fathom<00:03:27.730> age

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
the mechanics especially in fathom age

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.150 
the mechanics especially in fathom age
evolve<00:03:28.900> with<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.139> fact<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.560> when<00:03:29.829> it<00:03:29.950> grows

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
evolve with the fact that when it grows

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.979 
evolve with the fact that when it grows
gets<00:03:30.549> you<00:03:30.639> card<00:03:30.940> advantage<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.480> really<00:03:31.810> really

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
gets you card advantage is really really

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.559 
gets you card advantage is really really
unique<00:03:32.319> yeah<00:03:32.650> common<00:03:33.040> bond<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.579> increasing

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
unique yeah common bond and increasing

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.599 
unique yeah common bond and increasing
savagery<00:03:35.049> are<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.889> really<00:03:36.459> obvious

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
savagery are like the really obvious

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.420 
savagery are like the really obvious
applications<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.829> you<00:03:38.829> know<00:03:38.950> that's<00:03:39.310> going

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
applications and you know that's going

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.099 
applications and you know that's going
to<00:03:39.519> get<00:03:39.609> you<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> big<00:03:40.090> burst<00:03:40.389> of<00:03:40.569> cards<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.019> can

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
to get you a big burst of cards you can

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.750 
to get you a big burst of cards you can
almost<00:03:41.260> play<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.680> like<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> sphinx's

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
almost play it like a sphinx's

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.750 
almost play it like a sphinx's
revelation<00:03:42.790> yeah<00:03:43.540> but<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.799> thing<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.400> like

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
revelation yeah but the thing is like

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.569 
revelation yeah but the thing is like
let's<00:03:46.630> say<00:03:46.750> fathom<00:03:47.349> mage<00:03:47.470> gets<00:03:47.739> huge<00:03:48.069> gets<00:03:48.459> a

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
let's say fathom mage gets huge gets a

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.280 
let's say fathom mage gets huge gets a
ton<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.760> telling<00:03:49.060> ton<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:49.630> counters<00:03:49.989> on<00:03:50.139> it

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
ton of telling ton of counters on it

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.470 
ton of telling ton of counters on it
after<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.829> it's<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.310> huge<00:03:51.609> draw<00:03:52.030> engine

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
after that it's just a huge draw engine

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.420 
after that it's just a huge draw engine
that's<00:03:52.690> not<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.500> could<00:03:53.769> use<00:03:53.919> it<00:03:54.040> as<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:54.160> blocker

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
that's not you could use it as a blocker

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.099 
that's not you could use it as a blocker
in<00:03:54.790> some<00:03:55.209> instances<00:03:55.599> but<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.840> don't<00:03:56.019> really

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
in some instances but you don't really

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.379 
in some instances but you don't really
want<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.470> attacking<00:03:56.769> with<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.130> because<00:03:57.389> you

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
want to be attacking with it because you

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.699 
want to be attacking with it because you
know<00:03:58.510> you're<00:03:58.780> getting<00:03:58.959> lots<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.500> card

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
know you're getting lots of card

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.050 
know you're getting lots of card
advantage<00:03:59.859> rent<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.459> don't<00:04:00.609> want<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.819> ruin

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
advantage rent you don't want to ruin

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.729 
advantage rent you don't want to ruin
that<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.540> sometimes<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.079> know<00:04:02.139> combat<00:04:02.500> tricks

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
that so sometimes you know combat tricks

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:03.990 
that so sometimes you know combat tricks
could<00:04:02.950> get<00:04:03.099> rid<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.880> other

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
could get rid of that of you the other

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.640 
could get rid of that of you the other
things<00:04:04.299> are<00:04:04.450> around<00:04:04.540> too<00:04:04.840> much<00:04:04.989> people<00:04:05.470> also

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
things are around too much people also

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.870 
things are around too much people also
brought<00:04:05.919> up<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.160> Center<00:04:06.459> does<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:06.730> really

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
brought up that Center does it really

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.240 
brought up that Center does it really
well<00:04:07.060> with<00:04:07.209> golgari<00:04:07.829> especially<00:04:08.829> scheduling

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
well with golgari especially scheduling

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.400 
well with golgari especially scheduling
yes<00:04:09.669> scattered<00:04:10.090> or<00:04:10.419> Shack<00:04:10.690> minus--<00:04:11.079> so<00:04:11.290> that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
yes scattered or Shack minus-- so that

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.839 
yes scattered or Shack minus-- so that
it<00:04:11.500> gets<00:04:11.620> twice<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.099> amount<00:04:12.190> of<00:04:12.340> counters<00:04:12.700> you

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
it gets twice the amount of counters you

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.390 
it gets twice the amount of counters you
can<00:04:13.000> try<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.209> abuse<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.840> way<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:15.010> then

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
can try to abuse it that way and then

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.770 
can try to abuse it that way and then
there's<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.730> fact<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.329> know<00:04:16.450> with<00:04:16.630> some

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
there's the fact that you know with some

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.180 
there's the fact that you know with some
of<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.959> other<00:04:17.019> simet<00:04:17.410> cards<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.799> count<00:04:18.010> as<00:04:18.130> a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
of the other simet cards that count as a

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.370 
of the other simet cards that count as a
way<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.400> transfer<00:04:18.970> +1<00:04:19.389> counters<00:04:19.780> from<00:04:20.049> one

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
way to transfer +1 counters from one

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.550 
way to transfer +1 counters from one
creatures<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.919> another<00:04:21.130> so

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
creatures to another so

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.560 
creatures to another so
and<00:04:22.340> there's<00:04:22.669> also<00:04:22.790> ways<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.270> can<00:04:23.389> use<00:04:23.419> it

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
and there's also ways you can use it

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.629 
and there's also ways you can use it
with<00:04:23.750> say<00:04:23.960> restoration<00:04:24.680> angel<00:04:25.040> where<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:25.430> get

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
with say restoration angel where you get

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.250 
with say restoration angel where you get
it<00:04:25.669> big<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.150> then<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.389> reset<00:04:26.810> abstract<00:04:27.110> to

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
it big and then you reset abstract to

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.870 
it big and then you reset abstract to
one<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.710> then<00:04:27.830> enter<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.250> battlefield<00:04:28.490> and

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
one and then enter the battlefield and

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.760 
one and then enter the battlefield and
synergize<00:04:29.240> pretty<00:04:29.570> well<00:04:29.690> drag<00:04:30.110> test<00:04:30.440> because

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
synergize pretty well drag test because

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.860 
synergize pretty well drag test because
you<00:04:30.860> can<00:04:30.980> get<00:04:31.100> two<00:04:31.250> creatures<00:04:31.460> that<00:04:31.820> way<00:04:32.030> it

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
you can get two creatures that way it

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.510 
you can get two creatures that way it
has<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.020> lot<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.350> interactions<00:04:34.070> of<00:04:34.160> things<00:04:34.370> that

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
has a lot of interactions of things that

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.280 
has a lot of interactions of things that
are<00:04:34.610> popular<00:04:34.820> in<00:04:35.060> standard<00:04:35.480> right<00:04:35.660> now<00:04:35.840> yeah

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
are popular in standard right now yeah

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.860 
are popular in standard right now yeah
so<00:04:36.560> if<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.740> had<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.919> give<00:04:37.100> this<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.760> score<00:04:38.660> we're

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
so if you had to give this a score we're

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.240 
so if you had to give this a score we're
going<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.050> use<00:04:39.169> just<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.710> one<00:04:39.889> through<00:04:40.070> five

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
going to use just a one through five

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.800 
going to use just a one through five
scale<00:04:40.639> because<00:04:40.940> that's<00:04:41.210> what<00:04:41.300> everybody<00:04:41.660> does

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
scale because that's what everybody does

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.040 
scale because that's what everybody does
it<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.230> understandable<00:04:43.120> for<00:04:44.120> limited<00:04:44.750> play

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
it is understandable for limited play

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.330 
it is understandable for limited play
what<00:04:45.440> do<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.560> think<00:04:45.620> it's<00:04:45.980> going<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.190> look

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
what do you think it's going to look

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.370 
what do you think it's going to look
like<00:04:46.370> in<00:04:46.940> limited<00:04:47.419> it's<00:04:47.900> anywhere<00:04:48.200> between

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
like in limited it's anywhere between

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.129 
like in limited it's anywhere between
two<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:48.889> three<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.460> me<00:04:49.610> because<00:04:49.820> if<00:04:50.389> you<00:04:50.600> get

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
two to three to me because if you get

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.290 
two to three to me because if you get
things<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:51.800> are<00:04:52.040> able<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.400> put<00:04:52.639> counters<00:04:53.090> on

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
things that are able to put counters on

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.330 
things that are able to put counters on
fathom<00:04:53.780> age<00:04:53.960> or<00:04:54.260> if<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.710> just<00:04:54.770> get<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:55.070> lot<00:04:55.310> of

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
66 like it's hard to actually stop that

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
that in combat and it's already United

you<00:05:15.530> a<00:05:15.560> ton<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.860> cards<00:05:16.340> um<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.450> in<00:05:18.790> constructive

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
you a ton of cards um in in constructive

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.930 
you a ton of cards um in in constructive
it's<00:05:20.060> hard<00:05:20.360> I<00:05:20.600> want<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.900> say<00:05:21.139> 30<00:05:21.910> but<00:05:22.910> it's

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
it's hard I want to say 30 but it's

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.540 
it's hard I want to say 30 but it's
probably<00:05:23.419> closer<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.780> 2.5<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.650> guess<00:05:25.220> would<00:05:25.520> be

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
probably closer to 2.5 I guess would be

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.730 
probably closer to 2.5 I guess would be
the<00:05:25.910> way<00:05:26.060> it's<00:05:26.240> a<00:05:26.360> because<00:05:26.570> while<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.500> is

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
the way it's a because while it is

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.380 
the way it's a because while it is
something<00:05:28.400> that<00:05:28.640> you<00:05:28.789> might<00:05:28.970> be<00:05:29.030> able<00:05:29.270> to

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
something that you might be able to

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.510 
something that you might be able to
break<00:05:29.720> it's<00:05:30.050> not<00:05:30.289> really<00:05:30.560> that<00:05:30.860> strong<00:05:31.220> by

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
break it's not really that strong by

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.760 
break it's not really that strong by
itself<00:05:31.910> where<00:05:32.360> is<00:05:32.479> mana<00:05:32.780> it's<00:05:33.289> for<00:05:33.500> mana

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
itself where is mana it's for mana

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.380 
itself where is mana it's for mana
whereas<00:05:34.220> cards<00:05:34.610> obviously<00:05:34.970> like<00:05:35.090> thragtusk

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
whereas cards obviously like thragtusk

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.719 
whereas cards obviously like thragtusk
is<00:05:35.930> oh<00:05:36.050> I<00:05:36.260> almost<00:05:36.530> any<00:05:36.890> deck<00:05:37.160> it<00:05:37.310> has<00:05:37.430> grain

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
is oh I almost any deck it has grain

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.340 
is oh I almost any deck it has grain
that's<00:05:37.970> just<00:05:38.180> good<00:05:38.390> by<00:05:38.570> itself<00:05:38.600> worth<00:05:39.110> out<00:05:39.320> of

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
that's just good by itself worth out of

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.990 
that's just good by itself worth out of
age<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:40.070> can't<00:05:40.310> have<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:40.520> find<00:05:40.729> a<00:05:40.820> way<00:05:40.850> to

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
age you can't have to find a way to

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.490 
age you can't have to find a way to
breathe<00:05:41.300> that's<00:05:41.510> true<00:05:41.660> it<00:05:41.810> requires<00:05:42.200> other

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
breathe that's true it requires other

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.610 
breathe that's true it requires other
pieces<00:05:42.919> to<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.460> puzzle<00:05:43.610> but<00:05:44.210> in<00:05:45.140> women<00:05:45.440> did<00:05:45.530> I

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
pieces to the puzzle but in women did I

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.080 
pieces to the puzzle but in women did I
agree<00:05:45.890> at<00:05:46.010> drawing<00:05:46.190> cards<00:05:46.550> is<00:05:46.669> just<00:05:46.910> crazy

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
agree at drawing cards is just crazy

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.360 
agree at drawing cards is just crazy
good<00:05:47.270> I'm<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:47.990> little<00:05:48.229> curious<00:05:48.410> how<00:05:48.770> drafts

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
good I'm a little curious how drafts

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.340 
good I'm a little curious how drafts
will<00:05:49.520> go<00:05:49.729> with<00:05:50.150> all<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.660> evolved<00:05:50.960> creatures

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
will go with all the evolved creatures

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.050 
will go with all the evolved creatures
you<00:05:51.530> don't<00:05:51.740> necessarily<00:05:52.370> want<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:52.789> ton<00:05:53.030> of

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
you don't necessarily want a ton of

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.909 
you don't necessarily want a ton of
evolved<00:05:53.539> errs<00:05:53.690> because<00:05:54.110> then<00:05:54.320> you're<00:05:54.830> not

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
evolved errs because then you're not

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.100 
evolved errs because then you're not
triggering<00:05:55.310> it<00:05:55.520> as<00:05:55.639> often<00:05:55.820> yeah<00:05:56.210> so<00:05:56.960> you're

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
triggering it as often yeah so you're

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.659 
triggering it as often yeah so you're
going<00:05:57.200> to<00:05:57.260> want<00:05:57.440> a<00:05:57.650> good<00:05:57.830> balance<00:05:58.190> of<00:05:58.310> evolved

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
going to want a good balance of evolved

00:05:58.669 --> 00:05:59.950 
going to want a good balance of evolved
creatures<00:05:59.060> and<00:05:59.270> other<00:05:59.389> green<00:05:59.660> and<00:05:59.810> blue

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
creatures and other green and blue

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.750 
creatures and other green and blue
creatures<00:06:00.320> that<00:06:00.530> are<00:06:00.590> just<00:06:00.889> you<00:06:01.160> know<00:06:01.250> fatties

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
creatures that are just you know fatties

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.730 
creatures that are just you know fatties
so<00:06:02.630> you<00:06:02.720> can<00:06:02.840> keep<00:06:02.960> everything<00:06:03.229> growing<00:06:03.560> at

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
so you can keep everything growing at

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.770 
so you can keep everything growing at
once<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.820> know<00:06:04.940> we<00:06:05.150> obviously<00:06:05.330> still

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
once and you know we obviously still

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.600 
once and you know we obviously still
need<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> lot<00:06:06.050> more<00:06:06.169> card<00:06:06.500> spoiled<00:06:06.889> to<00:06:07.070> see<00:06:07.280> if

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
need a lot more card spoiled to see if

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.250 
need a lot more card spoiled to see if
fathom<00:06:08.090> mage<00:06:08.150> is<00:06:08.330> going<00:06:08.510> to<00:06:08.570> be<00:06:08.690> that<00:06:08.930> must

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
fathom mage is going to be that must

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.790 
fathom mage is going to be that must
have<00:06:09.440> car<00:06:09.710> door<00:06:10.100> or<00:06:10.520> not<00:06:10.910> so<00:06:11.240> I<00:06:12.050> don't<00:06:12.590> know<00:06:12.650> as

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
have car door or not so I don't know as

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.260 
have car door or not so I don't know as
much<00:06:12.919> about<00:06:12.979> constructed<00:06:13.729> I<00:06:13.880> would<00:06:14.000> say<00:06:14.180> it's

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
much about constructed I would say it's

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.450 
much about constructed I would say it's
probably<00:06:14.419> a<00:06:14.690> little<00:06:15.229> lower<00:06:15.500> than<00:06:15.800> Frank<00:06:16.340> is

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
probably a little lower than Frank is

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.490 
probably a little lower than Frank is
okay<00:06:16.789> I<00:06:17.030> think<00:06:17.450> he's<00:06:17.570> just<00:06:17.660> excited<00:06:18.139> I<00:06:18.200> wanted

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
okay I think he's just excited I wanted

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.260 
okay I think he's just excited I wanted
to<00:06:18.590> buy<00:06:18.710> stick<00:06:18.979> um<00:06:19.370> I'm<00:06:19.639> gonna<00:06:19.760> give<00:06:19.940> it<00:06:20.000> a<00:06:20.090> two

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
to buy stick um I'm gonna give it a two

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.090 
to buy stick um I'm gonna give it a two
and<00:06:20.690> you<00:06:20.810> know<00:06:20.930> it's<00:06:21.080> not<00:06:21.229> obviously<00:06:21.860> not

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
and you know it's not obviously not

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.760 
and you know it's not obviously not
useless<00:06:22.580> but<00:06:23.030> again<00:06:23.419> it's<00:06:23.750> it<00:06:24.260> requires<00:06:24.590> other

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
useless but again it's it requires other

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.970 
useless but again it's it requires other
pieces<00:06:25.039> and<00:06:25.310> that<00:06:25.400> can<00:06:25.520> be<00:06:25.580> tough

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
pieces and that can be tough

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.530 
pieces and that can be tough
and<00:06:26.100> standard<00:06:26.790> when<00:06:26.940> you've<00:06:27.060> got<00:06:27.180> things<00:06:27.360> that

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
and standard when you've got things that

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.090 
and standard when you've got things that
are<00:06:27.630> running<00:06:27.780> around<00:06:27.900> by<00:06:28.200> themselves<00:06:28.350> yeah

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
are running around by themselves yeah

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.340 
are running around by themselves yeah
being<00:06:29.490> very<00:06:29.700> powerful<00:06:30.180> so<00:06:30.390> I<00:06:30.600> think<00:06:31.200> that's

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
being very powerful so I think that's

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.050 
being very powerful so I think that's
pretty<00:06:31.470> much<00:06:31.590> it<00:06:31.650> for<00:06:31.890> fab<00:06:32.250> image<00:06:32.550> thanks<00:06:32.940> very
