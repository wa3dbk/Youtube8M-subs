00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
thing that I was thinking is a lot of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.170 
thing that I was thinking is a lot of
people<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:55.980> hearing<00:00:56.250> me<00:00:56.370> scream<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> top

of<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.390> lungs<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
of my lungs right now and that was a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.869 
of my lungs right now and that was a
little<00:00:58.710> bit<00:00:58.859> awkward<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.520> first<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.850> just

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
little bit awkward at first I just

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.700 
little bit awkward at first I just
closed<00:01:00.239> my<00:01:00.329> eyes<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.539> sang<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.590> actually

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
closed my eyes and sang and it actually

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.210 
closed my eyes and sang and it actually
sounded<00:01:02.129> pretty<00:01:02.250> good<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.300> think<00:01:04.220> we

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
sounded pretty good so I think we

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.480 
sounded pretty good so I think we
recorded<00:01:05.640> outside<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.600> wanted<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
recorded outside because we wanted to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
recorded outside because we wanted to
just<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> different<00:01:09.119> sound<00:01:09.270> on

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510
