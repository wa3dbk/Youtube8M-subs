00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.070 

so<00:00:03.899> as<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.170> continued<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.859> achieve<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:06.080> studs

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
so as I continued to achieve the studs

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.850 
so as I continued to achieve the studs
with<00:00:07.379> OSB<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.340> decided<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.120> stop<00:00:09.690> putting<00:00:10.650> up

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
with OSB I decided to stop putting up

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.180 
with OSB I decided to stop putting up
the<00:00:11.070> walls<00:00:11.309> when<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.700> got<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:13.590> section<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the walls when I got to the section of

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.770 
the walls when I got to the section of
shop<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.759> reason<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.420> I'm<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
shop and the reason is is I'm in the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.230 
shop and the reason is is I'm in the
process<00:00:16.199> as<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> can<00:00:16.560> see<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.119> building<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
process as you can see of building the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.720 
process as you can see of building the
framework<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> couple<00:00:19.350> benches<00:00:19.730> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
framework for a couple benches the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.750 
framework for a couple benches the
method<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.300> use<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.800> two-tiered

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
method that I use is I have a two-tiered

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.120 
method that I use is I have a two-tiered
bench<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.539> shelf<00:00:24.960> that's<00:00:25.080> 21<00:00:25.680> inches<00:00:25.949> on

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
bench I have a shelf that's 21 inches on

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.519 
bench I have a shelf that's 21 inches on
the<00:00:26.189> top<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.640> 24<00:00:27.119> inches<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.320> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the top it's 24 inches and what I do is

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.439 
the top it's 24 inches and what I do is
I<00:00:28.619> actually<00:00:28.740> mount<00:00:29.189> these<00:00:29.400> right<00:00:30.090> into<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
I actually mount these right into the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.830 
I actually mount these right into the
studs<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.800> couple<00:00:32.250> front<00:00:32.669> legs<00:00:32.910> I'll

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
studs and then a couple front legs I'll

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.540 
studs and then a couple front legs I'll
show<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> method<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.860> making<00:00:35.219> them<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.489> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
show you a method in making them but I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.220 
show you a method in making them but I
just<00:00:35.820> said<00:00:36.000> why<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.809> hold<00:00:36.960> off<00:00:37.200> putting

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
just said why don't I hold off putting

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.220 
just said why don't I hold off putting
up<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.850> sheets<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.809> know<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.050> she

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
up the the sheets you know the she

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
up the the sheets you know the she
product<00:00:40.710> instead<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.190> trying<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.430> figure<00:00:41.700> out

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
product instead of trying to figure out

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.790 
product instead of trying to figure out
where<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> studs<00:00:42.360> are<00:00:42.570> I'll<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> well<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
where the studs are I'll do it well the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.670 
where the studs are I'll do it well the
studs<00:00:44.070> are<00:00:44.219> exposed<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.480> anyways<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.649> my

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
studs are exposed but anyways this is my

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
studs are exposed but anyways this is my
method<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.219> building<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> couple<00:00:48.180> benches

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
method for building a couple benches

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.240 
method for building a couple benches
I've<00:00:48.719> made<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> couple<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> past<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.039> time

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
I've made a couple in the past this time

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.540 
I've made a couple in the past this time
I'm<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.809> sort<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.870> make<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> elf<00:00:52.620> l-shaped

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I'm going to sort of make a elf l-shaped

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
I'm going to sort of make a elf l-shaped
bench<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.690> 8<00:00:54.870> foot<00:00:55.170> by<00:00:55.379> 2<00:00:55.440> foot

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
bench it's going to be 8 foot by 2 foot

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.869 
bench it's going to be 8 foot by 2 foot
deep<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.109> this<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.289> will<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.730> got<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
deep and this one will be got the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.849 
deep and this one will be got the
extension<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.020> it'll<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.770> an

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
extension on there so it'll be an

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.290 
extension on there so it'll be an
l-shaped<00:01:02.250> patch<00:01:02.430> let<00:01:02.699> me<00:01:02.789> show<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> do

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
l-shaped patch let me show you what I do

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
l-shaped patch let me show you what I do
get<00:01:03.989> everything<00:01:04.170> I'll<00:01:04.350> cut<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.920> only

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
get everything I'll cut out the only

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.330 
get everything I'll cut out the only
thing<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> extra<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> legs

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
thing that is extra is that the legs

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.740 
thing that is extra is that the legs
which<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.490> believe<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:08.880> thirty<00:01:09.150> seven<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
which I believe are thirty seven and a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.620 
which I believe are thirty seven and a
quarter<00:01:10.020> high<00:01:10.439> 37<00:01:11.280> quarter<00:01:11.820> seems<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
quarter high 37 quarter seems to be a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.980 
quarter high 37 quarter seems to be a
good<00:01:13.320> height<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.950> once<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.340> put<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.150> 3/4

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
good height because once I put the 3/4

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
good height because once I put the 3/4
inch<00:01:16.380> plywood<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:19.220> 38<00:01:20.220> inches<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
inch plywood on there on 38 inches for a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.420 
inch plywood on there on 38 inches for a
bench<00:01:21.780> height<00:01:22.170> seems<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.770> perfect<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.310> me

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
bench height seems to be perfect for me

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
bench height seems to be perfect for me
but<00:01:24.180> let<00:01:24.390> me<00:01:24.450> show<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> how<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:25.020> my

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
but let me show you how we make my

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.240 
but let me show you how we make my
benches<00:01:26.299> first<00:01:27.299> thing<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.070> take<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
benches first thing I do I take the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.460 
benches first thing I do I take the
height<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> top<00:01:30.180> bench<00:01:30.509> which<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.810> 37

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
height of the top bench which is 37

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.060 
height of the top bench which is 37
recorder<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.030> start<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> stuff

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.240 

I<00:01:36.600> love<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.750> she's<00:01:37.960> going<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.290> be<00:01:38.409> at<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.770> 13

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
I love that she's going to be at the 13

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.289 
I love that she's going to be at the 13
inch<00:01:39.400> mark<00:01:39.700> while<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.120> top<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.540> us<00:01:40.690> will<00:01:40.840> be

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.929 

now<00:01:44.170> I'm<00:01:44.439> going<00:01:44.680> to<00:01:44.770> couple<00:01:45.189> support<00:01:45.700> pieces

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
now I'm going to couple support pieces

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.350 
now I'm going to couple support pieces
in<00:01:46.270> here<00:01:46.509> this'll<00:01:47.259> be<00:01:47.619> F<00:01:47.880> these<00:01:48.880> are<00:01:48.939> nine<00:01:49.329> and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
in here this'll be F these are nine and

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.179 
in here this'll be F these are nine and
a<00:01:49.600> half<00:01:49.659> because<00:01:50.229> between<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.619> nine<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.159> a

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
a half because between the nine and a

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.130 
a half because between the nine and a
half<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.640> height<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.090> bench<00:01:52.330> and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
half and the height of the bench and

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.840 
half and the height of the bench and
come<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.680> thirteen<00:01:54.159> which<00:01:54.399> is<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.670> higher

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
