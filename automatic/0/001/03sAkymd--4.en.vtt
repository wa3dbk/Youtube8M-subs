00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.810
 the goal of step 5 is to make in 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.160
 the white cross the side colors 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.160
 match the centers 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.820
 let's see how to do it 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.040
 we look now at how many edges there are 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.220
 that have a side color like the 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.980
 center is not 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.580
 this is not 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.520
 it's like this 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.830
 and this is not only one we want there to be 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.950
 two therefore we turn the face 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.750
 superior to see we will contact the time 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.340
 this is not 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.610
 it's like this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.340
 this one if it does not 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.680
 that is, we have the two that we were looking for 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.170
 there are two possibilities that the two that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.530
 they coincide they are side by side 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.020
 as is the case or that they were put 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.950
 that is to say that this was fine and that 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.570
 is 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.570
 let's see what to do in each case 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.220
 if the two edges that are good are 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.830
 next to each other we hold the cube 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.500
 so that they are on the right side and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.620
 on the back face 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.290
 now we will only move the right face and 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.990
 the top face and we'll look at this 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.450
 couple of pieces in our case the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.540
 view of the red and blue and the vertex the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.140
 red blue and yellow 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.650
 we will raise the couple to the upper face and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.690
 we will take her out for a walk 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.310
 we will stop the movement of the face 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.960
 right 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.270
 the couple will leave even more patient 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.690
 we will turn the right face to bring the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.240
 yellows 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.170
 the couple will return completely from 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.990
 ride and will lower your position 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.979
 we will see that the center does not coincide with the 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.250
 view but if we rotate the top face 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.430
 Now this does match this too 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.430
 as well 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.620
 if the two edges that are good not 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.020
 are side by side but that 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.069
 they are in opposite positions for example 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.999
 is 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.159
 and this is to say these two what we will do 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.290
 will apply the movements of the case 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.740
 previous and so we will get them to be 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.870
 together 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.150
 let's look at this couple here 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.310
 and we raise it to the upper face and the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.530
 We took the walk down the yellows 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.530
 we take out more to walk to the wall 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.940
 we climb the yellows 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:46.840
 the couple returns completely and lowers their 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.320
 position now we will have this list well 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.470
 and this too, however, this will be 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.720
 wrong and this will be wrong we hold the bucket 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.510
 so that those who are well are in 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.060
 the right face on the back face and we 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.520
 we look at this pair of pieces 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.319
 We climbed to the top face and 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.080
 We took the walk down the yellows 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.460
 the couple goes out for more walks 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.990
 we climb the yellows the couple returns 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.319
 completely the ride and go down to your 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.569
 position 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:25.730
 now this does not match but if we turn 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:29.890
 the top face will coincide the 4 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.890
 and now the time to go to step 6 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.350
 to me
