00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 hello to you so here I show you the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.980
 generator that makes 110 stainless steel plates 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.710
 so I'm plugging here so generators 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.890
 and there by the rods passes in this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.910
 homemade tank 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.699
 then I go through our tank 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.970
 that a bÃ¼hler greenhouse simply 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.369
 and stop hd flame on libe he 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590
 works very well at the end I 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.489
 always the little hi words that's like 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.320
 usually and there I took a life that's 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 a tungsten rod and then the pipes 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.670
 to show you all this is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.680
 plugged so I do not adhere to plug in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.239
 done on hard points of rapids and the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.989
 embarrassment because for the moment I have not 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.390
 still plugged pwm regulation of 120 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.449
 I make today but it is necessary that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.070
 so I'm trying for the moment I'm going 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.789
 this video then I have to 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.930
 compare report will have for theme 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.829
 classic power if we have some 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:07.610
 more reasons actually there so I you 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.610
 was starting to sight 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:25.049
 I would like the mirror 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.560
 iwata wattmeter the same thing so that 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:43.079
 made of emulators 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:45.299
 I had seen so here I have the cat humor 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.429
 largely nothing to do with their fact 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.590
 generator that's here these generators 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:59.220
 of sail that serve the blow that is going to be 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:01.429
 replaced by following 220 already not me 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.429
 complain 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.850
 thanks to simple copper types 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.490
 so here now I can do 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.380
 blush the tube what I could not 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.680
 before so I should be able to use it 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.140
 to do welding on pipes 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.850
 simply before the heat 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.190
 did not distribute well on the tube 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.130
 so it did not work and there we actually 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.490
 see that it works rather well than 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.410
 the type except well as it should be seen 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.900
 weird things the surface of the 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.420
 deforms a little short here is the pull of 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.990
 text m it's not too much what it gives 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.990
 what we see there 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.920
 So here it is pure tungsten it 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.920
 admit green 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.810
 so they burn down squarely 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.760
 I was trying to manipulate one but 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:13.069
 I do not think it will work and souzy 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.239
 together do not dream I think I 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.239
 can still this power in there 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.100
 crowd to his banks or fire that 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.100
 in the name it does not stick 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.610
 it's a small town that's 13 of 10 6% 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.610
 20 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.210
 here is the end of the prophet 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.220
 I can see these dukurs fronts 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.940
 or suede is good but that is the 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.650
 new only 220 volts 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.010
 I show you the bubbling the stop 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.060
 flames 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.440
 so actually see him here at 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.830
 plan rectors I cut the line of the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.580
 plate is actually the flame is going to get 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.980
 cut it will go back to the first 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.900
 turn but this rate is flat missile has 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:36.090
 is a flashback that makes 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.560
 some normally so that's it 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.180
 I could see that the flame stop 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.020
 works well it's the ib thing I 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.370
 do not know what's in it takes 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.550
 people actually demonstrate because it's 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.210
 very practical and it works nickel 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.360
 here is still advised to 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.970
 put two in series just in case but 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.130
 here it is thanks to false sense well voila 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.830
 here I will do two tests on others 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.320
 videos I think so here we see better the 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.680
 life this case make sure that it can be 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.680
 here we are
