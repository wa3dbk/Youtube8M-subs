00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 last week were again admittedly 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.700
 with a different feeling you what can then 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.110
 happen a lot during the week 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:13.320
 yes , I also had a look last week 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.330
 after two days what I was my bitterness 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.990
 was gone because namely had one and one 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.240
 team that they play very much 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.609
 energy initiative did you know our hearts 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.380
 created and only then the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.650
 a huge damper was that of those 8 a taxi 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.679
 minute to today you see you see a psv 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.840
 that one team that and I with one 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.700
 handball club plays where the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 very difficult to get through in the first half 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.920
 got what I meant to kept 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 and in the end you get all the feeling 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.489
 direction that rests that vvv in wooden 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.930
 toys 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.610
 gasping for air at the with I do 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.860
 that the two of them becomes space 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.780
 would get and that we do it 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 moment we are going to score 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.100
 I had that feeling at the time 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.730
 they didn't go in, that's the only thing 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.590
 but the green actually better 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.710
 luckily it didn't really play 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.320
 no but also with the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.950
 result that was already known from 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.750
 Amsterdam over this afternoon is this 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.880
 just nice that we now provisionally 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.470
 just as nice at the top as 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.890
 Jonathan then it takes you what the team 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.020
 may need has of course there 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.710
 I played a role there okay 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.150
 namely in the very small space 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.500
 I can say that nothing bad 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.420
 rather than i just think that jonathan 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.290
 where some important role can play 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.270
 and of course with the help of the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.220
 opponent because that one moment terms 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.990
 He now pulled the ball, so he sits well and 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.630
 then you break the game grandpa 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.880
 percent more filiz at swim that the mar 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.770

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.640
 roman port hand 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.460
 you still real time they fit this cow 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.940
 prefer history jan pox separate 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.160

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.560
 c14 show so can be a problem landscape 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.200
 s14 tea you need your personality 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.170
 is pachanga times 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.070
 Glados stuck in a fur rabaey you 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.729
 brush your philosophy of the forest is 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.200
 take the step or the push 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.880
 Jonathan then needs in design 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 process 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.709
 look that is look i hope only that 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.420
 anyone can understand that 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.640
 the I also ask incomprehension for the namely 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.700
 less policy is being made then yes 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.900
 then don't fall in on the policy and 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.010
 but it is equally not want all 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.440
 not say that he was about 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.260

 for the people and for everything and everyone 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.630
 I can't comment on that 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.010
 immediately silica sand in palaver is like in 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.310
 a home stadium 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.690
 passed away my videos simple parents 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.950
 has a separate story and jonathan how 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.739
 live on within you within you 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.950
 the group we want him to live with 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.950
 to have 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.580
 yes everyone is convinced of it 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.010
 qualities sulking china 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.060
 the soapbox where trabajar were like you 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 the pc again i like a strange sharla 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.090
 Let's go to the Dutch national team 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.590
 want to give yourself a little more time to get there 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.870
 eventually be ready for being a mary 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.160
 2 0 looked and saw how high you got I saw 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.040
 say it is just ready for it anyway 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.230
 yes but i have to be honest to myself 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.450
 and to the national coach I just got whole 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.489
 no long competitions behind 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.860
 played each other so now again for it 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.140
 first in a long time and for me 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.750
 right now just psv it 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.810
 most important and I still have whole 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.310
 what more matches needed and as me 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.569
 hold on to that level and I think 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.910
 that it can only get better 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.700
 by playing matches as time 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.660
 in a few months there will be a no 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.460
 call me again what i do 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.900
 of course hope yes 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.020
 then I'll be there again when 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.020
 not
