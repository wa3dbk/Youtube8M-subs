first<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.250> all<00:00:26.310> interval<00:00:26.670> training<00:00:27.060> is

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
first of all interval training is

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.599 
first of all interval training is
superior<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.230> any<00:00:28.410> other<00:00:28.619> form<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.220> cardio

superior to any other form of cardio

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.269 
superior to any other form of cardio
because<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:31.080> increases<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> metabolic

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
because it increases the metabolic

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
because it increases the metabolic
effect<00:00:33.000> which<00:00:33.210> means<00:00:33.390> you're<00:00:33.600> burning<00:00:33.870> more

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
fat in calories 24/7 and it reduces much

know<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.740> can<00:05:10.889> get<00:05:11.010> hard<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.780> stay<00:05:12.780> focused<00:05:13.169> on

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
know it can get hard to stay focused on

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.409 
know it can get hard to stay focused on
that<00:05:13.320> higher<00:05:13.680> intensity<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:14.910> if<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.120> kind<00:05:15.270> of

that higher intensity so if you kind of

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.390 
that higher intensity so if you kind of
break<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.720> into<00:05:16.020> two<00:05:16.500> different<00:05:16.800> blocks<00:05:16.919> a<00:05:17.190> red
