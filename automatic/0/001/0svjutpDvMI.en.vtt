 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.520
 social navigator is development 2 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.409
 handed with a big screen 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.379
 makes 450 leading kravchenko 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.379
 format and immediately 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.489
 especially since 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.880
 she is under repair 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.440
 including league reports 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.070
 blocking virtual key presses 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.040
 but just the economy 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 without size until they are all made large 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.750
 the scope of management is simple and straightforward 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.920
 the best solution is not to be distracted 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610
 numerous small icons 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 whose holders are not worth it without that 7 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.680
 given causes very little 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.239
 it allows love 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.239
 to the contrary 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.760
 just on the back of the birth 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.500
 do not use at all 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.950
 in the amount of slaughtered 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.640
 it seems not to know 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 production growth 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.780
 maximum values 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.780
 even interrupting each other terminated 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.280
 while two federal 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.930
 in Russia central and northwest 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.930
 note that 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.010
 and here the Germans rise 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.010
 we have two counties in spain 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.930
 in the program stand by 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.710
 The winner of this calculator 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.900
 a problem 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.180
 with the last program 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.540
 automatically why 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.000
 value when you cross the border 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.050
 time zones 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.509
 main plus unit 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.479
 nationality does not suffer from this 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.029
 great quality 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:13.659
 from injuries
