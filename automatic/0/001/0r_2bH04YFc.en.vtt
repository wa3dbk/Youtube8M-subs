incredibly important because it's all

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.939 
incredibly important because it's all
about<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.420> origins<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.960> sex<00:00:40.320> sex

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
thing about Go Go is that you're

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.690 
thing about Go Go is that you're

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.089 
domes you always see the pelvic fin is
being<00:04:17.940> very<00:04:18.180> simple<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:19.169> we<00:04:19.530> discovered<00:04:19.799> that

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
being very simple but we discovered that

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.860 
being very simple but we discovered that
these<00:04:20.370> fish<00:04:20.639> had<00:04:20.820> an<00:04:20.940> extra<00:04:21.269> lobe<00:04:21.539> that

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
these fish had an extra lobe that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:30.540 
these fish had an extra lobe that
extended<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.800> middle<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.430> pelvic<00:04:23.849> fin

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.820 

then<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:32.000> penny<00:04:32.240> dropped<00:04:32.570> what<00:04:33.500> John

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
then the penny dropped what John

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.040 
then the penny dropped what John
realized<00:04:34.370> was<00:04:34.669> that<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.940> extra<00:04:35.360> load<00:04:35.600> was<00:04:35.900> the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
realized was that the extra load was the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.530 
realized was that the extra load was the
class<00:04:36.350> /<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.830> male<00:04:37.040> fish<00:04:37.430> used<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:38.090> mate<00:04:38.300> with

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
class / the male fish used to mate with

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.330 
class / the male fish used to mate with
the<00:04:38.630> female<00:04:39.050> just<00:04:39.410> like<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.650> modern<00:04:39.950> shark

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
the female just like a modern shark

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.990 
the female just like a modern shark
has--

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
has--

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.450 
has--
so<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.810> other<00:04:41.900> words<00:04:42.020> these<00:04:42.650> placa<00:04:42.980> domes<00:04:43.220> had

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
so in other words these placa domes had

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.590 
so in other words these placa domes had
a<00:04:43.490> pelvic<00:04:44.000> girdle<00:04:44.410> modified<00:04:45.410> for<00:04:46.220> copulation

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
a pelvic girdle modified for copulation

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.150 
a pelvic girdle modified for copulation
so<00:04:47.600> you<00:04:48.020> know<00:04:48.110> we<00:04:48.230> have<00:04:48.320> an<00:04:48.410> expression<00:04:48.740> that

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
so you know we have an expression that

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.700 
so you know we have an expression that
humans<00:04:50.150> like<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.510> get<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.660> leg<00:04:50.900> over<00:04:51.080> but<00:04:51.560> these

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
humans like to get a leg over but these

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.320 
humans like to get a leg over but these

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
but our new work shows that you also get

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.909 
but our new work shows that you also get
internal<00:05:05.330> fertilization<00:05:06.080> or<00:05:06.260> sex<00:05:06.650> within

called<00:05:09.229> the<00:05:09.380> arthri<00:05:09.710> dyers<00:05:09.889> so<00:05:10.820> it<00:05:10.910> seems<00:05:11.150> to

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
called the arthri dyers so it seems to

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.629 
called the arthri dyers so it seems to
be<00:05:11.389> a<00:05:11.419> more<00:05:11.660> typical<00:05:11.930> condition<00:05:12.830> of<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.400> plaka

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
domes as a whole and probably now we

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.860 
domes as a whole and probably now we
could<00:05:16.460> say<00:05:16.639> that<00:05:16.669> it's<00:05:16.910> a<00:05:17.000> typical<00:05:17.150> condition

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870

of jawed vertebrates as a whole so

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.240 
of jawed vertebrates as a whole so
finally<00:05:20.450> we<00:05:20.600> had<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.780> model<00:05:21.169> of<00:05:21.320> how<00:05:21.770> these<00:05:21.979> fish

finally we had a model of how these fish

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.980 
finally we had a model of how these fish
were<00:05:22.430> reproducing<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.690> fact<00:05:23.900> that
