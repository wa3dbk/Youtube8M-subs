morning yeah there's more debris
floating<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:46.020> understand<00:02:46.530> there's<00:02:47.400> been<00:02:47.459> a

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
floating in we understand there's been a

floating in we understand there's been a
real<00:02:47.940> brief<00:02:48.590> lockdown

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.240 

thirty<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.560> thirty<00:03:06.770> five<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:10.190> is

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
thirty to thirty five and this is

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.710 
thirty to thirty five and this is
basically<00:03:10.610> what<00:03:10.940> we're<00:03:11.060> going<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.240> get<00:03:11.360> as<00:03:11.570> we

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
basically what we're going to get as we

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.840 
basically what we're going to get as we
head<00:03:11.840> through<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.140> day<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.620> mean<00:03:12.890> III<00:03:13.490> do<00:03:13.670> think

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
head through the day I mean III do think

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.370 
head through the day I mean III do think
the<00:03:14.150> biggest<00:03:14.330> threat<00:03:14.510> will<00:03:14.750> be<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.960> flooding

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
the biggest threat will be the flooding

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.500 
the biggest threat will be the flooding
and<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:16.100> source<00:03:16.310> of<00:03:16.400> water<00:03:16.640> right<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.390> in

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
and that source of water right and in

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.360 
and that source of water right and in
fact<00:03:17.690> we're<00:03:17.900> seeing<00:03:18.290> more<00:03:18.470> flooding<00:03:18.770> here<00:03:19.040> a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
fact we're seeing more flooding here a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.540 
fact we're seeing more flooding here a
number<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:20.060> our<00:03:20.210> colleagues<00:03:21.340> satellites<00:03:22.340> up

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
number of our colleagues satellites up

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.970 
number of our colleagues satellites up
too<00:03:22.700> sudden<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.150> flood<00:03:23.390> off<00:03:23.540> cnn's<00:03:24.140> but<00:03:24.470> was

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
too sudden the flood off cnn's but was

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.410 
too sudden the flood off cnn's but was
getting<00:03:25.250> flooded<00:03:25.490> out<00:03:25.700> they've<00:03:25.910> had<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> set

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
getting flooded out they've had a set

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.800 
getting flooded out they've had a set
down<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.810> move<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:31.210> really<00:03:32.210> is<00:03:32.420> starting

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
down and move so it really is starting

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.510 
down and move so it really is starting
to<00:03:33.200> move<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.650> water<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.010> starting<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.400> make

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
to move the water is starting to make

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.060 
to move the water is starting to make
its<00:03:34.580> way<00:03:34.850> in

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
its way in

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.470 
its way in
okay<00:03:37.070> so<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.280> see<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.670> wave<00:03:37.820> so<00:03:38.090> they<00:03:38.240> are<00:03:38.360> you

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
okay so you see the wave so they are you

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.270 
okay so you see the wave so they are you
see<00:03:38.690> this<00:03:38.840> barrier<00:03:39.320> they've<00:03:39.560> made<00:03:39.800> sure<00:03:40.040> to

nor'easter and we'd be talking about

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.200 
nor'easter and we'd be talking about
three<00:04:28.610> feet<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.970> snow

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:15.309 
problem for them would be a long fetch

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:17.969 
problem for them would be a long fetch
out<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.759> East<00:05:15.939> right<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.509> I<00:05:17.439> don't<00:05:17.740> know

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.089 
problem I'm more concerned about the

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.790 
problem I'm more concerned about the
southerly<00:05:22.629> fats<00:05:22.869> pushing<00:05:23.289> on<00:05:23.409> to<00:05:23.680> the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
southerly fats pushing on to the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.619 
southerly fats pushing on to the
southern<00:05:24.099> shores<00:05:24.399> of<00:05:24.639> maybe<00:05:24.819> central<00:05:25.539> and

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
southern shores of maybe central and

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:26.730 
southern shores of maybe central and
eastern<00:05:25.869> Long<00:05:26.050> Island<00:05:26.409> and<00:05:26.499> the<00:05:26.619> southern

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
eastern Long Island and the southern

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.769 
eastern Long Island and the southern
shores<00:05:27.129> of<00:05:27.369> the<00:05:27.759> New<00:05:27.849> England<00:05:27.879> area<00:05:28.270> right

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
shores of the New England area right

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:30.959 
shores of the New England area right
Narragansett<00:05:29.439> Bay<00:05:29.619> of<00:05:29.889> Buzzards<00:05:30.219> Bay<00:05:30.309> yeah<00:05:30.939> I

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
Narragansett Bay of Buzzards Bay yeah I

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.989 
Narragansett Bay of Buzzards Bay yeah I
I'm<00:05:31.419> inclined<00:05:31.899> to<00:05:32.050> think<00:05:32.139> that<00:05:32.639> Long<00:05:33.639> Island

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
I'm inclined to think that Long Island

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.719 
I'm inclined to think that Long Island
Sound<00:05:34.180> and<00:05:34.449> the<00:05:34.629> the<00:05:35.110> potential<00:05:35.519> threat<00:05:36.519> for

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
Sound and the the potential threat for

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.719 
Sound and the the potential threat for
flooding<00:05:36.909> there<00:05:37.300> which<00:05:37.899> is<00:05:38.139> actually<00:05:38.729> pretty

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
flooding there which is actually pretty

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.790 
flooding there which is actually pretty
extreme<00:05:40.149> because<00:05:40.569> the<00:05:40.719> tide<00:05:40.990> fluctuation<00:05:41.679> is

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
extreme because the tide fluctuation is

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.159 
extreme because the tide fluctuation is
8<00:05:41.949> feet<00:05:42.189> as<00:05:42.699> opposed<00:05:43.029> to<00:05:43.119> 5<00:05:43.389> feet<00:05:43.659> on<00:05:43.839> the<00:05:43.959> south

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
8 feet as opposed to 5 feet on the south

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.159 
8 feet as opposed to 5 feet on the south
side<00:05:44.519> so<00:05:45.519> when<00:05:45.909> you<00:05:46.029> put<00:05:46.269> water<00:05:46.509> in<00:05:46.779> there<00:05:46.959> boy

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
side so when you put water in there boy

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.709 
side so when you put water in there boy
there's<00:05:47.589> nowhere<00:05:47.949> to<00:05:48.219> get<00:05:48.669> it<00:05:48.819> out<00:05:48.999> except<00:05:49.539> to

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
there's nowhere to get it out except to

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.869 
there's nowhere to get it out except to
you<00:05:50.319> know<00:05:50.409> flood<00:05:50.769> it<00:05:50.949> at<00:05:51.099> the<00:05:51.249> end<00:05:51.459> and<00:05:51.789> then

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
you know flood it at the end and then

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.939 
you know flood it at the end and then
run<00:05:52.389> it<00:05:52.509> down<00:05:52.659> the<00:05:52.719> Harlem<00:05:53.319> River<00:05:53.439> down<00:05:53.709> to<00:05:53.860> the

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
run it down the Harlem River down to the

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:54.600 
run it down the Harlem River down to the
East<00:05:54.129> River

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
East River

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.329 
East River
so<00:05:55.180> I'd<00:05:56.019> say<00:05:56.229> they're<00:05:56.379> probably<00:05:56.589> be<00:05:56.829> water

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:57.339 
so I'd say they're probably be water

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:58.799 
so I'd say they're probably be water
rise<00:05:57.610> there<00:05:57.939> because<00:05:58.119> they've<00:05:58.240> had<00:05:58.360> a<00:05:58.389> pretty

00:05:58.799 --> 00:05:58.809 
rise there because they've had a pretty

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.439 
rise there because they've had a pretty
long<00:05:59.079> southeast<00:05:59.589> wind<00:05:59.829> but<00:06:00.399> not<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.939> real

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
long southeast wind but not the real

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.569 
long southeast wind but not the real
worst-case<00:06:02.079> kind<00:06:02.409> of<00:06:02.529> a<00:06:02.559> flooding<00:06:03.039> situation

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:03.579 
worst-case kind of a flooding situation

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:04.829 
worst-case kind of a flooding situation
right<00:06:03.759> and<00:06:03.969> of<00:06:04.029> course<00:06:04.209> the<00:06:04.329> big<00:06:04.509> problem

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:04.839 
right and of course the big problem

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.480 
right and of course the big problem
stuff<00:06:05.079> is<00:06:05.289> the<00:06:05.469> flooding<00:06:05.889> that<00:06:06.009> we<00:06:06.129> still<00:06:06.339> see

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
stuff is the flooding that we still see

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.639 
stuff is the flooding that we still see
an<00:06:06.579> extreme<00:06:06.939> threat<00:06:07.119> for<00:06:07.509> in<00:06:07.809> inland<00:06:08.259> areas<00:06:08.619> of

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:08.649 
an extreme threat for in inland areas of

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:10.570 
an extreme threat for in inland areas of
the<00:06:09.009> Northeast<00:06:09.369> active

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
the Northeast active

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.340 
the Northeast active
yeah<00:06:10.970> all<00:06:11.180> right<00:06:11.300> thanks<00:06:11.540> dr.<00:06:11.900> dev<00:06:12.050> let's<00:06:12.230> talk

yeah all right thanks dr. dev let's talk

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.020 
yeah all right thanks dr. dev let's talk
more<00:06:12.530> about<00:06:12.590> that<00:06:12.740> with<00:06:13.040> Mike<00:06:13.220> and<00:06:13.460> Mike<00:06:13.880> you

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
more about that with Mike and Mike you

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.640 
more about that with Mike and Mike you
and<00:06:14.150> I<00:06:14.240> are<00:06:14.360> talking<00:06:14.570> a<00:06:15.020> little<00:06:15.320> bit<00:06:15.470> earlier

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
and I are talking a little bit earlier

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.950 
and I are talking a little bit earlier
basically<00:06:16.520> we're<00:06:16.910> not<00:06:16.940> gonna<00:06:17.150> see<00:06:17.360> this<00:06:17.540> storm

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
basically we're not gonna see this storm

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.140 
basically we're not gonna see this storm
intensify<00:06:18.770> through<00:06:19.040> the<00:06:19.160> day<00:06:19.340> I<00:06:19.580> think<00:06:19.820> what's

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
intensify through the day I think what's

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.880 
intensify through the day I think what's
going<00:06:20.360> to<00:06:20.450> get<00:06:20.690> much<00:06:20.990> worse<00:06:21.020> will<00:06:21.560> be<00:06:21.740> that

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
going to get much worse will be that

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.260 
going to get much worse will be that
rainfall<00:06:22.250> and<00:06:22.400> flood<00:06:22.580> threat<00:06:22.790> though<00:06:22.970> you

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
rainfall and flood threat though you

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.120 
rainfall and flood threat though you
don't<00:06:23.420> see<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:23.930> flooding<00:06:24.470> step<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:24.980> so<00:06:25.070> you

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
don't see the flooding step and so you

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.100 
don't see the flooding step and so you
add<00:06:25.280> more<00:06:25.460> rain<00:06:25.760> to<00:06:25.940> that<00:06:26.120> you<00:06:26.330> can<00:06:26.510> only<00:06:26.660> guess

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
add more rain to that you can only guess

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.510 
add more rain to that you can only guess
now<00:06:27.320> that<00:06:27.560> we're<00:06:27.770> gonna<00:06:27.830> have<00:06:28.040> more<00:06:28.340> issues

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
now that we're gonna have more issues

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.010 
now that we're gonna have more issues
for<00:06:28.970> us<00:06:29.090> and<00:06:29.270> so<00:06:29.330> I'm<00:06:29.390> going<00:06:29.510> to<00:06:29.570> show<00:06:29.690> you<00:06:29.720> kind

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
for us and so I'm going to show you kind

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.960

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
because away from the centers where we

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.470 
because away from the centers where we
had<00:06:33.890> most<00:06:34.160> of<00:06:34.280> the<00:06:34.370> heavier<00:06:34.610> rain<00:06:34.700> bands<00:06:35.180> the

another 4 to 8 inches of rain on top of

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.140 
another 4 to 8 inches of rain on top of
what<00:06:39.590> we've<00:06:39.740> seen<00:06:39.950> already<00:06:40.130> that<00:06:40.490> looks<00:06:40.880> stand

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
what we've seen already that looks stand

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.520 
what we've seen already that looks stand
up<00:06:41.270> to<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.480> capital<00:06:41.840> district<00:06:42.110> up<00:06:42.290> through

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
up to the capital district up through

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.180 
up to the capital district up through
the<00:06:42.620> mountains<00:06:42.860> through<00:06:42.980> New<00:06:43.100> Hampshire

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
the mountains through New Hampshire

but<00:06:45.890> there's<00:06:46.130> our<00:06:46.280> areas<00:06:46.580> like<00:06:46.730> Atlantic<00:06:47.120> City

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
but there's our areas like Atlantic City

but there's our areas like Atlantic City
I<00:06:47.510> mean<00:06:47.840> that<00:06:47.990> the<00:06:48.080> condition<00:06:48.590> will<00:06:48.680> be

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
I mean that the condition will be

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.650 
I mean that the condition will be
improving<00:06:49.220> for<00:06:49.430> us<00:06:49.520> Cape<00:06:49.790> Cod<00:06:50.000> yes<00:06:50.330> we'll<00:06:50.540> get
