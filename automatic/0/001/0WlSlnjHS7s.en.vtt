yep a single pass I got it now of course
I<00:02:34.890> applied<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> little<00:02:35.490> bit<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.670> pressure<00:02:35.970> but

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
I applied a little bit of pressure but

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.870 
I applied a little bit of pressure but
this<00:02:37.560> goes<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:38.040> show<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:39.890> how<00:02:40.890> sharp<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.670> is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
this goes to show you how sharp this is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.450 
this goes to show you how sharp this is
right<00:02:42.030> at<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.240> box<00:02:42.680> how<00:02:43.680> crazy<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.190> imma

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
right at the box how crazy was that imma

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:54.560 
right at the box how crazy was that imma
do<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.580> again<00:02:51.740> if<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:53.700> guys<00:02:53.850> notice<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.420> has

do it again if you guys notice it has

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.680 
do it again if you guys notice it has
somewhat<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.290> wide<00:02:55.500> top<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.790> perhaps

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
somewhat of a wide top here so perhaps

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.110 
somewhat of a wide top here so perhaps
we<00:02:58.020> can<00:02:58.140> use<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> chisel<00:02:59.070> let's<00:02:59.640> find<00:02:59.970> out

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
we can use it as a chisel let's find out

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.900 
we can use it as a chisel let's find out
I'm<00:03:01.020> gonna<00:03:01.140> put<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.320> knife<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.040> use<00:03:02.880> my

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
camera as you guys can see it cut very

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.390 
camera as you guys can see it cut very
cleanly<00:03:12.360> into<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.020> side<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.530> wood<00:03:13.680> now

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
cleanly into the side of the wood now

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.220 
cleanly into the side of the wood now
let's<00:03:14.550> take<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> look<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> blade<00:03:15.330> itself<00:03:15.690> as

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
let's take a look at the blade itself as

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.740 
let's take a look at the blade itself as
I<00:03:17.190> move<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.610> knife<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:18.090> guys<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.480> kind<00:03:18.660> of

I move the knife you guys can kind of

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.540 
I move the knife you guys can kind of
see<00:03:18.959> where<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.260> word<00:03:19.470> kind<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.860> scratched<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
see where the word kind of scratched the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.080 
see where the word kind of scratched the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
paint

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.740

but<00:03:21.959> overall<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.880> knife<00:03:24.060> still<00:03:24.450> looks<00:03:24.630> very

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
but overall the knife still looks very

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.030 
but overall the knife still looks very
good<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.550> top<00:03:26.790> where<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.150> hammered<00:03:27.510> it

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
good and the top where I hammered it

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.880 
good and the top where I hammered it
very<00:03:29.040> very<00:03:29.459> negligible<00:03:29.910> as<00:03:30.870> far<00:03:31.230> as<00:03:31.380> what<00:03:31.770> it

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
very very negligible as far as what it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.420 
very very negligible as far as what it
is<00:03:34.400> yep<00:03:36.110> now<00:03:37.110> on<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> skills<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:38.040> comes<00:03:38.280> in

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
is yep now on the skills it comes in

I<00:03:43.700> would<00:03:44.700> over<00:03:45.030> half<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.390> pound<00:03:45.440> it's<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.830> the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
I would over half a pound it's not the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.310 
I would over half a pound it's not the
heaviest<00:03:47.430> thing<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> world<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.540> not<00:03:49.140> the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
heaviest thing in the world so not the

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.800 
heaviest thing in the world so not the
best<00:03:49.370> chopper<00:03:50.370> overall<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.239> use<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.630> as<00:03:51.780> a

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
best chopper overall you can use it as a

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.170 
best chopper overall you can use it as a
chopper<00:03:52.260> maybe<00:03:52.950> get<00:03:53.070> some<00:03:53.310> leverage<00:03:53.519> use<00:03:54.030> it

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
chopper maybe get some leverage use it

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.440 
chopper maybe get some leverage use it
like<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.360> machete<00:03:55.430> but<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:57.030> not<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.239> heavy

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
like a machete but it's not a heavy

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.900 
like a machete but it's not a heavy
knife<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.019> it's<00:03:58.140> not<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.380> best<00:03:58.560> chopper<00:03:59.310> as<00:03:59.850> a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
knife so it's not the best chopper as a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.290 
knife so it's not the best chopper as a
camp<00:04:00.390> knife<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.100> exactly<00:04:02.700> what<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.090> want

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
how to make a spear

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.800 
how to make a spear
now<00:04:08.780> remember<00:04:09.319> safety<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:10.010> paramount<00:04:10.750> so<00:04:11.750> to

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
but we're gonna add a little wood screw

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.080 
but we're gonna add a little wood screw
in<00:04:17.930> this<00:04:18.139> little<00:04:18.470> hole<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:19.000> we're<00:04:20.000> gonna

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
in this little hole and we're gonna

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.210 
in this little hole and we're gonna
attach<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:21.049> knife<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.430> stick<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.960> way

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
there's no chance of it coming off and
