what all that's about it's it's because

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.359 
what all that's about it's it's because
I<00:00:11.969> care<00:00:12.450> about<00:00:12.480> my<00:00:12.960> health<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:15.199> yeah<00:00:16.220> I'm<00:00:17.220> in

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I care about my health and yeah I'm in

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.800 
I care about my health and yeah I'm in
touch<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.580> my<00:00:17.880> feminine<00:00:18.060> side

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
touch with my feminine side

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.650 
touch with my feminine side
okay<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.650> let's<00:00:20.369> focus<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.270> something<00:00:21.539> more

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
okay so let's focus on something more

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.650 
okay so let's focus on something more
important<00:00:22.230> shall<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.760> cell

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
important shall we and that is cell

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.259 
important shall we and that is cell
fractionation<00:00:25.699> I'm<00:00:26.699> gonna<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:27.000> honest<00:00:27.240> with

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
fractionation I'm gonna be honest with

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.800 
fractionation I'm gonna be honest with
you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
you

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.349 
you
this<00:00:28.080> isn't<00:00:28.380> interesting<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.699> slightest

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
this isn't interesting in the slightest

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.450 
this isn't interesting in the slightest
but<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.260> need<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.480> enjoy<00:00:34.460> okay

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
but you need to know it so enjoy okay

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.990 
but you need to know it so enjoy okay
now<00:00:36.059> step<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.410> need<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.950> cut<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
now step one you need to cut up the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.569 
now step one you need to cut up the
tissue<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.660> cold<00:00:40.410> isotonic<00:00:41.190> buffered

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
tissue in cold isotonic buffered

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.709 
tissue in cold isotonic buffered
solution<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> basically<00:00:44.430> here's<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.539> little

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
solution so basically here's your little

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.979 
solution so basically here's your little
bits<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.200> tissue<00:00:46.350> that's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.670> knife<00:00:48.270> cutting<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
bits of tissue that's a knife cutting it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.010 
bits of tissue that's a knife cutting it
and<00:00:49.370> that's<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> code<00:00:50.789> buffered<00:00:51.270> isotonic

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and that's the code buffered isotonic

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
and that's the code buffered isotonic
solution<00:00:52.739> yeah<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.780> number<00:00:55.770> two<00:00:55.980> after<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
solution yeah and number two after you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.439 
solution yeah and number two after you
do<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:58.940> because<00:00:59.940> that<00:00:59.969> tissue<00:01:00.300> was

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
do that then because that tissue was

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.460 
do that then because that tissue was
broken<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.199> even<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.579> homogenize<00:01:03.000> ER

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
broken up even more in the homogenize ER

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
broken up even more in the homogenize ER
which<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.680> basically<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> blender<00:01:05.729> above<00:01:05.970> out

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
which is basically a blender above out

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
which is basically a blender above out
the<00:01:06.390> blades<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:08.220> crap<00:01:08.549> version<00:01:10.070> excuse<00:01:11.070> my

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the blades the crap version excuse my

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.870 
the blades the crap version excuse my
french

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
french

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.120 
french
and<00:01:12.810> then<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.760> homogeneity<00:01:16.130> homogenized

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and then in the homogeneity homogenized

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.399 
and then in the homogeneity homogenized
the<00:01:18.119> tissue<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.600> spun<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.259> an

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the tissue was spun in an

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.710 
the tissue was spun in an
ultracentrifuge<00:01:20.009> sort<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> circus

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
ultracentrifuge sort of like a circus

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.950 
ultracentrifuge sort of like a circus
ride<00:01:22.340> at<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.729> low<00:01:24.060> speed<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.570> ten<00:01:24.780> minutes

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
ride at a low speed for ten minutes

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
ride at a low speed for ten minutes
that's<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.220> always<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> case<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:27.119> only

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that's not always the case that's only

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.600 
that's not always the case that's only
if<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.110> want<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:29.100> yourself<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:29.700> nuclei

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
if you want to get yourself some nuclei

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.330 
if you want to get yourself some nuclei
okay<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:33.000> being<00:01:33.240> spun<00:01:33.509> innocence

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
okay now when being spun innocence

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
okay now when being spun innocence
ultracentrifuge<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.060> change<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.020> settings

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
ultracentrifuge you change the settings

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
ultracentrifuge you change the settings
of<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.180> different<00:01:39.420> sediment<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.000> if

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
of it to get different sediment so if

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.569 
of it to get different sediment so if
you<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.200> nuke<00:01:43.590> July<00:01:44.009> because

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
you want to get nuke July because

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.920 
you want to get nuke July because
there's<00:01:44.820> nothing<00:01:45.090> more<00:01:45.180> useful<00:01:45.659> than<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
there's nothing more useful than that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
there's nothing more useful than that
then<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.850> need<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.450> set<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.200> speed<00:01:49.680> of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
then you need to set the speed of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.310 
then you need to set the speed of

helps you there's a lot more to it so I

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.680 
helps you there's a lot more to it so I
suggest<00:02:37.989> reading<00:02:38.260> some<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:39.690> just

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
suggest reading some of it and just

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.470 
suggest reading some of it and just
trying<00:02:41.440> concentrate<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.489> not<00:02:42.640> interesting

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
trying concentrate it's not interesting

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.940 
trying concentrate it's not interesting
it's<00:02:43.780> bored<00:02:44.410> me
