00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.240
 was in the world with one with one 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.880
 selection what is your status in the 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.490
 teacher moment if it is we have to 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.920
 is here on the advisory board but 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.890
 of some team 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.650
 has conversed for the moment not for 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.020
 that fortunately taking advantage of this pause 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 that there is no direct responsibility 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.970
 with no institution to be here 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.809
 updating that compartment with the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.800
 mind football and reflecting a little 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.309
 I consider that all this type of analysis 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.530
 what feedback one each is each 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.830
 these elections look like 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.790
 interesting in the tactical technical order 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.770
 looking at the projection of these young people 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.360
 of the world is technical and good 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.480
 wait for the tournament to end as 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.130
 then in Peru there are new airs 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.300
 Federation president after 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.390
 a lot of time outings in calling the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.400
 volga this man oviedo and talk a lot 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.230
 of the possibility that you are 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.730
 technical team of the national team you 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.610
 what do they think about talking to you 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.979
 some good approach has arrived 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.120
 before everything else very distinguished with 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.400
 with that welcome 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.310
 by means of press I realized in 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.830
 December there was some call from friends 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.590
 of partners some means but 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.370
 officially there is no offer 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.490
 we know there is a new board 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.530
 directive that just enters and still 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.290
 do not take 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.660
 decisions and well I think we expect that 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.000
 everything is on the right track but I insist 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.650
 that is, the meaning of the new leadership 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.110
 is not having a national technician be 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.210
 Peruvian but one foreigner one to one in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.640
 one level and experienced not with the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.460
 you experience you have you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.520
 like you and if there is a call 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 go to train the Peruvian national team 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.640
 naturally I do not think that attractiveness 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.420
 for all it means but it's a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.909
 difficult challenge 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.670
 it's a culture that has always been 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.570
 admired for his good football and good everything 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.790
 will happen if the situation occurs and 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.459
 what are the conditions of a 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.349
 project that bets on the big goal not 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.239
 that we all like, I think 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.650
 Whenever a purpose is not puts 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.209
 this is to achieve the goal of classifying or 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.520
 world is open to the possibility 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.770
 then dialogue and accept the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.720
 charge follows naturally is what good 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.250
 is the dynamics of football not if there is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.580
 a possibility to bond to make a 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.600
 good job welcome be fortunately 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.549
 the previous technical bodies have 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.750
 developed a good job in the case 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.870
 of the hero macaria of the bengochea resort 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.030
 they did an excellent job that 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.709
 they promote some young people of even 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.110
 here in my partner gustavo ferri in 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.880
 how much was in the South American 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.799
 2011 I think it was for the world 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.410
 of Colombia that was screened in some 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.319
 young people of good talent and some already with 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.510
 some minutes 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.519
 games in the first in the selection 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.290
 absolute and good and the men that 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.639
 they were coming the way of the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.639
 national team in the qualifiers 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.790
 past I think it's a potential 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.709
 important and sure that that is a challenge 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.719
 big a big challenge that has 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.670
 Peruvian soccer for everything that means 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.200
 for South America and hopefully they can 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.700
 to achieve there are some young people who already 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.200
 they know them well that they had gone 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.510
 projecting that the professors are 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.659
 giving volume the teacher bengoetxea not his 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.370
 friendly match usually I do not 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.319
 I like to sing, I always like it 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.299
 talk about collective 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.650
 he does not know which young people are 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.269
 they accumulated some that managed 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.980
 position very well in the qualification 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:37.590
 good past and expected to go all 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.370
 on a path yes whoever it is that 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.370
 assume this responsibility 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.220
 this day more years then the day more or 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.410
 less project 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.200
 we all know that the long term does not 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.690
 exists in soccer in football is the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.300
 short and medium term 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.030
 everything will go through the conviction that 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.890
 have the part of the managers by the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.290
 communion that I believe that 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.840
 there is a there is a situation that all Peru 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.970
 you want the media want it what 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.700
 they need the hobby craves for their 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.230
 feeling the clubs all the investment 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.060
 VERONA there in football needs 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.709
 and I think it has to be a project 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.329
 of country a project of communion a 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.790
 project that where the selection is 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.470
 Bring on the court and hopefully you can 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.210
 achieve in the immediate future 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.210
 that's not for the good of Peruvian football 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.830
 uy
