00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.280
 Hi there, this is the second part of the video 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:27.660
 upgrading prick now it rotates 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:29.010
 let's turn it off so here it is 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.530
 stopped 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:42.030
 rotation let's try to install 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.540
 LEDs so here it fits into the groove 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.610
 need to bend 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.320
 legs so that he directly 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.219
 looked to the center 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:01.750
 cooler fan and so here it should 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.839
 look blades do not touch hide 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:13.320
 a little away his 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:13.320
 absolutely not hurt so here 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.580
 it looks like 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.690
 hours remaining LEDs attached 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.490
 dragon bend so that the legs were on the side 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 getting tired 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.640
 and so all the diodes are installed now 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.190
 I heated thermal adhesive instead 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.050
 you can use any other 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.500
 glue but have to wait 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:28.209
 thermo glue here looks like this 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.480
 gun shaped like a gun in it leaves 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.660
 with plastic rods 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.270
 it is sold everywhere the price is inexpensive rubles 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.390
 one hundred one hundred fifty 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.080
 Now I glued them is not convenient 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.380
 show on camera and show how it is 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.380
 will look
