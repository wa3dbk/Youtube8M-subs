00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.140
 Hello everyone in today's video vi 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.430
 i will show trades 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.560
 holes are great to do together 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.400
 children can also be attacked 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.650
 in the bedrooms I hope the idea will come 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:30.500
 like envy for the project 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:38.329
 always logical in the white card or 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:40.989
 colored if it is done with the vinyl of gods 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.989
 colors 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.600
 I have these fluo leeds today too 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.600
 a pencil 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.610
 a brush 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:07.680
 the cardboard the one that contains the eggs 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.680
 which we will then cut 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.800
 the scissors 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:27.369
 a journey is a container where 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:27.369
 mix colors a sewing thread 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.259
 first thing 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.259
 we cut the egg carton 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.380
 we glue two pieces together 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.480
 expect them to dry in the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.900
 meanwhile we draw the outline of one 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.900
 butterfly 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.939
 you 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:46.409
 let's color it the colors I have 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:55.000
 chosen to color it is this headset 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:59.459
 and purple that I will be mixing 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.459
 this can and this fuchsia 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.490
 we proceed to color the butterfly 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.380
 after having dried it to the ground 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.380
 this result 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.740
 now let's move on to gluing 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.600
 here 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.500
 now 15 needle and thread 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.510
 I tend to pass 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:43.310
 traverse this passage you will understand it in 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:46.570
 below in the next few we see here not 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.570
 see what you will need 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.410
 at this point what is there 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.100
 remains to be done are the antennas and 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.980
 draw eyes the sky mouth like 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:48.830
 first we take cardboard and 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:54.260
 we cut the strips they take 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:06:00.880
 life and we color them brown later 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.880
 having colored it we round a little 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.580
 and with a little bit of electricity 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:07:02.340
 after having attached to the andes in 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:07:03.889
 we draw the eyes and the mouth and this 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:08.430
 is the end result 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:11.130
