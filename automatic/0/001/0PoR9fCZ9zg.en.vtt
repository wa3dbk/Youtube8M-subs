00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
what would it sound like she brought

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.220 
what would it sound like she brought
back<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:41.140> two<00:02:42.140> concepts<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:44.180> liked<00:02:44.930> both<00:02:45.170> of

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
back to two concepts and I liked both of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.410 
back to two concepts and I liked both of
them<00:02:45.620> but<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.890> one<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.310> really<00:02:46.390> stuck<00:02:47.390> with

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
them but the one that really stuck with

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.810 
them but the one that really stuck with
me<00:02:47.600> was<00:02:47.900> songs<00:02:48.170> for<00:02:48.470> Jamie<00:02:48.710> when<00:02:49.280> we<00:02:49.430> both<00:02:49.610> look

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.550 
me was songs for Jamie when we both look
back<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.270> we<00:02:50.480> laugh<00:02:50.690> because<00:02:50.930> it's<00:02:51.230> clear

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
back on it we laugh because it's clear

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.920 
back on it we laugh because it's clear
that<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.250> impetus<00:02:52.670> for<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.940> was<00:02:53.120> really<00:02:53.390> me

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
that the impetus for that was really me

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.360 
that the impetus for that was really me
just<00:02:54.170> tapping<00:02:54.380> into<00:02:54.650> what<00:02:54.770> she<00:02:55.070> was<00:02:55.220> going

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
just tapping into what she was going

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.430 
just tapping into what she was going
through<00:02:55.490> once<00:02:56.030> she<00:02:56.180> presented<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.660> concept

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
through once she presented the concept

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.090 
through once she presented the concept
to<00:02:57.590> me<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.770> thought<00:02:58.160> perfect<00:02:59.590> just<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:00.890> ran

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
to me I thought perfect just kind of ran

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.430 
to me I thought perfect just kind of ran
with<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:02.600> started<00:03:03.430> tailoring<00:03:04.430> my

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
with it and it started tailoring my

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.970 
with it and it started tailoring my
personal<00:03:07.900> experience<00:03:08.900> my<00:03:09.110> lyrics<00:03:09.590> kind<00:03:09.920> of

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
personal experience my lyrics kind of

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.130 
personal experience my lyrics kind of
tailoring<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.570> Janie's<00:03:11.570> actually<00:03:12.110> I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
tailoring it to Janie's actually I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.660 
tailoring it to Janie's actually I
didn't<00:03:12.320> have<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.530> do<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.680> much<00:03:13.040> tailoring

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
didn't have to do that much tailoring

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.990 
didn't have to do that much tailoring
because<00:03:14.060> some<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:15.880> some<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
because some of the some of the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.570 
thus could see started getting the
feeling<00:03:38.530> his<00:03:39.530> dream<00:03:40.070> wasn't<00:03:40.670> me<00:03:42.100> topped<00:03:43.100> my

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.420 

Oh

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.309 

two

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.130 

now<00:03:59.219> we<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.670> this<00:03:59.909> full<00:04:00.299> fledged<00:04:00.599> project

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
now we have this full fledged project

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.679 
now we have this full fledged project
that<00:04:01.349> I<00:04:01.379> think<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.829> going<00:04:02.159> to<00:04:02.370> knock<00:04:03.239> people's

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
that I think is going to knock people's

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.229 
that I think is going to knock people's
also<00:04:04.109> because<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.709> really<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.310> in<00:04:05.700> the

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
also because it really is in the

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.080 
also because it really is in the
presentation<00:04:06.689> theatrical<00:04:07.620> it's<00:04:08.090> it's

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
presentation theatrical it's it's

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.879 
presentation theatrical it's it's
something<00:04:09.389> I<00:04:09.480> think<00:04:09.689> a<00:04:09.749> lot<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.930> women<00:04:10.109> have<00:04:10.650> to

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
something I think a lot of women have to

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.280 
something I think a lot of women have to
address<00:04:11.459> at<00:04:11.790> some<00:04:11.969> point<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.269> their<00:04:12.329> life<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
address at some point in their life the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.559 
address at some point in their life the
ideal<00:04:14.069> love<00:04:14.370> versus<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.879> reality<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.359> love

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
ideal love versus the reality of love

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.529 
ideal love versus the reality of love
how<00:04:15.810> does<00:04:15.989> how<00:04:16.620> do<00:04:16.680> they<00:04:16.859> intersect<00:04:17.459> where<00:04:18.209> can

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
how does how do they intersect where can

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.319 
how does how do they intersect where can
you<00:04:18.570> actually<00:04:18.900> find<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.970> dream

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
you actually find that that that dream

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.110

guy or that dream love affair and I

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.820 
guy or that dream love affair and I
think<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:24.419> some<00:04:24.630> point<00:04:24.690> we<00:04:24.960> all<00:04:24.990> experience<00:04:25.680> it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
think at some point we all experience it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.339 
think at some point we all experience it
we<00:04:26.460> just<00:04:26.729> learn<00:04:27.000> as<00:04:27.300> Jamie<00:04:27.750> did<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.199> it's

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
we just learn as Jamie did that it's

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.890 
we just learn as Jamie did that it's
very<00:04:28.530> short-lived<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:30.060> grand<00:04:30.360> plan<00:04:30.720> is<00:04:31.110> to
