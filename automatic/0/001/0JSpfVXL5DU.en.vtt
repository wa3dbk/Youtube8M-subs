okay we're still talking about how to
sew<00:00:02.790> for<00:00:03.120> roller<00:00:03.330> derby<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:04.220> this<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.609> a

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
sew for roller derby and this is a

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.990 
sew for roller derby and this is a
makeshift<00:00:06.480> line<00:00:06.990> up<00:00:07.230> tracking<00:00:07.560> sheets<00:00:08.130> just

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
makeshift line up tracking sheets just

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.419 
makeshift line up tracking sheets just
with<00:00:09.240> penalty<00:00:09.929> tracking<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.530> scorekeeping<00:00:11.160> I

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
with penalty tracking and scorekeeping I

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.400 
with penalty tracking and scorekeeping I
actually<00:00:11.730> have<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.330> line<00:00:12.509> up<00:00:12.660> sheet<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.230> but

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
actually have the line up sheet here but

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.470 
actually have the line up sheet here but
it's<00:00:13.559> really<00:00:13.830> hard<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.130> read<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.580> camera<00:00:14.880> it's

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
it's really hard to read on camera it's

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720 
it's really hard to read on camera it's
very<00:00:15.780> very<00:00:16.049> small<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.130> went<00:00:17.340> ahead<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.580> made

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
very very small so I went ahead and made

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.320 
very very small so I went ahead and made
a<00:00:17.789> bigger<00:00:18.060> one<00:00:18.300> I'll<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.320> sloppy<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.400> it's

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
a bigger one I'll be it sloppy but it's

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.490 
a bigger one I'll be it sloppy but it's
still<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:23.330> you'll<00:00:24.330> still<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.750> basic<00:00:25.199> idea

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
still a you'll still get the basic idea

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.080 
still a you'll still get the basic idea
of<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:25.710> you're<00:00:25.859> supposed<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.550> doing

you'll go ahead and write them down on
your<00:01:01.980> sheet<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.149> done<00:01:03.300> here

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
your sheet just like I have done here

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.260 
your sheet just like I have done here
now<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> pivot<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.150> go

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
now if they don't have a pivot just go

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
now if they don't have a pivot just go
ahead<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.600> put<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> tick<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.260> box<00:01:07.530> don't

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
ahead and put a tick in that box don't

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620 
ahead and put a tick in that box don't
worry<00:01:08.189> about<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.670> pivot<00:01:09.210> thing<00:01:09.390> just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
worry about this little pivot thing just

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.969 
worry about this little pivot thing just
use<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.170> blocker<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:10.740> they

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
use it for a blocker because they

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.660 
use it for a blocker because they
they're<00:01:11.460> still<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> blocker<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> track<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
they're still a blocker on the track and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.899 
they're still a blocker on the track and
then<00:01:14.670> you'll<00:01:14.820> start<00:01:15.090> watching<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.659> opposing

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
then you'll start watching the opposing

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.440 
then you'll start watching the opposing
teams<00:01:18.020> current<00:01:19.020> pass<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:20.400> their<00:01:20.850> initial<00:01:21.060> pass

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
teams current pass on their initial pass

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749 
teams current pass on their initial pass
you'll<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:21.990> ahead<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.350> you'll<00:01:22.619> mark<00:01:23.130> off<00:01:23.340> one

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you'll go ahead and you'll mark off one

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.810 
you'll go ahead and you'll mark off one
in<00:01:24.750> their<00:01:25.049> first<00:01:25.560> scoring<00:01:25.920> pass<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.700> our

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in their first scoring pass which is our

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.569 
in their first scoring pass which is our
second<00:01:27.210> pass<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.630> ahead<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.930> mark<00:01:28.110> off<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
second pass go ahead and mark off to so

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.539 
second pass go ahead and mark off to so
on<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.180> forth<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.930> say<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.829> jammer<00:01:32.189> gets

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
on and so forth I say your jammer gets

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.060 
on and so forth I say your jammer gets
sent<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> penalty<00:01:33.360> box<00:01:33.770> during<00:01:34.770> past

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
sent to the penalty box during past

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.770 
sent to the penalty box during past
three<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.400> opposing<00:01:38.939> team<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.509> still

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
three and the opposing team is still

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.830 
three and the opposing team is still
making<00:01:39.990> passes<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:41.909> jammer<00:01:42.210> doesn't<00:01:42.630> get

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
making passes so your jammer doesn't get

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.520 
making passes so your jammer doesn't get
released<00:01:43.200> until<00:01:43.619> past<00:01:43.979> seven<00:01:45.320> you'll<00:01:46.320> go

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
released until past seven you'll go

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.929 
released until past seven you'll go
ahead<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.799> write<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> seven<00:01:47.430> therefore<00:01:47.820> when

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
ahead and write a seven therefore when

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.149 
ahead and write a seven therefore when
they<00:01:48.090> got<00:01:48.240> released

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
they got released

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.999 
they got released
same<00:01:50.159> thing<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.700> pivots<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.600> blockers<00:01:52.229> they
