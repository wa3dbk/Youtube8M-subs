 model and today will expire which concept is the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.559
 card zac and me the virtues and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 differences with the other jackets for 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 the conditions with the different mouth 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 with the key or creative well this model 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.700
 is let's say it's a jacket of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.590
 first price 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.050
 talking on the price because the jacket 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.040
 It seems that super pretty is for the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.320
 cold windproof membrane 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.150
 reproduced to water but what is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.370
 important is that it is a first price 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.379
 because the core of pattern design is much more 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.170
 always much less panels than by 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.570
 example, then 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.820
 the accent 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.530
 the price is also cheaper in 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.850
 fix them for the back 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.450
 how is a panel 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.270
 straight we will have the panel to control 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.330
 the moment of the jacket is very well 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.159
 made and now that it is very beautiful 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.260
 the armpits the breathable fabric the 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.240
 pockets 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.240
 let's say it's a basic but a touch 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.040
 for example in the back a 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.570
 period in the inner part 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.570
 It is as if felt 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.180
 the neck is an elastic neck the wta 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.670
 which is the very practical jacket for 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.829
 all kinds of winter temperatures the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.110
 calculation that would be more or less for some 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:06.729
