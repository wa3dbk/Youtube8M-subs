I<00:04:14.360> this<00:04:14.750> is<00:04:15.170> called<00:04:16.239> spun<00:04:17.239> it's<00:04:17.600> called<00:04:17.810> tough

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
I this is called spun it's called tough

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.699 
I this is called spun it's called tough
spun<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.280> tough<00:04:19.790> spun<00:04:20.239> allows<00:04:20.870> us<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.290> diffuse

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
spun and tough spun allows us to diffuse

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.140 
spun and tough spun allows us to diffuse
the<00:04:21.739> light<00:04:21.919> a<00:04:22.100> little<00:04:22.220> bit<00:04:22.580> but<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.000> also

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
the light a little bit but it also

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.360 
the light a little bit but it also
allows<00:04:23.570> us<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:24.050> spread<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.740> out<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.919> little<00:04:25.250> bit

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
allows us to spread it out a little bit

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.760 
allows us to spread it out a little bit
that<00:04:25.970> helps<00:04:26.390> me<00:04:26.510> fill<00:04:26.930> up<00:04:26.960> all<00:04:27.289> that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
that helps me fill up all that

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.330 
that helps me fill up all that
information<00:04:28.250> that's<00:04:28.820> in

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
out of this particular light then I get

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.760 
out of this particular light then I get
to<00:04:32.760> point<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.330> right<00:04:33.720> where<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:33.930> want<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.440> I
