then<00:01:09.100> here's<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.640> tricky<00:01:09.880> part<00:01:10.120> you<00:01:10.240> want<00:01:10.390> to

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.430 

and<00:01:31.580> obviously<00:01:32.580> this<00:01:32.790> takes<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.090> little

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
and obviously this takes a little

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.790 
and obviously this takes a little
perfection<00:01:34.440> but<00:01:35.330> in<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.420> nutshell<00:01:36.590> that's<00:01:37.590> how

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
perfection but in a nutshell that's how

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.100 
perfection but in a nutshell that's how
it<00:01:37.860> works<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.730> can<00:01:39.420> trim<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.660> any<00:01:39.900> way<00:01:40.080> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it works and you can trim it any way you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.570 
it works and you can trim it any way you
kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.010> want<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.160> want<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.400> you

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
kind of want that so if you want to you

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.670 
kind of want that so if you want to you
can<00:01:44.700> even<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.510> tape<00:01:48.560> around<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
can even use a little tape around the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:19.210 
can even use a little tape around the
edges<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.160> that

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.220
