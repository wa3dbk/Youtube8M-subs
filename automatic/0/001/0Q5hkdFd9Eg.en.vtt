00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.140
 Every battery consists of a negative coach 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.249
 the cathode 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:09.570
 a positive Poland 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.559
 the anode 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.210
 and a liquid, the so-called electrolyte who passes the current 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.060
 These parts are made of different materials depending on 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.699
 Material and space are available 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.150
 OTE is made of a metal such as Zenker or Lithium 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.949
 Cathode is made of nickel with pressure looks brownstone or even looks 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.739
 As an electrolyte, conductive solutions of saline alkalis and acids such as 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.040
 ExxonMobil and Chloride Czink chloride sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.780
 for the isolation seal and wrapping of the batteries will be 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.480
 Isolation steel plastics paper and organic used for substances 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.410
 The three commercially available batteries are the all Kalimantan battery like zinc 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.010
 Coal batteries and the lithium-ion battery in the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.010
 Above all, the lithium-ion battery is used in electric vehicles 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.080
 the name of the battery is derived from the composition 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.130
 from the battery he constantly puts the battery here for example one 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.160
 alkaline batteries tracked in different steps 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.180
 First of all, the rods must be cups with power-giving chemicals 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.310
 be filled 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.939
 the r + v of the al Khali battery consists of a mixture of Traunstein and 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.370
 Forcefield a press, this powder comes so small ranks 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.109
 This tight fit exactly into the stall mug Ramthun are used there 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.550
 Subsequently, a partition of white tape inserted this separator 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.220
 Trends the two poles from each other 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.600
 who - choir of alkaline batteries consists of a mixture of potassium hydroxide solution 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.010
 and sinks or the ten happen this alkaline 10 Tel he will be in the middle 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.640
 like the battery 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.970
 then the battery is reliably sealed with a lid 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.070
 so that did not leak 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.580
 Afterwards, the arge manager Marcel in brass is pressed into the battery 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.570
 This new battery has positive and negatively charged particles 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.830
 Battery put in a circuit we want the negative particles over the circuit 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.099
 Circuit to the positive flow that allows the head of nobility 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.019
 this movement of particles through the circuit creates the current
