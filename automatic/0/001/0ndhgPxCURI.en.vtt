00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
valve there and that valve there

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.860 
valve there and that valve there
actually<00:01:08.290> blows<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.590> lot<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.100> dust<00:01:09.870> into

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870

actually blows a lot of the dust into
the<00:01:10.990> bottom<00:01:11.770> area<00:01:12.070> here<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.600> things<00:01:13.810> I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
the bottom area here one of the things I

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.820 
the bottom area here one of the things I
struggled<00:01:14.409> with<00:01:14.440> was<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:17.229> other<00:01:17.590> type

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
struggled with was is it the other type

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.270 
struggled with was is it the other type
of<00:01:17.909> creepy-crawlies<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.830> always<00:01:20.979> easily

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
of creepy-crawlies is it always easily

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.090 
of creepy-crawlies is it always easily
get<00:01:21.490> stuck<00:01:21.610> here<00:01:21.940> in<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.090> step<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.770> this<00:01:23.920> one

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
get stuck here in the step but this one

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.469 
get stuck here in the step but this one
here<00:01:24.280> has<00:01:24.400> been<00:01:24.580> actually<00:01:24.729> very<00:01:24.909> very<00:01:25.330> good

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
here has been actually very very good

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.100 
here has been actually very very good
it's<00:01:26.320> kind<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.710> cool<00:01:26.979> quite<00:01:27.310> spotless<00:01:27.760> as<00:01:28.510> you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
it's kind of cool quite spotless as you

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.300 
it's kind of cool quite spotless as you
can<00:01:29.260> see<00:01:31.049> my<00:01:32.049> comment<00:01:32.439> will<00:01:32.530> be<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.860> see<00:01:33.040> how<00:01:33.070> it

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
can see my comment will be to see how it

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.469 
can see my comment will be to see how it
goes<00:01:33.460> with<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:34.090> wheels<00:01:34.299> after<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:36.310> year<00:01:36.610> when

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
goes with the wheels after one year when

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.289 
goes with the wheels after one year when
you<00:01:37.689> need<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:37.930> replace<00:01:38.170> them<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:39.270> use<00:01:40.270> a

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
you need to replace them I use a

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.450 
you need to replace them I use a
concrete<00:01:40.689> pulse<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.409> it'd<00:01:41.740> be<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.010> lot<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.280> wear

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
concrete pulse so it'd be a lot of wear

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.320 
concrete pulse so it'd be a lot of wear
and<00:01:42.490> tear<00:01:42.790> there<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.520> other<00:01:45.700> than<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.000> can't

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
and tear there but other than I can't

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.480 
and tear there but other than I can't
really<00:01:46.509> fault<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:46.930> it's<00:01:47.590> been<00:01:47.799> fantastic<00:01:50.490> so

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
really fault this it's been fantastic so

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:06.450 
really fault this it's been fantastic so
now<00:01:51.640> what<00:01:51.820> we'll<00:01:51.939> do<00:01:52.119> is<00:01:52.830> come<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.040> corner

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.999 

so<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.579> pool<00:02:07.789> setup<00:02:08.149> though<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.539> have<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:09.009> six

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
so the pool setup though I have it's six

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.589 
meter of seven meters by three and a
half<00:02:12.110> meters<00:02:12.430> plus<00:02:13.430> just<00:02:14.090> two<00:02:14.269> by<00:02:14.450> two<00:02:14.510> here

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
half meters plus just two by two here

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.309 
half meters plus just two by two here
and<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:18.560> sort<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:19.390> greenery<00:02:20.390> RN<00:02:20.720> have<00:02:20.989> around

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.199 

now<00:02:45.230> that's<00:02:45.500> some<00:02:45.650> research<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.220> these<00:02:46.370> poor

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
now that's some research on these poor

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.780 
now that's some research on these poor
cleaners<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:49.069> will<00:02:49.250> probably<00:02:49.400> be<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.640> best

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
cleaners this will probably be the best

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.479 
cleaners this will probably be the best

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
type of pool planner you'll get for the

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.990 
type of pool planner you'll get for the
money<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.880> pay<00:02:53.060> anyway<00:02:53.950> as<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.549> can<00:02:55.610> see<00:02:55.849> now

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
money you pay anyway as you can see now

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.390 
money you pay anyway as you can see now
it's<00:02:56.150> start<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.510> crawl<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.900> wall<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:01.010> does<00:03:01.069> go

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
it's start to crawl the wall it does go

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.800 
it's start to crawl the wall it does go
all<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:01.670> way

it goes right up to the corner there's

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:12.089 
it goes right up to the corner there's
nothing

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.509 

so<00:04:13.099> I'm<00:04:13.160> just<00:04:13.280> gonna<00:04:13.510> demonstrate<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:15.519> guys

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
so I'm just gonna demonstrate the guys

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:35.320 
so I'm just gonna demonstrate the guys
up<00:04:16.699> the<00:04:16.820> wall

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.080 

so<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.510> went<00:04:36.690> up<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.990> down<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.530> same<00:04:38.090> piece

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
so that went up and down the same piece

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.830 
so that went up and down the same piece
of<00:04:39.360> area<00:04:39.600> there<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:41.180> it's<00:04:42.180> cleaned<00:04:42.479> it<00:04:42.690> and

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
of area there and it's cleaned it and

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.689 
of area there and it's cleaned it and
now<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.620> seems<00:04:43.860> like<00:04:43.979> it's<00:04:44.100> gonna<00:04:44.310> go<00:04:44.520> all<00:04:44.669> the

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
now it seems like it's gonna go all the

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:55.010 
now it seems like it's gonna go all the
way<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.120> top<00:04:50.510> there<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.600> go<00:04:53.780> that's<00:04:54.780> right

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
way to the top there you go that's right

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:12.250 
way to the top there you go that's right
up<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.350> Talde<00:04:57.949> it's<00:04:58.949> very<00:04:59.220> clever<00:04:59.460> design

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.470 

so<00:05:12.890> then<00:05:13.040> I<00:05:13.070> think<00:05:13.280> as<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.640> gets<00:05:13.790> enough<00:05:14.240> air

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
so then I think as it gets enough air

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:25.590 
so then I think as it gets enough air
into<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.900> system<00:05:15.140> it<00:05:15.410> starts<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.800> pull<00:05:16.010> back

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:38.429 

unless<00:05:26.600> it<00:05:26.840> just<00:05:27.170> starts<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.500> go<00:05:27.710> down

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:38.439 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.219 

yep<00:05:39.069> I<00:05:39.489> hope<00:05:39.729> you<00:05:39.849> enjoyed<00:05:40.089> the<00:05:40.209> video<00:05:40.300> thumbs

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
yep I hope you enjoyed the video thumbs

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:41.850 
yep I hope you enjoyed the video thumbs
