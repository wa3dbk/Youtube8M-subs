 together with it to decorate your dacha 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.830
 plot will help you a hedge of 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.199
 plants unlike ordinary such 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.779
 green fence also protects against dust 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.430
 and add oxygen for that there is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.490
 very many large assortment of plants 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.609
 It should be clearly a few 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.769
 Things First Live Shorn 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.610
 hedge any freely you let go 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.260
 for uncut hedgerow 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.550
 fits a lot of plants here I 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.920
 I'll call the main camp 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 which grow very well with us 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.520
 beautiful winters 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 and managed to go here is the crown chubushnik 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.390
 which people called jasmine he 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.239
 grows up to three meters very beautiful 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.539
 blooms and smells delicious this forsythia 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.030
 here are two kinds of intermediate and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.579
 European they grow to 3 meters 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.180
 3 meters high around me so 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.890
 are clearly up on a part of the Cape lies 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 on blooms early early spring before 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 leaf blooming bright yellow 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 flowers and and better shave a little bit 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.110
 after also after flowering 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.150
 Now that she laid instead of what is west 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.740
 seeds so she laid a new buds 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.229
 next year must be considered 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.509
 where do you plant it, that is, if you 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.570
 there is wet there will fit grains 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.240
 which is a lot of different varieties 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.689
 if you are sunny then you can plant 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.759
 decorative leafy 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.200
 that red forest the same lived 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.770
 tariff there is very often from the fence goes 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.420
 shadow or penumbra there you can use 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.400
 jasmine which is then not final 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.590
 can be used 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.300
 honeysuckle is also the most Tatar we 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.360
 which blooms beautifully and very tasty 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.400
 smells you can use euonymus 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.900
 also decide which one will be 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.240
 your hedge 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.970
 if you prefer a uniform green 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.140
 fence you fit thuja hedge 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.660
 can be built 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.880
 and from shrubs of different varieties landed 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.250
 near several species of flowering plants 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.410
 at different times you get a living garden 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.510
 changing throughout the year 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.640
 if you don't need to plant 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.990
 living faith 23 meters you can 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.770
 use the plant which approach for 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.520
 hedge 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.610
 two and a half two is a barberry tunberg 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.680
 there is a barberry tunberg 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.570
 the usual species has a green leaf but 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.430
 he is good because he is bright red in the fall 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.010
 coloring can eat barberry tunberg 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.230
 trapar puri him brightly burgundy sheets he 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.580
 the whole season is very beautiful rinks blooms 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.459
 small yellow flowers 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.040
 another plant for a low hedge 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.290
 his purple grows to 2 meters and 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 has delicate gray foliage all season 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.540
 The big plus of this shrub is that 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.549
 sprigs grow from the roots therefore 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.150
 when shearing it is quite simple to form 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.769
 big beautiful ball for you sleep I live and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.230
 it is absolutely necessary to get out of the forest 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.959
 fifty to fifty-fifty to 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.010
 you can live a little manure for chamfers and 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.350
 if you fall asleep good land 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.330
 if she is in the shadow in the deep shadow then she has 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.950
 a little greener if still 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.040
 services under this people remains 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.100
 your charms keeping it in shades of shades 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.110
 foliage this willow purple pharma graces 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.170
 already in adult condition here this 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.269
 instance 8 years old but she has been three years 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.010
 probably this is maximus and he 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.890
 reached 3 years ago 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.480
 this is a very plastic culture of his her 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.489
 you can shoot three times per season 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.100
 let's cut it off about centimeters 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.560
 10 12 shoot 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.290
 choose trellis scissors because 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.390
 pruner such a large amount 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.340
 very hard hand gets tired before that 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.360
 specifically there is useful scissors with no 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:55.390
 very long 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:57.370
 blade shoot that is it you don't 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.490
 give it a clear and sharp ball 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.850
 for example, when you cut your hair and just 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.770
 tear her up so she was more dense 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.420
 that is, it is your task that will take you 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.420
 maximum 10 15 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.520
 for trimmed hedges very often 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.560
 used cotoneaster brilliant he 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.969
 very steady their smoke therefore 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.370
 now enjoyed in urban landscaped 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:30.710
 plots can also be used 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.080
 live format will fit a centimeters to 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.500
 two meters but more often used for 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.250
 small there it turns out more dense 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.479
 shear hedge 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.879
 3 times per season in spring at the end of July and 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.099
 possible in early September, somewhere then she 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.740
 will be very tight and shears it 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.620
 about 10 centimeters removes 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.599
 land out for a low hedge 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.259
 dig countries neck 40 centimeters wide 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.360
 50 centimeters lip dig up depth 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.960
 a full trench is planted 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.789
 staggered after 40 centimeters 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.460
 then you will have it tight and have 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.919
 some amount of options to create 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.479
 hedges mass important right 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.729
 determine which plants are suitable 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.349
 just for your site so that 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.840
 time spent effort and money 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.710
 paid off as soon as possible and your 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.849
 hedge 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.849
 pleased all year round
