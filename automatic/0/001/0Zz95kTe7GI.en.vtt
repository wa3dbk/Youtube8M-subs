gtx 960 now the best way to understand

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.320 
gtx 960 now the best way to understand
960<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.880> some<00:00:24.060> live<00:00:24.210> demos

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.870 

so<00:00:31.960> what<00:00:32.110> we<00:00:32.169> got<00:00:32.320> going<00:00:32.529> on<00:00:32.619> here<00:00:32.680> well<00:00:33.340> I'm

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
so what we got going on here well I'm

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.790 
so what we got going on here well I'm
playing<00:00:34.150> so<00:00:34.300> far<00:00:34.480> cry<00:00:34.660> 4<00:00:34.720> okay<00:00:35.320> great<00:00:35.500> and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
playing so far cry 4 okay great and

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.650 
playing so far cry 4 okay great and
you've<00:00:35.920> got<00:00:36.070> a<00:00:36.130> gtx<00:00:36.610> 960<00:00:37.030> in<00:00:37.180> that<00:00:37.300> box<00:00:37.480> over

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
you've got a gtx 960 in that box over

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.510 
you've got a gtx 960 in that box over
there<00:00:37.840> and<00:00:38.230> everything<00:00:38.650> is<00:00:38.890> stuck<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.370> what

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
there and everything is stuck and what

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.040 
there and everything is stuck and what
you'll<00:00:39.640> see<00:00:39.700> is<00:00:39.910> right<00:00:40.180> away<00:00:40.480> we're<00:00:40.809> getting

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
you'll see is right away we're getting

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.140 
you'll see is right away we're getting
40<00:00:41.410> frames<00:00:41.620> per<00:00:41.920> second<00:00:42.340> okay<00:00:42.790> so<00:00:42.850> let's<00:00:43.059> take

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
40 frames per second okay so let's take

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.549 
40 frames per second okay so let's take
a<00:00:43.210> look<00:00:43.390> at<00:00:43.450> options<00:00:43.690> we're<00:00:44.110> actually<00:00:44.230> running

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
a look at options we're actually running

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.670 
a look at options we're actually running
4x<00:00:45.220> msaa<00:00:45.730> which<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:46.780> very<00:00:47.020> common<00:00:47.290> setting

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
4x msaa which is a very common setting

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.200 
4x msaa which is a very common setting
most<00:00:47.860> people<00:00:48.129> run<00:00:48.340> now<00:00:48.879> we're<00:00:49.030> going<00:00:49.150> to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
most people run now we're going to

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.780 
most people run now we're going to
change<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.720> to<00:00:49.809> 2x<00:00:50.290> MSAA<00:00:50.830> and<00:00:51.309> we're<00:00:51.610> going<00:00:51.760> to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
change it to 2x MSAA and we're going to

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.299 
change it to 2x MSAA and we're going to
turn<00:00:52.120> on<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.510> great<00:00:52.930> technology<00:00:53.530> called<00:00:53.710> MFA<00:00:54.280> a

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
turn on a great technology called MFA a

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.070 
turn on a great technology called MFA a
now<00:00:54.879> before<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.300> get<00:00:55.420> into<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:55.690> too<00:00:55.840> much<00:00:55.870> I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
now before we get into this too much I

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.660 
now before we get into this too much I
want<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.290> know<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.530> GeForce<00:00:56.980> experience<00:00:57.129> will

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
want to know the GeForce experience will

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.400 
want to know the GeForce experience will
do<00:00:57.790> this<00:00:57.940> for<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.150> automatically<00:00:58.809> but<00:00:59.290> we

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
do this for you automatically but we

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.660 
do this for you automatically but we
want<00:00:59.559> people<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.860> get<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.129> sense<00:01:00.340> of<00:01:00.489> how<00:01:00.610> to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
want people to get the sense of how to

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.130 
want people to get the sense of how to
tweak<00:01:00.910> this<00:01:01.030> stuff<00:01:01.269> up<00:01:01.449> right<00:01:01.629> and<00:01:01.870> what

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
tweak this stuff up right and what

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.320 
tweak this stuff up right and what
you'll<00:01:02.290> see<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:02.620> right<00:01:02.920> away<00:01:03.220> with<00:01:03.850> mfa

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
you'll see is right away with mfa

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.120 
you'll see is right away with mfa
running<00:01:04.839> you're<00:01:05.199> getting<00:01:05.440> about<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.830> same

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
running you're getting about the same

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.330 
running you're getting about the same
experience<00:01:06.970> as<00:01:07.180> 4x<00:01:07.750> msaa<00:01:08.229> but<00:01:09.100> you're<00:01:09.250> getting

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
experience as 4x msaa but you're getting

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.890 
experience as 4x msaa but you're getting
it<00:01:09.580> at<00:01:09.700> much<00:01:09.909> higher<00:01:09.970> performance<00:01:10.690> we<00:01:10.840> were

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
it at much higher performance we were

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.320 
it at much higher performance we were
about<00:01:11.140> 42<00:01:11.740> now<00:01:12.370> we're<00:01:12.549> at<00:01:12.640> about<00:01:12.700> 50<00:01:13.180> frames

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
about 42 now we're at about 50 frames

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.490 
about 42 now we're at about 50 frames
per<00:01:13.540> second<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:13.900> let's<00:01:14.049> take<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.260> to<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.409> next

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
per second so let's take it to the next

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.320 
per second so let's take it to the next
level<00:01:14.650> we're<00:01:14.890> going<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.070> overclock<00:01:15.610> now<00:01:15.820> gtx

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
level we're going to overclock now gtx

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.899 
level we're going to overclock now gtx
960<00:01:16.869> is<00:01:17.080> incredibly<00:01:17.890> power<00:01:18.280> efficient<00:01:18.820> it

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
960 is incredibly power efficient it

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.719 
960 is incredibly power efficient it
runs<00:01:19.119> at<00:01:19.270> about<00:01:19.299> 120<00:01:20.229> watts<00:01:20.409> TDP<00:01:21.130> so<00:01:21.610> that

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
runs at about 120 watts TDP so that

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.130 
runs at about 120 watts TDP so that
means<00:01:21.909> there's<00:01:22.060> plenty<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.479> power<00:01:22.630> Headroom

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
means there's plenty of power Headroom

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.200 
means there's plenty of power Headroom

playing a MOBA full screen it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.039 
playing a MOBA full screen it's

no<00:02:11.810> sound<00:02:12.020> at<00:02:12.230> all<00:02:12.319> which<00:02:12.890> means<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.280> can

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
no sound at all which means that you can

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.010 
no sound at all which means that you can
play<00:02:13.580> your<00:02:13.700> mobile<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.030> your<00:02:14.150> bedroom<00:02:14.330> or<00:02:14.630> next

so I think that pretty much summarizes

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.660 
so I think that pretty much summarizes
