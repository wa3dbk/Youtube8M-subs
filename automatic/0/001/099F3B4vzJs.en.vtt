00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that crawfish given the opportunity are

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
that crawfish given the opportunity are
gonna<00:00:55.770> hang<00:00:56.129> on

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
gonna hang on

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.380 
gonna hang on
this<00:00:57.840> type<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> structure<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.670> if<00:01:00.090> your

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
this type of structure so if your

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.039 
this type of structure so if your
structures<00:01:01.379> specific<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.640> you're<00:01:03.510> flipping

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
structures specific and you're flipping

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.950 
structures specific and you're flipping
what<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.939> I'll<00:01:06.210> choose<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
what I like to do is I'll choose a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.060 
what I like to do is I'll choose a
crawfish<00:01:07.650> bait<00:01:08.960> I'll<00:01:09.960> throw<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.650> there<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
crawfish bait I'll throw it in there and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.350 
crawfish bait I'll throw it in there and
I'll<00:01:11.159> leave<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.990> I'll<00:01:12.990> hold<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.650> next<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
I'll leave it I'll hold it next to that

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.230 
I'll leave it I'll hold it next to that
cover<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.630> longer<00:01:16.200> than<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.530> normally<00:01:16.799> would

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
cover for longer than I normally would

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.820 
cover for longer than I normally would
okay<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.840> fish<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.590> there

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
okay because that fish is up there

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.240 
okay because that fish is up there
looking<00:01:20.689> for<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> food<00:01:22.080> source<00:01:22.380> around<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
looking for a food source around that

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
looking for a food source around that
target<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> water<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
target and what I do when the water is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.030 
target and what I do when the water is
stained<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.939> I'll<00:01:27.900> actually<00:01:28.290> create

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
stained like this I'll actually create

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.649 
stained like this I'll actually create
my<00:01:29.430> lure<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:31.020> sound<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.860> crawfish<00:01:32.340> okay<00:01:33.030> so

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
my lure to sound like a crawfish okay so

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.109 
my lure to sound like a crawfish okay so
I'll<00:01:33.869> use<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> bobber<00:01:34.650> stop<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.520> hold<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
I'll use a bobber stop to hold the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.960 
I'll use a bobber stop to hold the
weight<00:01:36.270> close<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> bait<00:01:37.560> I'll<00:01:38.460> use<00:01:38.939> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
weight close to the bait I'll use a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.310 
weight close to the bait I'll use a
tungsten<00:01:39.570> weight<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:41.509> when<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> put<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
tungsten weight which when I put this

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.560 
tungsten weight which when I put this
glass<00:01:43.649> bead<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.460> between<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> worm<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
glass bead in between the worm and the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.609 
glass bead in between the worm and the
weight<00:01:45.829> that<00:01:46.829> clack<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.970> there<00:01:48.619> sounds

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
weight that clack right there sounds

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.249 
weight that clack right there sounds
like<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> crawfish<00:01:50.280> clicking<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.020> can

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
like a crawfish clicking and if you can

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.410 
like a crawfish clicking and if you can
hold<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.770> bait<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.820> against<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
hold that bait right up against the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.730 
hold that bait right up against the
target<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.200> lot<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.100> times<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:57.780> fish<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.469> hone

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
target a lot of times that fish can hone

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.880 
target a lot of times that fish can hone
in<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.430> clicking<00:01:59.909> sound

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
in on that clicking sound

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.460 
in on that clicking sound
and<00:02:01.190> you'd<00:02:01.640> be<00:02:01.820> surprised<00:02:02.360> at<00:02:02.690> how<00:02:02.930> many<00:02:02.990> more

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
and you'd be surprised at how many more

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.240 
and you'd be surprised at how many more
bites<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.190> get<00:02:04.630> by<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.690> two<00:02:06.140> things<00:02:06.560> making

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
bites you get by the two things making

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.999 
bites you get by the two things making
it<00:02:07.400> sound<00:02:07.670> like<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.909> crawfish<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.860> leaving<00:02:09.860> it

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
it sound like a crawfish and leaving it

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:24.570 
it sound like a crawfish and leaving it
in<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:10.670> longer<00:02:11.660> than<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.350> normally<00:02:12.500> would

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.230
