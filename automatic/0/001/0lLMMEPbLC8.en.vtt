strong this little bendy see scott

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.450 
strong this little bendy see scott
better<00:01:39.000> point<00:01:39.380> right<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> all

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
better point right here this is all

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
better point right here this is all
toothpicks<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.119> duct<00:01:42.360> tape<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:42.899> why

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
toothpicks and duct tape so that's why

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.100 
toothpicks and duct tape so that's why
it's<00:01:43.049> flimsy<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.860> mean<00:01:44.869> it's<00:01:45.869> okay<00:01:46.079> for

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it's flimsy I mean it's okay for

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.190 
it's flimsy I mean it's okay for
throwing<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:49.189> my<00:01:50.540> pullback

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.270 

rubber<00:01:55.200> band<00:01:55.470> gun<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.100> shoots<00:01:56.939> bb's<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.280> think

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
rubber band gun it shoots bb's I think

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670 
rubber band gun it shoots bb's I think
it<00:01:59.430> actually<00:01:59.549> might<00:01:59.909> shoot<00:02:00.149> these<00:02:00.469> try<00:02:01.469> real

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it actually might shoot these try real

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.000 
it actually might shoot these try real
quick

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.180 

try<00:02:09.010> trying<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.640> get<00:02:09.760> one<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.030> all<00:02:10.450> right<00:02:10.660> yo<00:02:10.780> yo

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
try trying to get one in all right yo yo

try trying to get one in all right yo yo
all<00:02:12.190> right<00:02:12.340> let's<00:02:12.610> try<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.330> see<00:02:14.170> right<00:02:14.350> here

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.520 

it's<00:02:19.450> actually<00:02:19.540> not<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.900> bad<00:02:19.990> weapon<00:02:20.440> right

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
it's actually not a bad weapon right

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.830 
it's actually not a bad weapon right
there<00:02:21.930> all<00:02:22.930> right<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:24.120> right<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.300> there

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
there all right so it's right here there

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.880 
there all right so it's right here there
we<00:02:25.930> go<00:02:28.200> whoa<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.730> works<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.740> think<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:32.830> is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
we go whoa that works I think this is

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.660 
we go whoa that works I think this is
actually<00:02:33.340> going<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.490> be<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.670> most<00:02:33.820> powerful

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
actually going to be the most powerful

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.310 
actually going to be the most powerful
yeah<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> most<00:02:37.360> powerful<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:38.050> shoots

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
yeah this is the most powerful it shoots

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.830 
yeah this is the most powerful it shoots
the<00:02:39.310> blow-dart<00:02:39.760> blitz<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:42.040> also<00:02:42.190> shoots

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the blow-dart blitz and it also shoots

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.610 
the blow-dart blitz and it also shoots
without<00:02:43.840> blowing<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:46.080> rubber<00:02:47.080> band<00:02:47.350> on<00:02:47.470> this

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
without blowing the rubber band on this

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.620 
without blowing the rubber band on this
one<00:02:47.770> is<00:02:47.890> better<00:02:48.040> than<00:02:48.280> rubber<00:02:49.060> band<00:02:49.300> on<00:02:49.480> this

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
one is better than rubber band on this

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.440 
one is better than rubber band on this
one<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:50.050> used<00:02:50.830> scotch<00:02:51.460> tape<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:52.000> one<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.390> it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
one I used scotch tape on this one so it

about<00:03:20.620> modifying<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.980> see<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:24.340> one<00:03:24.520> if<00:03:25.150> a

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
about modifying you see if one if a

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.810

toothpick would fit yeah i think i'm
going<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.000> modify<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:32.320> going<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.530> turn

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
going to modify it it's going to turn

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.970
