00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.200 

this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:02.010> first<00:00:02.220> French<00:00:02.429> class<00:00:02.700> we<00:00:03.000> have

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
this is the first French class we have

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
this is the first French class we have
the<00:00:03.620> gas<00:00:04.620> filled<00:00:05.100> trucks<00:00:05.730> what<00:00:06.660> we<00:00:06.870> call<00:00:07.049> them

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the gas filled trucks what we call them

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.900 
the gas filled trucks what we call them
as<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.560> veer<00:00:07.740> shocks<00:00:08.040> are<00:00:08.160> basically<00:00:08.460> gasping

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
as a veer shocks are basically gasping

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.140 
as a veer shocks are basically gasping
he<00:00:09.179> called<00:00:09.389> them<00:00:09.480> as<00:00:09.570> NOx<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.910> this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
he called them as NOx and this is the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.799 
he called them as NOx and this is the
first<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:13.290> like<00:00:13.590> 100<00:00:13.980> cc<00:00:14.160> class<00:00:14.809> normally

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
first it's like 100 cc class normally

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.680 
first it's like 100 cc class normally
gas<00:00:16.230> shocks<00:00:16.470> are<00:00:16.710> higher<00:00:17.190> power<00:00:17.490> because<00:00:18.060> we

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
gas shocks are higher power because we

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.910 
gas shocks are higher power because we
have<00:00:18.779> brought<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> hundred<00:00:19.770> cc

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
have brought it to the hundred cc

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
have brought it to the hundred cc
essentially<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> comfort<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.660> also

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
essentially that the comfort is also

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.259 
essentially that the comfort is also
important<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> computing<00:00:22.949> customer<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
important to the computing customer the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
have an easy pickle system it's not very

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
have an easy pickle system it's not very
safe<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> nights<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:07.979> when<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> speeds

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
safe in the nights also when the speeds

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
safe in the nights also when the speeds
are<00:01:09.030> long<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:09.900> headlamp<00:01:10.290> starts<00:01:10.619> dimming<00:01:10.890> so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
are long your headlamp starts dimming so

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.640 
are long your headlamp starts dimming so
you<00:01:11.549> don't<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> roads<00:01:12.150> properly<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:13.380> PC

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
you don't see the roads properly the PC

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.260 
you don't see the roads properly the PC
flicker-free<00:01:14.220> headlamp<00:01:14.700> gives<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
flicker-free headlamp gives you that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.440 
flicker-free headlamp gives you that
power<00:01:15.450> consistently<00:01:16.640> at<00:01:17.640> whatever<00:01:17.880> throttle

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
power consistently at whatever throttle

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.700 
power consistently at whatever throttle
that's<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> major

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
that's one of the major

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.560 
that's one of the major
so<00:01:22.710> overall<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.370> think<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.880> smaller

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
so overall if you think the smaller

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.469 
so overall if you think the smaller
engine<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> certain<00:01:25.800> power<00:01:26.300> which<00:01:27.300> is

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
engine has a certain power which is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.380 
engine has a certain power which is
unique<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.080> its<00:01:28.140> class<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.210> vehicle<00:01:30.210> has<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
unique in its class the vehicle has the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.370 
unique in its class the vehicle has the
suspension<00:01:31.080> which<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.260> gasping<00:01:33.380> electrical

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
suspension which is gasping electrical

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.370 
suspension which is gasping electrical
systems<00:01:34.920> are<00:01:35.450> DC<00:01:36.450> flicker-free<00:01:36.780> headlamps

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
systems are DC flicker-free headlamps

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
systems are DC flicker-free headlamps
and<00:01:37.580> these<00:01:38.580> are<00:01:38.760> some<00:01:38.940> very<00:01:38.970> important

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and these are some very important

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.510 
and these are some very important
features<00:01:40.380> 400cc<00:01:41.220> cos<00:01:41.990> therefore<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.110> call<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
features 400cc cos therefore we call it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.840 
features 400cc cos therefore we call it
ultimate<00:01:45.410> in<00:01:46.410> short<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.830> say<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.430> product

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
ultimate in short we say it is a product

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.469 
ultimate in short we say it is a product
which<00:01:48.150> is<00:01:48.180> an<00:01:48.570> expected<00:01:49.110> mileage<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.910> 160

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
which is an expected mileage for 160

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.520 
which is an expected mileage for 160
that's<00:01:51.780> 87.3<00:01:52.619> an<00:01:53.420> unexpected<00:01:54.420> power<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:55.320> this
