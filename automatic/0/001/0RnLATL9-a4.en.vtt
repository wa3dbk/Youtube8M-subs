run themselves but we're giving them
something<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.830> think<00:02:19.890> about<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.550> that's<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
something to think about so that's the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.400 
something to think about so that's the
most<00:02:21.090> important<00:02:21.540> thing<00:02:21.570> we<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.290> try

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
most important thing we just got to try

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.990 
most important thing we just got to try
and<00:02:22.500> keep<00:02:22.590> winning<00:02:22.890> we're<00:02:22.980> honored<00:02:23.160> amazing

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and keep winning we're honored amazing

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.160 
and keep winning we're honored amazing
run<00:02:24.150> certainly<00:02:24.450> away<00:02:24.660> from<00:02:24.870> home<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.080> think

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
run certainly away from home I think

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.540 
run certainly away from home I think
we've<00:02:25.410> won<00:02:25.530> our<00:02:25.560> last<00:02:25.650> six<00:02:26.100> games<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
we've won our last six games on the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.980 
we've won our last six games on the
world<00:02:26.730> now<00:02:26.850> maybe<00:02:27.030> more<00:02:27.240> than<00:02:27.270> nothing<00:02:27.660> seven

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
world now maybe more than nothing seven

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.930 
world now maybe more than nothing seven
so<00:02:28.170> we're<00:02:28.740> going<00:02:28.890> well<00:02:29.100> but<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:29.490> were<00:02:29.670> pleased

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
so we're going well but we were pleased

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.390 
so we're going well but we were pleased
with<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.240> way<00:02:30.330> at<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.480> plane<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:32.190> think

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
with the way at the plane and I think

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.390 
with the way at the plane and I think
today<00:02:32.520> was<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.760> tough<00:02:32.820> game<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.180> us
