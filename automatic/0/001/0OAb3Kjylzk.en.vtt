00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
 keeping some in order 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.600
 in today's project you will learn to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:26.880
 assemble beautiful side tables and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:30.240
 practices you will need to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.930
 two circles of mdf with 60 centimeters 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.000
 of diameter two rectangles of mdf with 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.120

 When I go to tell the pieces of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.539
 wood that someone from the store cut 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.149
 recommended sizes do not apply. 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.760
 forget the cracks of the rectangles that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.710
 should be done well in the center with 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.460
 length of plus or minus all 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.470
 We feel like coming home this whole time. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.350
 cut material and the housing 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.570
 rectangles as shown in the image made 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.390
 apply the glue to the base of the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.750
 rectangle and fit a circle over 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.670
 it to ensure the stability of the part 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.790
 martelly some nails along the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.610
 rectangular wood now or just apply the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.220
 wood mass on each nail and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 remove the excess with a spatula 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.930
 finishes of the new neighbor is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.409
 account of the caretaker trio for wood

 Latex paint and varnish in this order 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.780
 if you prefer to stand and casters on the bottom in the

 your side table will be super 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.840
