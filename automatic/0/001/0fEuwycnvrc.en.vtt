do is a quick review of this board
obviously<00:00:17.670> I'll<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:17.850> show<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.060> right<00:00:18.330> now

obviously I'll just show you right now

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.510 
obviously I'll just show you right now
it's<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.869> good<00:00:19.289> size<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.340> because

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it's a good size and I like that because

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.130 
it's a good size and I like that because
you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.910> stick<00:00:21.119> handle<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.779> shoot<00:00:21.990> off

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
you can stick handle on it and shoot off

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.320 
you can stick handle on it and shoot off
of<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.590> dual-purpose<00:00:22.880> also<00:00:23.880> compared<00:00:24.269> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
of it so a dual-purpose also compared to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.929 
of it so a dual-purpose also compared to
other<00:00:24.650> shooting<00:00:25.650> pads<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.099> fairly<00:00:26.369> thick<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
other shooting pads it's fairly thick so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.099 
other shooting pads it's fairly thick so
you<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> long<00:00:27.300> life<00:00:27.510> span<00:00:27.779> out<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.019> this

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
you have a long life span out of this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.980 
you have a long life span out of this
thing<00:00:28.260> it's<00:00:28.410> really<00:00:28.560> durable<00:00:29.150> which<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.480> really

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
thing it's really durable which I really

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.540 
thing it's really durable which I really
like<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.380> once<00:00:31.949> again<00:00:32.070> you're<00:00:32.309> gonna<00:00:32.369> be

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
like because once again you're gonna be

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
like because once again you're gonna be
able<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> use<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> long<00:00:33.210> time<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.809> other

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
able to use it for a long time the other

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.150 
able to use it for a long time the other
thing<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.440> handle<00:00:34.800> right<00:00:34.829> here

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
thing I like is this handle right here

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.100 
thing I like is this handle right here
because<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.820> makes<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.149> portable<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.780> have

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
because it makes it more portable I have

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.080 
because it makes it more portable I have
used<00:00:37.350> bigger<00:00:37.559> pads<00:00:37.890> without<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.460> handles<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
used bigger pads without the handles and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
used bigger pads without the handles and
it's<00:00:39.360> nearly<00:00:39.540> impossible<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:40.020> move<00:00:40.200> them<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it's nearly impossible to move them so I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.959 
it's nearly impossible to move them so I
like<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.370> he<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.670> pick<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> up

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
like that about this he can pick it up

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
like that about this he can pick it up
and<00:00:42.149> take<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.570> nice<00:00:42.780> shooting<00:00:43.350> area<00:00:43.590> like

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and take it to a nice shooting area like

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.319 
and take it to a nice shooting area like
this<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:44.579> we're<00:00:44.789> gonna<00:00:44.879> show<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.210> we

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
this so now we're gonna show you what we

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.279 
this so now we're gonna show you what we
can<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:47.420> can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.840> slides

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
can do with it you can see it slides

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.500 
can do with it you can see it slides
really<00:00:49.649> nicely<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.670> doesn't<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.059> come<00:00:51.239> up

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.599 

that<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.719> exactly<00:00:58.500> why<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.100> want<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.489> one

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
that is exactly why you want to get one

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
that is exactly why you want to get one
of<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.760> shooting<00:01:00.059> guys<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.600> lot<00:01:01.410> less

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of these shooting guys a lot less

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.329 
of these shooting guys a lot less
friction<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:03.149> puck<00:01:03.359> slides<00:01:03.600> nicely<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.470> it's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
friction the puck slides nicely and it's

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
friction the puck slides nicely and it's
really<00:01:05.700> close<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.900> stick<00:01:07.080> handling

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
really close to actually stick handling

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.670 
really close to actually stick handling
on<00:01:07.530> ice<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:09.140> shooting<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.260> great<00:01:10.500> because

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
on ice for shooting it's great because

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
on ice for shooting it's great because
it's<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> nice<00:01:11.100> smooth<00:01:11.400> surface<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:12.090> gonna

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's a nice smooth surface it's gonna

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
it's a nice smooth surface it's gonna
protect<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.810> bottom<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.439> blade<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:14.189> your

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
protect the bottom of your blade if your

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.880 
protect the bottom of your blade if your
shooting<00:01:14.670> off<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.270> before<00:01:16.200> no<00:01:16.470> time<00:01:16.710> your

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
shooting off of this before no time your

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.350 
shooting off of this before no time your
blade<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> gonna<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.880> thick<00:01:18.150> it's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
blade is gonna be about that thick it's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 
blade is gonna be about that thick it's
no<00:01:18.780> good<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> buy<00:01:19.560> new<00:01:19.590> sticks

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
no good for you have to buy new sticks

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
no good for you have to buy new sticks
so<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.280> gonna<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.549> save<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> money

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so it's gonna actually save you money

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.340

of<00:01:22.380> shooting<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.130> also<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.210> good<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
of shooting and also the good thing is
