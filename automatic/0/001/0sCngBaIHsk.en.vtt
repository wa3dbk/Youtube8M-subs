00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
from from not really satisfied with this

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.749 
from from not really satisfied with this
one<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.759> lower<00:02:06.119> version<00:02:06.630> before<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> think

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
one this is lower version before I think

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.850

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
luminance

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.920 
luminance
there<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.680> no<00:02:13.830> need<00:02:14.100> for<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:15.000> hydrogen<00:02:15.360> thing

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
there is no need for the hydrogen thing

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.070 
there is no need for the hydrogen thing
because<00:02:16.580> unless<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.730> want<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.970> blind<00:02:18.240> drivers

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
because unless you want to blind drivers

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.770 
because unless you want to blind drivers
around<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:20.160> will<00:02:20.460> be<00:02:20.610> still<00:02:20.880> visible<00:02:21.330> believe
