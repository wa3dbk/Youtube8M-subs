monkey off I've got it running through a

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
loop because the other pedals don't

loop because the other pedals don't
sound<00:01:20.649> good<00:01:20.740> minutes<00:01:21.130> in<00:01:21.189> front<00:01:21.399> of<00:01:21.460> its

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
sound good minutes in front of its

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.149 
sound good minutes in front of its
buffer<00:01:22.030> just<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.840> takes<00:01:23.049> away<00:01:23.259> some<00:01:23.470> dynamics

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
buffer just it takes away some dynamics

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.200 
buffer just it takes away some dynamics
and<00:01:25.470> some<00:01:26.470> spark<00:01:26.830> will<00:01:26.950> not<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:27.189> much<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:28.090> much

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
and some spark will not so much so much

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:36.929 
and some spark will not so much so much
tone<00:01:28.479> suckage<00:01:28.930> is<00:01:29.079> dynamic<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:29.619> here<00:01:30.009> we<00:01:30.070> go

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.999 

that's<00:01:37.420> same<00:01:37.929> picking<00:01:38.409> it's<00:01:38.560> almost<00:01:38.799> like<00:01:38.979> a

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
that's same picking it's almost like a

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:47.100 
that's same picking it's almost like a
compression<00:01:39.939> in<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.060> buffer<00:01:40.450> kind<00:01:40.689> of<00:01:40.749> games

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.760 

it's<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.800> harshness<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.380> while<00:01:50.380> taking

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
it's a harshness in it and while taking

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's a harshness in it and while taking
away<00:01:51.190> some<00:01:51.520> levels<00:01:51.940> so<00:01:52.150> don't<00:01:52.930> really<00:01:53.170> like

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
away some levels so don't really like

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.080 
away some levels so don't really like
that<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:53.740> first<00:01:54.130> thing<00:01:54.340> first<00:01:54.580> if<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:54.940> get

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
that so first thing first if you get

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.570 
that so first thing first if you get
this<00:01:55.380> again<00:01:56.380> buffers<00:01:56.770> are<00:01:56.920> sensitive<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.400> the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
this again buffers are sensitive to the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.010 
this again buffers are sensitive to the
rig<00:01:57.760> they're<00:01:57.940> playing<00:01:58.180> but<00:01:58.480> you<00:01:58.570> might<00:01:58.750> want

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
rig they're playing but you might want

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.530 
rig they're playing but you might want
to<00:01:59.220> get<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.250> bypass<00:02:00.670> looper<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.300> it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
to get a bypass looper for it

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
to get a bypass looper for it
so<00:02:02.310> I've<00:02:03.310> got<00:02:03.490> them<00:02:03.640> all<00:02:03.760> set<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:05.410> know

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
so I've got them all set it and you know

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.400 
so I've got them all set it and you know
close<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.370> same<00:02:06.610> same<00:02:07.360> setting<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:07.990> let's

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
close to the same same setting so let's

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:19.490 
close to the same same setting so let's
do<00:02:08.590> clean<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.130> Zen<00:02:09.520> Drive<00:02:09.790> at<00:02:10.000> 12

of that full you know glassiness of the
Zen<00:03:51.120> Drive<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.950> but<00:03:53.700> let's<00:03:53.910> try<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.330> without

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
Zen Drive so but let's try it without

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.040 
Zen Drive so but let's try it without
cords<00:03:55.470> let's<00:03:55.620> try<00:03:55.860> more<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.790> Leedy<00:03:57.420> stuff<00:03:57.840> with

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
cords let's try more of Leedy stuff with

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.250 
cords let's try more of Leedy stuff with
it<00:03:58.200> here<00:03:58.560> we<00:03:58.650> go

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260

like<00:04:36.780> as<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.139> other<00:04:37.290> ones

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
like as the other ones

00:04:38.880 --> 00:05:33.869

alright let's switch to the neck pickup
see<00:05:36.830> if<00:05:36.919> that<00:05:37.069> makes<00:05:37.340> any<00:05:37.490> difference

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.429

okay<00:06:18.500> and<00:06:19.300> now<00:06:20.300> let's<00:06:20.570> change<00:06:20.810> the<00:06:20.960> settings

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
okay and now let's change the settings

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.280 
okay and now let's change the settings
to<00:06:21.470> more<00:06:21.740> of<00:06:21.800> a<00:06:21.860> clean<00:06:22.130> boost<00:06:22.370> type<00:06:22.670> setting

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
to more of a clean boost type setting

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.500 
to more of a clean boost type setting
gain<00:06:24.290> down<00:06:24.680> level<00:06:25.310> up<00:06:27.550> same<00:06:28.550> with<00:06:28.760> all<00:06:29.270> of

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
gain down level up same with all of

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.080 
gain down level up same with all of
these

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:41.430 

see<00:06:34.660> how<00:06:34.750> that<00:06:34.930> does<00:06:35.200> clean

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:49.649 

not<00:06:42.040> bad<00:06:42.520> sounds<00:06:42.970> actually<00:06:43.270> better<00:06:43.480> that<00:06:43.690> way

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:07:08.899 

quite<00:06:50.659> as<00:06:50.780> good<00:06:50.930> as<00:06:51.050> that<00:06:51.259> one

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:08.909 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:11.209 

the<00:07:09.509> Zen<00:07:09.779> doesn't<00:07:10.110> do<00:07:10.199> a<00:07:10.229> clean<00:07:10.559> boost<00:07:10.740> just<00:07:11.039> as

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:11.219 
the Zen doesn't do a clean boost just as

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:18.990 
the Zen doesn't do a clean boost just as
a<00:07:11.249> nice<00:07:11.809> low<00:07:12.809> overdrive

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.340 

it's<00:07:19.300> not<00:07:19.449> really<00:07:19.630> nice<00:07:19.810> though<00:07:20.050> all<00:07:20.199> right

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.350 
it's not really nice though all right

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.370 
it's not really nice though all right
let's<00:07:20.860> put<00:07:21.070> them<00:07:21.160> back<00:07:21.310> to<00:07:21.750> the<00:07:22.750> settings<00:07:23.229> they

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
let's put them back to the settings they

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.080 
let's put them back to the settings they
might<00:07:23.590> be<00:07:23.770> most<00:07:23.949> happy<00:07:24.190> at<00:07:24.580> and<00:07:26.850> run<00:07:27.850> through

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
might be most happy at and run through

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:45.959 
might be most happy at and run through
them<00:07:28.270> one<00:07:29.110> last<00:07:29.139> time

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:45.969 

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:48.029 

you
