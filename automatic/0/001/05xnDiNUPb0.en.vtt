00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
on the bridge and the reason that is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040 
on the bridge and the reason that is
relevant<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.539> chapter<00:00:57.780> or

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
relevant is because in this chapter or

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510 
relevant is because in this chapter or
at<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.199> beginning<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> chapter<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.430> are

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
at the beginning of this chapter you are

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
at the beginning of this chapter you are
given<00:00:59.789> an<00:00:59.940> extremely<00:01:00.480> handy<00:01:00.809> weapon<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.469> arc

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
given an extremely handy weapon the arc

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
given an extremely handy weapon the arc
induction<00:01:02.219> Lance<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.270> basically<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
induction Lance that is basically the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.840 
induction Lance that is basically the
charge<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.379> lightning<00:01:04.830> rifle<00:01:05.129> weapon<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
charge of lightning rifle weapon and the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.609 
charge of lightning rifle weapon and the
reason<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.330> good<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
reason this is good is because if you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.649 
reason this is good is because if you
charge<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.280> homes<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.119> enemies<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
charge up it homes in on enemies and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.240 
charge up it homes in on enemies and
that<00:01:09.720> applies<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> both<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.070> aiming

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that applies to both with your aiming

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.950 
that applies to both with your aiming
