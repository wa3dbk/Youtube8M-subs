I'll take a snap of this because this is
the<00:00:33.090> most<00:00:33.239> useful<00:00:33.510> image<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.469> gonna

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the most useful image and it's gonna

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
the most useful image and it's gonna
mean<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.280> colors<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.880> my<00:00:36.149> images

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
mean I can get my colors and my images

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.920 
mean I can get my colors and my images
looking<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.079> good<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.320> possible<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:38.399> quickly

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
okay so it's a white balance card now we

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.779 
okay so it's a white balance card now we
use<00:00:42.210> these<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.690> set<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.230> color<00:00:43.590> correctly<00:00:44.370> now

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

this<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.059> nice<00:01:03.329> gray<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.439> specifically

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this this is a nice gray is specifically

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.870 
this this is a nice gray is specifically
made<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.580> job

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
made for this job

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
made for this job
so<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> click<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.260> it'll<00:01:07.590> remap<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
so I click on that and it'll remap the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.280 
so I click on that and it'll remap the
colors<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.000> where<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.659> clicked<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
colors so where I just clicked and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
colors so where I just clicked and
everything<00:01:10.680> around<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.100> becomes<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.610> neutral

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
everything around it becomes a neutral

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.660 
everything around it becomes a neutral
gray<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:13.439> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> subtle<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
gray it's kind of subtle because the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
gray it's kind of subtle because the
cameras<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> reasonable<00:01:15.810> good<00:01:15.960> job<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
cameras do a reasonable good job but you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.260 
cameras do a reasonable good job but you
may<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.130> able<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> difference<00:01:18.180> that

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
may be able to see the difference that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 
may be able to see the difference that
looks<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.750> bit<00:01:18.930> magenta<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.619> looks<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
looks a little bit magenta that looks a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.330 
looks a little bit magenta that looks a
lot<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.820> neutral<00:01:21.270> now<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.830> good<00:01:23.130> tip

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
lot more neutral now one really good tip

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
lot more neutral now one really good tip
is<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> make<00:01:23.909> sure<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.630> properly

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
colors that little bit more accurate now

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.999

like<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> use<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:37.650> target

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
like to use and it's this little target

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.490 
like to use and it's this little target
up<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> top<00:01:39.240> left<00:01:39.270> corner<00:01:39.810> because

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
up here in the top left corner because

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530 
up here in the top left corner because
this<00:01:40.860> allows<00:01:41.189> me<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> check<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.030> chromatic

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this allows me to check for chromatic

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.810 
this allows me to check for chromatic
aberration<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.259> even<00:01:43.890> though<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.220> using<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
aberration and even though I'm using a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
aberration and even though I'm using a
great<00:01:45.240> Canon<00:01:45.570> camera<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.140> professional

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
great Canon camera and professional

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.069 
great Canon camera and professional
glass<00:01:46.950> I'm<00:01:47.310> getting<00:01:48.090> chromatic<00:01:48.509> aberration

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
glass I'm getting chromatic aberration

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.539 
glass I'm getting chromatic aberration
and<00:01:49.259> that's<00:01:49.439> perfectly<00:01:50.100> normal

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
and that's perfectly normal

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.100 
and that's perfectly normal
you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.840> color

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
you can see it here is this color

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.530 
you can see it here is this color
fringing<00:01:52.590> sort<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.070> blue<00:01:53.310> fringing<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
fringing sort of blue fringing there and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380 
fringing sort of blue fringing there and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
chromatic aberration it's just genius if

chromatic aberration it's just genius if
it<00:02:30.489> doesn't<00:02:30.700> work<00:02:30.819> for<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.150> or<00:02:31.390> your<00:02:31.540> lens

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
it doesn't work for you or your lens

it doesn't work for you or your lens
isn't<00:02:32.019> listed<00:02:32.200> jump<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.040> manual<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.730> then

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
isn't listed jump to the manual and then

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.720 
isn't listed jump to the manual and then
you<00:02:34.300> can<00:02:34.480> manually<00:02:35.110> remove<00:02:35.650> lens<00:02:36.130> vignetting

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
you can manually remove lens vignetting

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.110 
you can manually remove lens vignetting
and<00:02:36.819> chromatic<00:02:37.300> aberration<00:02:37.989> as<00:02:38.140> required

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
and chromatic aberration as required

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.910 
and chromatic aberration as required
okay<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.180> that's<00:02:40.900> basically<00:02:41.380> got<00:02:41.560> our<00:02:41.680> image

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
okay so that's basically got our image

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.800 
okay so that's basically got our image
looking<00:02:42.160> pretty<00:02:42.459> good<00:02:42.670> now<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.390> couple<00:02:43.660> of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
looking pretty good now a couple of

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.600 
looking pretty good now a couple of
other<00:02:43.930> things<00:02:44.080> I'd<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.560> do<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:45.010> my<00:02:45.190> photos

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
other things I'd like to do to my photos

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.940 
other things I'd like to do to my photos
particularly<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.299> they're<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.600> studio<00:02:47.410> picture

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
particularly if they're a studio picture

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.789 
particularly if they're a studio picture
is<00:02:48.100> I'll<00:02:48.819> come<00:02:49.000> back<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.360> basic<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.989> I'll

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
is I'll come back to the basic and I'll

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.280 
is I'll come back to the basic and I'll
put<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.760> little<00:02:52.150> bit<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.330> negative<00:02:52.540> clarity

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
put a little bit of negative clarity

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.289 
put a little bit of negative clarity
because<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.799> like<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.220> soften<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.760> skin<00:02:54.970> ever

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
because I like to soften the skin ever

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.059 
because I like to soften the skin ever
so<00:02:55.510> slightly<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.140> I'll<00:02:56.500> put<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.739> down<00:02:56.890> to

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
so slightly so I'll put that down to

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.180 
so slightly so I'll put that down to
minus<00:02:57.459> 20<00:02:57.880> I'll<00:02:58.599> put<00:02:58.870> my<00:02:59.019> vibrance<00:02:59.650> up<00:02:59.830> to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
minus 20 I'll put my vibrance up to

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.690 
minus 20 I'll put my vibrance up to
about<00:03:00.610> plus<00:03:01.060> 30<00:03:01.660> more<00:03:02.470> or<00:03:02.620> less<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.040> my

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
about plus 30 more or less and my

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.930 
about plus 30 more or less and my
saturation<00:03:03.940> up<00:03:04.599> to<00:03:05.019> 10<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.549> put<00:03:06.790> some

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
saturation up to 10 so that I put some

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.059 
saturation up to 10 so that I put some
color<00:03:07.330> into<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.959> pictures<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.680> like<00:03:09.040> a

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
color into the pictures and I like a

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.320 
color into the pictures and I like a
little<00:03:09.370> bit<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.549> color<00:03:09.760> if<00:03:10.000> they're<00:03:10.150> going<00:03:10.269> to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
little bit of color if they're going to

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.770 
little bit of color if they're going to
be<00:03:10.420> color

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
be color

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.650 
be color
let's<00:03:11.140> have<00:03:11.290> plenty<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.450> also<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.480> like

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
let's have plenty of it and also I like

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.630 
let's have plenty of it and also I like
to<00:03:13.720> come<00:03:13.930> down<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.170> detail<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.860> put<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:15.340> here

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
to come down to detail and put in here

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.870 
to come down to detail and put in here
about<00:03:15.880> my<00:03:16.269> about<00:03:16.690> 20<00:03:17.349> rather<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.880> luminance

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
about my about 20 rather of luminance

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.720 
about my about 20 rather of luminance
noise<00:03:19.150> reduction<00:03:19.900> okay<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.130> just<00:03:21.400> helps

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
noise reduction okay and that just helps

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.030 
noise reduction okay and that just helps
to<00:03:21.910> remove<00:03:22.570> any<00:03:22.930> noise<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.560> might<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.859> in<00:03:23.950> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
to remove any noise that might be in the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.729 
to remove any noise that might be in the
picture<00:03:24.840> one<00:03:25.840> other<00:03:25.989> thing<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.230> like<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.530> do<00:03:26.620> is

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
picture one other thing I like to do is
