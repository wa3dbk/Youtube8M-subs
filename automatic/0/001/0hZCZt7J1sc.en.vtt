00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 if it is a fruit that can not be found 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.620
 hardly ever in the trade and 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.990
 gooseberry 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.730
 if you want to enjoy this fruit you have to 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.730
 absolutely have in his garden 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.010
 whether it's gooseberry 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 or redcurrants the requirements 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.770
 are practically the same they are 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.720
 plants that m 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.150
 insolent smoke not too much moisture 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 during the winter but as fresh during 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.460
 the summer it also supports a little bit 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.439
 shaded the priority when planting 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.270
 gooseberries or currants 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.149
 rap you have to have an extremely 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.850
 clean and there I worked my soil on 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.270
 at least one square meter is removed 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.020
 absolutely everything quack 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.809
 that is to say, that is true 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 really a real dig then here 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.820
 it is a gooseberry in containers 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.149
 we are going to soak him up as 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.379
 want to use in a bucket of water 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.930
 and during that time we are going to do 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.789
 our hole then because it already has 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 been worked it's going to be a lot more 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.809
 easy to dig it so we go 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.080
 just do it slightly more 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.939
 deep that a spade and we'll go there 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.070
 put potting soil that we 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.320
 let's go mixed with our land and we're going 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.950
 give a little bit of normal earth the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.939
 garden soil from above we will plant 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.130
 our currant bushes so we go on 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.290
 position at the bottom of the hole in his 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.060
 range of where we will use our 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.369
 down not to bury him anymore 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.350
 deeply he was on pole he did not 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.600
 you must never bury a shrub 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.200
 it's also true for a tree and we're going 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.200
 carry our land around the mound 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:52.020
 we 're going to have a bowl that's 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.750
 formed around our gooseberry we 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.600
 let's water the value of 10 liters 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.130
 water 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.570
 here we finished our implementation of 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.890
 currant bushes now stays longer 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.350
 wait until next spring 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.140
 at the end of the winter if it is very 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.810
 cold and it froze it thawed on 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.220
 will iron our currant bushes and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.780
 will bring 10 liters again 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.640
 of water is in principle one should be 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.890
 quiet then a little tip when 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.690
 even for spring do not hesitate to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.239
 pay the foot to prevent the grass 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.239
 unwanted sprouts in currant bush
