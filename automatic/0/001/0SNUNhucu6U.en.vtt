there'll be no earth left so what can we

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.600 
there'll be no earth left so what can we

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
do connect to a semi carrier if I can

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
do connect to a semi carrier if I can
get<00:00:32.759> inside<00:00:32.910> their<00:00:33.300> heads<00:00:33.510> maybe<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.140> can

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
get inside their heads maybe I can

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.110 
get inside their heads maybe I can
reverse<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.010> awakening<00:00:35.489> put<00:00:35.670> them<00:00:35.790> all<00:00:35.940> back

even when your mind was protected we've
turned<00:00:49.649> those<00:00:49.890> safeties<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.519> now

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
turned those safeties off now

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.119 
turned those safeties off now
that<00:00:51.480> means<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> nanites<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.469> your<00:00:52.620> suit<00:00:52.949> are

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that means the nanites in your suit are

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.520 
that means the nanites in your suit are
free<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:54.120> means<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.750> transform<00:00:55.260> into

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
free that means they can transform into

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.579 
free that means they can transform into
anything<00:00:56.159> any<00:00:56.430> form<00:00:56.879> imaginable<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.350> could

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
actually become a set that's a risk I'm

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:26.610 
actually become a set that's a risk I'm
willing<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:02.010> take

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620
