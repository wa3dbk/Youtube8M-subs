00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.260 
modern warfare and call duty two
together<00:00:31.189> overall<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.430> play<00:00:32.640> online<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
together overall when I play online I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.060 
together overall when I play online I
find<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:33.780> seems<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:34.950> bit

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
find that there seems to be a little bit

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.150 
find that there seems to be a little bit
of<00:00:35.460> less<00:00:36.059> cheap<00:00:36.480> perks<00:00:36.960> than<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.739> other<00:00:37.890> games

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
of less cheap perks than in other games

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.819 
of less cheap perks than in other games
and<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.180> zombie<00:00:39.629> mode<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.050> brilliant<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and the zombie mode is brilliant it

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.979 
and the zombie mode is brilliant it
actually<00:00:41.219> competes<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:41.969> left<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.450> dead<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
actually competes with left for dead and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.310 
actually competes with left for dead and
is<00:00:43.760> brilliantly<00:00:44.760> done<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.329> love<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.079> how

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
is brilliantly done I love the way how

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.130 
is brilliantly done I love the way how
they<00:00:46.440> set<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.520> know<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.180> by<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.450> weapons

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
they set up you know you by your weapons

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.090 
they set up you know you by your weapons
and<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.899> fun<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.800> hell<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and it just it's just fun as hell to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.299 
and it just it's just fun as hell to
play<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.399> friends<00:00:54.559> now<00:00:55.559> while<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> war<00:00:56.070> has

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
play with friends now while the war has

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.080 
play with friends now while the war has
a<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.670> better<00:00:56.969> story<00:00:57.449> than<00:00:57.840> four<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
a much better story than four is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.270 
a much better story than four is
definitely<00:01:00.090> longer<00:01:00.329> than<00:01:00.660> four<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.890> felt

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
definitely longer than four and it felt

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060 
definitely longer than four and it felt
more<00:01:02.550> profound<00:01:03.710> fighting<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> Japanese

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
more profound fighting the Japanese

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.910 
more profound fighting the Japanese
makes<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.119> feel<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.750> less<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.409> you're

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
makes this feel a lot less like you're

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.030

it makes it brings you like into the
story<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.700> American

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
story more I think for the more American

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.940 
story more I think for the more American
side<00:01:39.450> because<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.110> previous<00:01:40.470> Call<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> Duty

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
side because in previous Call of Duty

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
side because in previous Call of Duty
games<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.310> sort<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> felt<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> Americans

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
games I sort of felt that the Americans

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
games I sort of felt that the Americans
you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.490> didn't<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:44.939> know<00:01:45.450> them

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you know you didn't really know them

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.039 
you know you didn't really know them
very<00:01:45.960> much<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.560> didn't<00:01:47.210> get<00:01:48.210> attached<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.899> them

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
very much I didn't get attached to them

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.389 
very much I didn't get attached to them
like<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.290> did<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> Russian<00:01:50.189> end

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
like you did with the Russian end

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.060 
like you did with the Russian end
British<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.530> glad<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> they

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
British side but I really glad that they

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.639 
British side but I really glad that they
focused<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> different<00:01:54.119> part<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.290> war

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
focused on a different part of the war

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.340 
focused on a different part of the war
then<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.299> storm<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
then you know just you know storm the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.149 
then you know just you know storm the
beaches<00:01:58.790> but<00:02:00.079> overall<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.530> can't<00:02:01.890> say<00:02:02.040> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
beaches but overall I can't say this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.480 
beaches but overall I can't say this
game<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.399> perfect<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.619> still<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
game is perfect I still think that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.540 
game is perfect I still think that
Treyarch<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.079> know<00:02:07.320> learn<00:02:08.310> from

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
Treyarch that you know learn from

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.520 
Treyarch that you know learn from
