00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.470
 the recipe for scribble farinata 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.739
 according to the ancient codes that date back 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.340
 in the fifteenth century it is very simple and 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.120
 requires only four water ingredients 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.610
 salt olive oil strictly 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.540
 extra virgin and above all Ligurian and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.540
 chickpea flour 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.679
 in val varenna in the hinterland appeals e 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.530
 there is one of the few mills 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:04.220
 but don't think about the one with the wheels on 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.159
 stream that produces legume flour a 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.710
 modern factory but not too much that you give 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.049
 cc of anatolian origin because 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.689
 the Sardinian ones though of superior quality 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.140
 do not guarantee continuity of 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.240
 feeding to the production process 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.929
 step by step I am one 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.259
 medicine churns out the case 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.679
 raw material is almost unique to the 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.679
 gruel 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.880
 legumes should be cleaned and washed before 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.880
 move to the crushing phase 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.950
 this first operation takes place 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.160
 inside this car while 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.390
 the water we see is what it takes to 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.390
 cool the engine 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.189
 the second operation that of 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 crushing provides for eleven different ones 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.760
 step by step steps are used a 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.700
 more and more rifling roller 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.750
 thin as the image of gods shows 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.750
 different cylinders 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.800
 once the mill was done with the grinding wheel 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.220
 of stone as this model shows in 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.069
 still able to produce 10 kg of 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.640
 flour in spite of the proportions 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.640
 reduced 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.110
 eleven different even or as good 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.720
 soccer training to get the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.660
 winning team are shuffled 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.320
 in the agitated king to get the compound 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.320
 winning 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.989
 another machine the detached king 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.780
 prevents the formation of lumps because 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.120
 being chickpea flour rich in 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.840
 fat tends to gulacsi water with 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.840
 easiness 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.709
 it takes more than an hour to finish the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.980
 cycle and it's in a day 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.040
 if the weather is dry the mill succeeds in 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.730
 pack up to 60 quintals of 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.030
 excellent flour while cruz semolina that it 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.670
 and bran I take in Genoese come 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.670
 separated and marketed separately 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.900
 because chickpeas are not thrown away 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.900
 practically nothing 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.740
 chickpea flour compared to that of 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.500
 wheat is fatter and higher 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.970
 gluten content for which of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.000
 superior food quality 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.630
 remember the farinata must be Coptic 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.540
 at not less than 300 degrees for 8 10 minutes 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.940
 in an absolutely flat oven provided 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.410
 of grill to get caught 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.900
 the indispensable gilding in a baking dish 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.900
 copper greased with extra virgin olive oil 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.300
 the doses to be respected are a kilo of 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.449
 chickpea flour per 4 liters of water 50 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.270
 grams of salt per kilo 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.000
 the soft dough eliminated the foam 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.850
 must rest in a cool place for at least 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.710
 six hours and rim was before being 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:44.050
 baked in the maximum heat and the oven 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.650
 reaches 400 degrees 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.440
 7 8 minutes are enough if the temperature is 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.130
 lower proportionately increases the 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.130
 cooking time
