00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
recommend getting is glyph obtained

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039 
recommend getting is glyph obtained
beasts<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.150> tame<00:01:06.360> him<00:01:06.540> faster

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
beasts that you can tame him faster

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.020 
beasts that you can tame him faster
other<00:01:07.740> than<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.549> don't<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:08.880> need

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
other than that you don't really need

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.440 
other than that you don't really need
anything<00:01:09.299> special<00:01:10.310> if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.490> low<00:01:11.760> DPS<00:01:12.210> I'd

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
anything special if you have low DPS I'd

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.450 
anything special if you have low DPS I'd
suggest<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.080> optimize<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:14.040> damage

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
suggest that you optimize for damage

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.640 
suggest that you optimize for damage
over<00:01:14.670> time<00:01:14.700> moves<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.570> instant<00:01:16.110> casts<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
over time moves and instant casts and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.330 
over time moves and instant casts and
maybe<00:01:16.979> some<00:01:17.220> speed<00:01:17.520> increases<00:01:19.070> better<00:01:20.070> yet

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
maybe some speed increases better yet

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.620 
maybe some speed increases better yet
you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.580> bring<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> friend<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.360> will<00:01:21.509> make

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
you can bring a friend which will make

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
you can bring a friend which will make
him<00:01:21.780> super<00:01:22.259> easy<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.770> especially<00:01:23.340> if

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
him super easy to get especially if

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.270 
him super easy to get especially if
somebody<00:01:23.939> has<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> lot<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> interrupts<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.280> tame

the trick to this one is just kite him

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.670 
the trick to this one is just kite him
around<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.270> log<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.840> he<00:01:42.930> spawns<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.409> front

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
around the log that he spawns in front

around the log that he spawns in front
of<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.270> interrupts<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> heal<00:01:45.720> whenever<00:01:46.049> he

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of and interrupts the heal whenever he

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.810 
of and interrupts the heal whenever he
starts<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> cast<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.950> he<00:01:47.159> only<00:01:47.189> did<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.759> think

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
starts to cast it he only did it I think

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.690 
starts to cast it he only did it I think
once<00:01:48.240> when<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:48.630> fighting<00:01:48.960> him<00:01:49.610> other<00:01:50.610> than

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
once when I was fighting him other than

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
that
just<00:01:52.229> pop<00:01:52.409> any<00:01:52.619> instance<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.430> just

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
just pop any instance that you have just
