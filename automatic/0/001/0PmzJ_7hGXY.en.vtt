00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.670
 Help the dosbox on current 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.109
 operating system like xp vista or windows 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 7 can play and we will look first 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.900
 times that on the cd so we have here 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.410
 City is file and we have to go now 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.510
 actually just copy this folder 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.969

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.750

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.750
 insert 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.059
 it is actually relatively easy now 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.620
 we open the folder hockey manager 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.530
 and drag the hockey manager died 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.530
 File on the postbox link 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.000
 we can allude to the game for a moment 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.659
 yes, if you always be 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.659
 No one here 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.240
 we have different clubs that we 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:40.340
 can select 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.880
 I want the foxes of Weisswasser 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:49.640
 start in the bundesliga games level 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.299
 yes let's pre-set and yes we 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.299
 stop the game 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.750
 the b cup but clear 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:08.649
 well I round a bit and we 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.649
 play at home against landsberg 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:26.340
 strength 43 second league as stronger 71 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.340
 That should be done in any case 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.810
 make up half a million 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.100
 I'll click on a few menus now 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.480
 Finances also have the possibility of money 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.590
 take or shares at 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.700
 speculate 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:47.020
 advertising comes right out try it 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.170
 television advertising 80,000 certainly gives 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:59.410
 better companies just now 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:00.790
 a jersey 73,000 of playtime I think 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.620
 that's pretty neat 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.680
 the option on extension and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.870
 tied advertising brings always automatically 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.950

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:20.620
 mega games yes okay and the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.950
 Video dice are also still advertising

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.670
 come still expand a variety of things 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.670
 leave it as it is 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.810
 Youth a youth investing is always 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.810

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.260
 who are stronger than us 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.590
 You can see the strength here again 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.590

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.750

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.330
 Set workout what I now 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.940
 However, we do not do that 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.930
 continuously improve 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.569
 also have the possibility over the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.270

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.610

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.270
