00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.200
 from the football field to the hospital that can go fast if the players 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.859
 Not 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:15.289
 I wanted to play my club in the balanced adjusted book value 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.650
 yes one has betrayed a few days ago we are the markets 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.869
 in the crisis area 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.550
 At the University Hospital Regensburg, the serious ones are specialized 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.259
 on such football injuries 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.259
 There is no shortage of patients here 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.270
 take care of yourself 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.600
 how can be solved I can do it right in the air 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.230
 her cross when read this day it will be replaced 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.560
 how exactly that also depends on the gender that patients have 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.710
 Stability is possible 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.840
 to different techniques which one here also part of the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.410
 Seven times we decide in the women depending on the musculature 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.290
 and which they no longer connect as a substitute No we know that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.900
 Especially women have certain ratios of the muscles of the thighs 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.050
 or back since then are different and it is taken into account 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.320
 around 250 cruciate ligaments 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.180
 but who this team every year 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.660
 Long-term studies show that the knee is more stable when two Kreuzbergers 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.780
 be replaced 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.600
 the level of nine sports injuries does not protect that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.980
 Cruciate ligament tears remain the biggest risk especially for female footballers 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.759
 the anterior cruciate ligament is injured five times more frequently than 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.080
 called 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.480
 with regard to the reform 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.060
 Prof and 4 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.600
 the FÃ¶rderverein has lied 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 more women 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 Develop programs as possible 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.980
 more prevention 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.440
 to work that is cruciate ligament 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.710
 three women too 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.420
 less injuries 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.790
 That is also the goal of sports scientists in Freiburg 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.589
 The researchers are investigating why football is so dangerous for the female 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.079
 knee 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.759
 the answers so far 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.759
 Women have less strength and way of connective tissue 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.369
 and they move differently than men 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:28.619
 This is especially evident in jumps landing is the problem without 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.930
 the women have on compared to men 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.249
 the stronger use rotation of the knee joint 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.810
 the orthopedist said Andy Waldis their contents are kinking, however 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.899
 Knee joint inside and so they have, of course, different than in the 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:48.419
 Level yes in the frontal level they would pick more would be a jump in 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.259
 the pool 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.749
 Special soccer shoes for women should help 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:56.429
 this narrower and lighter 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.429
 but above all, they have another person off 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.319
 it's about the right ground adhesion the so-called traction 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.629
 for women it has to be lower 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.269
 if the editorship and Oberstdorf process is too strong 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.779
 Thanks to a return to increased joints benefits 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:17.879
 and that has to 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.430
 Moments in a group does not do a good deed so always gives an optimal 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.169
 Traction their musculoskeletal system that athletes and athletes around the steadily 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.639
 this optimal traction the planned tax 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.090
 special school for women through targeted strength training 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.949
 the band is missing the sports scientists 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.689
 we are aware of that or death 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.650
 These trees belonged to the tournament and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania where from the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.559
 knee 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.590
 we have the task that the lower leg 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.129
 to pull backwards 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.470
 and if they are properly trained then the guests can 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.319
 their job well come up percent and the wood but not everything 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.319
 relieve 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.260
 The right training helps the most 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.739
 to avoid a cruciate ligament tear and even if it already happened 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.249
 Haller's Opi went well but of course she is allowed to work out 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.560
 not first of all where you go with crutches for four weeks
