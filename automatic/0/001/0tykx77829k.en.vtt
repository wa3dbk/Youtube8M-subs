one comes from a reliable analyst that

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.870 
one comes from a reliable analyst that
has<00:00:12.480> accurately<00:00:12.809> predicted<00:00:13.880> specifications

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
has accurately predicted specifications

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.210 
has accurately predicted specifications
in<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.059> past<00:00:15.360> he<00:00:15.870> claims<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.800> next

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
in the past he claims that the next

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160 
in the past he claims that the next
generation<00:00:17.730> iPhone<00:00:17.940> will<00:00:18.449> be<00:00:18.570> just<00:00:18.990> as

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
generation iPhone will be just as

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.620 
generation iPhone will be just as
revolutionary<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.279> not<00:00:20.640> more<00:00:20.910> revolutionary

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
revolutionary if not more revolutionary

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.210 
revolutionary if not more revolutionary
than<00:00:21.810> its<00:00:22.350> predecessors<00:00:23.279> by<00:00:23.939> combining<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:25.220> 4.7

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
than its predecessors by combining a 4.7

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.880 
than its predecessors by combining a 4.7
inch<00:00:26.460> screen<00:00:27.029> with<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> overall<00:00:28.349> thinner

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
inch screen with a overall thinner

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.999 
inch screen with a overall thinner
profile<00:00:29.580> than<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.939> iPhone<00:00:30.539> 4<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.800> is

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
profile than the iPhone 4 so if this is

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.979 
profile than the iPhone 4 so if this is
correct<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.550> means<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.540> will<00:00:33.690> only

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
correct that means that it will only

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.340 
correct that means that it will only
increase<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.800> overall<00:00:35.010> size<00:00:35.610> slightly<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.140> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
increase the overall size slightly so it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.590 
increase the overall size slightly so it
won't<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.770> much<00:00:38.070> bigger<00:00:38.399> than<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> iPhone<00:00:39.270> 4

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
won't be much bigger than the iPhone 4

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.260 
won't be much bigger than the iPhone 4
right<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:41.309> addition<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
right now and in addition to that it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.410 
right now and in addition to that it
will<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.629> thinner<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.460> 4.7<00:00:44.460> inch<00:00:44.789> display

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
will be thinner with a 4.7 inch display

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.290 
will be thinner with a 4.7 inch display
and<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.200> iPhone<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> 3.5<00:00:47.820> inch

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and right now the iPhone has a 3.5 inch

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500 
and right now the iPhone has a 3.5 inch
display<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.620> whole<00:00:50.090> 1.2<00:00:51.090> inches

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
display so that's a whole 1.2 inches

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.810 
display so that's a whole 1.2 inches
bigger<00:00:51.780> than<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.379> current<00:00:52.980> iPhone<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.640> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
bigger than the current iPhone if this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430 
bigger than the current iPhone if this
picture<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.180> accurate<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> looks<00:00:55.350> like

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
picture is accurate then it looks like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920 
picture is accurate then it looks like
the<00:00:55.739> next<00:00:55.980> iPhone<00:00:56.309> will<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> edge<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.780> edge

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the next iPhone will be a edge to edge

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.080 
the next iPhone will be a edge to edge
display<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.859> again<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.430> only<00:00:59.609> slightly

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
display and again it's only slightly

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.869 
display and again it's only slightly
bigger<00:01:00.570> than<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.289> current<00:01:01.559> iPhone<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.730> with

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
bigger than the current iPhone now with

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.340 
bigger than the current iPhone now with
all<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> rumors<00:01:03.510> floating<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:03.989> about

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
all the rumors floating around about

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.109 
all the rumors floating around about
different<00:01:04.830> iPhones<00:01:05.250> being<00:01:05.519> made<00:01:05.700> different

different iPhones being made different

iPhone models different iPhone types it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
iPhone models different iPhone types it
is<00:01:08.340> definitely<00:01:08.880> possible<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> them

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
is definitely possible that one of them

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.250 
is definitely possible that one of them
could<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.119> 4.7<00:01:12.119> inch<00:01:12.270> display<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:13.110> at

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
could have a 4.7 inch display or at

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
could have a 4.7 inch display or at
least<00:01:13.500> something<00:01:13.950> that's<00:01:14.130> relatively<00:01:14.760> close

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
least something that's relatively close

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
least something that's relatively close
Apple<00:01:15.720> has<00:01:15.840> also<00:01:16.020> teamed<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.619> China's

just<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> while<00:01:31.650> back<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.040> talked<00:01:32.220> about<00:01:32.310> how

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
just a while back I talked about how

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.179 
just a while back I talked about how
Apple<00:01:32.790> wouldn't<00:01:33.210> actually<00:01:33.479> make<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.259> LTE

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
Apple wouldn't actually make a LTE

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.280 
Apple wouldn't actually make a LTE
iPhone<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.270> yet<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> first

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
iPhone just yet because the first

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
iPhone just yet because the first
generation<00:01:37.890> LTE<00:01:38.280> parts<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.909> too<00:01:39.119> big<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
generation LTE parts are too big and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.539 
generation LTE parts are too big and
they<00:01:40.079> didn't<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> compromise

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
they didn't actually want to compromise

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.520 
they didn't actually want to compromise
the<00:01:41.759> size<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> that's<00:01:42.570> coming<00:01:42.810> straight<00:01:43.140> from

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the size and that's coming straight from

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
the size and that's coming straight from
one<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> executives<00:01:44.549> at<00:01:44.700> Apple<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.450> that

one of the executives at Apple with that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.469 
one of the executives at Apple with that
said<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.110> could<00:01:46.320> actually<00:01:46.649> incorporate

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
said they could actually incorporate

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.179 
said they could actually incorporate
HSPA+<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> next<00:01:49.560> generation<00:01:49.619> iPhone

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.530 
that 4.7 inch display iPhone rumor is
correct<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> iPhone<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:57.000> actually

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
correct then the iPhone would actually

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.359 
correct then the iPhone would actually
be<00:01:57.659> bigger<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.500> could<00:01:58.710> possibly<00:01:59.130> support

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
be bigger and it could possibly support

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.060 
be bigger and it could possibly support
first<00:01:59.880> generation<00:02:00.600> LTE<00:02:01.049> components<00:02:01.890> and

first generation LTE components and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.280 
first generation LTE components and
apparently<00:02:02.520> Apple<00:02:02.909> has<00:02:03.090> already<00:02:03.450> ordered<00:02:04.049> 10

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
apparently Apple has already ordered 10

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.800 
apparently Apple has already ordered 10
million<00:02:04.619> iPhone<00:02:05.100> 5<00:02:05.430> units<00:02:05.909> from<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.240> Taiwanese

million iPhone 5 units from a Taiwanese
company<00:02:07.350> called<00:02:07.619> Pegatron<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:09.090> are

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
company called Pegatron and they are

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.830 
company called Pegatron and they are
actually<00:02:09.660> switching<00:02:10.440> over<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:11.190> multiple

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
actually switching over to multiple

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.960 
actually switching over to multiple
actors<00:02:13.110> not<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.920> few<00:02:14.160> manufacturers

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
actors not just a few manufacturers

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.790 
actors not just a few manufacturers
they're<00:02:15.450> broadening<00:02:16.050> their<00:02:16.200> reach<00:02:16.470> and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
they're broadening their reach and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.110 
they're broadening their reach and
they're<00:02:16.980> probably<00:02:17.160> doing<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.849> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
they're probably doing this to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.970 
they're probably doing this to
distribute<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.870> load<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.590> demand

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
distribute the load and the demand

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.309 
distribute the load and the demand
evenly<00:02:20.610> across<00:02:21.000> different<00:02:21.510> manufacturers

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
evenly across different manufacturers

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.619 
evenly across different manufacturers
now<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.709> also<00:02:22.890> said<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.640> Pegatron<00:02:24.150> will

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
now it's also said that Pegatron will

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.770 
now it's also said that Pegatron will
slowly<00:02:25.019> replace<00:02:25.650> Foxconn<00:02:26.550> as<00:02:26.730> Apple's<00:02:27.390> number

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
slowly replace Foxconn as Apple's number

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.720 
slowly replace Foxconn as Apple's number
one<00:02:27.989> manufacturer<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:29.040> we'll<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.519> have<00:02:29.700> to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
one manufacturer but we'll just have to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.229 
one manufacturer but we'll just have to
see

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
see

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.630 
see
apparently<00:02:30.780> fifth-generation<00:02:31.440> iPhone<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
apparently fifth-generation iPhone and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.210 
apparently fifth-generation iPhone and
third-generation<00:02:33.019> iPad<00:02:34.019> parts<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.890> been

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
third-generation iPad parts have been

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.160 
third-generation iPad parts have been
leaked<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.879> ipad<00:02:36.360> parts<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:36.810> actually

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
leaked and the ipad parts are actually

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.559 
leaked and the ipad parts are actually
made<00:02:37.319> from<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> same<00:02:37.890> materials<00:02:38.459> as<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.940> ipad

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
made from the same materials as the ipad

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.330 
made from the same materials as the ipad
2<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.379> this<00:02:40.530> leads<00:02:40.709> people<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.040> believe<00:02:41.129> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
2 so this leads people to believe that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.580 
2 so this leads people to believe that
these<00:02:41.549> artificial<00:02:42.360> Apple<00:02:42.750> parts<00:02:43.080> however<00:02:43.349> the

these artificial Apple parts however the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.660 
these artificial Apple parts however the
buttons<00:02:43.860> are<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.129> completely<00:02:44.549> different

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
buttons are in completely different

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.640 
buttons are in completely different
spots<00:02:45.269> which<00:02:45.750> either<00:02:45.959> means<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.470> these<00:02:46.590> are

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
spots which either means that these are

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.470 
spots which either means that these are
fake<00:02:47.069> or<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.519> Apple<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:47.910> actually<00:02:48.209> going<00:02:48.360> to

the two-times mode on the iPad however
it<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.900> quite<00:03:40.470> annoying<00:03:40.799> especially<00:03:41.130> because

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
it is quite annoying especially because
