00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:03.909
 hello to all this tax had many others where they were impacted 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:06.050
 keep material 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.089
 murray marched with us today 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:09.819
 what do you mean 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.819
 good go it's gone on the big place 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.499
 and you present us today a multicasquette artist the area on the 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.939
 head today so that was scooping the composer performer in 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.969
 the part thanks to the signals today didier for us specially on the 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:29.579
 main square 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:30.740
 he shows us a little 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.880
 how quickly it mixes on understanding and pieces 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.130
 on vinyls in the association so without seeing it in a few minutes we 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.930
 knew that 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.120
 we think especially of supporters of the activist region of 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.020
 from the middle hip-hop that's hip-hop movement how will you define either the 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.270
 more than that is what do you like 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.870
 a month I define myself as a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.030
 a person of the Pope simply that is to say I have I passed by 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.330
 there by the four pillars of the hip-hop that is to say the dance graffiti 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.160
 the 18 p 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.100
 for now it does not scare me 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.949
 muller at mulhouse in the bullring of the bank 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.760
 last deadline is and it's not salty 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.620
 then their qualifiers in the months following the conquest 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.180
 it's a game that could just have wanted to 205 in front of nothing but apple 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.790
 I know that the smallest possible me is the reward happens is the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.800
 consumer does not want to count the chance of being able to you 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.009
 hit what's best for the dancer composing your own pieces 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.889
 so we will see a small and that's where we will see quickly so surprising 

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:28.210
 is that his sentence often so that it sounds video that was done and that is 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:31.209
 now species currently alsace 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.950
 in the meantime 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950
 6 gold 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.100
 3 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.390
 his price 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.890
 jordi bar 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 you will be able to say 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.900
 all this propaganda for the launch so we have to find other albums and 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.479
 a death for one of the first cities that follow a number that is always 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.320
 not completed call for an equivalent effective competition 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.380
 and yet for so many temporary factors 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.349
 to take it out when you sell a dream 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.729
 simply conquer 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.860
 the pointed shoes which implies a little bit exceptional if you turned 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.189
 for the society 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.879
 in a team that was originally it was for my body weight 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.769
 so for those who know europa corp is the art society 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.749
 great French amateur who made big blue so that the balance of work oit the 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.010
 rue brisson and so you also have a video we will move in this spirit 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.010
 and we first talked a little bit 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.689
 here 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.389
 strong 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.359
 fabre 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.199
 by who 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.199
 it's a video 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.129
 a de facto dependency m different neighborhoods in his hold where he had been 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.540
 rather than the siame his work of this project of transfer of concrete actions 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.719
 it was signed by europacorp 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.149
 the producer luc besson they chose the very influential in the region 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:10.109
 big brandon man and the islands we realized the clip conquest but that 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.430
 this team can go that actually it was the prey these patient children 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.420
 that's where the rub is so you also have your blog either it is 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.659
 sick his it's his son and his identity in that sense there are 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.470
 sensitive to that but we call it 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.280
 it's funny challenge why not this attack by power because we are 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.390
 able to do that we have no news of them 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.540
 that's why we welcome you heard exactly 100 years ago for 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.360
 move the plateau of difference in value between 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.979
 live session payments 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.129
 you do not have to move from the main square then 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.769
 but if before you lie 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.579
 a computer 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.579
 it's good so it's because all summer 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.479
 all have received your defeat and districts so there I tell myself turntables 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.670
 vinyls and k7 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.480
 not quite 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.140
 in fact it's the turntable vinyl pure and simple but in fact 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.379
 we just need 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.459
 a vinyl record that helped a lot 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.199
 cp3 stage c it cost numerically the info of the transfer window 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.590
 winter because the disc 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.660
 in this case a first time that is here and there 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.859
 and actually his sister live audience 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.859
 Monday he does not know what he saw much more than expected 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.569
 agree not easy it's the challenge that represented no 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.569
 to see with sport in the clashes that are indispensable 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.749
 you have to know 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.649
 in front of saint-raphaÃ«l and their father because when you play well you 

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:30.819
 do not finish your mouth long live the Beijing cinema festival fight 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:31.759
 for his computer 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.589
 strong of this observation we must always guess what will be the moment towards 

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:36.259
 la France 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.999
 okay I'll hand 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.729
 founder of his airport all that it gives 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.460
 I love France 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.379
 bordeaux 10 choose your reaction 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.699
 during the whole party, however, the people from Strasbourg showed themselves 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.439
 dangerous face to face saturday 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.439
 this date 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.539
 the story 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.440
 Why 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.199
 Algerian football is the strength 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.849
 criticism 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.719
 on France 5 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.199
 Pierre 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.370
 students 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.569
 to hide is hard to hold for investors 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.009
 behind the different major players in this project 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.089
 after 107,555 euros 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:29.400
 click here for more than 10 Swiss francs deemed attractive 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.630
 over twenty years ago 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.509
 disappeared during the show recovery remains fragile 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.689
 what a pleasure to see new faces to draw a new day 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.000
 as for me it is to make live such an agreement 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.150
 g very quickly 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.490
 for fun theme fusion project the car sports jeannette schwamberger 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.720
 finally given up 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.800
 and yet guaranteed 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.839
 then appointments can be announced at the end of the appointment 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.800
