we worked on leaves which can be a
problem<00:00:09.280> for<00:00:09.700> many<00:00:09.910> brush<00:00:10.270> painters<00:00:10.809> the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
problem for many brush painters the

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.350 
problem for many brush painters the
second<00:00:11.889> difficulty<00:00:12.580> that<00:00:12.760> we<00:00:12.879> often

encounter<00:00:13.719> is<00:00:14.080> painting<00:00:14.619> the<00:00:14.650> branch<00:00:15.129> we<00:00:16.000> have

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
encounter is painting the branch we have

quite<00:00:18.460> sure<00:00:18.520> how<00:00:18.880> to<00:00:19.179> do<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.689> branch<00:00:20.220> let's

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
quite sure how to do the branch let's

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.329 
quite sure how to do the branch let's
discuss<00:00:21.730> a<00:00:21.939> few<00:00:21.970> examples<00:00:22.929> of<00:00:23.259> using<00:00:23.560> a<00:00:23.949> branch

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
discuss a few examples of using a branch

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.939 
discuss a few examples of using a branch
in<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:24.939> painting<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:25.539> the<00:00:26.019> first<00:00:26.320> one<00:00:26.650> would

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
in the painting and the first one would

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.880 
in the painting and the first one would
be<00:00:27.009> wisteria<00:00:27.999> now<00:00:28.720> I<00:00:28.749> always<00:00:29.320> use<00:00:29.679> the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890

various<00:00:42.489> shades<00:00:42.760> of<00:00:43.090> brown<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.460> we<00:00:45.940> would<00:00:46.149> have

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
various shades of brown so we would have

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.290 
various shades of brown so we would have
our<00:00:46.739> wisteria<00:00:47.739> flowers<00:00:50.399> say<00:00:51.399> hither<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:52.059> yon

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
our wisteria flowers say hither and yon

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.919 
our wisteria flowers say hither and yon
and<00:00:52.600> then<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:54.160> challenge<00:00:55.059> is<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.690> get<00:00:55.899> a

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
and then the challenge is to get a

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.040 
and then the challenge is to get a
branch<00:00:56.469> that<00:00:56.710> weaves<00:00:57.250> in<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:57.820> out<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.239> our

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
branch that weaves in and out of our

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.650 
branch that weaves in and out of our
floral<00:00:59.710> composition<00:01:00.460> because<00:01:01.000> when<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.449> do

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
floral composition because when you do

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.979 
floral composition because when you do
wisteria<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.949> always<00:01:03.399> do<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.850> flowers<00:01:04.300> first

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
wisteria you always do the flowers first

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.190 
wisteria you always do the flowers first
it<00:01:05.140> works<00:01:05.470> out<00:01:05.710> best<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.250> way<00:01:06.460> okay<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:07.750> the

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
it works out best that way okay so the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.550 
it works out best that way okay so the
brush<00:01:08.470> would<00:01:08.800> be<00:01:08.980> held<00:01:09.540> pointed<00:01:10.540> upward<00:01:11.020> you

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
brush would be held pointed upward you

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.500 
brush would be held pointed upward you
would<00:01:11.740> land<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.460> brush<00:01:12.730> and<00:01:13.060> then

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
would land the brush and then

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.940 
would land the brush and then
immediately<00:01:14.200> turn<00:01:14.680> it<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:16.050> every<00:01:17.050> time<00:01:17.380> you

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
immediately turn it and every time you

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.060 
immediately turn it and every time you
stop<00:01:18.340> you're<00:01:18.970> going<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.570> create<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.680> joint

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
stop you're going to create a joint

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.250 
stop you're going to create a joint
stroke<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:21.820> then<00:01:22.060> you're<00:01:22.270> coming<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.930> the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
stroke and then you're coming to the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.000 
stroke and then you're coming to the
flower<00:01:23.560> area<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.400> pull<00:01:25.030> back<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.380> that's<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
flower area and pull back so that's the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.490 
flower area and pull back so that's the
first<00:01:27.280> section<00:01:27.910> and<00:01:28.120> then<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.930> next<00:01:29.290> section

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
first section and then the next section

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.580 
first section and then the next section
would<00:01:29.890> be<00:01:30.040> here<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.670> I<00:01:31.240> just<00:01:31.330> have<00:01:31.900> decided<00:01:32.380> to

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
would be here and I just have decided to

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.460 
would be here and I just have decided to
go<00:01:32.770> on<00:01:32.890> up<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.340> here<00:01:33.730> and<00:01:33.910> then<00:01:34.840> making<00:01:35.170> the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
go on up to here and then making the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.180 
go on up to here and then making the
strokes<00:01:35.830> smaller<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:37.620> maybe<00:01:38.620> becoming

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
strokes smaller and maybe becoming

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.930 
strokes smaller and maybe becoming
tendrils<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:43.380> okay<00:01:44.410> now<00:01:45.010> you<00:01:45.490> can<00:01:45.700> also

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
tendrils like so okay now you can also

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.010 
tendrils like so okay now you can also
have<00:01:46.890> sections<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.130> come<00:01:48.340> off<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.810> main

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
have sections that come off of the main

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.380 
have sections that come off of the main
branch<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.870> and<00:01:56.580> then<00:01:57.580> we<00:01:58.120> could<00:01:58.360> have

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
branch like so and then we could have

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
branch like so and then we could have
say<00:01:58.930> our<00:01:59.170> leaves<00:01:59.500> would<00:01:59.890> be<00:02:00.070> here<00:02:00.460> or<00:02:01.270> wherever

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
say our leaves would be here or wherever

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.010 
say our leaves would be here or wherever
the<00:02:03.460> leaves<00:02:03.790> are<00:02:04.060> hard<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.480> do<00:02:04.690> with<00:02:04.900> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
the leaves are hard to do with the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.840 
the leaves are hard to do with the
mountain<00:02:05.440> horse<00:02:05.620> brush<00:02:05.950> because<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:06.610> not

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
mountain horse brush because it's not

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.820 
mountain horse brush because it's not
full<00:02:07.150> enough<00:02:07.300> but<00:02:08.020> just<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.410> give<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.619> an

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
full enough but just to give you an

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.459 
full enough but just to give you an
example<00:02:09.390> alright<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:11.109> would<00:02:11.290> be

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.469 
example alright so that would be

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.280 
example alright so that would be
painting<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.189> branch

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
painting a branch

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.009 
painting a branch
for<00:02:13.709> wisteria<00:02:14.340> leafs<00:02:14.670> remember<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.689> press

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
for wisteria leafs remember you press

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.520 
for wisteria leafs remember you press
down<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.549> brush<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.150> then<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
down on the brush and then you do a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.080 
down on the brush and then you do a
movement<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.459> place<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> turning<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.110> then

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
movement in place a turning and then

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.259 
movement in place a turning and then
venture<00:02:24.090> forth<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.780> every<00:02:25.709> time<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.549> ease<00:02:26.939> up

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
venture forth and every time you ease up

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.240 
venture forth and every time you ease up
on<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:29.400> tip<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:31.019> branch<00:02:31.319> will<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.799> smaller

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
on the tip the branch will get smaller

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.530 
on the tip the branch will get smaller
as<00:02:32.579> it<00:02:32.610> should<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.450> smaller<00:02:35.239> okay<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.510> you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
as it should and smaller okay can you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.649 
as it should and smaller okay can you
see<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.049> no<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:38.730> good<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.269> have<00:02:39.450> this

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
see that no it's good to have this

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.229 
see that no it's good to have this
flying<00:02:40.170> white<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:41.190> don't<00:02:41.459> want<00:02:41.700> your<00:02:41.909> branch

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
flying white you don't want your branch

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.759 
flying white you don't want your branch
to<00:02:43.109> be<00:02:43.290> totally<00:02:43.980> solid<00:02:44.480> for<00:02:45.480> example<00:02:46.140> if<00:02:46.470> it

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
to be totally solid for example if it

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.849 
to be totally solid for example if it
looks<00:02:49.579> like<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:52.200> not<00:02:52.470> quite<00:02:52.739> as

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
looks like that it's not quite as

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.119 
looks like that it's not quite as
pleasing<00:02:56.599> as<00:02:57.599> a<00:02:57.930> rougher<00:02:58.440> looking<00:02:58.859> branch

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
pleasing as a rougher looking branch

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.190 
pleasing as a rougher looking branch
would<00:02:59.459> be<00:02:59.670> all<00:03:00.209> right<00:03:00.269> now<00:03:00.720> if<00:03:01.019> you're

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
would be all right now if you're

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.860 
would be all right now if you're
painting<00:03:01.650> something<00:03:01.680> such<00:03:02.459> as<00:03:02.489> plum<00:03:03.060> or

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
painting something such as plum or

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.059 
painting something such as plum or
cherry<00:03:04.319> blossoms

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
cherry blossoms

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.800 
cherry blossoms
I<00:03:06.500> suggest<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.680> only<00:03:07.889> go<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.519> far<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.209> then

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
I suggest you only go so far and then

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.490 
I suggest you only go so far and then
you<00:03:10.019> start<00:03:10.409> painting<00:03:11.280> your<00:03:12.230> blossoms<00:03:13.230> and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
you start painting your blossoms and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.780 
you start painting your blossoms and
then<00:03:14.159> you<00:03:14.400> continue<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.459> maybe<00:03:17.459> do

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
then you continue on like so maybe do

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.449 
then you continue on like so maybe do
some<00:03:18.060> more<00:03:18.239> blossoms<00:03:18.840> here<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.440> then<00:03:20.129> the

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
some more blossoms here and then the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.319 
some more blossoms here and then the
branch<00:03:20.730> could<00:03:21.090> narrow<00:03:21.359> off<00:03:21.660> like<00:03:22.019> that
