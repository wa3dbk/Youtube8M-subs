to<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:10.889> talking<00:00:11.099> about<00:00:11.370> two<00:00:11.670> possible<00:00:12.179> new

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
to be talking about two possible new

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.660 
to be talking about two possible new
perks<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:13.170> could<00:00:13.410> be<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.950> zombies<00:00:14.429> map

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
perks that could be in this zombies map

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.490 
perks that could be in this zombies map
now<00:00:14.940> I've<00:00:15.240> already<00:00:15.420> covered<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.960> first<00:00:16.260> one

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
now I've already covered the first one

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.859 
now I've already covered the first one
which<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.859> reckon<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.210> new<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.600> called

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
which I reckon is this new one called

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.740 
which I reckon is this new one called
may<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.590> damaged<00:00:20.100> aid<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.580> something<00:00:21.180> vulture

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
may be damaged aid or something vulture

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.570 
may be damaged aid or something vulture
aid<00:00:21.900> something<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> I'll<00:00:23.400> cover

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
aid something like that and I'll cover

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.920 
aid something like that and I'll cover
that<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.789> my<00:00:23.970> previous<00:00:24.269> video<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.750> I'm<00:00:24.810> just

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that in my previous video but I'm just

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.029 
that in my previous video but I'm just
gonna<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.109> talking<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.529> little<00:00:25.800> bit<00:00:25.890> more

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
gonna be talking about a little bit more

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.220 
gonna be talking about a little bit more
in<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.369> video<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.760> well<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.720> also<00:00:27.900> have

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
in this video as well but we also have

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.250 
in this video as well but we also have
some<00:00:28.650> speculations<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.429> PhD<00:00:30.390> flopper<00:00:30.570> could

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
some speculations that PhD flopper could

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
some speculations that PhD flopper could
actually<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.250> map<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:32.669> well<00:00:32.700> now<00:00:33.090> i

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
actually be in this map as well now i

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.790 
actually be in this map as well now i
think<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.719> basically<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> feels

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
think it's basically because it feels

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.530 
think it's basically because it feels
long<00:00:35.190> overdue<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.000> haven't<00:00:36.180> had<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
long overdue that we haven't had it in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.410 
long overdue that we haven't had it in
any<00:00:36.840> black<00:00:37.380> ops<00:00:37.620> 2<00:00:37.800> maps<00:00:37.980> apart<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
any black ops 2 maps apart from the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.450 
any black ops 2 maps apart from the
grief<00:00:39.989> mode<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.500> mob<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.860> dead<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.250> course

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
grief mode in mob of the dead of course

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.130 
grief mode in mob of the dead of course
but<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.059> doesn't<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.510> count<00:00:42.629> cause<00:00:42.899> not

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
but that doesn't really count cause not

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.080 
but that doesn't really count cause not
many<00:00:43.200> people<00:00:43.559> play<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.010> guess<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
many people play that I guess but it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.060 
many people play that I guess but it
does<00:00:45.270> feel<00:00:45.300> overdue<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.110> hopefully<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
does feel overdue so hopefully that is

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.560 
does feel overdue so hopefully that is
going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.940> map<00:00:48.149> we're<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.480> go

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
going to be in this map we're here we go

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.970 
going to be in this map we're here we go
let's<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.960> into<00:00:49.079> some<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> information

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
let's get into some of the information

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.220 
let's get into some of the information
some<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> images<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.539> makes<00:00:51.989> me<00:00:52.110> believe

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
some of the images that makes me believe

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
some of the images that makes me believe
that<00:00:52.410> PhD<00:00:52.980> flopper<00:00:53.129> could<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.699> coming<00:00:54.000> into

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that PhD flopper could be coming into

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
that PhD flopper could be coming into
this<00:00:54.420> map<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.989> let<00:00:55.199> me<00:00:55.289> first<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.590> say<00:00:55.829> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
this map so let me first just say I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.380 
this map so let me first just say I
didn't<00:00:56.370> spot<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:57.300> have

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
didn't spot this and I would have

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
didn't spot this and I would have
skipped<00:00:57.600> over<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> trailer<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.859> guy

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
skipped over it in the trailer this guy

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.590 
skipped over it in the trailer this guy
hadn't<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.460> commented<00:00:59.820> on<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> video<00:01:00.180> saying

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
hadn't have commented on a video saying

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.389 
hadn't have commented on a video saying
you<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.140> look<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.530> time<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> looks

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you know look at this time and it looks

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.369 
you know look at this time and it looks
like<00:01:02.460> PhD<00:01:02.910> flop<00:01:03.149> could<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.080> still

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
like PhD flop could be there it is still

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.840 
like PhD flop could be there it is still
very<00:01:04.500> vague<00:01:04.769> even<00:01:05.040> though<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.189> still<00:01:05.549> look<00:01:05.729> at

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
very vague even though you still look at

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
very vague even though you still look at
it<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.060> HD<00:01:06.299> put<00:01:06.750> put<00:01:07.110> full<00:01:07.320> screen<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.770> HD<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it in HD put put full screen on HD and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
it in HD put put full screen on HD and
it's<00:01:08.939> still<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.570> vague<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.320> just

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it's still very very vague and we just

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
it's still very very vague and we just
guessing<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> looks<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.150> look

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
guessing really but it looks if you look

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.330 
guessing really but it looks if you look
in<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> smashed<00:01:13.020> window<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.770> place<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
in that smashed window kind of place it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
in that smashed window kind of place it
looks<00:01:14.580> kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.540> silhouette<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
looks kind of like the silhouette of a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.929 
looks kind of like the silhouette of a
perk<00:01:16.770> machine<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> circle<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.850> top

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
perk machine with a circle at the top

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
perk machine with a circle at the top
and<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> only<00:01:18.630> perk<00:01:18.930> machine<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and the only perk machine I know of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.609 
and the only perk machine I know of
unless<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> newport<00:01:21.180> machine<00:01:21.479> has<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
unless it's a newport machine has this

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
unless it's a newport machine has this
circle<00:01:23.130> shape<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.759> top<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.270> PhD<00:01:24.840> flopper

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
see the image on screen that i've put

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.580 
see the image on screen that i've put
their<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.840> looks<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
their of what it looks like and if you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.109 
their of what it looks like and if you
kind<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.829> move<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.159> two<00:01:32.340> images<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:33.030> each

but<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> talk<00:02:06.270> about<00:02:06.509> this

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
but now I'm going to talk about this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.930 
but now I'm going to talk about this
other<00:02:06.960> perk<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.560> reckon<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> new<00:02:08.640> for

other perk that I reckon is a new for

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609 
other perk that I reckon is a new for

black ops 2 zombies never never ever
seen<00:02:10.950> before<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> one

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
seen before really and it's the one

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.990 
seen before really and it's the one
spoke<00:02:13.650> about<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> my<00:02:14.100> previous<00:02:14.370> video<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.790> can

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
spoke about in my previous video you can

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.880 
spoke about in my previous video you can
see<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> certain<00:02:15.900> point<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> trailer<00:02:16.620> there

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
see a certain point in the trailer there

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.680 
see a certain point in the trailer there
and<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.610> looks<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.210> Newport

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
and what looks to be like a Newport

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.570 
and what looks to be like a Newport
machine<00:02:19.020> now<00:02:19.230> I've<00:02:19.680> had<00:02:19.890> some<00:02:20.100> updated

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
machine now I've had some updated

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.280 
machine now I've had some updated
thoughts<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.390> before<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.810> thought<00:02:22.140> it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
thoughts on it but before I thought it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.350 
thoughts on it but before I thought it
was<00:02:22.350> called<00:02:22.680> damaged<00:02:23.640> age<00:02:23.790> if<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.030> look<00:02:24.180> at<00:02:24.300> it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
was called damaged age if you look at it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.910 
was called damaged age if you look at it
really<00:02:24.630> closely<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.200> something<00:02:25.680> aid

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
really closely that's like something aid

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.670 
really closely that's like something aid
and<00:02:26.300> someone<00:02:27.300> went<00:02:27.450> into<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.810> pc<00:02:28.200> files<00:02:28.470> of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and someone went into the pc files of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
and someone went into the pc files of
the<00:02:28.740> game<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.100> saw<00:02:29.370> two<00:02:29.610> new<00:02:30.060> perks<00:02:30.330> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
the game and saw two new perks that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
the game and saw two new perks that
hadn't<00:02:30.990> been<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.380> released<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> zombies

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
hadn't been like released on a zombies

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.160 
hadn't been like released on a zombies
map<00:02:32.520> yet<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.540> them<00:02:33.630> called<00:02:33.660> damaged

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
map yet one of them called damaged

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.780 
map yet one of them called damaged
eights<00:02:34.320> are<00:02:34.440> kind<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.830> presumed<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.400> might<00:02:35.610> be

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
eights are kind of presumed it might be

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.340 
eights are kind of presumed it might be
called<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:36.600> if<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.750> do<00:02:36.930> look<00:02:37.110> at<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
called that but if you do look at the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.980 
called that but if you do look at the
first<00:02:37.710> letters<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.730> word<00:02:38.910> real<00:02:39.240> close<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
first letters of the word real close it

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.200 
first letters of the word real close it
looks<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.560> says<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:41.040> water<00:02:41.430> or<00:02:41.880> be

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
looks like it says like water or be

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.270 
looks like it says like water or be
something<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> lot<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:43.890> people<00:02:44.040> do

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
something and so a lot of people do

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.860 
something and so a lot of people do
think<00:02:44.550> now<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.910> called<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.300> vulture<00:02:45.780> aid

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
think now it's called like vulture aid

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.810 
think now it's called like vulture aid
or<00:02:46.020> something<00:02:46.260> maybe<00:02:46.520> similar<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.670> the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
or something maybe similar to the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.270 
or something maybe similar to the
scavenger<00:02:48.390> perk<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.900> multiplayer<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.040> that

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
scavenger perk in multiplayer so that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.190 
scavenger perk in multiplayer so that
it's<00:02:50.760> definitely<00:02:50.940> got<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.330> use<00:02:51.600> for<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
it's definitely got a use for it and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.990 
it's definitely got a use for it and
then<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.770> makes<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.010> lot<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.190> sense<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:53.790> whether

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
then it makes a lot of sense but whether

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.130 
then it makes a lot of sense but whether
it<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.480> or<00:02:54.570> not<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> guess<00:02:54.960> we're<00:02:55.110> just

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it is that or not I guess we're just

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.510 
it is that or not I guess we're just
gonna<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.620> wait<00:02:55.650> until<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.280> see<00:02:56.490> some

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
gonna have to wait until we see some

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.970 
gonna have to wait until we see some
other<00:02:56.880> gameplay<00:02:57.540> images<00:02:58.260> or<00:02:58.470> gameplay<00:02:58.920> itself

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
other gameplay images or gameplay itself

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.130 
other gameplay images or gameplay itself
so<00:02:59.730> they're<00:02:59.880> my<00:03:00.060> thoughts<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.600> couple<00:03:00.960> of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
so they're my thoughts on a couple of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.470 
so they're my thoughts on a couple of
new<00:03:01.350> possible<00:03:01.770> perks<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.550> map<00:03:02.820> leave<00:03:03.330> any
