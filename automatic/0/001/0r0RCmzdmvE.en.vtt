00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the system I know I might drill it out a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
the system I know I might drill it out a
little<00:00:50.670> bit<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.510> more<00:00:51.860> ease

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of putting them in and out but they go

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319

in<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.530> half<00:00:55.980> way<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.059> let

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
in about half way and then I have to let

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.709 
in about half way and then I have to let
it<00:00:57.480> shoot<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:58.050> down<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:59.039> I've<00:00:59.160> done<00:00:59.600> if<00:01:00.600> you

when<00:02:24.300> they<00:02:24.420> pull<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> door<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.769> get<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
when they pull the door you get the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.320 
when they pull the door you get the
string<00:02:27.590> coming<00:02:28.590> actually<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
string coming actually out of the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.490 
string coming actually out of the
grenade<00:02:31.129> now<00:02:32.129> I'm<00:02:32.810> going<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.049> quick<00:02:34.349> one

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
grenade now I'm going to do a quick one

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.180 
grenade now I'm going to do a quick one
the<00:02:35.069> door<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.849> little<00:02:36.299> bit<00:02:36.530> holding<00:02:37.530> there's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the door is a little bit holding there's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.160 
the door is a little bit holding there's
a<00:02:38.250> catch<00:02:38.519> on<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.879> outside<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.540> if<00:02:40.019> you're

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
a catch on the outside so that if you're

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.839 
a catch on the outside so that if you're
pulling<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.650> from<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.920> outside<00:02:41.310> or<00:02:41.489> pushing

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
pulling it from the outside or pushing

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.819 
pulling it from the outside or pushing
it<00:02:41.940> hard<00:02:42.180> directly<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.200> door<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.620> does

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
it hard directly on the door it does

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.789 
it hard directly on the door it does
open<00:02:44.090> but<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.360> wasn't<00:02:45.900> open<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.260> good<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:46.680> me

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
open but it wasn't open it good with me

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.770 
open but it wasn't open it good with me
just<00:02:47.040> trying<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.280> push<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.549> from<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> side<00:02:48.030> so

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
just trying to push it from the side so

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.150 
just trying to push it from the side so
what<00:02:49.079> I'm<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.860> have<00:02:49.980> this

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
what I'm going to do is I have this

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.039 
what I'm going to do is I have this
really<00:02:50.579> close<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.660> ramp<00:02:51.810> set

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
really close I have the ramp set

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.410 
really close I have the ramp set
cartridge<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:52.920> there<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:54.000> going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.209> set

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
cartridge in there and I'm going to set

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:07.400 
cartridge in there and I'm going to set
it<00:02:54.569> off<00:02:54.690> again<00:03:05.870> now<00:03:06.870> here's<00:03:07.079> another<00:03:07.170> example

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
it off again now here's another example

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.470 
it off again now here's another example
of<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.980> door<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> door<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.090> an<00:03:09.209> upper

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
of a door this is a door on an upper

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.839 
of a door this is a door on an upper
side<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.769> gravity<00:03:11.040> door<00:03:11.430> which<00:03:11.640> means

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
side it's a gravity door which means

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.550 
side it's a gravity door which means
that<00:03:12.180> gravity<00:03:12.390> shuts<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.140> because<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.470> a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
that gravity shuts it because it's a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.800 
that gravity shuts it because it's a
little<00:03:13.739> downhill<00:03:14.010> now<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:15.269> can<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:15.690> I'm

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
little downhill now you can see I'm

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.440 
little downhill now you can see I'm
still<00:03:16.049> using<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.530> same<00:03:16.579> string<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:18.000> hook<00:03:18.180> to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
still using the same string to hook to

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.129 
still using the same string to hook to
the<00:03:19.139> clip<00:03:19.350> pair<00:03:19.819> but<00:03:20.989> what<00:03:21.989> I'm<00:03:22.079> thinking

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
the clip pair but what I'm thinking

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.229 
the clip pair but what I'm thinking
about<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.769> making<00:03:23.100> various<00:03:23.579> lengths<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
about is making various lengths of the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.940 
about is making various lengths of the
string<00:03:24.600> but<00:03:25.109> make<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.470> little<00:03:25.680> heavier

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
string but make that a little heavier

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.599 
string but make that a little heavier
cord<00:03:26.989> this<00:03:27.989> one<00:03:28.319> if<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.799> look<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.250> window

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
cord this one if you look in the window

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.400 
cord this one if you look in the window
over<00:03:30.120> here<00:03:30.150> which<00:03:30.599> you<00:03:30.720> can<00:03:30.870> see<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.109> corner

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
over here which you can see the corner

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.039 
over here which you can see the corner
of<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.920> could<00:03:32.130> see<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.519> if<00:03:33.150> they<00:03:33.810> open

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
of it you could see that if they open

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.920 
of it you could see that if they open
the<00:03:34.139> door<00:03:34.349> slowly<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:36.090> could<00:03:36.299> see<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.599> as<00:03:36.750> well

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the door slowly you could see it as well

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.710 
the door slowly you could see it as well
I<00:03:37.790> don't<00:03:38.790> think<00:03:38.849> they<00:03:39.060> could<00:03:39.239> reach<00:03:39.419> in<00:03:39.599> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
I don't think they could reach in and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.039 
I don't think they could reach in and
disarm<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.290> but<00:03:40.919> if<00:03:41.040> they<00:03:41.160> see<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.870> they<00:03:42.870> could

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
disarm it but if they see it they could

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.360 
disarm it but if they see it they could
not<00:03:43.200> go<00:03:43.380> in<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.560> building<00:03:43.829> or<00:03:43.980> they<00:03:44.099> stand

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
not go in the building or they stand

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.979 
not go in the building or they stand
around<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.639> corner<00:03:44.910> from<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.090> door<00:03:45.389> now<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.750> do

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
around the corner from the door now I do

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.539 
around the corner from the door now I do
have<00:03:46.169> a<00:03:46.230> ramp<00:03:46.440> set<00:03:46.650> cartridge<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.220> there<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
have a ramp set cartridge in there and

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.940 
have a ramp set cartridge in there and
I'm<00:03:48.209> going<00:03:48.419> to<00:03:48.480> show<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:49.560> opening<00:03:49.680> on

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
I'm going to show you the opening on

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.550 
I'm going to show you the opening on
this<00:03:50.099> door<00:03:50.340> now<00:03:50.519> this<00:03:50.669> door<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.319> little

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
this door now this door I have a little

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.400 
this door now this door I have a little
closer<00:03:52.889> so<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.669> might<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.180> making<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.780> different

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
closer so I might be making a different

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.819 
closer so I might be making a different
length<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:56.160> shorter<00:03:56.700> cord<00:03:57.000> for<00:03:57.269> certain<00:03:57.540> doors

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
length a shorter cord for certain doors

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:16.520 
length a shorter cord for certain doors
but<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.160> see<00:03:59.310> how<00:03:59.459> much<00:03:59.669> this<00:04:00.120> opens

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.440 

one<00:04:17.530> thing<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.830> want<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.040> show<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.340> here<00:04:18.880> is<00:04:19.150> the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
one thing I want to show you here is the

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.650 
one thing I want to show you here is the
cord<00:04:19.720> dangling<00:04:20.200> on<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:21.130> door<00:04:21.400> once<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.420> goes

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
cord dangling on the door once it goes

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.690 
cord dangling on the door once it goes
off<00:04:22.840> it's<00:04:23.170> still<00:04:23.470> hanging<00:04:23.680> there<00:04:23.860> you're<00:04:24.550> not

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
off it's still hanging there you're not

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.350 
off it's still hanging there you're not
going<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.940> lose<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:27.370> grenade<00:04:27.550> is

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
going to lose it and the grenade is

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.930 
going to lose it and the grenade is
still<00:04:28.720> left<00:04:29.110> right<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.950> there<00:04:30.130> as<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.760> can<00:04:30.820> see

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
still left right to there as you can see

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.630 
still left right to there as you can see
there<00:04:31.300> is<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.480> window<00:04:31.900> it's<00:04:32.350> actually<00:04:32.920> two<00:04:33.370> feet

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
there is a window it's actually two feet

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.430 
there is a window it's actually two feet
long<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:34.600> could<00:04:34.900> see<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:36.030> for<00:04:37.320> where<00:04:38.320> the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
long you could see in for where the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.850 
long you could see in for where the
grenade<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:39.010> and<00:04:39.420> probably<00:04:40.420> disarm<00:04:41.140> it<00:04:41.290> or

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
grenade is and probably disarm it or

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.650 
grenade is and probably disarm it or
even<00:04:42.220> set<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.670> off<00:04:42.820> from<00:04:43.170> safety<00:04:44.170> of<00:04:44.260> outside

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
even set it off from safety of outside

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.880 
even set it off from safety of outside
now<00:04:46.660> we<00:04:46.720> have<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.930> slightly<00:04:47.170> different<00:04:47.290> door

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
now we have a slightly different door

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.100 
now we have a slightly different door
now<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:48.430> one<00:04:48.970> of<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.180> buildings<00:04:49.600> this

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
now on one of the buildings this

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.540 
now on one of the buildings this
actually<00:04:50.440> has<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> lock<00:04:50.920> on<00:04:51.160> it

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
actually has a lock on it

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.770 
actually has a lock on it
you<00:04:51.970> open<00:04:52.480> by<00:04:52.990> pulling<00:04:53.410> this<00:04:54.400> way<00:04:54.640> in<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.510> door

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
you open by pulling this way in the door

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.640 
you open by pulling this way in the door
little<00:04:56.230> open<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:58.000> shut<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.200> then<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.500> can

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
little open and shut and then you can

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.850 
little open and shut and then you can
lock<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:00.790> if<00:05:01.750> there<00:05:02.020> is<00:05:02.140> quite<00:05:02.350> a<00:05:02.380> bit<00:05:02.530> of<00:05:02.650> gap

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
lock it if there is quite a bit of gap

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.180 
lock it if there is quite a bit of gap
here<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.630> from<00:05:04.630> here<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:05.140> can<00:05:05.560> see<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.830> there

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
here and from here I can see that there

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.330 
here and from here I can see that there
is<00:05:06.600> in<00:05:07.600> there<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.170> trip<00:05:08.710> line<00:05:08.890> is<00:05:09.040> in<00:05:09.160> there

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
is in there the trip line is in there

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.640 
is in there the trip line is in there
but<00:05:09.690> we'll<00:05:10.690> see<00:05:10.840> how<00:05:10.870> it<00:05:10.960> works<00:05:11.200> out<00:05:11.440> okay<00:05:13.650> you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
but we'll see how it works out okay you

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.350 
but we'll see how it works out okay you
can<00:05:14.830> see<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.010> same<00:05:15.310> system<00:05:15.790> set<00:05:15.970> up<00:05:16.090> with<00:05:16.270> the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
can see the same system set up with the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.480 
can see the same system set up with the
same<00:05:16.540> length<00:05:16.780> of<00:05:16.930> string<00:05:17.169> it's<00:05:17.890> a<00:05:18.040> little<00:05:18.280> a

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
same length of string it's a little a

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.830 
same length of string it's a little a
little<00:05:19.360> longer<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:20.620> fits<00:05:20.919> pretty<00:05:21.310> well<00:05:21.550> on<00:05:22.540> the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
little longer it fits pretty well on the

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.320 
little longer it fits pretty well on the
door<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.320> even<00:05:24.040> opening<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.700> door<00:05:24.910> will<00:05:25.150> open

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
door and even opening the door will open

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.780 
door and even opening the door will open
the<00:05:25.990> lock<00:05:26.140> won't<00:05:26.380> set<00:05:26.890> it<00:05:27.010> off<00:05:27.160> you<00:05:27.669> actually

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
the lock won't set it off you actually

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.170 
the lock won't set it off you actually
have<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:29.340> open<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.430> door<00:05:30.640> so<00:05:30.880> we're<00:05:30.970> going<00:05:31.090> to

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
have to open the door so we're going to

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
have to open the door so we're going to
try<00:05:31.300> that<00:05:45.120> as<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.330> can<00:05:46.480> see<00:05:46.630> I'm<00:05:46.780> using<00:05:46.810> the

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
try that as you can see I'm using the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.430 
try that as you can see I'm using the
same<00:05:47.380> pipe<00:05:47.680> setup<00:05:48.630> ran<00:05:49.630> out<00:05:49.780> a<00:05:49.810> half<00:05:50.020> inch<00:05:50.229> pipe

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
same pipe setup ran out a half inch pipe

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.230 
same pipe setup ran out a half inch pipe
so<00:05:50.680> I<00:05:50.740> add<00:05:50.830> some<00:05:50.890> 3/4<00:05:51.460> inch<00:05:51.610> pipe<00:05:51.820> and<00:05:52.000> it<00:05:52.090> work

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
so I add some 3/4 inch pipe and it work

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.540 
so I add some 3/4 inch pipe and it work
well<00:05:52.510> what<00:05:53.470> I've<00:05:53.620> done<00:05:53.830> is<00:05:53.979> I've<00:05:54.160> set<00:05:54.400> them

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
well what I've done is I've set them

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.540 
well what I've done is I've set them
won't<00:05:54.850> work<00:05:55.000> so<00:05:55.660> that<00:05:55.870> this<00:05:56.340> sits<00:05:57.340> right<00:05:57.490> on

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
won't work so that this sits right on

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.610 
won't work so that this sits right on
top<00:05:57.790> of<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:58.000> 2x4<00:05:58.510> frame<00:05:58.810> as<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.200> can<00:05:59.350> see<00:05:59.530> it

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
top of the 2x4 frame as you can see it

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.950 
top of the 2x4 frame as you can see it
just<00:05:59.650> sits<00:06:00.040> right<00:06:00.280> down<00:06:01.210> on<00:06:01.419> there<00:06:01.570> and<00:06:01.810> it's

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
just sits right down on there and it's

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.830 
just sits right down on there and it's
working<00:06:02.350> out<00:06:02.650> fine<00:06:02.919> it's<00:06:03.580> solid<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.450> doesn't

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
working out fine it's solid it doesn't

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.600 
working out fine it's solid it doesn't
move<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.020> because<00:06:05.470> you<00:06:05.560> have<00:06:05.650> the<00:06:05.770> two<00:06:06.010> it

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
move and because you have the two it

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.530 
move and because you have the two it
can't

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
can't

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.420 
can't

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
is you always have to put on the ground

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.560 
is you always have to put on the ground
set<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.450> then<00:06:14.169> put<00:06:14.919> it<00:06:15.010> up<00:06:15.100> here<00:06:15.310> put<00:06:16.180> it<00:06:16.270> inside
