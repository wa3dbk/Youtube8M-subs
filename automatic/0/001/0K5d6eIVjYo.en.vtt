00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.690
 what's up people this afternoon I'm going to 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.519
 eye doctor and I'm going to buy new glasses 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.389
 so I'm not thrilled about the 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.389
 true but good 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:31.960
 hello hello hello all the people 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.610
 and if I take time with the glasses that 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.750

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.760
 video but I'm not sure our here 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.970

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.089
 He saw the shit and they already bought some 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.790
 I like that they take us glasses because they do not 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:58.080
 I like them but the thing is that if I 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.629
 I buy the newest ones that I am going to buy 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.270
 they would be more to carry it always thing 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:08.480

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:12.020
 It is a link for the blackboard 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.860
 until then that too but now 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.600

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:38.980

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.870

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.290
 we come back with the new ranges 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.180
 good people have not yet measured 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.380

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.600
 old saints and I think not old ones 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.570
 that I have now I think I think that already 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:38.590

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:58.720
