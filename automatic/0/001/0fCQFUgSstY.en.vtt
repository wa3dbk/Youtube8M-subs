00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:02.100
 in this chapter 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.270
 we will start the assembly itself 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.409
 and we'll start with installation 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.709
 of the motherboard the buttress 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.529
 let's talk 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.949
 with the opening of the cabinet 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.169
 usually the cabinet 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.239
 He has taken the sides 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.109
 the higher contributions 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.759
 fix to give 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.759
 four screws 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.529
 removing the screws with a wrench 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.430
 you 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 take cover 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 of the cabinet 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.850
 there are cabinets in which the top 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.070
 will remain 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.510
 visually the two sides 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 will be withdrawn 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 the cabinet has one of its sides 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.460
 Omar ChabÃ¡n 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 will be tested 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.990
 the bitterness 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.480
 she is closed 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.550
 the two screws that can also be removed with a wrench 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.610
 you must 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.960
 pull rates 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.770
 thus 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.460
 contrary 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 the point at which it is attached to the cabinet 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.200
 lay it down 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.590
 so that it stays 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.810
 lose take off 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 to the cabinet 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.150
 Green Fashion Fixing Plate has wi-fi partners so we can place 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.480
 The screws 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.870
 in several models of Monaco 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.370
 you must 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.340
 with eight people on board. 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.500
 finally mark the attachment points with a pencil or a pen for example 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 so that you can place 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.690
 the plastics 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.690
 which he-man has the motherboard far from the plate 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.579
 the pins 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.320
 for fixing the screws themselves 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.560
 in these points 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.480
 will not be put to funds 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.320
 only 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 a plastic tube 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.770
 allowed to stay away is a shame 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.499
 and find 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.690
 the plastic products having been placed 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.959
 the marked places 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.249
 the connectors for fastening the screws 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.579
 hostel 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.629
 set in boxing fashion 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.919
 first on plastic pins 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.619
 later to find out 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.859
 where you put the clubs 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.249
 the fixing of the screws 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.079
 as in the northeast of the state 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.349
 but still 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.269
 lying perpendicular to the cabinet 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.549
 we should do 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.549
 the installation of control means 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:50.829
 the control means will be linked in a specific part of the malev today 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.950
 this is only possible 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.699
 with the specification 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:55.830
 that exists 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.589
 in a new fashion from the port 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.660
 to know exactly which pins to see 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.929
 what kind of connectors 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.929
 the connectors order control buttons 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.809
 they will come with your cabinet 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:13.359
 and will be placed in the psf's following the specification 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.919
 a new fashion change 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.710
 so that all buttons work 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.739
 of all genders works properly 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.920
 let's see the specification 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.920
 there was no agreement we are working 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.719
 as there was no agreement it is usually very specific 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.809
 the position of the action now per day where the pins are 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.249
 for placement 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.709
 in control positions 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.750
 enke pins each of these collectors must be fixed and what it means 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.979
 each of these connectors 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:54.069
 the cabinets usually offer 5 types of control connectors 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:56.749
 the broker 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.059
 for control 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:59.769
 access leading 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.699
 to thank 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.529
 the connector for operation of the spigot 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:07.429
 which is the cabinet speaker 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.429
 the connector for the reset button 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.029
 the connector or connectors that can be individual 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.969
 the lead 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.269
 from polanski klein 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.750
 so the average blackout to know if the microcomputer is on or 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.289
 off 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.860
 and with the connector 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.919
 to the power button 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.019
 which is the power on and off button punishing the computer 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.259
 the position 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.680
 clubs is also important. 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.740
 though 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.980
 an inverted plug will not cause problems in the same way. 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.120
 computer 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.120
 just smell the button will stop working 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.430
 this world 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.650
 1 that should be compatible with the connector position 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.059
 this will enable 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.889
 keiko club is placed on the pins in the correct position
