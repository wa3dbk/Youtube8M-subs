00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.019
 it's my case 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.019
 already on the israel side 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:28.699
 there is weak light talking 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.699
 everything motivated this speech do not stand the material pressure 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.230
 so you're putting 50 soon 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.090
 I also think it comes 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.200
 these ideas between students and I think this is worth a lot 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.130
 those who refused to comment 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.580
 next week 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.580
 In addition, this silence of doing 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.060
 twenty five 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.490
 paris Apr 21 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.740
 the best balance 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 so it's about relating 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.750
 so the premiere of the film is crispation recognize the different 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.210
 types 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.490
 lucas who has undergone change 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.560
 but for us still in Spain in the month 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.540
 in the american market 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 has achieved 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
 workshops and were 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 do you watch 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.099
 my answer 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 In general 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
 You have to do your best. 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.239
 in answer 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.399
 series 5 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:57.549
 unfortunately with 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.209
 the residence 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.679
 some parents who think 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.289
 in art preschool i 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.289
 What do we want to stay? 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.979
 I guess so 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.200
 here at school we will decide then if we had parental support 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.299
 in 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.109
 and baltimore 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.139
 the social factor 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.139
 all people who already have 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.379
 in a statement 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.169
 why the brand choice 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.879
 then this is essential 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.499
 I think the biggest difficulty is the lack 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.499
 say everything 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.559
 because many advances 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:24.389
 have school 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.610
 if nothing is done 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.610
 crises that this role 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.479
 the pre-school disorder 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.129
 has been debated 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.559
 So we really need this support. 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:41.439
 because we know that many countries in unicamp 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.439
 if the student learns our first 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.849
 by contract 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.479
 Deise Scallop 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.659
 has a cost eg kills 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.639
 if the squid made no appearances 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.639
 the one that I asked or took care of 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:02.759
 a science says 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.759
 larissa appears after the end of the month on the day of the meeting 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:16.689
 I think when you have here 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.210
 some aggravated 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.339
 then yes to pt 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.339
 I think this one 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.960
 wake up first time 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.029
 to assimilate 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.249
 in sufficient numbers 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:07.249
 an accident or an accident 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.389
 promised worm striving can have a salary 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.520
 if you have a job 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.569
 of everything else you will not be fine if you have 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.659
 at 28 o'clock 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:24.990
 a very bad 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.990
 then the situation 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.490
 in one of them yes 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.979
 so you have to work 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.960
 I did not get scared 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.020
 aware of this 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.020
 I hope to do a good job 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.669
 the industry experts 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.870
 more classes or more schools more work 

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:50.259
 produced 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:51.990
 all the consequences 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.220
 small flaws in the systems that 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.240
 education 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.240
 I forgot right from the start 

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.770
 he is supporting 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.470
 It's also great because it's no use trying to Dutch 

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.369
 did not struggle 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:18.879
 with the teaching board 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.279
 however he may 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.680
 so I think I need 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.680
 in this brazilian 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:31.289
 I got scared
