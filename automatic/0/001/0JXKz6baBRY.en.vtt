00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
translates to about 132 PPI or pixels

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.219 
translates to about 132 PPI or pixels
per<00:01:13.080> inch<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:14.460> side<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.180> an<00:01:15.330> iPad<00:01:15.780> 3

with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 which

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.840 
with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 which
it<00:01:25.560> translates<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.220> about<00:01:27.979> 264<00:01:28.979> pixels<00:01:29.280> per

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it translates to about 264 pixels per

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.289 
it translates to about 264 pixels per
inch<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.310> iPad<00:01:32.670> 3<00:01:32.970> has

and also the PPI has been doubled

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.660 
and also the PPI has been doubled
okay<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.500> taking<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> look<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> icons

me<00:02:38.790> there's<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.630> lot<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.290> pixelation<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> an

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
me there's a lot of pixelation on the an

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.390 
me there's a lot of pixelation on the an
event<00:02:41.580> too<00:02:42.319> okay<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:43.380> taking<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.100> look<00:02:44.160> at<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
event too okay so taking a look at a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.699 
event too okay so taking a look at a
folders<00:02:44.850> you're<00:02:45.299> now<00:02:45.450> looking<00:02:45.690> at<00:02:46.019> an<00:02:46.170> iPad<00:02:46.500> 2

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
folders you're now looking at an iPad 2

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.370 
folders you're now looking at an iPad 2
and<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:48.360> know<00:02:48.599> if<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.870> see<00:02:49.080> from<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
video but the icons inside the folder

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.130 
video but the icons inside the folder
are<00:02:51.959> really<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:53.040> hard<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.489> distinguish

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
are really really hard to distinguish

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
when you take a look at a gap at 3

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.030 
when you take a look at a gap at 3
screen<00:03:35.100> there's<00:03:35.459> no<00:03:35.700> pixelation<00:03:36.359> at<00:03:36.480> all<00:03:37.040> ok

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
take a look at a small text this is the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.030 
take a look at a small text this is the
iPad<00:03:54.450> 2<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.840> can<00:03:55.019> see<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.590> really

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
iPad 2 you can see that it's really

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.599 
iPad 2 you can see that it's really
really<00:03:56.280> pixelated<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:58.069> really<00:03:59.069> hard<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.430> read

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
really pixelated and really hard to read

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.270 
really pixelated and really hard to read
with<00:03:59.639> on<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> iPad<00:04:00.359> 3<00:04:00.690> there's<00:04:01.380> no<00:04:01.590> pixelation

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
with on the iPad 3 there's no pixelation

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.670 
with on the iPad 3 there's no pixelation
and<00:04:02.400> all<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.790> can<00:04:02.940> clearly<00:04:03.569> see<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.290> text

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
and all you can clearly see the text

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.520 
and all you can clearly see the text
read<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.209> understand<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.359> so<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:07.139> difference

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
read it understand it so the difference

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.000 
read it understand it so the difference
is<00:04:07.769> huge<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:09.959> how<00:04:10.079> they<00:04:10.260> look<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.500> one

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
is huge this is how they look like one

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.670 
is huge this is how they look like one
now<00:04:11.189> your<00:04:11.519> side<00:04:11.849> by<00:04:12.000> side<00:04:12.269> so<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.170> iPad<00:04:13.409> 2<00:04:13.650> is

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
now your side by side so the iPad 2 is

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.080 
now your side by side so the iPad 2 is
on<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.099> left<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.700> it's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
on the left and it's

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.420 
on the left and it's
really<00:04:15.360> really<00:04:15.599> pixelated<00:04:15.989> while<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.739> iPad<00:04:17.100> 3

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
really really pixelated while the iPad 3

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.849 
really really pixelated while the iPad 3
is<00:04:18.060> on<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.299> right<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:19.380> cannot<00:04:19.620> see

is on the right and you cannot see

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.520 
is on the right and you cannot see
anything<00:04:20.070> souls<00:04:20.459> at<00:04:20.609> all<00:04:20.989> now<00:04:21.989> if<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.500> zoom

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
anything souls at all now if you zoom

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.490 
text is so pixelated and so small now
while<00:04:37.380> doing<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.830> same<00:04:38.070> thing<00:04:38.400> on<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.729> iPad<00:04:39.030> 3

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
while doing the same thing on the iPad 3

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.950 
while doing the same thing on the iPad 3
you<00:04:40.500> will<00:04:40.650> notice<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.220> text<00:04:41.820> is<00:04:41.970> perfectly

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
you will notice that text is perfectly

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.600 
you will notice that text is perfectly
readable<00:04:44.210> here<00:04:45.210> we<00:04:45.300> go<00:04:45.479> so<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.500> can<00:04:46.710> read<00:04:47.580> a

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
readable here we go so you can read a

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.400 
readable here we go so you can read a
text<00:04:48.060> on<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.600> iPad<00:04:48.960> 3<00:04:49.280> while<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.729> iPad<00:04:51.030> 2

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
text on the iPad 3 while on the iPad 2

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.830 
text on the iPad 3 while on the iPad 2
you<00:04:52.410> cannot<00:04:52.919> read<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.610> at<00:04:54.389> all

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
you cannot read it at all

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.230 
you cannot read it at all
and<00:04:55.350> believe<00:04:55.770> me<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.100> camera<00:04:56.460> was<00:04:56.669> in<00:04:56.700> focus

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
and believe me the camera was in focus

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.710 
and believe me the camera was in focus
but<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.600> text<00:04:57.930> is<00:04:58.020> too<00:04:58.050> small<00:04:58.320> on<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.979> iPad<00:04:59.310> 2

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
but the text is too small on the iPad 2

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.409 
but the text is too small on the iPad 2
it's<00:05:00.720> just<00:05:01.560> not<00:05:01.740> readable<00:05:02.100> while<00:05:02.729> on<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.120> iPad

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
it's just not readable while on the iPad

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.560 
it's just not readable while on the iPad
3<00:05:03.600> as<00:05:04.229> you<00:05:04.560> can<00:05:04.740> see<00:05:04.919> again<00:05:05.220> it's<00:05:05.970> perfectly

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
3 as you can see again it's perfectly

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.490 
3 as you can see again it's perfectly
readable<00:05:06.930> now<00:05:08.210> taking<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.330> look<00:05:09.360> at<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.930> really

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
readable now taking a look at a really

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.920 
readable now taking a look at a really

really closed up image off on a safari I
can<00:05:13.289> can<00:05:13.500> definitely<00:05:14.100> see<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.340> pixels<00:05:14.850> on<00:05:15.330> the

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
can can definitely see the pixels on the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.409 
can can definitely see the pixels on the
iPad<00:05:16.350> 2<00:05:16.560> which<00:05:17.010> is<00:05:17.160> on<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.430> left<00:05:17.639> and<00:05:17.820> of

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
iPad 2 which is on the left and of

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.029 
iPad 2 which is on the left and of
course<00:05:18.630> that<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:18.900> can<00:05:18.930> also<00:05:19.229> see<00:05:19.590> them<00:05:19.770> on<00:05:19.919> the

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
course that you can also see them on the

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.190 
course that you can also see them on the
iPad<00:05:20.160> 3<00:05:20.490> which<00:05:20.760> is<00:05:20.789> on<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.120> right<00:05:21.300> but<00:05:21.570> they

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
iPad 3 which is on the right but they

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.520 
iPad 3 which is on the right but they
are<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.770> lot<00:05:23.460> smaller<00:05:23.850> than<00:05:24.270> on<00:05:24.840> your<00:05:24.900> iPad<00:05:25.380> 2<00:05:27.530> so

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
are a lot smaller than on your iPad 2 so

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.830 
are a lot smaller than on your iPad 2 so
as<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.919> can<00:05:29.039> see<00:05:29.250> in<00:05:29.370> Apple's<00:05:29.850> video<00:05:30.180> each

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
as you can see in Apple's video each

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.760 
as you can see in Apple's video each
pixel<00:05:31.470> has<00:05:31.520> 3<00:05:32.520> sub<00:05:33.030> pixels<00:05:33.450> so<00:05:33.750> red<00:05:34.050> green<00:05:34.530> and

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
pixel has 3 sub pixels so red green and

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.270 
pixel has 3 sub pixels so red green and
blue<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:35.599> by<00:05:36.770> quadrupling<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:37.919> amount<00:05:38.220> of

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
blue and by quadrupling the amount of

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.820 
blue and by quadrupling the amount of
pixels<00:05:38.520> on<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.060> screen<00:05:39.389> it<00:05:40.169> also<00:05:40.320> had<00:05:40.650> to

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
pixels on the screen it also had to

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.339 
pixels on the screen it also had to
quadruple<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.729> amount<00:05:41.760> of<00:05:42.060> sub<00:05:42.300> pixel<00:05:42.720> found

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
quadruple the amount of sub pixel found

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.589 
quadruple the amount of sub pixel found
in<00:05:43.590> each<00:05:43.889> pixel<00:05:44.280> so<00:05:44.669> this<00:05:44.940> is<00:05:45.090> really<00:05:45.450> really

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
in each pixel so this is really really

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.810 
in each pixel so this is really really
hard<00:05:45.750> to<00:05:46.080> achieve<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:47.190> way<00:05:47.340> they<00:05:47.490> did<00:05:47.669> it

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
hard to achieve and the way they did it

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.159 
hard to achieve and the way they did it
is<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.150> they<00:05:48.750> raised<00:05:49.729> two<00:05:50.729> sub<00:05:51.120> pixels<00:05:51.570> as

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
is that they raised two sub pixels as

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.700 
is that they raised two sub pixels as
you<00:05:52.260> can<00:05:52.440> see<00:05:52.710> in<00:05:52.950> the<00:05:53.190> video<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.990> basically<00:05:55.440> if

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
you can see in the video so basically if

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.159 
you can see in the video so basically if
the<00:05:55.889> sub<00:05:56.130> pixels<00:05:56.580> are<00:05:56.940> situated<00:05:57.539> at<00:05:57.780> different

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
the sub pixels are situated at different

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.710 
the sub pixels are situated at different
heights<00:05:58.410> then<00:05:59.070> it's<00:05:59.639> possible<00:05:59.970> to<00:06:00.389> make<00:06:00.660> a

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
heights then it's possible to make a

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.140 
heights then it's possible to make a
Retina<00:06:01.229> Display<00:06:01.560> this<00:06:01.889> huge<00:06:02.340> because<00:06:03.090> you

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
Retina Display this huge because you

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.909 
Retina Display this huge because you
know<00:06:03.419> Apple<00:06:03.810> had<00:06:04.020> a<00:06:04.050> previous<00:06:04.440> Retina

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
know Apple had a previous Retina

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.400 
know Apple had a previous Retina
displays<00:06:05.280> with<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:06.000> iPhone<00:06:06.419> 4<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.930> iPhone<00:06:07.200> 4

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
displays with the iPhone 4 the iPhone 4

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
displays with the iPhone 4 the iPhone 4
as<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.620> iPod<00:06:08.520> Touch<00:06:08.760> 4<00:06:09.110> but<00:06:10.110> those<00:06:10.650> screens

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
as the iPod Touch 4 but those screens

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.850 
as the iPod Touch 4 but those screens
were<00:06:11.940> really<00:06:12.450> small<00:06:12.810> compared<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.320> the<00:06:13.470> iPads

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
were really small compared to the iPads

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.400 
were really small compared to the iPads
so<00:06:14.550> this<00:06:15.000> is<00:06:15.150> how<00:06:15.330> they<00:06:15.599> made<00:06:16.020> it<00:06:16.050> possible

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
so this is how they made it possible

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.029 
so this is how they made it possible
this<00:06:16.979> is<00:06:17.130> how<00:06:17.250> they<00:06:17.490> engineered<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:19.680> Retina

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
this is how they engineered the Retina

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.700 
this is how they engineered the Retina
display<00:06:20.340> and<00:06:20.720> although<00:06:21.720> you<00:06:21.960> think<00:06:22.110> you've

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
display and although you think you've

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.440 
display and although you think you've
seen<00:06:22.979> the<00:06:23.219> retina<00:06:23.580> display<00:06:23.640> in<00:06:23.969> this<00:06:24.090> video

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
seen the retina display in this video

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.730 
seen the retina display in this video
you're<00:06:25.260> wrong<00:06:25.560> you<00:06:25.830> have

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
you're wrong you have

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.530 
you're wrong you have
because<00:06:27.740> in<00:06:27.980> reality<00:06:28.490> the<00:06:28.760> rest<00:06:29.000> on<00:06:29.150> display

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
because in reality the rest on display

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.010 
because in reality the rest on display
is<00:06:29.840> a<00:06:30.080> billion<00:06:30.830> times<00:06:31.220> more<00:06:31.940> amazing<00:06:32.480> than<00:06:32.660> in

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
is a billion times more amazing than in

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.740 
is a billion times more amazing than in
this<00:06:33.139> video<00:06:33.470> so<00:06:34.190> just<00:06:34.520> go<00:06:35.060> to<00:06:35.120> your<00:06:35.389> local
