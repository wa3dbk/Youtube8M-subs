00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
up the light screen because he might

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.790 
up the light screen because he might
just<00:00:29.970> rotate<00:00:30.420> into<00:00:30.750> his<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.349> flows<00:00:31.619> in

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
gonna set up that reflect and now I'm

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.259 
gonna set up that reflect and now I'm
pretty<00:03:06.930> much<00:03:07.050> safe<00:03:07.440> from<00:03:08.220> from<00:03:08.670> both<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
pretty much safe from from both the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.850 
pretty much safe from from both the
special<00:03:09.750> effects<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.260> physical<00:03:10.560> effects

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
special effects and the physical effects

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.250 
special effects and the physical effects
and<00:03:11.130> I'm<00:03:11.820> gonna<00:03:11.940> switch<00:03:12.390> back<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.720> my<00:03:12.840> Kyogre

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
and I'm gonna switch back to my Kyogre

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.050 
and I'm gonna switch back to my Kyogre
to<00:03:13.320> get<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.590> rain<00:03:13.739> back<00:03:13.950> up<00:03:14.160> as<00:03:14.340> he<00:03:14.700> rotates

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
to get that rain back up as he rotates

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.060 
to get that rain back up as he rotates
into<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.510> dear<00:03:15.810> thing<00:03:16.050> again<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.590> he's

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
into this dear thing again and he's

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.620 
into this dear thing again and he's
gonna<00:03:17.220> hit<00:03:17.400> me<00:03:17.519> with<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> double<00:03:17.760> edge<00:03:18.120> which<00:03:18.329> is

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
gonna hit me with a double edge which is

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.080 
gonna hit me with a double edge which is
stab<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.829> that's<00:03:20.130> gonna<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:20.400> quite<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> bit<00:03:20.910> even

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
stab so that's gonna do quite a bit even

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.780 
stab so that's gonna do quite a bit even
with<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.360> reflect<00:03:22.160> pretty<00:03:23.160> insane<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.640> does

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
with the reflect pretty insane it does

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.949 
with the reflect pretty insane it does
some<00:03:24.030> pretty<00:03:24.209> good<00:03:24.360> damage<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:26.180> yeah<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.720> don't

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
some pretty good damage and yeah I don't

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.000 
some pretty good damage and yeah I don't
know<00:03:28.049> where<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.200> do<00:03:28.320> where<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.560> think<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:28.920> I

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
know where I do where I think so I

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.530 
know where I do where I think so I
switch<00:03:29.220> back<00:03:29.400> out<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.030> get<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.299> rain

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
switch back out just to get that rain

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.180 
switch back out just to get that rain
back<00:03:30.780> up<00:03:30.959> later<00:03:31.110> no<00:03:31.380> actually<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.799> wrote<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
back up later no actually I wrote it

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.280 
back up later no actually I wrote it
into<00:03:32.400> my<00:03:32.549> eye<00:03:33.060> Mewtwo<00:03:33.840> expecting<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.750> burn

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
into my eye Mewtwo expecting to burn

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.050 
into my eye Mewtwo expecting to burn
some<00:03:37.500> turns<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.829> sleep<00:03:38.070> because<00:03:38.220> I'm<00:03:38.459> not<00:03:38.640> sure

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
some turns of sleep because I'm not sure

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.190 
some turns of sleep because I'm not sure
if<00:03:39.329> sleeper<00:03:39.989> sets<00:03:40.320> up<00:03:40.560> on<00:03:40.829> like<00:03:41.930> rotating<00:03:42.930> out

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
if sleeper sets up on like rotating out

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.390 
if sleeper sets up on like rotating out
I<00:03:43.230> don't<00:03:43.560> think<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.829> does<00:03:43.950> because<00:03:44.130> you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
I don't think it does because you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.150 
I don't think it does because you
basically<00:03:44.850> are<00:03:44.940> still<00:03:45.239> in<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> field<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.160> think

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
basically are still in the field I think

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.920 
basically are still in the field I think
also<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.489> if<00:03:47.910> you're<00:03:48.090> locked<00:03:48.390> into<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.660> move

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
also that if you're locked into a move

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.120 
also that if you're locked into a move
with<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> choice<00:03:49.530> band<00:03:49.799> or<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> choice

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
with like a choice band or a choice

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.560 
with like a choice band or a choice
scarf<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.670> rotate<00:03:51.030> out<00:03:51.239> you're<00:03:51.450> still

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
scarf and you rotate out you're still

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.810 
scarf and you rotate out you're still
locked<00:03:51.930> into<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.350> move<00:03:52.650> I'm<00:03:53.400> not<00:03:53.610> sure

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
locked into that move I'm not sure

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.789 
locked into that move I'm not sure
though<00:03:54.030> if<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:55.079> guys<00:03:55.170> know<00:03:55.380> let<00:03:55.590> me<00:03:55.680> know

because you know light screen is up I
can<00:04:06.570> take<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.720> fire<00:04:06.930> blast<00:04:07.170> no<00:04:07.260> problem<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.860> the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
can take a fire blast no problem and the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.250 
can take a fire blast no problem and the
cool<00:04:08.850> thing<00:04:08.880> about<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.420> know<00:04:09.540> rotation

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
cool thing about you know rotation

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.410 
cool thing about you know rotation
matches<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.859> you<00:04:11.010> can<00:04:11.160> set<00:04:11.370> up<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.549> move<00:04:11.760> or

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
matches is that you can set up a move or

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.910 
matches is that you can set up a move or
you<00:04:12.660> know<00:04:12.780> boost<00:04:12.959> your<00:04:13.140> stats<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.590> then<00:04:13.739> just

you know boost your stats and then just

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.680 
you know boost your stats and then just
rotate<00:04:14.370> out<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.790> say<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.150> shit<00:04:15.269> for<00:04:15.480> later

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
rotate out and say that shit for later

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.360 
rotate out and say that shit for later
which<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.380> exactly<00:04:16.829> what<00:04:17.010> I'm<00:04:17.070> gonna<00:04:17.160> do
