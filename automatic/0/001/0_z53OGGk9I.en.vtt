00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
complex he basically just moved into a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.770 
complex he basically just moved into a
different<00:00:09.840> unit<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:10.830> across<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.780> parking

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
different unit just across the parking

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.770 
different unit just across the parking
lot<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:14.280> not<00:00:14.429> really<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> new<00:00:15.389> location

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780

lot so it's not really a new location
it's<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> same<00:00:16.590> location<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
it's in the same location just a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.269 
it's in the same location just a
different<00:00:18.150> unit<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> building<00:00:19.279> yeah

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
different unit in the building yeah

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.759 
different unit in the building yeah
we're<00:00:20.820> checking<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.960> new<00:00:22.140> store<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we're checking of the the new store I

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.519 
we're checking of the the new store I
was<00:00:23.220> basically<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.789> my<00:00:23.939> way<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> Toronto<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.500> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
was basically on my way to Toronto so I

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.519 
was basically on my way to Toronto so I
figured<00:00:25.619> I'll<00:00:26.310> stop<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.230> Milton<00:00:28.230> since

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
figured I'll stop off in Milton since

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.640 
figured I'll stop off in Milton since
it's<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.890> way<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.660> it's<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:30.900> not<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it's on the way and it's really not that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.360 
it's on the way and it's really not that
far<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.399> 401<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.630> mean<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:35.190> you're

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
far off the 401 so I mean if you're

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.940 
far off the 401 so I mean if you're
going<00:00:35.489> past<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.930> might<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:37.260> stop<00:00:37.710> in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
going past it you might as well stop in

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.819 
going past it you might as well stop in
right<00:00:38.480> as<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.379> little<00:00:40.710> bit

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
right as you can see it's a little bit

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.840 
right as you can see it's a little bit
messy<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.670> basically<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.629> work<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.230> progress

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
messy it's basically a work in progress

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.940 
messy it's basically a work in progress
as<00:00:44.850> they're<00:00:44.910> moving<00:00:45.210> into<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> new<00:00:46.140> location
