00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
screen right now and firstly you're

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.310 
screen right now and firstly you're
probably<00:00:21.359> thinking<00:00:21.510> isn't<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.199> from

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
probably thinking isn't this just from

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.540 
probably thinking isn't this just from
one<00:00:22.500> warfare<00:00:22.830> two<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.189> there<00:00:23.310> are<00:00:23.430> some

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
one warfare two but there are some

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.340 
one warfare two but there are some
slight<00:00:23.699> differences<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.990> check<00:00:25.199> out

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
slight differences so if you check out

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.109 
slight differences so if you check out
this<00:00:25.619> image<00:00:25.980> right<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.849> lobby

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
this image right here you see the lobby

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.490 
this image right here you see the lobby
screen<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.599> we've<00:00:27.720> seen<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.289> bottom

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
screen that we've seen in the bottom

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
screen that we've seen in the bottom
left<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.250> picture<00:00:29.849> from<00:00:30.029> modern

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
left and then a picture from modern

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.420 
left and then a picture from modern
warfare<00:00:30.420> 2<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> top<00:00:31.050> right<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:32.279> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
warfare 2 in the top right so see that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.770 
warfare 2 in the top right so see that
they<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.579> look<00:00:32.790> quite<00:00:32.910> similar<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> main

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
they do look quite similar just the main

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.180 
they do look quite similar just the main
difference<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.290> actually<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.710> police<00:00:34.980> car

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
difference is actually that police car

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
difference is actually that police car
see<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> bottom<00:00:36.149> left<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> modern

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
see in the bottom left in the modern

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.299 
see in the bottom left in the modern
warfare<00:00:36.930> 3<00:00:37.050> version<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.649> white<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
warfare 3 version is white and in the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.190 
warfare 3 version is white and in the
one<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.670> two<00:00:38.760> version<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.780> mainly<00:00:39.989> black

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
one or a two version it's mainly black

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200 
one or a two version it's mainly black
so<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.739> some<00:00:40.920> differences<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.520> now<00:00:42.030> I'm

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
so there are some differences so now I'm

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.310 
so there are some differences so now I'm
just<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> kind<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> put<00:00:42.870> some<00:00:42.989> gameplay

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
just going to kind of put some gameplay

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.660 
just going to kind of put some gameplay
from<00:00:43.379> terminal<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> background<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
from terminal on in the background and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.340 
from terminal on in the background and
give<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.059> guys<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.360> thoughts<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.809> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
give you guys my thoughts on it so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
give you guys my thoughts on it so
terminal<00:00:46.829> terminal<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.280> actually<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> really

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
terminal terminal was actually a really

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
terminal terminal was actually a really
really<00:00:48.420> fun<00:00:48.539> map<00:00:48.840> mine<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.140> modern<00:00:49.289> warfare<00:00:49.440> 2

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
really fun map mine in modern warfare 2

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.410 
really fun map mine in modern warfare 2
I<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.219> didn't<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.520> mom<00:00:50.670> offer<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.149> game

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I really didn't my mom offer to a game

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.880 
I really didn't my mom offer to a game
obviously<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> big<00:00:52.289> problems<00:00:52.710> as

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
obviously there was the big problems as

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.200 
obviously there was the big problems as
I'd<00:00:53.129> already<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.760> into<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.090> guys

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I'd already have to go into you guys

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.729 
I'd already have to go into you guys
will<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> problems<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.530> think

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
will know the problems but I do think

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.110 
will know the problems but I do think
the<00:00:55.890> terminal<00:00:56.219> was<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> best<00:00:56.789> map<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the terminal was one the best map the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.220 
the terminal was one the best map the
only<00:00:57.270> thing<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.690> ruined<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.109> was

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
only thing that really ruined it was

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
only thing that really ruined it was
that<00:00:58.379> kind<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.620> big<00:00:58.800> long<00:00:58.980> corridor<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> just

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that kind of big long corridor and just

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.130 
that kind of big long corridor and just
the<00:01:00.059> problem<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> kind<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> one-man

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the problem with the kind of one-man

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
the problem with the kind of one-man
army<00:01:01.410> new<00:01:01.649> tube<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.100> taking<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
army new tube so taking that out of it I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.939 
army new tube so taking that out of it I
can<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:03.989> being<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.559> great<00:01:04.739> map

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
can just see it being a really great map

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
can just see it being a really great map
so<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.549> looking<00:01:05.700> forward<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
so I'm looking forward to it and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.789 
so I'm looking forward to it and
hopefully<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.380> happen

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
hopefully this will actually happen

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.649 
hopefully this will actually happen
because<00:01:08.130> basically<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.000> lot<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> time

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
because basically a lot of the time

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.760
