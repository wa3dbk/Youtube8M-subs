00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
linksys in the sharp booth the first

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.439 
linksys in the sharp booth the first
thing<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.410> checked<00:00:19.710> out<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.369> flexible<00:00:21.090> LED

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
thing we checked out is the flexible LED

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.140 
thing we checked out is the flexible LED
display<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.890> only<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> three<00:00:23.880> point

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
display so this is only a three point

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.700 
display so this is only a three point
four<00:00:24.420> inch<00:00:24.720> model<00:00:25.080> they've<00:00:25.230> got<00:00:25.439> two

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
four inch model they've got two

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.980 
four inch model they've got two
prototypes<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.519> display<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.779> all

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
prototypes on display here they have all

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.599 
prototypes on display here they have all
the<00:00:28.170> same<00:00:28.349> benefits<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.099> were<00:00:29.220> used<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
the same benefits that were used to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.339 
the same benefits that were used to
seeing<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.060> 0<00:00:30.090> LED<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.990> say<00:00:31.140> they

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
seeing with 0 LED that is to say they

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.620 
seeing with 0 LED that is to say they
have<00:00:31.500> more<00:00:31.710> vibrant<00:00:32.130> colors<00:00:32.460> better<00:00:33.090> contrast

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
have more vibrant colors better contrast

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.139 
have more vibrant colors better contrast
ratios<00:00:34.110> lower<00:00:34.380> power<00:00:34.680> consumption<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.550> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
ratios lower power consumption all of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
ratios lower power consumption all of
that<00:00:36.180> good<00:00:36.660> stuff<00:00:36.719> however<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that good stuff however now all of a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.970 
that good stuff however now all of a
sudden<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:40.739> one

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
sudden you can see that with there's one

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
sudden you can see that with there's one
demo<00:00:41.190> there<00:00:41.550> where<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.879> curved<00:00:42.210> by<00:00:42.540> default

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
demo there where it's curved by default

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
demo there where it's curved by default
and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.469> there's<00:00:43.649> another<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.100> over<00:00:44.129> here

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and then there's another one over here

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.860 
and then there's another one over here
on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> right<00:00:44.940> where<00:00:45.120> they've<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.480> got

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
on the right where they've actually got

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
on the right where they've actually got
it<00:00:46.020> flexing<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.770> real<00:00:46.950> time<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it flexing in real time that

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.790 
it flexing in real time that
dramatically<00:00:48.300> increases<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> applications

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
dramatically increases the applications

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
dramatically increases the applications
that<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> use<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.820> technology<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.719> now

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
that we can use this technology for now

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.560 
that we can use this technology for now
this<00:00:53.219> these<00:00:53.640> particular<00:00:54.180> ones<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.539> here

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
this these particular ones right here

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630 
this these particular ones right here
implement<00:00:55.199> sharps<00:00:55.469> XO<00:00:55.829> technology<00:00:56.430> which

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
implement sharps XO technology which

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
implement sharps XO technology which
does<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> couple<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.329> things<00:00:57.390> number<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
does a couple of things number one is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.500 
does a couple of things number one is
that<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> highly<00:00:59.850> sensitive<00:01:00.300> touch

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that it is a highly sensitive touch

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.619 
that it is a highly sensitive touch
panel<00:01:00.840> technology<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.620> number<00:01:02.280> two<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.789> that

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
panel technology and number two is that

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
panel technology and number two is that
it<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:04.379> reduces<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.339> power

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it actually reduces the power

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.270 
it actually reduces the power
consumption<00:01:06.060> again<00:01:06.960> compared<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.920> other

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
consumption again compared to other

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120 
consumption again compared to other
approaches<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> comes<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> LED

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
approaches for when when it comes to LED

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
approaches for when when it comes to LED
screens<00:01:11.430> now<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.030> might<00:01:12.479> say<00:01:12.510> okay<00:01:12.960> Oh<00:01:13.110> LED<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
screens now you might say okay Oh LED is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
screens now you might say okay Oh LED is
already<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:14.130> efficient<00:01:14.729> why<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.030> care

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
already very efficient why do we care

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.179 
already very efficient why do we care
and<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> answer<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> build<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and the answer is if you want to build a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.010 
and the answer is if you want to build a
larger<00:01:17.520> format<00:01:17.880> panel<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
larger format panel or if you want to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.600 
larger format panel or if you want to
pack<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.350> pixels<00:01:19.650> into<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.100> power

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
pack more pixels into it power

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
pack more pixels into it power
consumption<00:01:21.030> becomes<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.570> factor<00:01:21.750> again<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
consumption becomes a factor again so

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.520 
consumption becomes a factor again so
the<00:01:23.610> great<00:01:23.820> thing<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.780> unlike<00:01:25.350> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the great thing about this is unlike so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
the great thing about this is unlike so
many<00:01:25.590> things<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.070> see<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.369> CES<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.479> isn't

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
many things we see at CES this isn't

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
many things we see at CES this isn't
actually<00:01:28.110> science<00:01:28.680> fiction<00:01:29.130> unlike<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> know

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
actually science fiction unlike you know

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
actually science fiction unlike you know
the<00:01:30.030> product<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> sony<00:01:31.140> booth

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the product that was in the sony booth

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.160 
the product that was in the sony booth
where<00:01:32.310> no<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> booth<00:01:33.600> had<00:01:33.840> actually

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
where no one from the booth had actually

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.210 
where no one from the booth had actually
even<00:01:34.350> heard<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.860> seen<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> they

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
even heard of this or seen it they

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010 
even heard of this or seen it they
basically<00:01:35.520> pulled<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.850> out<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.090> box<00:01:36.299> put<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
basically pulled it out of a box put it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.569 
basically pulled it out of a box put it
in<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> display<00:01:37.470> stand<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.040> no<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.250> knows<00:01:38.400> what

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
in a display stand and no one knows what

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.090 
in a display stand and no one knows what
it<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.509> could<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.780> produced<00:01:40.110> tomorrow<00:01:40.770> if

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it is this could be produced tomorrow if

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.730

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
is an AK 85 inch TV that is actually

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.400 
is an AK 85 inch TV that is actually
displaying<00:02:10.500> native<00:02:11.220> 8k<00:02:11.880> content<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.110> the

displaying native 8k content so the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680 
displaying native 8k content so the
difference<00:02:13.590> between<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.310> kak<00:02:14.940> quite<00:02:15.240> simply

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
difference between for kak quite simply

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.920 
difference between for kak quite simply
is<00:02:16.400> for<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.300> not<00:02:18.450> before<00:02:18.630> you're

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
is for but but not before you're

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.590 
is for but but not before you're
thinking<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.410> not<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:19.860> not<00:02:20.130> 4000<00:02:20.940> actually<00:02:21.390> it

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
thinking of not not not 4000 actually it

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.560 
thinking of not not not 4000 actually it
is<00:02:21.960> four<00:02:22.320> times<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.430> resolution<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:24.120> 4k

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
is four times the resolution of 4k

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.180 
is four times the resolution of 4k
content<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.170> what<00:02:25.320> I'd<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.920> my
