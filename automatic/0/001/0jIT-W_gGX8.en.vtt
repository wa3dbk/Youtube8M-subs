00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:16.460
 [Music] 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:25.349
 [Laughs] 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:27.599
 twenty five hello everyone I'm bringing you 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.359
 another equal gap on the banks of drift 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.880
 wood on the east map that goes well 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.950
 a sun comes out there in a lighthouse and it's good 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.350
 very simple is right now you are going to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.629
 see in this house here the blue house 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.890
 one of the largest there is as you see 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.629
 just good in this game was 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.579
 with car there is and we are using 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.280
 the cactus since we can use then 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.710
 the drone is worth as you are seeing in a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 partner puts you the drone and so we can 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.190
 jump inside as you see it like that first 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.289
 we can not jump but if you put the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.510
 drone right there we jump and we 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.190
 we will put inside what is the house and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.019
 we can be out there I saw some trolling 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 It is worth but little more since it does not have much 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.160
 utility is worth we can be here and already 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.170
 it is but we can not shoot the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.910
 enemies because even though we shoot at 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.010
 enemies from within we can not 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.140
 killing them is worth just as good as 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.159
 I already said it in another video we can 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.380
 give us a little spin 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.689
 and make enemies go crazy 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.999
 looking for us and little more as knowing that 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.530
 let's go in with the drone but there 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.819
 an easier way to get into this 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 house because here we still had not 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.899
 tried just here I got to put 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.290
 These potatoes are nuts there 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:35.210
 some who say they are potatoes watching 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.590
 they go much better because it's like a 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.350
 We can use a kind of step 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.880
 as a step and it goes well at the time of 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.220
 enter and exit, so we do not have to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.740
 be with no partner 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.480
 in this way just one single 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 could go in and out without any kind of 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.600
 problem is worth it here you will see that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.180
 put back because other potatoes 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.700
 these or nuts or whatever they are worth and it will be 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.740
 much easier to enter and exit and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 it's okay so nothing this is the trick 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.400
 It is quite curious as I say no 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.160
 bring your hands to your head because no 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.690
 we can kill anyone from here it's worth 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.890
 we can simply see how you see there 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.679
 the spines of the cactus remain 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.780
 hooked do not pass from there it's worth like that 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.820
 that nothing simply for another failure more 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.200
 here in poses versus zombies I suppose 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.570
 that these are unsuccessful fools who will go 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.060
 by removing on this map you are going to see some 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.050
 more about everything and good in other maps is 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.400
 a little more complicated but good 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.410
 it's also a matter of looking for vale has 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.580
 it looks like they're going to see more so nothing 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.930
 simply this I hope that I have 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.730
 liked if you liked to vote I like it 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.780
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.780
 video to all 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.000
 and point 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.890

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.040
