00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.110 
was interested in it any time I sell a
bike<00:05:36.140> I<00:05:36.380> try<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.710> do<00:05:36.980> all<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.280> servicing<00:05:37.880> and

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
bike I try to do all the servicing and

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.080 
bike I try to do all the servicing and
get<00:05:38.420> it<00:05:38.510> up<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.780> par<00:05:38.990> for<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.800> new<00:05:39.950> owner<00:05:40.190> so<00:05:41.030> I

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
get it up to par for the new owner so I

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.910 
get it up to par for the new owner so I
go<00:05:41.210> ahead<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.450> I<00:05:41.570> change<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.110> oil<00:05:42.320> I<00:05:42.620> flush

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
go ahead and I change the oil I flush

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.240 
go ahead and I change the oil I flush
out<00:05:43.130> the<00:05:43.280> brake<00:05:43.520> fluids<00:05:44.000> I<00:05:44.150> clean<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:44.600> chain

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
out the brake fluids I clean the chain

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.060 
out the brake fluids I clean the chain
check<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.430> tire<00:05:46.670> pressures<00:05:47.560> just<00:05:48.560> make<00:05:48.830> sure

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
check the tire pressures just make sure

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.700 
check the tire pressures just make sure
that<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.490> bikes<00:05:50.030> 100%<00:05:50.810> serviceable<00:05:51.410> for<00:05:51.470> the

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
that the bikes 100% serviceable for the

00:05:51.710 --> 00:06:21.370 
that the bikes 100% serviceable for the
new<00:05:51.860> owner

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.030 

so<00:06:22.380> that's<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:22.710> SP<00:06:23.100> 1000s<00:06:24.090> oil<00:06:24.630> change<00:06:25.040> it's

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
so that's the SP 1000s oil change it's

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.910 
so that's the SP 1000s oil change it's
pretty<00:06:26.280> much<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.550> same<00:06:26.730> for<00:06:26.940> an<00:06:27.030> SV<00:06:27.390> 650

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
pretty much the same for an SV 650

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.650 
pretty much the same for an SV 650
rolling<00:06:28.920> I<00:06:29.010> hope<00:06:29.190> you<00:06:29.310> enjoyed<00:06:29.640> the<00:06:29.790> bite<00:06:29.970> good
