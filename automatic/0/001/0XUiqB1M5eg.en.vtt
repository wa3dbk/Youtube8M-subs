00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
recognize is there are a lot of things

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.069

we could have done to him back this game

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.869 
we could have done to him back this game
so<00:00:59.289> it<00:00:59.410> turned<00:00:59.590> out<00:00:59.680> differently<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.610> then<00:01:00.760> we

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
so it turned out differently and then we

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:01.889 
so it turned out differently and then we
got<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.090> believe<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.570> luck<00:01:01.719> will<00:01:01.870> turn

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and come back to us somewhere else and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.959 
and come back to us somewhere else and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
the guys were the most committed so I

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.949

think<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.289> Fresno<00:01:14.469> game<00:01:14.859> was<00:01:15.069> good<00:01:15.369> for<00:01:15.609> us

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
think that Fresno game was good for us

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.069
