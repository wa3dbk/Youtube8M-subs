00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 they are gods to mamani mamani 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.490
 everyone welcome to sandra stylize there 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.809
 is the third video that he filmed 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.990
 that's why they always see me with the same 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.869
 blouse because I decided to make several draws 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.420
 and this is going to be the video where draw 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.820
 the brushes these brushes are the most 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.830
 I like it a lot because of the appearance 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 they have that is to say you know that no 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.879
 only women also buy us with 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.730
 the aesthetic part of things I bring a 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.680
 color super cute rosadito oh my god 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.800
 I'm falling the other thing that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.800
 loved is that they came in their case 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.710
 that you can close is to say that for 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.900
 travel are the maximum so here it is and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.220
 the brushes are kept protected but 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.860
 also the case is super nice 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.840
 it's also like skin is surely 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.030
 fake skin obviously I hope it's 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.690
 false skin and after these pÃ³sitos here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.630
 that close 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.030
 has a very curious finish whether it's the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.540
 case that the brushes have a hair 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.460
 super super soft and as they are decent 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.830
 Synthetics are brushes that you can use 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.570
 be with liquid products that with 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.670
 creamy products that with products in 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.250
 good dust surely I saw them 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.110
 use if the two videos were lost 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.060
 prior to this I invite you to go 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.220
 to check the videos so they can see 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 the make-up tutorial so that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.420
 see how you use the brushes and graben 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.940
 test many many brushes come 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 be for the face that for the eyes is 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.350
 for example, it seems perfect for me 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.820
 place the loose powder this other without 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.610
 But I was using it to 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.800
 amalgamate the good correctors in the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.840
 video that I made about the profiling of 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.060
 face I was using this brush 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.700
 mostly to amalgamate tea the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.260
 clear product that the dark product 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.870
 left this result that you are seeing me 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.450
 that is super natural I fell in love with this 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.060
 This other brush seems perfect for me 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.370
 place the blush and also the bronzer 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.600
 well in fact they saw me use it with 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.990
 this 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.020
 and since they have almost nullified cuts , 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.880
 fits perfectly here and it's as if 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.590
 it will be easier to extract with turin 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.290
 because precisely because of the way 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.930
 she has when she supports you on the brush she 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.580
 you practically deposit the product 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.410
 of the way it should be that it's going to 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.810
 place as many products 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.770
 in this area here and the least amount 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.340
 of product in this one here supports it 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.200
 and smudged this brush is surely 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.640
 to place the foundation for 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.470
 the lovers to place the base of 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.690
 makeup with this type of brushes yes 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.450
 but I sincerely prefer it for 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.430
 place the illuminator and place it 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.750
 so a more compact form is 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.700
 that like me I have a little face 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.430
 I also prefer this type of brushes 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.440
 so more contained because I feel that I 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.180
 it's easier to have craftsmanship and 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.520
 concentrate the product in the areas that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.770
 I really want and not that I'm going away 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.320
 the hand everything then I like 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.840
 a lot to place the illuminator in this 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.690
 zone here of the cheekbone and also to what 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.690
 length of the wall of the nose in the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.200
 cupid's bow on the chin and so on and 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.900
 and all these others that would be for the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.150
 eyes although good for example is the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.310
 is using to place the corrector 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.590
 here in the area of those of the bonfire of 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.630
 the ojera spectacular and I think this 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.640
 It's great to blur because 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.110
 brings the super hairs to open 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.540
 this one also I use it for 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.100
 blur to place in color here in 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.680
 the external angle of the eye and then 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.170
 blur these two the sixth uses 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.359
 to place the shadows and how they have 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.700
 the little hairs so super- dense 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.040
 they pick up super good either the shadows 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.950
 powder that cream shadows what 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.500
 maximum and this is one of my favorites 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.689
 at all because it ends like this 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.019
 point and then you can make a 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.030
 super precise application of the shadow in 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.280
 the place really exposing 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.019
 especially when he does not want to intensify 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.510
 the external angle of the eyes or even 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.889
 to place on the lower eyelid 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.139
 you manage to have more crafts is more 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.359
 precise with this brush this one still does not 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.909
 I used but I know it is to place 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.349
 the gel liner but I'm not very 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.030
 lover of this type of brushes for 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.739
 place the eyeliner on gel because almost 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.570
 they always come with the tip too 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.139
 thick and I find it a bit difficult 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.599
 make thin strokes I prefer this one that is 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.870
 the angled cut and this one not only for 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:34.270
 place the eyeliner but also to 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.070
 touch up the eyebrows with shadow this brush 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.440
 I love it for that and good too 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.270
 It serves to put some other shadow 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.190
 in the lower eyelid or when we want 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.409
 make an application also accurate 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.679
 as a line 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.059
 previous no previous no in the 

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:50.709
 makeup that I proposed for the day 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.899
 of valentine in fact use this 

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:55.239
 brush to make the tail of the eyes 

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:57.159
 golden ones that I did under the other 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:58.899
 delineated good if you have not seen videos 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.610
 I invite you to go to check it 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.899
 also and because I do not want that in 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.929
