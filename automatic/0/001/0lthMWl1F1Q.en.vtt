00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.940
 [Music] 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.709
 mortal kombat the legendary saga of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.869
 struggle with almost two decades of 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.880
 History behind him returns to the end

 occasion to 360 equipment platforms and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.220
 Playstation 3 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.990
 now 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.970
 in total this new chapter of mortal 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.650
 kombat offers around a 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.020
 thirty characters with whom 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.329
 play being present most of 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.030
 most known fighters of the saga as 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.160
 scorpions you can not take away jon and kate 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.480
 sonya blade raiden or the icy sub zero 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.879
 meeting all of them unlocked 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.980
 from the beginning also the version of 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.230
 playstation 3 that we analyze in this 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.600
 video also has a character 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.940
 exclusive guest nothing less than the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.400
 mighty kratos warrior of the god saga 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.350
 of war which is also a character 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.350
 playable from the start 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.720
 although without a doubt what has most 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.730
 surprised of this new mortal kombat 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.520
 are the game modalities between 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.470
 that we can choose both by number and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.080
 for its great variety having more 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.840
 specifically the combat mode in mode 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.880
 history the tower mode of the challenges the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.950
 tracking time and online mode 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.950
 which we detail below 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.020
 of entry the combat mode is one of the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.360
 most complete of the game since in it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.700
 we can play a tournament either in 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.280
 alone or also by teams in mode 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.560
 tag being possible in this case to choose 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.360
 two wrestlers with whom to play the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.670
 which we can alternate during the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.060
 fight with the push of a button 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.060
 I send 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.520
 also there does not end everything since this 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.280
 modality also includes several modes 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.060
 challenges called lucky challenge 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.500
 of force of reflexes and striking 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.780
 being mostly simple 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.890
 minigames having each of them 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.890
 your own rules 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.339
 [Music] 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.489
 [Music] 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.349
 On the other hand, the story mode of the game 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.599
 it allows us to play following the plot 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.849
 plot of mortal kombat being the 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.220
 detail that has surprised us most in the 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.950
 fact that everything is conceived as if 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.019
 of a movie it was about being 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.629
 full of continuous cinematic scenes 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.099
 and indeed so much so that in this 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.980
 modality we will not even be able 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.569
 select a certain character 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.250
 but we will fight with the fighter who 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.530
 the story script itself go 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.360
 putting under our control according to 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.880
 develop the events of the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.799
 plot resulting in one of the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.690
 most original ways and stories and 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.360
 fun we had seen until 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.849
 now in a fighting game 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.040
 I can not let you hang around alone without 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.470
 shooting guard 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.350
 or 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.770
 I do not need is like, and I'm certainly not 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.770
 your baby 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.770
 guarch 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.300
 As for the tower mode of the challenges, 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.090
 It also deals with a modality where 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.070
 we will have to overcome various challenges 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.990
 although in this case of skill as 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.210
 for example execute all attacks 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.790
 specials of a character in less than 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.830
 25 seconds so it's a 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.930
 ideal way to learn to master the 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.930
 movements of the different fighters 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.819
 going into training mode is a 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.739
 modality that as you have deduced is 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.810
 thought to be able to practice all the 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.299
 time we need the techniques of 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.819
 the different characters although even 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.349
 this mode is much more complete 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.810
 of what is usual in the 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.569
 most games of the genre being 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.160
 divided in turn into several categories 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.500
 being one of them the possibility of 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.680
 practice the wild final blows of 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.919
 mortal kombat is to say the ruthless 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.919
 fatality them 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.430
 [Music] 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.680
 and finally the multiplayer mode 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.810
 online also offers us a great 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.850
 offer of fun can enjoy 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.430
 both fights one against one as 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.290
 battles to double in tag mode in addition 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.510
 we also have a cinema mode where 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.310
 through avatars the users 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.560
 can watch the combats of the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.810
 other players while waiting for their 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.570
 turn being able to cheer or boo 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.710
 contenders and even give your vote yes 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.710
 they liked the fight 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.830
 but in case all these modes up 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.440
 now he commented we were not already 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.990
 by itself more than enough the title we 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.120
 keeps a couple of surprises plus one 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.250
 option called the crypt and another 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.500
 called necropolis where we can 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.780
 exchange the coins we get after 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.850
 win each fight unlocking like this 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.639
 various extra content for the game 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.620
 like new leg litis and suits for the 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.530
 fighters to be able to listen to the melodies 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.840
 of the game view the classic galleries 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.659
 of art or even access some that 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.800
 another hidden character 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.719
 finally before firing this 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.150
 analysis we can not forget about 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.199
 graphic section of the game 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.749
 finding us with a design of the 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.509
 sensational characters as well as with ones 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.919
 scenarios that perfectly meet 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.529
 being these set in a large 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.210
 variety of environments of all kinds and all 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:53.129
 it always loaded with a great 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.469
 component of violence and blood in 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.620
 screen which is already a sign of 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.820
 identity of the saga 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.830
 - I extend 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.830
 it's the end of everything 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.410
 grass 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.470
 in conclusion mortal kombat not only 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.540
 supposes the return of a classic that 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.640
 will meet all the expectations of the 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.620
 numerous fans of the saga but that 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.510
 It is also one of the best and most 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.940
 complete fighting games of the current 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.770
 generation so yes you are passionate about 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.050
 genre is a title that should not 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.120
 missing in your collection having 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.250
 always present that yes for its 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.620
 High level of violence is a game 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.370
 recommended only for adults over 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:42.160
 years without mistakes to your opponents 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.620
 you will face one last challenge 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.010
 to me 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.290
 that is the final challenge they could be giving 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.160
 nick to the belt of champion 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.160
 they will have hundreds no
