00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone this week 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.790
 I would like to talk about cycling 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.740
 stationary 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.030
 especially at the position I have 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.650
 a lot of customers me that I think of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.840
 the solar usta with me in the running 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.280
 workouts and i have to school i 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.980
 actually the tip of the feet at 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.090
 back level and also the people who have 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.859
 problems and relate to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 more important problems of good 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.420
 position his goal in the first 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.660
 thing if you notice at the level of the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.000
 room when I'm in extension if 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.340
 a parent corner that the foot is club and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.710
 no point was so the right foot is 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 flat and plays to see such a reflection 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.210
 at the game level so I believe before 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.340
 completely in the leg in the extension 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.680
 there is no extension 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.230
 I have a little bending of the dance juice 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 important which is the small section of the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.860
 young guy lambda back posture so that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.149
 it's really personal to everyone 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.949
 because there are people who do not like 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.000
 they too bike ps there are people who 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.199
 like to be a little further 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.739
 me personally never enough 13 bike 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.650
 so just see when you are 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.590
 leaned before eyes first level a 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.840
 second time there are still two 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.810
 missions we use a lot on the bike 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.150
 which is position 1 on appeal if the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 hands on the horizontal bar corner not 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.340
 the position of who is at the end of the guide 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.950
 in so pollution a position of little and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.500
 see if you are in position also in 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.650
 two same thing at the elbows 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.770
 had to have a small flexion in the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.880
 cuts and not lic to young parents 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.920
 the composition of the guides in position 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.360
 legs but the renewal of the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.250
 posture to important to properly use the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.869
 dorsal it is all alone when you 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.049
 ride a stationary bike 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.020
 that is, always avoid having the 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.329
 shoulders in elevation like this one is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.140
 to serve obvious and we want the hand 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.479
 before the shoulders cleared well engaged 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.410
 Gomis muscles at the dorsal level 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.340
 liszt is also are engaged and a 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.620
 pedals so how does his daughter annie 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.390
 really see their time pretty relaxed 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.140
 so everything is focused this the bastard 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.510
 so you see my foot is still 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.329
 full so I avoid proulx was 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.489
 well like this one so why that 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.650
 I 'm going to have the flat foot his notebooks 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.459
 flat feet first hand level 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.069
 Household 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.220
 it's a lot easier to push and 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.319
 shoot who knows the movement wants one 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.340
 wants to ask 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.440
 we won 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.140
 in the spinning classes so during 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.810
 that I have a leg that pushes the order 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.750
 I pull up then the latter 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.330
 point was is to forget serge abacus 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.730
 at the time second thing is that towards 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.599
 an elsewhere the team there I can really 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.799
 use the whole surface of my thigh 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.090
 so I was going to have a lot more 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.250
 meaning for more inertia and for 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.500
 accelerations it's really better to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.140
 much more efficient burns more than 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.549
 calories that more speeds more more 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:23.019
 ok so the flat feet post position 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.760
 at the back level so for the people here 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:30.140
 I put him in about the same 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.940
 level that the scene why because 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.560
 like that I sort clannin gentlemen 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.940
 having a bike is what it is which 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.250
 a little more bent over to be more 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.480
 aerodynamic 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.940
 by cons if you ever have 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.000
 back problems I'm one of those 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.000
 moments of getting up a video 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.700
 at that moment the water ex- sake 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.790
 much more important sent 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.069
 means leaning forward 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.850
 I have a beautiful posture but he is 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.630
 clear and not listen 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.870
 I own I shoot and I really use 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.750
 off the surface of an act us for 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.680
 well be tight to use the best 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.190
 unfolds itself says so this is another 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.020
 thing for sure when fabius 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.120
 national I gave it a lot 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.160
 during this little game it's always that 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.650
 it's always necessary in this environment 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.040
 to say never 500 resistance at all 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.770
 at all, so do not pedal in a vacuum 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.480
 or do not pedal with too much 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.050
 the space where is what we can not 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.330
 can not do some inertia 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.940
 oh it sure is for efficiency 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.530
 try to belgians very much above 66 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.690
 minutes 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.330
 no matter where you are especially when 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.940
 you have the distance and the party 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.200
 express accelerations and batches 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.460
 give you a cost could reach 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:07.720
 less than 120 rpm 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.310
 in that same day I was showing 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.700
 the acceleration I'm talking about 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.730
 then the jpeg I still have the strength 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.689
 I would say that it should savor 60 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.719
 for his rich proust 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.179
 post is well engaged anyway and 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.759
 meuse dutronc which is important for the 

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:28.309
 posture but dorsal I respect well 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.199
 be careful at the neck level of not 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:32.689
 not have any balls so like that's 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.540
 like to keep a posture the size 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.750
 in the same extension as it 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:43.290
 rebrab at this moment i can change a 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:46.480
 punishment if I access music 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.480
 if you ever want the purpose of the saddle 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.100
 is accelerated at that moment it is 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.160
 important to put more intensity 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.130
 for not the city and you go the 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.000
 do like this you go fast and 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.880
 to be completely solid floor in 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.700
 the halls use linux of the glutes 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:13.120
 and thighs always flat feet 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:19.380
 they go down and he goes on 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:23.590
 magritte - not threaten the rations so 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:27.940
 flat feet knees them 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:30.100
 infections in the back to have a 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.440
 such tension the head an extension of 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.300
 the column elbows them always a 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.570
 small selection 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.360
 the shoulders away from the ears we engage 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.940
 the muscles of the trunk not always 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.370
 my brother were posted 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.180
 feet are flat like fabre 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.980
 rated you will imagine yourself as 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.140
 if you are ready to slip under the 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.270
 rain ok that's really the movement 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.450
 what we want then is a movement 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:02.260
 pushes the fires up and down but 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:05.940
 it's a bit we will act for really 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.710
 look for them from a mining kente 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.780
 do you do intervals in 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.540
 always intend not to a 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.390
 completely in the void that is 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.430
 always on board some resistance 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.560
 and sublime mother resistance is revered in 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.060
 muscular endurance is well there this 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.460
 moment there you do not put too much 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.350
 the space for the bus he even kept 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.910
 a certain momentum 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:34.030
 you have to keep the right pace finish at 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.880
 unwelcome academic level you 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:40.830
 drink some shade to hope well and I 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.830
 see you next week thank you
