of<00:01:33.860> defense<00:01:34.250> as<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.700> see<00:01:34.910> it's<00:01:35.090> free<00:01:35.450> to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
of defense as you can see it's free to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.400 
of defense as you can see it's free to
plant<00:01:36.460> but<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.970> has<00:01:38.390> only<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.720> very<00:01:38.900> short<00:01:38.990> range

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
plant but it has only a very short range

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.900 
plant but it has only a very short range
of<00:01:39.590> attack<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.130> will<00:01:40.250> only<00:01:40.310> hit<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.700> first

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
of attack it will only hit the first

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.060 
of attack it will only hit the first
object<00:01:41.120> it<00:01:41.420> comes<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.690> counter<00:01:41.960> with<00:01:42.080> two<00:01:42.380> it

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
object it comes to counter with two it

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.030 
object it comes to counter with two it
also<00:01:43.280> has<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.640> lifespan<00:01:43.850> on<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.360> board<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:45.110> over

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
also has a lifespan on the board so over

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.800 
also has a lifespan on the board so over
time<00:01:46.070> you'll<00:01:46.490> notice<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.120> pups<00:01:47.630> rooms

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
time you'll notice that the pups rooms

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.360 
time you'll notice that the pups rooms
start<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.230> fade<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.830> eventually<00:01:49.220> they'll

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
start to fade and eventually they'll

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.920 
start to fade and eventually they'll
flicker<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.880> then<00:01:50.030> disappear<00:01:50.510> after<00:01:50.750> about<00:01:50.870> a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
flicker and then disappear after about a

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.899 
flicker and then disappear after about a
minute<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.920> can<00:01:52.040> come<00:01:52.190> back<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.550> by<00:01:52.760> either

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
minute you can come back that by either

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.060 
minute you can come back that by either
planting<00:01:53.390> more<00:01:53.570> posh<00:01:53.810> rooms<00:01:54.080> or<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.920> can
