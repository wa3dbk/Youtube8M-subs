00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.200
 Y 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.200
 I am so already pray I am a dancer 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.349
 contemporary dance 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.610
 I'm a choreographer, I'm also a director 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.070
 a dance company too 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.259
 contemporary that is called instinct and 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.689
 I'm a director and producer of video dance 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.939
 I studied a degree in dance 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.120
 contemporary the mode of interpreter 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.850
 that's the name of the whole career and study 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.519
 because from a very young age I had 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 liked to dance like that always workshop 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.410
 ballet 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.699
 but at 15 years old I had the 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.440
 opportunity to know the dance 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.790
 contemporary thanks to a teacher who 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.220
 I had said and I really like it 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.340
 but you already know dads is always like 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.160
 art not because you're going to starve 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.450
 and you're going to be poor and nobody is going to love you 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.900
 so I said well I'm going to use it as 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.970
 a hobby and I got to study biology 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.310
 in a class I remember perfectly in a 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.810
 chemistry class I said this is not going to be 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.580
 my life or what I'm deciding 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 right now and I left and never came back 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.300
 then I said no I 'm going to study dance 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 contemporary and I wanted to go to Mexico 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.560
 I had a lot of problems in the end I was 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 here in aguascalientes that is, there is nothing 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.220
 harder I think to study that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.170
 contemporary dance and classical ballet are 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.940
 as very very very difficult to start 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.420
 the very difficult contemporary dance of 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.570
 explain but more or is similar to the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.180
 classical dance as you can recognize it 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.520
 is that almost everything is barefoot 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.840
 that you see 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.979
 and that has a very strong theme 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.979
 usually of contemporary dance 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.900
 the sacrifices of dance are many 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.659
 of the best dance school 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.840
 I have personally sacrificed 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.300
 very much of my life as around 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.400
 other people because the dance really 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.920
 it becomes your life is very difficult because 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.020
 example have a boyfriend being a dancer 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.840
 difficult because you really do not have 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.370
 time the family always claims you 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.750
 why not come to eat here is because 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.370
 because I'm in school and I live in the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.739
 school and I sleep at school always 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.900
 there are many scolding then you have to be 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.900
 very strong to finish 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.900
 in Mexico there is a lot of talent 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.620
 awesome dancers that is not what you 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.360
 can you imagine I think Mexico is 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.330
 competing with the best encounters 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.050
 dancers there are many competitions the people 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.030
 does many things technically mexico 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.030
 it is very very very well 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.810
 it's a pink mountain professional life 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.060
 from someone who dances especially because 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.590
 there are times when you are very high 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.310
 there are times when they are very down 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.080
 because of participations that I had 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.820
 I think my favorite has been the 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.620
 Lake of the swans' had a lot 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.330
 lake production the swans for me was 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.930
 of those experiences that you can never 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.220
 forget 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.410
 I have had two works that I liked 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.730
 much of contemporary one was the year 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.520
 passed with a well-known choreographer 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.950
 that is called everton ortiz rode us a 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.750
 20 minute precious work that 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.670
 called by the fly or I enjoyed it 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:41.180
 very much there I found more as my click 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.830
 of a dancer with him and now my last 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.330
 the graduation work with which we 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.850
 we graduate that was the teacher jaime 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.020
 saw he came to set up a work that 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.520
 it's called ostrich syndrome and it was 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.800
 Well beautiful because it's also the 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.160
 graduation the culmination of everything and it was 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.170
 on sand then that was super a 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.150
 super great challenge as dancers for 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.930
 all of us and it was very pretty 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.290
 so 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.200
 fallen many times I was to 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.359
 5 seconds of taking my papers out of the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.450
 career because I could not anymore because it's 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.799
 very strong or the failures are 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.889
 Fractal Tile Failure Is If You're 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:22.009
 going a little to the subject of my company 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.990
 I think we did because it's a 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.810
 company of two people that is two 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.970
 directors that is miguel angel aguilar and 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.759
 I believe that thanks to all 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.400
 failures we had decided to do 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.380
 something on our own then thank you 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.210
 to the failures we made the company my 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.789
 plan is to study the mastery thus left 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.620
 because I just did exam and the 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.330
 biggest project that I have is the 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.030
 Miguel and I have been 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.729
 working around eight months 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.680
 clandestinely because we did not want 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.440
 as it was known until really 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.110
 we had the project moored then 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.570
 at the end of a few months we decided that it 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.110
 will call instinct dance the design of what 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.060
 did pinocho and then soon what 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.880
 let's take it out or it's still like 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.300
 half in diapers but it's already 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.300
 to be made 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.819
 ah 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.759
 now 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.740
 a company makes itself known 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.410
 taking it out or doing the touching 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.080
 doors but above all I think it is 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.080
 of being a good job in my opinion what 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.250
 unique thing that is missing from dance in general 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.889
 so here in China is broadcast then 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.720
 I think that for there to be something for 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.120
 there is a lot of public there needs to be a lot 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.710
 diffusion and there needs to be good dance 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.870
 because yes 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.610
 someone who has never been to see dance goes 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.440
 to see dance and it 's horrible it's never going to 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.470
 go back to see nobody the only thing that I 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.270
 would do if in my hands it is 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.300
 invest a lot of money to advertising 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.300
 a lot and I think that doing a good 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.540
 advertising and having a good work 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.970
 very safe 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.470
 It would be a good one after many years and 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.770
 a lot of effort but it could be like the 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.770
 movie theater 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.250
 hi i am tania i am a dance dancer 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.620
 contemporary and director of the company 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.620
 instinct and you're in biopolitics 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.720
 i
