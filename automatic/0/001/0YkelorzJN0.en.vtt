00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.520
 Hello UTB psycho artur and today 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.630
 joyful news for all those who waited 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.340
 My modpack for patch version 099 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.620
 finally I actually washed this mod 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.680
 pak by the way for the first time collected it himself 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.990
 manually not without the help of course the service 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.600
 who previously collected Dima modpak but 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.140
 Now I will play the prince on the idea myself 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.609
 like this show as well as nothing 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.199
 I have not changed, that is, I have everything here 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.939
 main mods that are needed for 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.640
 comfortable game is nothing superfluous 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.100
 that is, as you see, it is removed for stupid 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.630
 fog which of course add by 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.410
 atmospheric but because of him not a fig 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.840
 it is clear that everything is now clearly straightforward 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.370
 straight nice to see there is stabilization 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.890
 that is, nothing moves no 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.570
 jumps in sight when you go to eat 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.820
 Of course, my favorite server is cross 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.980
 Sight well, and all the gingerbread and sleep mods 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.410
 inclusive and in sniper scope 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.390
 The multiplicity with which you are displayed 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.030
 actually zoom in here 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.969
 I have my favorite frequency of 48 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.310
 16 and basically nothing special about this 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.060
 there is no modpak except perhaps 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.670
 only 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.700
 xvm ABC config someone who did more 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.850
 one king pea tuner bout is also one of 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.680
 my mates are actually here for those 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.810
 who's new has never seen this mod 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.240
 pak explain on the left 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.430
 the figure is seven thousand three hundred and 19 this 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.659
 the number of battles on the tank further 41000 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.400
 this is the total number of battles 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.610
 then a personal rating of efficiency of 1744 and then 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.869
 percent of victories accordingly 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.040
 opponents just as well 19b in this 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.040
 how much is on his tank 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.780
 10k fights this is how much it is 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.600
 total fights then his rating 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.520
 efficiency and winning percentage is such 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.030
 here's a little thing there is also a log panel damage 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.479
 damage that's what i say i need 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.979
 for a comfortable and enjoyable game and all that 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.680
 without any tricked out 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.259
 installer who will powder you 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.750
 registry shorter windows and 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.780
 let's say so for litter com computer 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.969
 here you can add at will 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.619
 some kind of medic delete something that 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.290
 to correct 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.720
 that is, everything is done for people done 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.140
 so as i like as you know in old 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.060
 good times when that's done paki 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.310
 every water chore just did well somehow 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.379
 what he enjoys ie he enjoys 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.769
 so a dresser means he does 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.989
 corresponding modpack and now everything 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.700

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.090
 boys we have no assembly here 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.340
