00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.759
 and there rapacious and quiet beauty next 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.850
 Op is good trying to think about a 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:20.449
 Different for us to do this week. 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.599
 and I thought about the pitch so let's try 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.369
 use the seat 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:29.150
 Let's try to use the bass drum and we'll try 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.919
 use a taste in the box in double 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.950
 so you're mixing a lot of 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.590
 fundamentals then basic basic basic is 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.989
 easy to do only you need to train 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.719
 enough for this, it quickly looks cool 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.170
 because slow does not always stay then are 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.579
 things you need to have a certain 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.760
 agility still matter to stay cool 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.629
 so it's plain dude I was having the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.789
 accent two ghosts with the left and the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:04.580
 Butt is next to the seat. 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:06.920
 you can apply it on the bacteria then here 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.479
 we used it in the tones take a look 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.850
 slower slow 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.299
 It's how you should always serve as you are. 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.299
 that looks good 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.899
 Hey, what's up 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.070
 after you've trained slow paulo gato 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.780
 Accelerate because it looks cool, you can 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.960
 doubling this may be making this monkey 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.509
 filled with a sudden meltdown. 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.189
 have to train beauty so it was good 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.490
 guys this is it will train these in 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.719
 eighth note between peggle x in hands and feet 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.909
 beauty 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.909
 It was worth a hug next week.
