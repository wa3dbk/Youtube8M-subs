00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
insulin levels in your blood so that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.280 
insulin levels in your blood so that
much<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.819> diabetic<00:02:30.330> whose<00:02:30.750> blood<00:02:31.019> sugar

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
much like a diabetic whose blood sugar

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.430 
much like a diabetic whose blood sugar
is<00:02:31.349> too<00:02:31.410> high<00:02:31.590> your<00:02:31.890> body<00:02:32.130> wastes<00:02:33.019> water<00:02:34.019> and

is too high your body wastes water and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.250 
is too high your body wastes water and
you<00:02:34.800> become<00:02:35.099> increasingly<00:02:36.000> thirsty<00:02:36.750> to

you become increasingly thirsty to

compensate for your high blood sugar
levels<00:02:38.940> which<00:02:39.120> which<00:02:39.510> causes<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.110> actually

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
levels which which causes you actually

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.589 
levels which which causes you actually
to<00:02:40.650> drop<00:02:40.890> weight<00:02:41.099> diabetics<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.239> don't<00:02:42.420> have

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.699 
than those with well managed sugars
frequently<00:02:48.209> so<00:02:48.870> maybe<00:02:49.170> that's<00:02:49.380> what<00:02:49.530> she's

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
frequently so maybe that's what she's

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.320
