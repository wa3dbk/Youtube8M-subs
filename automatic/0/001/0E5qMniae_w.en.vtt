remember burning crusade we're pretty

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.370 
remember burning crusade we're pretty
much<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.030> professions<00:01:18.479> had<00:01:18.630> specializations

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
much all professions had specializations

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260 
much all professions had specializations
that's<00:01:19.650> how<00:01:19.770> cooking<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.520> but
