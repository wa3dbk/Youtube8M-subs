00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
stuff down I actually already recorded

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.069 
stuff down I actually already recorded
this<00:04:16.799> video<00:04:17.220> once<00:04:17.549> but<00:04:18.000> because<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.690> was<00:04:18.810> so

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
this video once but because it was so

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.800 
this video once but because it was so
lucky<00:04:19.380> I'm<00:04:19.769> doing<00:04:20.039> it<00:04:20.160> again<00:04:20.280> I've<00:04:21.150> been<00:04:21.209> like

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
lucky I'm doing it again I've been like

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.210 
lucky I'm doing it again I've been like
bare<00:04:22.200> minimum<00:04:23.539> I'll<00:04:24.539> put<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:25.020> oh<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:26.099> by

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
bare minimum I'll put it on oh and by

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.320 
bare minimum I'll put it on oh and by
the<00:04:26.250> way<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.430> can<00:04:26.610> only<00:04:26.789> change

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
the way you can only change

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.119 
the way you can only change
difficulty<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.050> settings<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:28.800> doesn't

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
difficulty in settings so that doesn't

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.040 
difficulty in settings so that doesn't
really<00:04:29.250> matter<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.720> then<00:04:31.250> video<00:04:32.250> settings

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
really matter and then video settings

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.709 
really matter and then video settings
fast<00:04:34.520> render<00:04:35.520> distance<00:04:35.699> I'll<00:04:36.389> put<00:04:36.569> that

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
fast render distance I'll put that

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.589 
fast render distance I'll put that
really<00:04:37.020> low<00:04:37.430> use<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.669> normally<00:04:39.150> because

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
really low use I normally because

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.950 
really low use I normally because
normally<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.169> realm<00:04:40.590> is<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:41.370> lot<00:04:41.969> faster<00:04:42.719> than<00:04:42.900> a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
normally a realm is a lot faster than a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.459 
normally a realm is a lot faster than a
normal<00:04:43.379> server<00:04:43.740> it's<00:04:44.639> just<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:46.620> know<00:04:48.469> I'm

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
normal server it's just you know I'm

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.580 
normal server it's just you know I'm
going<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.650> turn<00:04:49.860> clouds<00:04:50.159> off<00:04:51.289> that<00:04:52.289> helps

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
going to turn clouds off that helps

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.950 
going to turn clouds off that helps
because<00:04:53.099> it's<00:04:53.939> a<00:04:54.000> lot<00:04:54.210> longer<00:04:54.360> than<00:04:54.509> normal

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
because it's a lot longer than normal

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.050 
because it's a lot longer than normal
server<00:04:55.199> fee<00:04:55.349> that's<00:04:55.530> run<00:04:55.800> by<00:04:55.830> Mojang<00:04:56.370> it's

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
server fee that's run by Mojang it's

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.230 
server fee that's run by Mojang it's
actually<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.689> servers<00:04:58.199> are<00:04:58.620> run<00:04:59.460> by<00:04:59.490> Amazon

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
play and I'll probably record some time

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.529 
play and I'll probably record some time
today<00:05:59.159> if<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.639> fix<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.240> recording<00:06:00.960> flag<00:06:01.319> issue

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
today if I fix the recording flag issue

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.329 
today if I fix the recording flag issue
so<00:06:03.539> I'll<00:06:03.960> show<00:06:04.139> you<00:06:04.199> how<00:06:04.349> to<00:06:04.409> reset<00:06:04.979> it<00:06:05.159> in<00:06:05.250> all

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
so I'll show you how to reset it in all

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.700 
so I'll show you how to reset it in all
the<00:06:05.460> maps<00:06:05.699> you<00:06:05.879> can<00:06:05.940> reset<00:06:06.389> it<00:06:06.419> to<00:06:06.599> because<00:06:07.469> in

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
the maps you can reset it to because in

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.189 
the maps you can reset it to because in
this<00:06:07.860> that<00:06:08.219> world<00:06:08.550> there's<00:06:09.360> actually<00:06:09.810> a<00:06:09.839> very

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
this that world there's actually a very

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.309 
this that world there's actually a very
large<00:06:10.650> city<00:06:11.339> in<00:06:11.669> tons<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.479> Easter<00:06:12.900> eggs<00:06:13.080> all

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
large city in tons of Easter eggs all

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.029 
large city in tons of Easter eggs all
around<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.830> map<00:06:14.089> somewhere<00:06:15.089> and<00:06:15.860> there<00:06:16.860> we

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
around the map somewhere and there we

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.010 
around the map somewhere and there we
just<00:06:17.159> really<00:06:17.789> far<00:06:18.000> away<00:06:18.180> to<00:06:18.240> build<00:06:18.509> our<00:06:18.750> town

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
just really far away to build our town

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.379 
just really far away to build our town
so<00:06:20.009> when<00:06:20.190> you<00:06:20.279> click<00:06:20.430> minecraft<00:06:20.940> rooms<00:06:21.270> and

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
so when you click minecraft rooms and

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.790 
so when you click minecraft rooms and
you<00:06:24.389> can<00:06:24.599> figure<00:06:24.870> it<00:06:27.080> there<00:06:28.080> is<00:06:28.289> a<00:06:28.319> place<00:06:28.650> where

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
you can figure it there is a place where

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.730 
you can figure it there is a place where
you<00:06:28.919> can<00:06:29.039> click<00:06:29.250> reset<00:06:30.000> realm<00:06:32.990> so<00:06:33.990> this<00:06:34.560> will

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
you can click reset realm so this will

well then let's say you can type in a

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.339 
well then let's say you can type in a
seed<00:06:50.419> in<00:06:51.219> select<00:06:52.219> template<00:06:52.939> which<00:06:53.930> is<00:06:53.960> really

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
seed in select template which is really

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.080 
seed in select template which is really
cold<00:06:54.620> it<00:06:54.740> does<00:06:54.860> it's<00:06:55.340> different<00:06:55.759> like

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
cold it does it's different like

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.760 
cold it does it's different like
adventure<00:06:56.810> maps<00:06:57.020> you<00:06:57.199> can<00:06:57.349> do<00:06:57.439> and<00:06:57.590> stuff

what's<00:06:57.949> weird<00:06:58.219> it's<00:06:58.909> completely<00:06:59.750> when<00:07:00.110> I<00:07:00.139> made

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
what's weird it's completely when I made

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.610 
what's weird it's completely when I made
it<00:07:01.009> there<00:07:01.520> were<00:07:01.669> only<00:07:01.969> two<00:07:02.900> options

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
it there were only two options

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.330 
it there were only two options
it<00:07:03.740> was<00:07:04.189> City<00:07:04.639> in<00:07:05.000> parkour<00:07:05.800> what's<00:07:06.800> the<00:07:06.979> city

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
it was City in parkour what's the city

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.850 
it was City in parkour what's the city
map<00:07:07.699> isn't<00:07:08.569> even<00:07:08.780> available<00:07:08.900> anymore

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
map isn't even available anymore

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.409 
map isn't even available anymore
so<00:07:10.219> there's<00:07:10.490> cake<00:07:10.909> defense<00:07:11.389> to<00:07:12.729> block<00:07:13.729> sources

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419 
so there's cake defense to block sources

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.279 
so there's cake defense to block sources
on<00:07:14.629> bees<00:07:15.099> walls<00:07:16.479> which<00:07:17.479> is<00:07:17.629> really<00:07:18.020> fun
