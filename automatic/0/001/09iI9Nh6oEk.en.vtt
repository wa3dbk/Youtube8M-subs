attached<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> visor<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.790> my<00:02:23.940> car<00:02:24.740> because

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
attached to the visor of my car because

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.590 
attached to the visor of my car because
you<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.040> something<00:02:26.670> going<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.060> then<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.420> want

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
you have something going on then I want

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.020 
you have something going on then I want
to<00:02:27.720> get<00:02:28.200> some<00:02:28.440> hidden<00:02:29.040> camera<00:02:29.520> footage<00:02:29.850> of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
to get some hidden camera footage of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.220 
to get some hidden camera footage of
anyway<00:02:30.960> um<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.820> these<00:02:33.000> are<00:02:33.060> really<00:02:33.420> discreet<00:02:33.960> I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
anyway um so these are really discreet I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.590 
anyway um so these are really discreet I
mean<00:02:34.950> really<00:02:35.310> no<00:02:35.670> one's<00:02:35.850> going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.090> notice<00:02:36.300> it

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
mean really no one's going to notice it

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.420 
mean really no one's going to notice it
it's<00:02:36.780> literally<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:38.250> size<00:02:38.460> of<00:02:38.790> my<00:02:38.970> thumb<00:02:39.300> so

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
it's literally the size of my thumb so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.130 
it's literally the size of my thumb so
it's<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:41.610> easy<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.060> keep<00:02:42.330> hidden<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:43.110> can

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
it's very easy to keep hidden you can

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.920 
it's very easy to keep hidden you can
you<00:02:43.830> know<00:02:43.950> stash<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.760> some<00:02:44.970> flowers<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.570> if

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
you know stash it in some flowers or if

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.050 
you know stash it in some flowers or if
you<00:02:46.320> keep<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> visor<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.340> your<00:02:47.490> car<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
you keep it on the visor of your car it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.550 
you keep it on the visor of your car it
hardly<00:02:48.660> anyone's<00:02:48.990> going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.230> notice<00:02:49.320> that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
hardly anyone's going to notice that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.080 
hardly anyone's going to notice that
it's<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.010> tiny<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.800> thing<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.790> need<00:02:53.970> to

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
it's so tiny the thing that you need to

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.160 
it's so tiny the thing that you need to
know<00:02:54.270> about<00:02:54.540> these<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.500> they<00:02:55.770> are

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
know about these is that they are

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.920 
know about these is that they are
notorious<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:59.130> get<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> lemon<00:02:59.640> about<00:03:00.540> half

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
notorious for you get a lemon about half

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.350 
notorious for you get a lemon about half
the<00:03:01.080> time<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.830> literally<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> lemon

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the time so literally this is a lemon

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.810 
the time so literally this is a lemon
and<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:04.110> one<00:03:04.260> isn't<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.400> one<00:03:05.520> doesn't

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
and that one isn't the that one doesn't

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.700 
and that one isn't the that one doesn't
that<00:03:06.060> one<00:03:06.240> does<00:03:06.450> work<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.020> this<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:07.440> doesn't

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
that one does work and this one doesn't

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.650 
that one does work and this one doesn't
work<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.670> I'm<00:03:08.760> probably<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.210> open<00:03:09.510> this

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
work so I'm probably going to open this

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.160 
work so I'm probably going to open this
up<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:11.300> try<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.360> see<00:03:12.900> if<00:03:12.990> there's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
up and and try to see if there's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.780 
up and and try to see if there's
something<00:03:13.380> loose<00:03:13.770> or<00:03:14.040> something<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:14.580> can

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
something loose or something that I can

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.730 
something loose or something that I can
diagnose<00:03:15.240> but<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.840> want<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.170> guys<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.350> see

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
diagnose but I want you guys to see

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.220 
diagnose but I want you guys to see
these<00:03:17.210> the<00:03:18.210> other<00:03:18.480> thing<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.840> need<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.080> know

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
these the other thing you need to know

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.700 
these the other thing you need to know
is<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.590> they<00:03:20.190> by<00:03:20.730> default<00:03:21.270> they<00:03:21.870> do<00:03:21.930> put<00:03:22.680> a

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
is that they by default they do put a

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.980 
is that they by default they do put a
time<00:03:23.040> stamp<00:03:23.490> on<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.150> video<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.690> you'll<00:03:24.780> have

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
time stamp on the video and you'll have

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.530 
time stamp on the video and you'll have
to<00:03:25.200> like<00:03:25.530> crop<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.190> or<00:03:26.520> edit<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.090> out<00:03:27.210> and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
to like crop that or edit it out and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.430 
to like crop that or edit it out and
they<00:03:28.500> also<00:03:28.970> there's<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.060> way<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.360> hack<00:03:30.840> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
they also there's a way to hack the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
they also there's a way to hack the
firmware<00:03:31.890> on<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.640> if<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.630> if<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.590> want<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.920> try

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
firmware on it if you if you want to try

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.000 
firmware on it if you if you want to try
it<00:03:35.490> you<00:03:35.880> can<00:03:36.030> take<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.750> EEPROM<00:03:37.650> out<00:03:37.890> of

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
it you can take the the EEPROM out of

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.360 
it you can take the the EEPROM out of
there<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.870> literally<00:03:39.890> reprogram<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.280> it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
there and literally reprogram it so it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.250 
there and literally reprogram it so it
doesn't<00:03:41.550> put<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.060> time<00:03:42.450> stamp<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.960> it<00:03:43.110> but

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
doesn't put the time stamp on it but

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.600 
doesn't put the time stamp on it but
it's<00:03:43.410> kind<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.250> process<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.590> also<00:03:46.800> set

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
it's kind of a process you can also set

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.980 
it's kind of a process you can also set
the<00:03:47.880> time<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.390> date<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.840> be

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
the time and date on it to be

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.480 
the time and date on it to be
appropriate<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.890> documentation

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
appropriate but the documentation

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.040 
appropriate but the documentation
doesn't<00:03:53.940> really<00:03:54.180> tell<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.510> how<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.720> do<00:03:54.870> that

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
doesn't really tell you how to do that

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.610 
doesn't really tell you how to do that
so<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:56.160> will<00:03:56.760> put<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.510> description<00:03:58.440> down

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
so I will put in the description down

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.000 
so I will put in the description down
there<00:03:58.680> how<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.880> worked<00:04:00.510> on<00:04:00.720> mine<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.290> if

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
there how it worked on mine and if

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.850 
there how it worked on mine and if
someone<00:04:02.340> wants<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.670> add<00:04:03.140> add<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.620> then

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
someone wants to add add to that then

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.960 
someone wants to add add to that then
they<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.150> can<00:04:07.100> put<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.250> time<00:04:08.640> stamp

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
they can but you can put the time stamp

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.270 
they can but you can put the time stamp
file<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.440> on<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:12.050> camera<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:13.260> then<00:04:13.950> it

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
file on the on the camera and then it

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.229 
file on the on the camera and then it
you<00:04:14.730> power<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.120> up<00:04:15.240> and<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.600> will<00:04:15.780> fix<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.980> time

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
you power it up and it will fix the time

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.000 
you power it up and it will fix the time
anyway<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.510> just<00:04:19.350> wanted<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.620> show<00:04:19.770> you<00:04:19.799> these

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
anyway I just wanted to show you these

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.070 
anyway I just wanted to show you these
these<00:04:20.340> are<00:04:20.580> really<00:04:20.970> cheap<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.630> they're<00:04:21.870> easy

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
these are really cheap and they're easy

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.190 
these are really cheap and they're easy
to<00:04:22.169> hide<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:24.120> can<00:04:24.300> get<00:04:24.479> some<00:04:24.750> really<00:04:24.960> nice

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
to hide and you can get some really nice

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.370 
to hide and you can get some really nice
footage<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:25.890> I<00:04:26.040> mean
