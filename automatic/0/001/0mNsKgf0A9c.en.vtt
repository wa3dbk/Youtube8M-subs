wheel length difference in size plus you
don't<00:01:03.360> really<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> body<00:01:04.259> on<00:01:04.610> but

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.390 

it's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.120> good<00:01:13.670> well<00:01:14.670> nearly<00:01:15.120> an<00:01:15.330> inch<00:01:15.479> wider

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
it's a good well nearly an inch wider

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.530 
it's a good well nearly an inch wider
I've<00:01:17.400> often<00:01:17.580> said<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.090> wheels<00:01:18.360> have

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I've often said that these wheels have

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.940 
I've often said that these wheels have
sports<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.930> an<00:01:19.020> inch<00:01:19.170> offset<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.830> should

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
sports of an inch offset so it should

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:34.210 
sports of an inch offset so it should
actually<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.280> 2<00:01:20.580> inches<00:01:20.760> wider<00:01:22.790> what<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.940> isn't

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.450 

nicely<00:01:35.240> just<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> give<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> an<00:01:36.659> idea<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.460> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
nicely just to give you an idea of the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.310 
nicely just to give you an idea of the
size<00:01:38.700> difference<00:01:39.210> between<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.020> tired

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
size difference between when it's tired

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.600 
size difference between when it's tired
out<00:01:40.619> as<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.180> now<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> mean<00:01:42.690> that<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.520> at

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
out as it is now I mean that and then at

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.149 
out as it is now I mean that and then at
the<00:01:44.700> body<00:01:44.880> from<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.180> FG<00:01:46.939> call<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> big<00:01:48.299> full

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
the body from an FG call it a big full

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
the body from an FG call it a big full
the<00:01:50.159> monster<00:01:50.520> truck<00:01:50.700> version<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.590> obviously

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the monster truck version and obviously

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.020 
the monster truck version and obviously
the<00:01:52.740> wheels<00:01:52.920> aren't<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.400> big<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:53.820> doesn't

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the wheels aren't as big and it doesn't

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.249 
the wheels aren't as big and it doesn't
sit<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.299> high<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.830> mean<00:01:56.689> it<00:01:57.689> looks<00:01:57.960> about

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
sit as high but I mean it looks about

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.260 
sit as high but I mean it looks about
with<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.830> length<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.790> extra<00:02:00.060> bit<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
with the length and the extra bit of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.870 
with the length and the extra bit of
width<00:02:00.479> actually<00:02:01.020> looks<00:02:01.200> scale<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
width actually looks scale to the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.660 
width actually looks scale to the
original<00:02:03.330> in<00:02:03.930> height<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.130> width<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.549> length

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
original in height and width and length

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.909 
original in height and width and length
and<00:02:06.119> stuff<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:09.019> I<00:02:10.019> don't<00:02:10.409> make<00:02:10.649> him<00:02:10.769> on<00:02:10.859> the

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:10.919 
and stuff and I don't make him on the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.190 
and stuff and I don't make him on the
show<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.129> sticks<00:02:11.430> out<00:02:11.579> from<00:02:11.700> underneath

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
show so sticks out from underneath

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.370 
show so sticks out from underneath
and<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:13.730> always<00:02:14.390> think<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.660> looks<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:15.050> we've

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
and I always think it looks like we've

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.559 
and I always think it looks like we've
got<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.590> wrong<00:02:15.800> body<00:02:15.980> on<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.370> won't<00:02:17.209> treat<00:02:17.450> my

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
got the wrong body on I won't treat my

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.370 
got the wrong body on I won't treat my
team<00:02:17.959> then<00:02:18.640> Traxxas<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:19.970> good<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:24.260> not

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
team then Traxxas for that good it's not

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.500 
team then Traxxas for that good it's not
just<00:02:24.560> like<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.920> original<00:02:25.340> black<00:02:25.550> body<00:02:25.819> this

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
just like the original black body this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.240 
just like the original black body this
is<00:02:26.540> really<00:02:28.600> appealing<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.750> me<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.170> think<00:02:30.380> before

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
is really appealing to me I think before

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.000 
is really appealing to me I think before
I<00:02:31.880> get<00:02:32.450> an<00:02:32.569> original<00:02:32.780> chassis<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.590> return<00:02:33.860> it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
I get an original chassis and return it

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.670 
I get an original chassis and return it
back<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.190> Emacs<00:02:34.670> sighs<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:36.380> I'm<00:02:36.560> gonna

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
back to Emacs sighs I think I'm gonna

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.290 
back to Emacs sighs I think I'm gonna
have<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.860> give<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.160> try<00:02:37.430> because<00:02:37.760> weight

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
have to give this a try because weight

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.770 
have to give this a try because weight
wise<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:39.610> with<00:02:40.610> all<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.880> nitro<00:02:41.360> engine<00:02:41.660> in

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
wise and with all the nitro engine in

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.880 
wise and with all the nitro engine in
there<00:02:42.489> this<00:02:43.489> problem<00:02:43.849> weighs<00:02:43.970> about<00:02:44.090> sin

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
there this problem weighs about sin

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.949 
there this problem weighs about sin
despite<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.069> being<00:02:46.430> bigger<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:47.209> we'll<00:02:47.750> give<00:02:47.900> it

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
despite is being bigger so we'll give it

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.890 
despite is being bigger so we'll give it

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
the 180 box Oriya now I took it out

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.699 
the 180 box Oriya now I took it out
because<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.400> thought<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.850> went<00:03:01.940> okay<00:03:02.239> but<00:03:05.709> it

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
because I thought it went okay but it

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.740 
because I thought it went okay but it
spins<00:03:07.040> freely

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
spins freely

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.030 
spins freely
there's<00:03:08.750> no<00:03:08.870> noises<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:12.380> upgrade<00:03:12.769> without

the<00:03:13.190> diffs<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.720> chassis<00:03:14.989> needs<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.950> be

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
the diffs and the chassis needs to be

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.069 
the diffs and the chassis needs to be
finished<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.329> chassis<00:03:20.600> as<00:03:20.900> it

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
finished this is the chassis as it

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.120 
finished this is the chassis as it
stands<00:03:21.560> now<00:03:22.010> I've<00:03:22.810> bolted<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:24.200> these<00:03:24.920> together

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
stands now I've bolted to these together

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.759 
stands now I've bolted to these together
I<00:03:25.519> made<00:03:25.850> another<00:03:26.299> plate<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.840> go<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.049> top<00:03:27.260> but

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
I made another plate to go the top but

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.930 
I made another plate to go the top but
it's<00:03:27.890> added<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.190> lot<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.370> weight<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.820> the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
it's added a lot of weight to the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.170 
it's added a lot of weight to the
original<00:03:29.359> design<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.820> thought<00:03:31.820> what's<00:03:32.030> to

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
original design so I thought what's to

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.220 
original design so I thought what's to
get<00:03:32.329> to<00:03:32.630> Emax<00:03:33.940> plastic<00:03:34.940> chassis<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.630> do<00:03:36.079> the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
get to Emax plastic chassis and do the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.349 
get to Emax plastic chassis and do the
same<00:03:36.410> with<00:03:36.470> all<00:03:36.769> but<00:03:37.489> as<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.700> can<00:03:37.790> see<00:03:37.850> it's

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
same with all but as you can see it's

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.390 
same with all but as you can see it's
completely<00:03:38.690> rigid<00:03:39.380> there's<00:03:39.709> no<00:03:39.829> bending<00:03:40.280> in

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
completely rigid there's no bending in

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.250 
completely rigid there's no bending in
the<00:03:40.489> middle<00:03:40.730> whatsoever<00:03:41.829> which<00:03:42.829> i<00:03:43.870> think<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.230> a

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
the middle whatsoever which i think is a

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.160 
the middle whatsoever which i think is a
good<00:03:45.440> idea<00:03:46.810> but<00:03:47.810> like<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.019> said<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:50.170> didn't

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
good idea but like I said this I didn't

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.370 
good idea but like I said this I didn't
realize<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.920> gnu<00:03:52.070> emacs<00:03:52.340> two<00:03:53.380> gearbox

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
realize that the gnu emacs two gearbox

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.069 
realize that the gnu emacs two gearbox
is<00:03:55.010> 30%<00:03:55.459> smaller<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.329> lighter<00:03:56.540> than<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
is 30% smaller and lighter than the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.920 
is 30% smaller and lighter than the
original<00:03:57.109> team<00:03:57.680> act<00:03:57.890> gearbox<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.660> doesn't

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
original team act gearbox so it doesn't

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.050 
original team act gearbox so it doesn't
quite<00:04:00.109> fit<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:01.010> original<00:04:01.400> hole<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.910> that's

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
quite fit in the original hole so that's

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.759 
quite fit in the original hole so that's
why<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.239> put<00:04:02.450> new<00:04:02.690> holes<00:04:03.049> in<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.530> sort<00:04:03.709> of

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
why I put new holes in and you sort of

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.300 
why I put new holes in and you sort of
Joe<00:04:04.489> being<00:04:04.819> I<00:04:05.060> just<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:06.049> want<00:04:06.829> it<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:07.130> look<00:04:07.250> like

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
Joe being I just I want it to look like

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.210 
Joe being I just I want it to look like
it<00:04:07.640> came<00:04:07.760> out<00:04:07.819> factor<00:04:08.269> that<00:04:08.389> way<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.069> don't

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
it came out factor that way so I don't

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.490 
it came out factor that way so I don't
know<00:04:10.579> whether<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:11.000> completely<00:04:11.660> redo<00:04:12.139> it<00:04:12.319> or

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
know whether to completely redo it or

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.879 
know whether to completely redo it or
just<00:04:13.130> get<00:04:13.250> it<00:04:13.340> running<00:04:13.639> as<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:13.940> ease<00:04:14.769> but<00:04:15.769> I'll

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
just get it running as it ease but I'll

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.219 
just get it running as it ease but I'll
need<00:04:16.039> the<00:04:16.190> bigger<00:04:16.760> more<00:04:17.030> four<00:04:17.600> stars<00:04:17.840> because

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
need the bigger more four stars because

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.320 
need the bigger more four stars because
I've<00:04:18.829> put<00:04:19.070> them<00:04:19.250> all<00:04:19.430> back<00:04:20.320> into<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.820> /<00:04:23.060> based

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
I've put them all back into the / based

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.990 
I've put them all back into the / based
one<00:04:23.630> safe<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.770> works<00:04:24.950> really<00:04:25.220> well<00:04:25.370> so

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
one safe and that works really well so

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.810 
one safe and that works really well so
don't<00:04:26.390> want<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.690> rip<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.440> apart<00:04:27.770> unless<00:04:28.640> I

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
don't want to rip that apart unless I

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.460 
don't want to rip that apart unless I
get<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:28.970> cheaper<00:04:29.330> ma<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.690> go<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.050> I<00:04:30.230> don't

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
get a cheaper ma to go in that I don't

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.260 
get a cheaper ma to go in that I don't
know<00:04:30.680> anyway<00:04:31.100> let's<00:04:31.280> ask<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.640> update<00:04:31.970> for<00:04:32.210> the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
know anyway let's ask the update for the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.020 
know anyway let's ask the update for the
week<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.780> just<00:04:33.350> needed<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.370> show<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.820> size

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
week I just needed to show you the size

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.970 
week I just needed to show you the size
difference<00:04:35.450> between<00:04:35.480> these<00:04:35.930> two<00:04:36.880> because<00:04:38.980> you

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
difference between these two because you

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.590 
difference between these two because you
can't<00:04:40.250> really<00:04:40.550> appreciate<00:04:40.700> just<00:04:41.150> how<00:04:41.270> much

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
can't really appreciate just how much

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:50.830 
can't really appreciate just how much
bigger<00:04:44.530> as<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:45.560> can<00:04:45.770> see<00:04:46.010> look<00:04:49.660> that's<00:04:50.660> the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
bigger as you can see look that's the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.550 
bigger as you can see look that's the
original<00:04:51.020> Tmax<00:04:51.970> gearbox<00:04:53.200> as<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.350> can<00:04:54.440> see

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
original Tmax gearbox as you can see

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.900 
original Tmax gearbox as you can see
it's<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.710> fairly<00:04:54.890> sizable<00:04:55.520> thing<00:04:55.670> and<00:04:55.820> that's

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
it's a fairly sizable thing and that's

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:03.040 
it's a fairly sizable thing and that's
the<00:04:58.060> Emax<00:04:59.060> gearbox<00:04:59.600> which<00:04:59.870> is<00:05:01.540> narrower<00:05:02.540> by<00:05:03.020> a

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
the Emax gearbox which is narrower by a

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.440 
the Emax gearbox which is narrower by a
lot<00:05:03.470> but<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:04.490> don't<00:05:04.580> realized<00:05:05.090> is<00:05:05.330> the

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
lot but I don't realized is the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.300 
lot but I don't realized is the
mountings<00:05:05.930> on<00:05:06.170> the<00:05:06.230> bottom<00:05:06.530> are<00:05:06.950> actually

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
mountings on the bottom are actually

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.890 
mountings on the bottom are actually
narrow<00:05:07.550> I<00:05:07.640> figured<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:08.240> just<00:05:08.390> made<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.600> fit

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
narrow I figured that just made it fit

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.960 
narrow I figured that just made it fit
the<00:05:08.990> same<00:05:09.170> hole<00:05:09.490> but<00:05:10.490> without<00:05:10.670> all<00:05:10.790> new

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
the same hole but without all new

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.040 
the same hole but without all new
chassis<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.420> guess<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.600> didn't<00:05:11.870> think<00:05:11.930> they

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
chassis I guess I didn't think they

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.840 
chassis I guess I didn't think they
needed<00:05:12.080> to<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:15.190> I'm<00:05:16.190> guessing<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.520> problem

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
needed to so I'm guessing the problem

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.010 
needed to so I'm guessing the problem
will<00:05:16.940> end<00:05:16.970> up<00:05:17.240> with<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.540> plastic<00:05:17.900> chassis

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
will end up with the plastic chassis

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:34.210 
will end up with the plastic chassis
eventually<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:32.630> gearbox<00:05:33.020> I<00:05:33.230> just<00:05:33.830> assumed

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
eventually the gearbox I just assumed

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.500 
eventually the gearbox I just assumed
they<00:05:34.340> were<00:05:34.400> identical<00:05:34.880> cuz<00:05:35.180> they<00:05:35.270> look<00:05:35.390> the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
they were identical cuz they look the

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.490 
they were identical cuz they look the
same<00:05:35.540> but<00:05:36.430> they're<00:05:37.430> not<00:05:39.430> which<00:05:40.430> surprised<00:05:40.820> me

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
same but they're not which surprised me

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.780 
same but they're not which surprised me
didn't<00:05:42.500> do<00:05:42.560> any<00:05:42.740> research<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:45.580> but<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:46.610> want

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
didn't do any research and but I want

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.030 
didn't do any research and but I want
about<00:05:46.940> two<00:05:47.000> about<00:05:47.240> one<00:05:47.419> of<00:05:47.450> these<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.919> then

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
about two about one of these and then

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.730 
about two about one of these and then
converted<00:05:49.640> to<00:05:49.669> single<00:05:50.090> speed<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:51.410> go<00:05:51.560> with<00:05:51.680> the

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
converted to single speed to go with the

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.610 
converted to single speed to go with the
brushless<00:05:51.979> and<00:05:52.870> yeah<00:05:53.870> that<00:05:54.080> was<00:05:54.110> much<00:05:54.410> more

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
brushless and yeah that was much more

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.180 
brushless and yeah that was much more
expensive<00:05:54.860> I<00:05:55.370> mean<00:05:56.260> this<00:05:57.260> gearbox<00:05:57.560> cost<00:05:58.010> me

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
expensive I mean this gearbox cost me

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.070 
expensive I mean this gearbox cost me
and<00:05:59.500> well<00:06:00.500> that<00:06:00.650> was<00:06:00.680> an<00:06:01.040> issue<00:06:01.130> actually<00:06:02.080> what

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
and well that was an issue actually what

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.760 
and well that was an issue actually what
I<00:06:03.290> live<00:06:03.560> in<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.740> UK<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:04.130> with<00:06:04.370> customs<00:06:05.770> it

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
I live in the UK and with customs it

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.420 
I live in the UK and with customs it
came<00:06:07.160> to<00:06:07.460> 75<00:06:08.150> pounds<00:06:08.590> for<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.650> gearbox<00:06:09.890> and

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
came to 75 pounds for the gearbox and

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.550 
came to 75 pounds for the gearbox and
then<00:06:10.580> because<00:06:10.850> that<00:06:10.880> came<00:06:11.240> over<00:06:11.270> 45<00:06:12.110> pounds

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
then because that came over 45 pounds

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.800 
then because that came over 45 pounds
they<00:06:12.650> charged<00:06:12.979> me<00:06:13.070> another<00:06:13.370> 20<00:06:13.640> pounds<00:06:13.760> so<00:06:14.090> it

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
they charged me another 20 pounds so it

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.700 
they charged me another 20 pounds so it
was<00:06:14.900> actually<00:06:15.460> 95<00:06:16.460> pounds<00:06:16.880> which<00:06:17.870> was<00:06:18.200> a<00:06:18.260> huge

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
was actually 95 pounds which was a huge

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.520 
was actually 95 pounds which was a huge
dent<00:06:19.160> in<00:06:19.340> my<00:06:19.550> budget<00:06:19.790> and<00:06:20.060> caused<00:06:20.390> me<00:06:20.630> well<00:06:21.290> not

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
dent in my budget and caused me well not

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.080 
dent in my budget and caused me well not
to<00:06:21.650> be<00:06:21.770> able<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:21.979> finish<00:06:22.130> the<00:06:22.310> build<00:06:22.490> as

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
to be able to finish the build as

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.230 
to be able to finish the build as
intended<00:06:23.690> but<00:06:24.490> well<00:06:25.490> there<00:06:25.790> you<00:06:25.880> go<00:06:25.910> these

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
intended but well there you go these

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.750 
intended but well there you go these
things<00:06:26.479> happen<00:06:26.810> they're<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:28.310> joys<00:06:28.550> of

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
things happen they're the joys of

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.400 
things happen they're the joys of
importing<00:06:29.419> things<00:06:29.570> from<00:06:29.810> another<00:06:29.900> country

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410

eBay or not right what goes that slots

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.650 
eBay or not right what goes that slots
in<00:06:34.849> a<00:06:34.970> lot

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
in a lot

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.900 
in a lot
it's<00:06:36.230> reasonably<00:06:37.100> tight<00:06:37.280> there's<00:06:37.670> a<00:06:37.700> little

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
it's reasonably tight there's a little

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.250 
it's reasonably tight there's a little
bit<00:06:38.030> of<00:06:38.090> a<00:06:38.120> wobble<00:06:38.300> when<00:06:38.540> the<00:06:38.630> screws<00:06:38.900> are<00:06:39.140> in

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
bit of a wobble when the screws are in

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.510 
bit of a wobble when the screws are in
it's<00:06:39.620> okay<00:06:40.100> a<00:06:41.920> hundred<00:06:42.920> percent<00:06:43.010> happy<00:06:43.190> with

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
it's okay a hundred percent happy with

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.890 
it's okay a hundred percent happy with
it<00:06:43.640> but<00:06:43.790> not<00:06:43.880> being<00:06:44.120> an<00:06:44.210> engineer<00:06:44.660> that<00:06:44.690> would

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
it but not being an engineer that would

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.500 
it but not being an engineer that would
know<00:06:45.020> we're<00:06:45.230> making<00:06:45.470> that<00:06:45.590> gearbox<00:06:45.830> fit<00:06:46.510> to

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
know we're making that gearbox fit to

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.270 
know we're making that gearbox fit to
the<00:06:47.600> standard<00:06:47.960> old<00:06:48.140> up<00:06:48.260> and<00:06:48.410> bought<00:06:48.770> eats<00:06:49.040> in

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
the standard old up and bought eats in

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.860 
the standard old up and bought eats in
and<00:06:49.550> it<00:06:49.700> works

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.540 

-<00:06:53.870> after<00:06:54.230> here<00:06:55.360> these<00:06:56.360> are<00:06:56.600> just<00:06:57.550> some

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
- after here these are just some

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.060 
- after here these are just some
aluminium<00:06:59.000> tubing<00:06:59.360> and<00:06:59.810> just<00:06:59.990> put<00:07:00.770> screws

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
aluminium tubing and just put screws

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.660 
aluminium tubing and just put screws
through<00:07:01.450> yeah<00:07:02.980> whether<00:07:03.980> that's<00:07:04.220> the<00:07:04.310> best<00:07:04.520> way

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
through yeah whether that's the best way

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.220 
through yeah whether that's the best way
to<00:07:04.700> do<00:07:04.910> it<00:07:05.000> I'm<00:07:05.090> not<00:07:05.120> but<00:07:05.510> it<00:07:05.600> worked

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
to do it I'm not but it worked

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.380 
to do it I'm not but it worked
they<00:07:06.440> didn't<00:07:06.710> Bend<00:07:06.920> twist<00:07:07.340> or<00:07:07.760> breaking

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390 
they didn't Bend twist or breaking

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.720 
they didn't Bend twist or breaking
anywhere<00:07:09.020> under<00:07:09.860> the<00:07:10.100> Lord<00:07:10.310> now<00:07:10.550> whether

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.730 
anywhere under the Lord now whether

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.980 
anywhere under the Lord now whether
they'll<00:07:10.940> do<00:07:11.060> the<00:07:11.210> same<00:07:11.240> when<00:07:11.600> I<00:07:11.630> put<00:07:11.810> a<00:07:11.840> bit

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
they'll do the same when I put a bit

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.370 
they'll do the same when I put a bit
more<00:07:12.020> in<00:07:12.200> we'll<00:07:13.010> see<00:07:13.840> but<00:07:14.840> after<00:07:15.020> bad<00:07:15.170> a<00:07:15.200> big

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
more in we'll see but after bad a big

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.830 
more in we'll see but after bad a big
mark<00:07:15.560> first<00:07:16.120> get<00:07:17.120> all<00:07:17.240> the<00:07:17.330> little<00:07:17.570> niggles

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
mark first get all the little niggles

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.020 
mark first get all the little niggles
first<00:07:18.080> out<00:07:19.070> of<00:07:19.160> the<00:07:19.250> way<00:07:19.370> so<00:07:19.610> that<00:07:19.640> when<00:07:19.790> I<00:07:19.850> get

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
first out of the way so that when I get

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.630 
first out of the way so that when I get
the<00:07:20.120> big<00:07:20.270> more<00:07:20.480> it's<00:07:21.470> ready<00:07:21.800> to<00:07:21.830> just<00:07:22.070> bolt<00:07:22.370> and
