taste<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.140> caramel<00:00:59.470> in<00:00:59.710> it<00:00:59.830> it<00:00:59.980> just<00:01:00.160> tastes

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
taste the caramel in it it just tastes

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.369 
taste the caramel in it it just tastes
like<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.640> hot<00:01:00.970> apple<00:01:01.300> that's<00:01:01.870> what<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.230> tastes

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
like a hot apple that's what it tastes

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.390 
like a hot apple that's what it tastes
like<00:01:02.559> hot<00:01:02.769> liquid<00:01:03.160> apple<00:01:04.740> but<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:05.979> really

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
like hot liquid apple but it is really

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.950 
like hot liquid apple but it is really
good<00:01:06.550> probably<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.149> lot<00:01:07.330> better<00:01:07.509> with<00:01:07.720> whipped

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
good probably a lot better with whipped

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.600 
good probably a lot better with whipped
cream<00:01:08.050> because<00:01:08.410> I'm<00:01:08.560> guessing<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.430> whipped

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
cream because I'm guessing the whipped

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.070 
cream because I'm guessing the whipped
cream<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:09.970> know<00:01:10.149> provides<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.570> sweetness<00:01:11.020> that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
cream you know provides a sweetness that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.930 
cream you know provides a sweetness that
counterbalance<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:11.979> kind<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.369> tart<00:01:12.580> apple

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
counterbalance is kind of the tart apple

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.389 
counterbalance is kind of the tart apple
taste<00:01:13.090> probably<00:01:13.810> much<00:01:13.960> better<00:01:13.990> with<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.470> but

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
taste probably much better with that but

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.249 
taste probably much better with that but
even<00:01:15.640> without<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.030> whipped<00:01:16.360> cream<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.810> like<00:01:17.110> it

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
even without a whipped cream I like it

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.130 
even without a whipped cream I like it
so<00:01:17.800> that<00:01:18.040> says<00:01:18.280> something<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.600> normally<00:01:20.110> a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
so that says something it is normally a

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.109 
so that says something it is normally a
hot<00:01:20.350> drink<00:01:20.590> obviously<00:01:21.190> I<00:01:21.399> don't<00:01:21.640> know<00:01:21.850> how<00:01:22.000> it

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
hot drink obviously I don't know how it

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.150 
hot drink obviously I don't know how it
would<00:01:22.210> be<00:01:22.330> iced<00:01:22.590> probably<00:01:23.590> be<00:01:23.740> kind<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.979> weird

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
would be iced probably be kind of weird

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.859
