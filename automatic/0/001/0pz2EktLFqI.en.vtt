there and then putting it on found the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
there and then putting it on found the
best<00:01:28.020> way<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.590> button<00:01:28.920> side<00:01:29.220> first<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
best way is to go button side first and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.359 
best way is to go button side first and
then<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.329> pop<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.619> so

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
then just pop it on and there you go so

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.789 
then just pop it on and there you go so
you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> back<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.380> the

microphone the belkin name is embossed
there<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> top<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.689> pretty<00:01:48.840> subtle

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
there on the top but it's pretty subtle

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.660 
there on the top but it's pretty subtle
you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> doesn't<00:01:49.890> stand<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.280> too<00:01:50.460> badly

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
you know it doesn't stand out too badly

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
you know it doesn't stand out too badly
on<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.119> front<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> nice<00:01:52.530> amount<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
on the front you get a nice amount of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.950 
on the front you get a nice amount of

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.260 
lay on the table design the edge of this
case<00:01:55.200> does<00:01:55.470> come<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.890> over<00:01:56.100> onto<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> glass<00:01:56.700> so

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
case does come up over onto the glass so

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.389

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you can lay it down screen side first on

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.050 
you can lay it down screen side first on
the<00:02:00.329> bottom<00:02:00.570> there's<00:02:01.409> two<00:02:01.829> cutouts<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.729> for

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
headset jack now it's a little bit loose

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
or weak point on this case is this low

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.430

wedge<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.209> runs<00:02:15.390> along<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.720> bottom<00:02:16.020> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
wedge that runs along the bottom and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.410 
wedge that runs along the bottom and
I've<00:02:16.770> found<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.520> be<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> case<00:02:17.730> with<00:02:18.060> most

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
I've found that to be the case with most

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.199 
I've found that to be the case with most
cases<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.410> ipod<00:02:19.709> touch<00:02:19.980> because<00:02:20.700> all<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
cases for the ipod touch because all the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.180 
cases for the ipod touch because all the
ports<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.599> whatnot<00:02:21.930> are<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.319> bottom<00:02:22.680> but

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
ports and whatnot are on the bottom but

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.350 
ports and whatnot are on the bottom but
it's<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.370> little<00:02:23.459> bit<00:02:23.640> flimsy<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.239> have

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
it's a little bit flimsy you just have

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.420 
it's a little bit flimsy you just have
to<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.569> careful<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.080> there<00:02:25.530> as<00:02:26.130> far<00:02:26.310> as

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
to be careful with that there as far as

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.830 
to be careful with that there as far as
the<00:02:26.580> volume<00:02:26.910> buttons<00:02:27.209> go<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.690> see

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the volume buttons go you can see

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.270 
the volume buttons go you can see
they're<00:02:27.989> covered<00:02:28.410> there<00:02:28.590> by<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.800> case<00:02:29.069> but

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
they're covered there by the case but

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.500 
they're covered there by the case but
they<00:02:29.340> give<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.550> nice<00:02:29.730> feedback<00:02:30.060> when<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
they give you nice feedback when you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.570 
they give you nice feedback when you
press<00:02:30.720> them<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.800> top<00:02:31.980> same<00:02:32.370> goes

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
press them and then on the top same goes

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.340 
press them and then on the top same goes
for<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.760> sleep/wake<00:02:33.239> button<00:02:33.270> it's<00:02:34.050> covered

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
for the sleep/wake button it's covered

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.540 
for the sleep/wake button it's covered
by<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.530> case<00:02:34.739> but<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.100> gives<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.310> good

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
by the case but it gives you good

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.760 
by the case but it gives you good
feedback<00:02:36.060> when<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.300> press<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.600> as<00:02:36.840> well<00:02:37.080> so

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
feedback when you press it as well so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.320 
feedback when you press it as well so
I'm<00:02:37.920> really<00:02:38.100> enjoying<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.670> case<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.180> been

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
I'm really enjoying this case it's been

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.210 
I'm really enjoying this case it's been
kind<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.630> my<00:02:39.780> case<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.230> choice<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.680> lakes<00:02:40.920> the

kind of my case of choice of lakes the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920 
kind of my case of choice of lakes the
one<00:02:41.340> I've<00:02:41.459> been<00:02:41.489> using<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:42.360> offers<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.750> nice

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
one I've been using it offers a nice

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170 
one I've been using it offers a nice
amount<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:44.040> know<00:02:44.069> slimness<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.910> doesn't

amount of you know slimness it doesn't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.970 
amount of you know slimness it doesn't
add<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.269> lot<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.510> bulk<00:02:45.840> again<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.500> allows<00:02:46.739> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
add a lot of bulk again it allows the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
add a lot of bulk again it allows the

Apple information to shine through which

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.690 
Apple information to shine through which
I<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.170> comes<00:02:49.800> in<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.980> variety<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.340> colors

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
I like comes in a variety of colors

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.270 
I like comes in a variety of colors
which<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.060> good<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.450> at<00:02:51.870> 2999<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
which is good and at 2999 it's not the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.949 
which is good and at 2999 it's not the
cheapest<00:02:53.700> case<00:02:53.880> around<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.330> your<00:02:54.420> ipod<00:02:54.690> touch

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
cheapest case around for your ipod touch

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.680 
cheapest case around for your ipod touch
but<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.560> do<00:02:55.680> think<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.190> worth<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.459> price<00:02:57.330> tag

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
but I do think it's worth the price tag

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.509 
but I do think it's worth the price tag
if<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.560> any<00:02:58.709> questions<00:02:59.130> about<00:02:59.250> this
