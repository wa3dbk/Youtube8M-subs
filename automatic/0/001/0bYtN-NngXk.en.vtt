00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
multi-tool the Leatherman skeletal this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.480 
multi-tool the Leatherman skeletal this
is<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.630> carbon<00:00:15.630> fiber<00:00:15.870> version<00:00:16.199> which<00:00:16.680> really

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
is the carbon fiber version which really

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.710 
is the carbon fiber version which really
the<00:00:17.609> only<00:00:17.699> difference<00:00:18.090> between<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.390> carbon

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the only difference between the carbon

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.910 
the only difference between the carbon
fiber<00:00:18.930> version<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.640> non<00:00:21.650> carbon<00:00:22.650> fiber

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
fiber version and the non carbon fiber

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.550 
fiber version and the non carbon fiber
version<00:00:24.470> is<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:27.320> carbon<00:00:28.320> fiber

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
version is this little carbon fiber

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.679 
version is this little carbon fiber
insert<00:00:29.010> right<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> other<00:00:30.359> version

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
insert right here on the other version

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.410 
insert right here on the other version
this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.929> kind<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.850> stainless<00:00:32.850> steel<00:00:33.059> thing

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
this is kind of stainless steel thing

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.880 
this is kind of stainless steel thing
like<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.690> would<00:00:34.530> also<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
like that would also be up here and

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.790 
like that would also be up here and
blade<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.500> partially<00:00:40.500> serrated

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
blade on this one is partially serrated

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.920 
blade on this one is partially serrated
and<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.399> made<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.870> 154cm<00:00:42.870> steel<00:00:44.690> whereas<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and it's made of 154cm steel whereas the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.420 
and it's made of 154cm steel whereas the
one<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.829> non<00:00:47.039> carbon<00:00:47.700> fiber<00:00:48.000> version<00:00:49.430> it's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
one on the non carbon fiber version it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.979 
one on the non carbon fiber version it's
just<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.730> flat<00:00:51.000> grind<00:00:52.190> non-serrated<00:00:53.190> blade<00:00:53.989> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
just a flat grind non-serrated blade and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.310 
just a flat grind non-serrated blade and
I<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> steel<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.780> some<00:00:57.780> form<00:00:58.140> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
I think the steel is some form of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.529 
I think the steel is some form of
stainless<00:00:58.770> 440<00:00:59.640> stainless<00:00:59.699> or<00:01:00.270> something

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
stainless 440 stainless or something

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
stainless 440 stainless or something
like<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.370> of<00:01:02.370> course<00:01:02.550> doesn't<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.969> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
like that of course doesn't have this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.960 
like that of course doesn't have this
kind<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.530> coated<00:01:04.530> finish<00:01:04.860> either<00:01:05.369> which

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
kind of coated finish either which

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.000 
kind of coated finish either which
really<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.140> reason<00:01:07.380> why<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> got<00:01:07.799> this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
really has some in reason why I got this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.410 
really has some in reason why I got this
one<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.340> because<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> way<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
one is because I like the way that it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.880 
one is because I like the way that it
looks<00:01:10.250> anyway<00:01:11.270> as<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.630> pretty<00:01:13.530> small

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
looks anyway as you can see pretty small

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
looks anyway as you can see pretty small
not<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> big<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.420> heavier<00:01:15.750> than

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
not for a big it's a little heavier than

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.219 
not for a big it's a little heavier than
like<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> juice<00:01:17.180> s2<00:01:18.180> or<00:01:18.479> something<00:01:18.750> else<00:01:19.020> from

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
like a juice s2 or something else from

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.460 
like a juice s2 or something else from
other<00:01:19.439> men<00:01:19.619> definitely<00:01:19.860> much<00:01:20.250> bigger<00:01:20.520> than<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
other men definitely much bigger than a

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
other men definitely much bigger than a
Leatherman<00:01:22.470> Micra<00:01:23.330> but<00:01:26.090> nice<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.210> blades<00:01:27.450> on

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
Leatherman Micra but nice to blades on

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.330 
Leatherman Micra but nice to blades on
the<00:01:27.659> outside<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.380> he<00:01:28.500> had<00:01:28.590> opening<00:01:28.979> nice

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the outside one he had opening nice

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.359 
the outside one he had opening nice
positive<00:01:29.850> liner<00:01:30.570> lock<00:01:30.920> nice<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.130> strong

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
positive liner lock nice and strong

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.240 
positive liner lock nice and strong
there<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> lot<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.079> blade<00:01:34.560> play<00:01:34.920> which

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
there is not a lot of blade play which

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.130 
there is not a lot of blade play which
is<00:01:35.280> excellent

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
is excellent

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.149 
is excellent
most<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> Leatherman<00:01:37.590> line<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.009> pretty

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
most of the Leatherman line is pretty

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.920 
most of the Leatherman line is pretty
good<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> got<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.490> blade

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
good with that so you got your blade

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.139 
good with that so you got your blade
you've<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.290> kind<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.649> clip<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.820> which

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you've got this kind of clip here which

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.880 
you've got this kind of clip here which
you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> use<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.170> carabiner<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> clip

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you can use as a carabiner to clip

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.230 
you can use as a carabiner to clip
another<00:01:47.100> pack<00:01:47.310> or<00:01:47.490> something<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
another pack or something like that I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.899 
another pack or something like that I
just<00:01:48.930> use<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.259> belt<00:01:49.470> clip<00:01:49.670> where<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.850> my

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
just use the belt clip where it in my

just use the belt clip where it in my
pocket<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.990> thing<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
pocket I thing about this is that you

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.730 
pocket I thing about this is that you
know<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> guess<00:01:54.689> pretend<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:57.740> your

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
know I guess pretend that's like a your

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530 
know I guess pretend that's like a your
bottle<00:01:58.979> cap<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.310> something<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.850> this

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
bottle cap or something like that this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.569 
bottle cap or something like that this
serves<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.140> bottle<00:02:01.409> opener<00:02:01.500> which<00:02:01.920> really

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
serves as a bottle opener which really

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.120 
serves as a bottle opener which really
works<00:02:02.939> well<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.590> kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.740> nice<00:02:04.860> always
