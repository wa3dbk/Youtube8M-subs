 while to burst 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.350
 for the entire universe 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.690
 to my parents 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.340
 the moments that we have spent together that 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.620

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.050
 hell is destroyed and is that the past 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.780
 days worth as everyone feels that 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.090
 often deep down my joys do not 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.460

 in love listened to detractors and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.260
 reasons they have left me are things that 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.540
 we have spent more or less all and the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.540
 jobs or two careers in another period

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.800
 arra measures mean I do not care 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.980

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.949
