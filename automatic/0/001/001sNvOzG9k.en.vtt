00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
okay we're looking at a GE range we're

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.040 
okay we're looking at a GE range we're
gonna<00:00:10.890> replace<00:00:11.280> both<00:00:11.820> fronts<00:00:12.450> infinite

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
gonna replace both fronts infinite

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.920 
gonna replace both fronts infinite
switches<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:14.100> this<00:00:14.250> one<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.580> here<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.210> this

just gonna remove that's the knobs off
of<00:00:23.490> each<00:00:23.640> switch<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.270> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.539> working

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
of each switch I'm going to be working

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
of each switch I'm going to be working
on<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.920> helps<00:00:26.130> me<00:00:26.190> so<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> don't

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
on it just helps me so I don't

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.279 
on it just helps me so I don't
accidentally<00:00:27.029> replace<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> wrong<00:00:27.990> switch

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
accidentally replace the wrong switch

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.420 
accidentally replace the wrong switch
because<00:00:28.440> they<00:00:28.590> all<00:00:28.710> look<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> same<00:00:29.130> every

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
because they all look the same every

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.730 
because they all look the same every
time<00:00:29.750> so<00:00:30.750> from<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.170> we're<00:00:31.320> gonna<00:00:31.380> pull<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
time so from here we're gonna pull the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.830 
time so from here we're gonna pull the
range<00:00:31.949> out<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.580> back<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.780> get

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
range out get to the back so we can get

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.100 
range out get to the back so we can get
to<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> wiring

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
to the wiring

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.720 
to the wiring
okay<00:00:37.140> we've<00:00:37.710> already<00:00:37.890> unplugged<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> unit

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
okay we've already unplugged the unit

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.069 
okay we've already unplugged the unit
obviously<00:00:38.850> we're<00:00:39.239> behind<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> we're<00:00:39.809> gonna<00:00:39.899> go

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
obviously we're behind it we're gonna go

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
obviously we're behind it we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.230> remove<00:00:40.380> our<00:00:40.680> panel<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> access<00:00:41.220> our

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
ahead and remove our panel to access our

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.150 
ahead and remove our panel to access our
console<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.380> it's<00:00:43.530> held<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.710> place<00:00:43.770> with<00:00:44.130> some

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
is I'm gonna go around to the front and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.780 
is I'm gonna go around to the front and
then<00:01:28.520> unmount<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.350> switches<00:01:31.350> from<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> front

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
then unmount the switches from the front

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.230 
then unmount the switches from the front
each<00:01:34.790> switch<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.390> held<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:35.690> place<00:01:35.810> with<00:01:35.930> two

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
each switch is held in place with two

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.800 
each switch is held in place with two
Phillips<00:01:38.240> screws

Phillips screws

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.360 
Phillips screws
we're<00:01:39.470> just<00:01:39.620> gonna<00:01:39.710> take<00:01:39.980> them<00:01:40.130> out<00:01:40.190> they're

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
we're just gonna take them out they're

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.320 
we're just gonna take them out they're
very<00:01:40.550> small<00:01:40.850> easy<00:01:41.120> to<00:01:41.300> drop<00:01:45.850> do<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.940> same<00:01:47.150> for

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
very small easy to drop do the same for

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and then now we can go back to the back

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.950 
and then now we can go back to the back
to<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.510> unit<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.110> replace<00:02:01.680> our<00:02:01.830> switches

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
to the unit to replace our switches

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.620 
to the unit to replace our switches
okay<00:02:04.650> so<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.610> our<00:02:05.640> new<00:02:05.910> switches<00:02:06.210> here

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
okay so we have our new switches here

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.090 
okay so we have our new switches here
I'm<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.650> gonna<00:02:07.800> pull<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.369> old<00:02:09.360> switch<00:02:09.720> out

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
I'm just gonna pull the old switch out

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.800 
I'm just gonna pull the old switch out
and<00:02:11.100> what<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.940> do<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.630> look

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and what I have to do is I have to look

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.960 
and what I have to do is I have to look
at<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.980> actual<00:02:14.390> each<00:02:15.390> terminal<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.200> labeled

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
at the actual each terminal is labeled

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.120 
at the actual each terminal is labeled
and<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.360> same<00:02:18.570> on<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> new<00:02:18.960> one<00:02:19.170> now<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.860> lot<00:02:20.100> of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
and the same on the new one now a lot of

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.210 
and the same on the new one now a lot of
the<00:02:20.250> times<00:02:20.459> they'll<00:02:20.670> switch<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:22.410> terminal

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the times they'll switch the terminal

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.830 
the times they'll switch the terminal
location<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.240> have<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.540> pay<00:02:24.810> close

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
location so we have to pay close

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.270 
location so we have to pay close
attention<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.800> make<00:02:26.490> sure<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.060> get<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
attention to make sure that we get the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.710 
attention to make sure that we get the
right

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
right

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
right
while<00:02:31.590> you're<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> right<00:02:32.160> spot<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.730> can't

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
while you're in the right spot you can't

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.450 
while you're in the right spot you can't
just<00:02:33.240> go<00:02:33.420> into<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.500> same<00:02:34.710> location<00:02:34.860> because

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
just go into the same location because

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.840 
just go into the same location because
like<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> said<00:02:35.730> they<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.090> change<00:02:37.610> right<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.760> we

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
like I said they will change right so we

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.070 
like I said they will change right so we
got<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.180> one<00:02:39.360> done<00:02:39.510> we're<00:02:39.720> gonna<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:39.960> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
got that one done we're gonna do the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.230 
got that one done we're gonna do the
exact<00:02:40.380> same<00:02:40.410> thing<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.610> other<00:02:41.640> one<00:02:42.000> over

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
exact same thing on the other one over

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.940 
exact same thing on the other one over
here<00:02:47.930> now<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:48.990> can<00:02:49.260> go<00:02:49.380> around<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.920> front

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
here now we can go around to the front

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.920 
here now we can go around to the front
and<00:02:50.810> fasten<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.930> switches<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:52.470> place<00:02:53.930> all

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
and fasten the switches in place all

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.270 
and fasten the switches in place all
right<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.350> we're<00:02:55.470> gonna<00:02:55.560> go<00:02:55.740> ahead<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.040> mount

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
right so we're gonna go ahead and mount

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.750 
right so we're gonna go ahead and mount
our<00:02:56.490> switch<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.570> position<00:02:58.490> just<00:02:59.490> going<00:02:59.670> to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
our switch in position just going to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:09.170 
our switch in position just going to
slide<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.210> into<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:02.150> wall<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.640> as<00:03:09.030> you

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
slide it into the wall here and as you

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.090 
slide it into the wall here and as you
can<00:03:09.300> see<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.870> shaft<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> lot<00:03:10.709> longer<00:03:10.890> than

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
can see the shaft is a lot longer than

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.430 
can see the shaft is a lot longer than
what<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.459> need<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:12.440> universal

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
what we need it's a universal

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.680 
what we need it's a universal
replacement<00:03:14.040> switch<00:03:14.280> because<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.360> age<00:03:15.510> of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
replacement switch because of the age of

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.740 
replacement switch because of the age of
it<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.700> once<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.330> knob<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
it so once we get the knob and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.660 
it so once we get the knob and
everything<00:03:19.080> here<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.740> will<00:03:19.950> snap<00:03:20.190> off<00:03:20.459> at

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
everything here we can will snap off at

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.310 
everything here we can will snap off at
the<00:03:20.790> right<00:03:20.940> length<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.690> make<00:03:21.840> sure<00:03:21.990> it<00:03:22.110> fits

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
the right length to make sure it fits

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.960 
the right length to make sure it fits
properly<00:03:22.410> we're<00:03:23.340> gonna<00:03:23.459> do<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> same<00:03:23.910> thing

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
properly we're gonna do the same thing

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.400 
properly we're gonna do the same thing
on<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.480> right<00:03:25.050> side<00:03:25.800> here<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.280> secure<00:03:26.670> our

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
on the right side here to secure our

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:38.339 
on the right side here to secure our
switch

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.180 

so<00:03:39.349> that's<00:03:39.560> in<00:03:39.769> there<00:03:39.920> now<00:03:40.750> what<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:42.050> will<00:03:42.920> do<00:03:43.069> at

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
so that's in there now what I will do at

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.839 
so that's in there now what I will do at
this<00:03:43.310> point<00:03:43.580> is<00:03:44.830> we'll<00:03:45.830> just<00:03:46.010> go<00:03:46.160> ahead<00:03:46.280> and

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
this point is we'll just go ahead and

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.119 
this point is we'll just go ahead and
test<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.599> switch<00:03:47.870> now<00:03:47.900> before<00:03:48.739> we<00:03:48.830> get<00:03:48.920> too

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
test the switch now before we get too

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.400 
test the switch now before we get too
far<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.840> make<00:03:50.840> sure<00:03:50.989> everything's<00:03:51.290> gonna

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
far and make sure everything's gonna

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.780 
far and make sure everything's gonna
work<00:03:51.500> properly<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.130> I'm<00:03:52.280> gonna<00:03:52.370> go<00:03:52.519> ahead<00:03:52.640> and

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
work properly so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.940 
work properly so I'm gonna go ahead and
plug<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.150> range<00:03:53.360> in<00:03:53.599> turn<00:03:54.410> on<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.680> burners

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
plug the range in turn on the burners

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.190 
plug the range in turn on the burners
make<00:03:55.190> sure<00:03:55.310> they<00:03:55.430> want<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.700> heat<00:03:55.819> up<00:03:56.140> okay<00:03:57.140> so

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
make sure they want to heat up okay so

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.750 
make sure they want to heat up okay so
we<00:03:57.410> have<00:03:57.530> power<00:03:57.709> into<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.160> unit<00:03:58.430> we're<00:03:58.610> just

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
we have power into the unit we're just

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.920 
we have power into the unit we're just
gonna<00:03:58.849> go<00:03:59.000> ahead<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.150> turn<00:03:59.330> it<00:03:59.450> out<00:03:59.510> we<00:03:59.900> have

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
gonna go ahead and turn it out we have

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.539 
gonna go ahead and turn it out we have
our<00:04:00.019> service<00:04:00.470> element<00:04:00.890> like<00:04:01.069> that<00:04:01.310> is

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
our service element like that is

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.240 
our service element like that is
illuminating<00:04:02.209> now<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:03.319> was<00:04:03.530> not<00:04:03.769> doing<00:04:03.980> that

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
illuminating now it was not doing that

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.789

tighten up the back panel here so what
we<00:05:03.430> have<00:05:03.580> here<00:05:03.820> we<00:05:04.060> we<00:05:04.420> have<00:05:04.600> our<00:05:04.720> shaft<00:05:04.990> here<00:05:05.290> I

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
we have here we we have our shaft here I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.490 
we have here we we have our shaft here I
looked<00:05:07.420> at<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.630> one<00:05:07.750> next<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:08.170> it's<00:05:08.410> a

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
looked at the one next to it it's a

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.830 
looked at the one next to it it's a
replacement<00:05:08.890> there<00:05:09.310> are<00:05:09.430> five<00:05:09.700> cubes<00:05:10.450> on<00:05:10.690> this

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
replacement there are five cubes on this

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.620 
replacement there are five cubes on this
one<00:05:11.160> we'll<00:05:12.160> say<00:05:12.310> that<00:05:12.520> each<00:05:12.700> little<00:05:12.970> segment

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
one we'll say that each little segment

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.830 
one we'll say that each little segment
is<00:05:13.840> like<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:13.990> caterpillar<00:05:14.290> body<00:05:14.770> or<00:05:15.040> something

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
is like a caterpillar body or something

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.810 
is like a caterpillar body or something
so<00:05:16.840> we<00:05:16.990> need<00:05:17.170> to<00:05:17.260> make<00:05:17.410> this<00:05:17.590> one<00:05:17.800> five<00:05:18.130> as<00:05:18.340> well

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
so we need to make this one five as well

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.390 
so we need to make this one five as well
so<00:05:19.360> there<00:05:19.540> we've<00:05:19.780> got<00:05:19.810> one<00:05:20.170> two<00:05:20.500> three<00:05:20.770> four

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
so there we've got one two three four

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
so there we've got one two three four
five<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:24.280> I'm<00:05:24.520> gonna<00:05:24.610> count<00:05:24.850> again<00:05:25.150> just<00:05:25.330> to

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420
