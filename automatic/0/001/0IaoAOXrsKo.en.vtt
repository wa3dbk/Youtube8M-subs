00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.380
 hi guys blessings to everyone in this 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.080
 video we will show you various types of 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.300
 dribbling to show off to our opponent 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.700
 [Music] 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.220
 in this story what is done is to pass 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.530
 the ball from one side to another and with the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.869
 inner edge of the opposite foot pulls 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.689
 in order to pass the opponent we do not leave 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.910
 The escape of the ball is an art of 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.370
 medium high level that needs very good 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.860
 technique but it's very good for fingers 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.340
 center our opponent and pass it 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.309
 [Music] 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.400
 in this second dribble a mini is made 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.870
 bicycle with the least skillful leg 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.910
 followed by a little touch of your leg 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.550
 will come out with the internal board of the foot 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.120
 to be able to make a joint advance to 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.120
 contrary 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.079
 this dribble is a little less complicated 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.820
 of a medium low level but that there is 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.449
 that the Arabs try to make their 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.449
 perfection 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.690
 in this hill wheel of the ball with the 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.420
 more skillful foot forward 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.450
 and will slow with the sole less 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.980
 skillful and then this will be shot for the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.980
 opposite side where the ball went 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.840
 [Music] 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.509
 Y 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.510
 it's a relevant one that needs to have good 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.589
 synchronization at the time of doing it 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.589
 [Music] 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.370
 in this low medium level and help 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.990
 very much to destabilize your 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.470
 opponent 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.620
 [Music] 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.560
 this really is one of the simplest 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.990
 you just make a bicycle with the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.620
 less skillful leg and roll the ball with 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.650
 the most skillful leg to make him finish 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.960
 [Music] 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.060
 these reals that will be seen below 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.910
 they are the combination of dribbles 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.410
 previous is simply a matter 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.000
 of creativity and the style that you put 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.000
 [Music] 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.760
 double ribbons endorsement ribbons 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.790
 etcetera the most important thing is that you 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.400
 goals your own styled play these 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.280
 combinations are a little more complex 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.310
 but the constant practice of chin-ups 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.400
 and there will be no rival who can beat you 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.400
 [Music] 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.139
 [Music] 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.000
