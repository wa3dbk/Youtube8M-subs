with the hardware and design you got two

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.790 
with the hardware and design you got two
devices<00:00:13.980> very<00:00:14.309> similar<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.410> you<00:00:16.410> know<00:00:16.529> from<00:00:16.710> an

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
devices very similar in you know from an

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
devices very similar in you know from an
aspect<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.369> kind<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> form<00:00:18.270> factor<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:18.900> they

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
aspect of kind of a form factor out they

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.529 
aspect of kind of a form factor out they
kind<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.289> feel<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> hand<00:00:20.420> because<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
kind of feel in the hand because the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.390 
kind of feel in the hand because the
size<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:22.289> there's<00:00:22.710> somewhat<00:00:23.039> similar<00:00:23.369> in

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
size there there's somewhat similar in

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.099 
size there there's somewhat similar in
size<00:00:23.699> now<00:00:23.939> obviously<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> Lumia<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.810> much

size now obviously the Lumia is much

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.460 
size now obviously the Lumia is much
heavier<00:00:26.359> too<00:00:27.359> compared<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> BlackBerry

heavier too compared to the BlackBerry

dimensions and there's not much
the<00:00:32.910> Lumia<00:00:33.149> isn't<00:00:33.420> much<00:00:33.540> bigger<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.110> far<00:00:34.380> as

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you hold the back button and that's how

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.459 
you hold the back button and that's how
you<00:01:57.060> bring<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> multitasking<00:01:58.170> window

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
you bring up the multitasking window

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.359 
you bring up the multitasking window
although<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.890> cannot<00:01:59.399> close<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.479> any<00:02:00.890> of<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
although you cannot close out any of the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.609 
although you cannot close out any of the
apps<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.000> whereas<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> z10<00:02:04.409> when

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
apps that way whereas on the z10 when

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.550 
apps that way whereas on the z10 when
you<00:02:04.710> swipe<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:07.049> close<00:02:07.350> out

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
you swipe up you can close out

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.779 
you swipe up you can close out
applications<00:02:08.129> running<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> background

applications running in the background

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.250

so<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.360> definitely<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:10.020> thing<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.470> notice

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
so that's definitely one thing to notice

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.650 
so that's definitely one thing to notice
performance-wise<00:02:12.220> they<00:02:12.700> both<00:02:12.940> perform<00:02:13.390> very

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
performance-wise they both perform very

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.660 
performance-wise they both perform very
well<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.170> don't<00:02:14.350> really<00:02:14.560> notice<00:02:14.890> any<00:02:15.310> major

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
well I don't really notice any major

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.990 
well I don't really notice any major
difference<00:02:16.180> between<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.660> two<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:17.050> far<00:02:17.290> as

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
difference between the two as far as

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.520 
difference between the two as far as
speed<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.330> most<00:02:19.540> part<00:02:19.810> we're<00:02:20.080> gonna<00:02:20.230> go

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
speed for the most part we're gonna go

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.340 
speed for the most part we're gonna go
let's<00:02:21.490> try<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.760> site<00:02:22.300> let's<00:02:22.960> see

it all may have to put dot-com in which

it all may have to put dot-com in which

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.580 

actually<00:02:52.390> thinks<00:02:52.840> for<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.050> little<00:02:53.290> unfair

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590

the screen size you could tell the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.500 
the screen size you could tell the
difference<00:03:09.160> there<00:03:09.640> but<00:03:09.850> let's<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.090> click<00:03:10.330> on

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
difference there but let's just click on

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.350 

seems<00:03:30.340> like<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.579> Lumia<00:03:30.879> is<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.030> little<00:03:31.239> bit

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
seems like the Lumia is a little bit

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.089 
seems like the Lumia is a little bit
faster<00:03:31.930> than<00:03:32.409> bringing<00:03:32.650> up<00:03:32.799> some<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.040> the

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
faster than bringing up some of the

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.490 
faster than bringing up some of the
pages<00:03:36.269> in<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.329> z10<00:03:37.870> but<00:03:38.049> overall<00:03:38.379> pretty

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
pages in the z10 but overall pretty

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.280 
pages in the z10 but overall pretty
pretty<00:03:39.340> similar<00:03:39.819> acceptable<00:03:40.659> performance<00:03:40.810> on

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
pretty similar acceptable performance on

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.280 
pretty similar acceptable performance on
both<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.829> do<00:03:42.670> tend<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.750> screen<00:03:44.079> on<00:03:44.260> the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
both I do tend to like the screen on the

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.949 
both I do tend to like the screen on the
Lumia<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.739> little<00:03:44.980> bit<00:03:45.069> better<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.930> know

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
Lumia a little bit better and you know

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.390 
Lumia a little bit better and you know
that's<00:03:47.200> definitely<00:03:47.409> one<00:03:47.769> thing<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.099> think<00:03:48.159> that

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that's definitely one thing I think that

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.190 
that's definitely one thing I think that
gives<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.819> a<00:03:48.879> little<00:03:49.000> bit<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.510> edge<00:03:49.930> as<00:03:50.170> far

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
gives it a little bit of a edge as far

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.229 
gives it a little bit of a edge as far
that<00:03:50.590> but<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:50.799> is<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.099> much<00:03:51.340> heavier<00:03:51.549> device<00:03:52.000> I

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
that but this is a much heavier device I

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.449 
that but this is a much heavier device I
you<00:03:52.599> definitely<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.379> definitely<00:03:53.920> suggest

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
you definitely I definitely suggest

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.759 
you definitely I definitely suggest
picking<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.180> Lumia<00:03:55.510> up<00:03:55.720> even<00:03:56.140> if<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.349> have<00:03:56.560> it

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
picking the Lumia up even if you have it

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.520 
picking the Lumia up even if you have it
just<00:03:56.939> to<00:03:57.939> feel<00:03:58.180> out<00:03:58.299> heavy<00:03:58.540> it's<00:03:59.079> definitely<00:03:59.500> a

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
just to feel out heavy it's definitely a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.129 
just to feel out heavy it's definitely a
tank<00:03:59.890> but<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.760> could<00:04:01.120> take<00:04:01.269> some<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:02.019> know

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
tank but it could take some you know

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.960 
tank but it could take some you know
drops<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.799> so<00:04:02.920> forth<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.340> that's<00:04:03.459> definitely

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
drops and so forth so that's definitely

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.750 
drops and so forth so that's definitely
something<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.329> be<00:04:04.359> aware<00:04:04.659> of<00:04:04.739> camera<00:04:05.739> is<00:04:06.639> that

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
something to be aware of camera is that

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.970 
something to be aware of camera is that
I<00:04:07.209> don't<00:04:07.480> think<00:04:07.659> it's<00:04:07.780> no<00:04:08.139> comparison<00:04:08.319> all<00:04:08.769> the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
I don't think it's no comparison all the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.660 
I don't think it's no comparison all the

low-light which is definitely a very

very good feature to have not to say
that<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:28.690> blackberry<00:04:29.110> doesn't<00:04:29.620> take

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
that the the blackberry doesn't take

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.070 
that the the blackberry doesn't take
great<00:04:30.130> nice<00:04:30.669> pictures<00:04:31.150> but<00:04:31.419> it's<00:04:31.630> nothing

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
great nice pictures but it's nothing

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.110 
great nice pictures but it's nothing
super<00:04:32.560> great<00:04:32.979> it<00:04:33.160> doesn't<00:04:33.460> make<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.849> pixel

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
super great it doesn't make a pixel

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.230 
super great it doesn't make a pixel
camera<00:04:35.130> but<00:04:36.130> for<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.340> most<00:04:36.490> part<00:04:36.580> it's<00:04:36.970> just

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
camera but for the most part it's just

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.420 
camera but for the most part it's just
you<00:04:37.840> know<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.289> does<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.530> job<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:39.039> mean<00:04:39.190> for<00:04:39.310> what

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
you know it does the job I mean for what

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.620 
you know it does the job I mean for what
most<00:04:39.639> people<00:04:39.880> going<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.030> use<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.300> for<00:04:40.510> it's

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
most people going to use it for it's

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.730 
most people going to use it for it's
definitely<00:04:41.440> decent<00:04:42.389> when<00:04:43.389> it<00:04:43.510> comes<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.990> you

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
definitely decent when it comes to you

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.820 
definitely decent when it comes to you
know<00:04:44.830> like<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.159> software<00:04:45.699> and<00:04:45.970> so<00:04:46.150> forth<00:04:46.510> I

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
know like the software and so forth I

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.230 
know like the software and so forth I
still<00:04:47.830> give<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.159> edge<00:04:48.310> over<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.849> Lumia

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
still give the edge over to Lumia

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.689 
still give the edge over to Lumia
because<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:49.750> AppStore<00:04:50.550> definitely<00:04:51.550> has<00:04:51.669> a

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
because the AppStore definitely has a

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.189 
because the AppStore definitely has a
lot<00:04:51.970> more<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.630> then<00:04:52.750> when<00:04:52.870> you<00:04:52.960> have<00:04:53.110> the

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
lot more and then when you have the

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.770 
lot more and then when you have the
Nokia<00:04:53.620> collection<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.970> have<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.180> lot<00:04:55.449> of<00:04:55.479> apps

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
Nokia collection you have a lot of apps

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.250 
Nokia collection you have a lot of apps
in<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.139> Nokia<00:04:56.560> Store<00:04:57.510> then<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.630> have<00:04:58.780> access

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
in the Nokia Store then you have access

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.170 
in the Nokia Store then you have access

like<00:05:19.990> the<00:05:20.650> experience<00:05:21.190> nokia<00:05:21.580> gives<00:05:21.820> you<00:05:21.880> with

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
like the experience nokia gives you with

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.670 
like the experience nokia gives you with
their<00:05:22.150> software<00:05:22.510> package<00:05:22.990> that's<00:05:23.199> definitely

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
their software package that's definitely

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.430 
their software package that's definitely
a<00:05:23.740> very<00:05:23.949> good<00:05:24.340> benefit<00:05:25.150> they<00:05:25.270> have<00:05:25.449> as<00:05:26.199> far<00:05:26.380> as

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
a very good benefit they have as far as

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.529 
a very good benefit they have as far as
the<00:05:26.650> network<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.460> radio<00:05:27.699> performance<00:05:28.270> both

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
the network and radio performance both

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.570 
the network and radio performance both
of<00:05:28.780> these<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.320> same<00:05:29.470> network<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.220> radios

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
of these on the same network so radios

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.189 
of these on the same network so radios
performed<00:05:31.090> very<00:05:31.270> well<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.539> haven't<00:05:31.810> had<00:05:32.020> any

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
performed very well I haven't had any

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.469 
performed very well I haven't had any
issues<00:05:32.289> with<00:05:32.500> Carl<00:05:33.490> drops<00:05:33.789> or<00:05:34.060> anything<00:05:34.240> like

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
issues with Carl drops or anything like

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.149 
issues with Carl drops or anything like
that<00:05:34.539> so<00:05:35.020> they<00:05:35.139> definitely<00:05:35.470> work<00:05:35.919> well

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
that so they definitely work well

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.610 
that so they definitely work well
they're<00:05:36.430> they're<00:05:36.610> pretty<00:05:36.639> about<00:05:36.970> even<00:05:37.599> I<00:05:38.080> do

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
they're they're pretty about even I do

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.330 
they're they're pretty about even I do
know<00:05:39.099> that<00:05:39.279> I<00:05:39.430> do<00:05:39.490> tend<00:05:39.909> to<00:05:39.969> notice<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:41.650> tried

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
know that I do tend to notice I tried

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.040 
know that I do tend to notice I tried
this<00:05:42.460> in

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
this in

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.260 
this in
try<00:05:43.379> to<00:05:43.440> speed<00:05:43.830> to<00:05:44.069> us<00:05:44.159> again<00:05:44.580> on<00:05:46.970> this<00:05:47.970> black

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
try to speed to us again on this black

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.909 
try to speed to us again on this black
bear<00:05:48.479> and<00:05:48.629> I<00:05:48.690> think<00:05:48.930> it's<00:05:49.080> just<00:05:49.229> so<00:05:49.500> much<00:05:49.680> the

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
bear and I think it's just so much the

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.450 
bear and I think it's just so much the
app<00:05:50.099> itself<00:05:50.669> it<00:05:51.419> it's<00:05:52.199> not<00:05:52.440> very<00:05:52.710> all<00:05:53.280> it

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
app itself it it's not very all it

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.010 
app itself it it's not very all it
doesn't<00:05:53.789> seem<00:05:54.030> to<00:05:54.120> be<00:05:54.210> performing<00:05:54.690> that<00:05:54.720> well

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
doesn't seem to be performing that well

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.350 
doesn't seem to be performing that well
but<00:05:55.319> we<00:05:55.620> have<00:05:55.800> speed<00:05:56.129> tests<00:05:56.460> on<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.759> Windows

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
but we have speed tests on the Windows

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.850 
but we have speed tests on the Windows
Phone<00:05:57.539> which<00:05:57.780> just<00:05:58.020> came<00:05:58.199> out<00:05:58.409> not<00:05:58.590> too<00:05:58.650> long

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
ago so we're gonna do a speed test on

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.200 
ago so we're gonna do a speed test on
both<00:06:03.629> of<00:06:03.810> these<00:06:03.900> here<00:06:04.139> in<00:06:04.199> a<00:06:04.379> moment<00:06:04.849> ready<00:06:05.849> so

tests<00:06:35.340> for<00:06:35.490> everything<00:06:35.909> so<00:06:36.949> it<00:06:37.949> could<00:06:38.219> be<00:06:38.250> just

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 
tests for everything so it could be just

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.430 
tests for everything so it could be just
the<00:06:38.699> application<00:06:39.360> and<00:06:39.509> I'm<00:06:39.629> not<00:06:40.080> even<00:06:40.199> sure

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
the application and I'm not even sure

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.980 
the application and I'm not even sure
where<00:06:40.650> this<00:06:40.800> is<00:06:41.039> getting<00:06:41.940> a<00:06:42.030> server<00:06:42.330> from<00:06:42.599> so

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
where this is getting a server from so

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.740 
where this is getting a server from so
it's<00:06:43.259> kind<00:06:43.530> of<00:06:43.849> hard<00:06:44.849> to<00:06:44.940> say<00:06:45.560> but<00:06:46.560> the<00:06:46.889> Lumia

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
it's kind of hard to say but the Lumia

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.290 
it's kind of hard to say but the Lumia
AT&amp;T<00:06:48.750> Meyer<00:06:48.990> Lumias<00:06:49.830> got<00:06:50.069> been<00:06:50.370> very<00:06:50.639> good<00:06:50.909> and

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:55.730 
I haven't noticed anything off the wall
using<00:06:54.300> the<00:06:54.539> BlackBerry<00:06:54.960> z10<00:06:55.199> so<00:06:55.560> that's

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
using the BlackBerry z10 so that's

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.950 
using the BlackBerry z10 so that's
another<00:06:55.979> great<00:06:56.159> thing<00:06:56.490> to<00:06:57.300> notice<00:06:57.539> as<00:06:57.750> well

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
another great thing to notice as well

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.709 
another great thing to notice as well
overall<00:06:58.740> conclusion<00:06:59.430> long<00:06:59.849> story<00:07:00.150> short<00:07:00.449> I

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:00.719 
overall conclusion long story short I

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:02.600 
overall conclusion long story short I
still<00:07:00.990> think<00:07:01.409> the<00:07:01.500> Lumia<00:07:01.800> winds<00:07:02.099> out<00:07:02.279> between

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
still think the Lumia winds out between

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.649 
still think the Lumia winds out between
the<00:07:02.789> both<00:07:02.969> leads<00:07:03.210> simple<00:07:04.050> fact<00:07:04.259> is<00:07:04.460> $99<00:07:05.599> for<00:07:06.599> a

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
the both leads simple fact is $99 for a

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.350 
the both leads simple fact is $99 for a
two-year<00:07:06.960> contract<00:07:07.139> I've<00:07:07.650> seen<00:07:07.979> it<00:07:08.099> free<00:07:08.460> and
