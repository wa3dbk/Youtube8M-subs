00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.220 
starch or carbohydrates or rice that's
another<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.380> know<00:00:25.500> that's<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.890> start<00:00:26.630> say<00:00:27.630> yeah

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
another you know that's a start say yeah

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.230 
another you know that's a start say yeah
you're<00:00:28.470> right<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:28.980> yeah<00:00:29.609> let's<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.060> about

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you're right or yeah let's think about

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.780 
you're right or yeah let's think about
this<00:00:30.599> let's<00:00:30.869> see<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.710> eat<00:00:31.890> starch<00:00:32.309> like

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.299 
this let's see don't eat starch like
don't<00:00:33.120> eat<00:00:33.239> rice<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:34.500> rice<00:00:34.530> turns<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
don't eat rice because rice turns to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.580 
don't eat rice because rice turns to
sugar<00:00:35.700> which<00:00:35.850> turns<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.360> fat<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.809> that's<00:00:37.350> why

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
sugar which turns to fat and that's why

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
sugar which turns to fat and that's why
there<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.160> point<00:00:38.460> seven<00:00:39.030> three<00:00:39.059> billion

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
there are one point seven three billion

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.979 
there are one point seven three billion
obese<00:00:40.649> Asians<00:00:41.489> living<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.000> rice<00:00:42.210> based<00:00:42.540> diets

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
obese Asians living on rice based diets

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.069 
obese Asians living on rice based diets
and<00:00:43.160> then<00:00:44.160> everybody<00:00:44.670> stops<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.329> says<00:00:45.510> well

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and then everybody stops and says well

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.410 
and then everybody stops and says well
that's<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.590> true

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
that's not true

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.790 
that's not true
then<00:00:48.420> start<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> conversation<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.770> course

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
then start the conversation of course

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.760 
then start the conversation of course
rice<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.910> starch<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> carbohydrates<00:00:52.590> don't
