00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.769
 Hello 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:18.310
 It is an inspection 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:21.900
 Easy to learn from Man and it is a deep game 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:28.550
 It is said to be one of the world's best games 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.150
 A record has been kept in Egypt in 1400 BC 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.950
 The rules are very simple 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:41.290
 I think it is a perfect play for children's clubs 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:49.260
 It is not uncommon for a first grader to lend to a third grader from well 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:49.260
 What if is try to incorporate the children club of the play to be out of your Zonchi yet how 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.380
 Let me explain the rules 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:02.170
 This is a set from Man 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:06.670
 The line is 12 pieces and the cup is 30 pieces. 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:11.690
 The cup can be substituted with a jelly or pudding cup after eating 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:17.500
 Also repelling You can also substitute with stones and tree nuts 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:23.159
 The five ahead will be your opponent's position and your 5 will be your opponent's position 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 The two cups on both feet in the middle are not in either position 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.830
 It is the first time for Man to put three oysters in each cup of each other's position 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.000
 Please give me 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.000
 Please 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.950
 袁 じ ゃ け ん け ん け ん 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:50.220
 Pick one cup you like and take out all the plays in the cup 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:54.150
 Please put one cup at a time clockwise 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:00.560
 The last one is not in either position at this time 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.560
 Once in the cups at this end you can continue one more time 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.250
 If the last one goes into any other place, it will be the other party's turn 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.730
 In this way, it eventually wins the game if there are no marbles of their own territory in 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.890
 There was 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:50.190
 Please try to open the tournament at the Children's Club children If you remember the rules 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.190
 It is very exciting
