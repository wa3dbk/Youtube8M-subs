flying
on<00:02:13.890> Saturdays<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:14.670> what<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.820> would<00:02:14.910> be

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
on Saturdays now what I would be

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.520 
on Saturdays now what I would be
concerned<00:02:15.420> about<00:02:15.450> here<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.810> Silicon<00:02:16.200> Valley<00:02:16.230> I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
concerned about here in Silicon Valley I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.930 
concerned about here in Silicon Valley I
think<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.800> biggest<00:02:16.950> market<00:02:17.400> probably<00:02:17.580> would

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
think the biggest market probably would

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.670 
think the biggest market probably would
be<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.690> corporate<00:02:18.900> traveler<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.530> would

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
be the corporate traveler and I would

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.560 
be the corporate traveler and I would
think<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.400> corporations<00:02:21.180> around<00:02:21.450> here

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
think that the corporations around here

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.390 
think that the corporations around here
from<00:02:21.750> Microsoft<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.410> Google<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.280> the

from Microsoft at Google and all of the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.060 
from Microsoft at Google and all of the
above<00:02:23.640> would<00:02:24.210> want<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.840> get<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.710> sense<00:02:25.950> of

above would want to get in a sense of
corporate<00:02:26.430> pass<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.850> say<00:02:27.030> four<00:02:27.810> maybe<00:02:28.380> ten

why<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.550> right<00:02:39.480> now<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.720> model<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.290> built

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
why is that right now the model is built

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500 
why is that right now the model is built
on<00:02:40.800> one<00:02:40.980> person<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.490> subscription<00:02:41.880> now<00:02:42.360> there

on one person one subscription now there

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.670 
on one person one subscription now there
is<00:02:42.600> some<00:02:42.780> flexibility<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.530> can

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
is some flexibility in that you can

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.810 
is some flexibility in that you can
bring<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.980> buddy<00:02:44.130> with<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.490> way<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.640> would

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
bring a buddy with you the way you would

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.220 
bring a buddy with you the way you would
at<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.970> country<00:02:45.090> club<00:02:45.240> or<00:02:45.540> something<00:02:45.840> else<00:02:45.990> on

at a country club or something else on
occasion<00:02:46.740> but<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.730> reality<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.570> model

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
occasion but the reality is the model

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.060 
occasion but the reality is the model
works<00:02:49.020> when<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.350> one<00:02:49.470> person<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.950> one

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.310 
works when it's one person to one
subscription<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.870> doesn't<00:02:52.200> work<00:02:52.290> right

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320

now now it may in the future but what

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.270 
now now it may in the future but what
we've<00:02:54.660> got<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.410> put<00:02:55.680> two<00:02:55.800> planes<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
we've got to do is put two planes in the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
we've got to do is put two planes in the
sky<00:02:56.490> fly<00:02:56.910> these<00:02:56.970> 500<00:02:57.300> people<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.959> really

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
sky fly these 500 people and really

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.810 
sky fly these 500 people and really
learn<00:02:58.440> what<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.890> usage<00:02:59.190> pattern<00:02:59.550> looks<00:02:59.760> like

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
learn what that usage pattern looks like

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.699 
learn what that usage pattern looks like
what<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.360> reality<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.990> then<00:03:01.440> when<00:03:01.620> we

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
what it is in reality and then when we

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.440 
what it is in reality and then when we
have<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.070> information<00:03:02.220> then<00:03:02.850> we're<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.360> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
have that information then we're in a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.640 
have that information then we're in a
much<00:03:03.660> better<00:03:03.810> position<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.410> look<00:03:04.530> at

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
much better position to look at

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.260 
much better position to look at
Microsoft<00:03:05.100> or<00:03:05.310> Google<00:03:05.340> or<00:03:05.610> whoever<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.180> say

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
Microsoft or Google or whoever and say

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.880 
Microsoft or Google or whoever and say
okay<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:06.930> how<00:03:07.050> we<00:03:07.140> could<00:03:07.440> structure<00:03:07.740> a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
okay this is how we could structure a

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.380 
okay this is how we could structure a
corporate<00:03:08.280> plan<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.760> what<00:03:08.910> would<00:03:09.150> work

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
corporate plan this is what would work

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.820 
corporate plan this is what would work
and<00:03:09.570> wouldn't<00:03:09.750> break<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.020> model<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.740> of

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
and wouldn't break the model and one of

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.320 
and wouldn't break the model and one of
the<00:03:10.950> key<00:03:11.100> things<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.459> I'm<00:03:11.610> sure<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.000> learned

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
the key things that I'm sure you learned

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.600 
the key things that I'm sure you learned
in<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.990> process<00:03:13.170> you've<00:03:14.010> done<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> little<00:03:14.370> bit

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
in the process you've done a little bit

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.920 
in the process you've done a little bit
of<00:03:14.700> pivoting<00:03:15.120> over<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.480> past<00:03:15.660> eight<00:03:15.900> weeks

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
of pivoting over the past eight weeks

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.840 
of pivoting over the past eight weeks
and<00:03:16.290> probably<00:03:16.680> more<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.010> come<00:03:17.190> right<00:03:17.459> that's

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
and probably more to come right that's

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.729 
and probably more to come right that's
right<00:03:18.060> we<00:03:18.209> started<00:03:18.600> at<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> price<00:03:18.959> point<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.290> 500

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
right we started at a price point of 500

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.440 
right we started at a price point of 500
bucks<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:20.040> month<00:03:20.160> we<00:03:20.489> started<00:03:20.850> using<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.150> Cessna

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
bucks a month we started using a Cessna

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.940 
bucks a month we started using a Cessna
208<00:03:21.720> which<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.080> little<00:03:22.230> bit<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> same<00:03:22.709> size

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
208 which is a little bit the same size

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.890 
208 which is a little bit the same size
but<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.280> little<00:03:23.400> different<00:03:23.519> aircraft<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.480> as

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
but a little different aircraft and as

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.660 
but a little different aircraft and as
we<00:03:25.019> went<00:03:25.140> through<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.500> said<00:03:25.650> okay<00:03:25.860> well<00:03:26.100> turns

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
we went through we said okay well turns

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.009 
we went through we said okay well turns
out<00:03:26.820> this<00:03:27.030> aircraft<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.540> better<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:27.840> all<00:03:27.959> I

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
out this aircraft is better for all I

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.000 
out this aircraft is better for all I
wanna<00:03:28.170> do<00:03:28.290> because<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> hundred<00:03:28.800> knots

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
wanna do because it's a hundred knots

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.699 
wanna do because it's a hundred knots
faster<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:30.360> we'll<00:03:30.690> get<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.870> there<00:03:30.989> 2025

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
faster so we'll get you there 2025

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.900 
faster so we'll get you there 2025
minutes<00:03:31.950> faster<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.430> time<00:03:32.610> we<00:03:32.670> wouldn't

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
minutes faster in this time we wouldn't

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.790 
minutes faster in this time we wouldn't
a<00:03:32.940> 208<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:34.080> meant<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.320> could<00:03:34.470> get<00:03:34.620> more

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
a 208 and that meant we could get more

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.920 
a 208 and that meant we could get more
people<00:03:34.860> back<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.060> forth<00:03:36.150> between<00:03:36.480> Palo<00:03:36.870> Alto

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
people back and forth between Palo Alto

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.479 
people back and forth between Palo Alto
and<00:03:37.260> Santa<00:03:37.470> Monica<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.890> day<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.250> meant

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
and Santa Monica in a day and that meant

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.300 
and Santa Monica in a day and that meant
a<00:03:38.519> lot<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.700> us<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:40.170> switched<00:03:40.410> aircraft<00:03:40.800> and

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
a lot to us so we switched aircraft and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.229 
a lot to us so we switched aircraft and
then<00:03:41.430> as<00:03:41.519> we're<00:03:41.640> looking<00:03:41.820> at<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.000> well<00:03:42.090> that's

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
then as we're looking at it well that's

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.540 
then as we're looking at it well that's
also<00:03:42.390> slightly<00:03:42.750> more<00:03:42.989> expensive<00:03:43.050> aircraft<00:03:43.620> so

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
also slightly more expensive aircraft so

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.949 
also slightly more expensive aircraft so
does<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.880> still<00:03:45.060> work<00:03:45.090> at<00:03:45.300> 500<00:03:45.690> bucks<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.870> month

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
does it still work at 500 bucks a month

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.300 
does it still work at 500 bucks a month
you<00:03:46.110> know<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.320> doesn't<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:46.800> it's<00:03:46.950> important

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
you know it doesn't but it's important

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.100 
you know it doesn't but it's important
to<00:03:47.400> enough<00:03:47.610> important<00:03:48.330> enough<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.690> us<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.019> add

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
to enough important enough to us to add

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.930 
to enough important enough to us to add
these<00:03:49.320> new<00:03:49.530> seats<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.160> sort<00:03:50.459> of<00:03:50.489> inventory

these new seats to the sort of inventory
or<00:03:51.060> capacity<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.600> seats<00:03:51.840> we're<00:03:52.560> gonna<00:03:52.650> change

or capacity of seats we're gonna change

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.100 
or capacity of seats we're gonna change
the<00:03:53.070> price<00:03:53.280> point<00:03:53.610> plus<00:03:54.450> an<00:03:54.600> a-minus<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.989> that

the price point plus an a-minus to that

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.600 
the price point plus an a-minus to that
at<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.290> thousand<00:03:55.650> bucks<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.920> month<00:03:55.950> we<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.580> a

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
at a thousand bucks a month we have a

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.710 
at a thousand bucks a month we have a
smaller<00:03:56.910> pool<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.300> folks<00:03:57.420> who'd<00:03:57.660> be

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
smaller pool of folks who'd be

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.449 
smaller pool of folks who'd be
interested<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:58.800> we<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.040> Fargo<00:03:59.340> focus

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
interested in it but we can Fargo focus

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.800 
interested in it but we can Fargo focus
our<00:03:59.700> marketing<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.150> target<00:04:00.480> them<00:04:00.630> more

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
our marketing and target them more

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.060 
our marketing and target them more
specifically<00:04:01.260> because<00:04:01.410> they're<00:04:01.620> because<00:04:01.980> it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
specifically because they're because it

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.320 
specifically because they're because it
is<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.190> smaller<00:04:02.430> group<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:02.820> would<00:04:02.940> imagine<00:04:03.150> that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
is a smaller group I would imagine that

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.840 
is a smaller group I would imagine that
you<00:04:03.480> probably<00:04:03.660> don't<00:04:04.230> need<00:04:04.620> venture<00:04:05.400> capital

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
you probably don't need venture capital

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.759 
you probably don't need venture capital
right<00:04:06.180> away<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.450> mean<00:04:06.660> if<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.870> have<00:04:07.110> paying

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
right away I mean if you have paying

customers 500 paying customers right
away<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:09.900> going<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.470> cover<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.250> your

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
away is that going to cover all of your

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.860 
away is that going to cover all of your
costs<00:04:11.489> in<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.970> little<00:04:12.150> more<00:04:12.299> well

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
costs in a little more well

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.680 
costs in a little more well
interestingly<00:04:13.140> no<00:04:14.070> we<00:04:14.970> we<00:04:15.180> will<00:04:15.330> go<00:04:15.420> out<00:04:15.570> and

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
interestingly no we we will go out and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.060 
interestingly no we we will go out and
seek<00:04:15.870> some<00:04:16.049> funding<00:04:16.380> we<00:04:16.590> initially<00:04:17.040> thought

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
seek some funding we initially thought

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.590 
seek some funding we initially thought
we<00:04:17.370> wouldn't<00:04:17.549> have<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.850> because<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.330> exactly

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
we wouldn't have to because of exactly

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.479 
we wouldn't have to because of exactly
that<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.590> we<00:04:19.709> thought<00:04:19.830> we<00:04:19.979> would<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.220> able<00:04:20.400> to

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
that but we thought we would be able to

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.120 
that but we thought we would be able to
get<00:04:20.580> a<00:04:20.609> factoring<00:04:21.030> loan<00:04:21.209> against<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:21.870> know

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
get a factoring loan against you know

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.469 
get a factoring loan against you know
against<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.490> pre-sold<00:04:23.910> subscriptions

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
against the the pre-sold subscriptions

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.740 
against the the pre-sold subscriptions
etc<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.530> turns<00:04:25.710> out

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
etc but it turns out

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.550 
etc but it turns out
buildin<00:04:27.110> Airlines<00:04:27.350> kind<00:04:27.500> of

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
buildin Airlines kind of

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.800 
buildin Airlines kind of
capital-intensive<00:04:27.950> deal<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:29.030> we'll<00:04:29.600> go<00:04:29.690> out

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
capital-intensive deal so we'll go out

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.510 
capital-intensive deal so we'll go out
and<00:04:29.960> raise<00:04:30.080> some<00:04:30.260> money<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.680> we'll<00:04:31.160> share<00:04:31.340> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
and raise some money and we'll share the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.750 
and raise some money and we'll share the
success<00:04:31.850> with<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.030> bigger<00:04:32.240> group<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.570> folks
