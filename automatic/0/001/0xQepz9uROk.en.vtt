00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.459
 hello welcome again today I want 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.340
 show them a practical hand design 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.320
 very simple I will apply this form of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.800
 sculpture I will put the bezel in the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.650
 tip to lengthen it a bit more is a 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.490
 very simple design I will only apply 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.369
 this mix in the whole nail this mix is â€‹â€‹from 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.630
 mine the connection that I will show you soon 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.029

 I'm going to put on all the wheel of the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.170

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:38.410
 it is a color with very subtle sparkles 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.510
 like pink and other nuances here the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.370
 city arranging very carefully for

 that its colors are appreciated very well 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.320
 it is not necessary to put much of the mixture 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.589
 because it can be spent and it is not 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 necessary we put a thin layer the 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.530

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.909
