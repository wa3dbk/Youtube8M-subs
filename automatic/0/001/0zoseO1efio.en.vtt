durability its safety its cost all those
things<00:00:31.630> are<00:00:31.779> constantly<00:00:32.200> working<00:00:32.439> on<00:00:32.680> but<00:00:33.250> I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
things are constantly working on but I

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.950 
things are constantly working on but I
want<00:00:33.700> to<00:00:33.790> leave<00:00:33.970> I<00:00:34.300> want<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.630> leave<00:00:34.750> the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
want to leave I want to leave the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.050 
want to leave I want to leave the
Facebook<00:00:35.650> fans<00:00:35.920> out<00:00:36.160> there<00:00:36.370> with<00:00:36.580> a<00:00:36.610> really

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
Facebook fans out there with a really

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.210 
Facebook fans out there with a really
simple<00:00:37.240> fact<00:00:37.690> right<00:00:38.470> now<00:00:38.500> it's<00:00:38.830> a<00:00:38.920> cost

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
simple fact right now it's a cost

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.630 
simple fact right now it's a cost
equation<00:00:39.630> the<00:00:40.630> as<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:41.500> increase<00:00:41.830> range<00:00:42.220> right

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
equation the as you increase range right

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.580 
equation the as you increase range right
now<00:00:42.670> you're<00:00:43.120> adding<00:00:43.510> more<00:00:43.690> cells<00:00:44.020> you're

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
now you're adding more cells you're

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.410 
now you're adding more cells you're
adding<00:00:45.010> more<00:00:45.040> modules<00:00:45.760> you're<00:00:46.000> adding<00:00:46.390> more

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
adding more modules you're adding more

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.620 
adding more modules you're adding more
costs<00:00:47.140> so<00:00:47.290> yes<00:00:47.560> a<00:00:47.830> 300<00:00:48.730> mile<00:00:48.940> battery<00:00:49.510> is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
costs so yes a 300 mile battery is

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.580 
costs so yes a 300 mile battery is
possible<00:00:50.230> but<00:00:50.860> not<00:00:50.920> at<00:00:51.250> $30,000<00:00:52.240> a<00:00:52.450> 300<00:00:53.440> mile

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
possible but not at $30,000 a 300 mile

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.390 
possible but not at $30,000 a 300 mile
battery<00:00:54.070> mmm<00:00:54.970> you<00:00:55.150> might<00:00:55.360> be<00:00:55.540> 70<00:00:56.050> or<00:00:56.400> $90,000

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
battery mmm you might be 70 or $90,000

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.800 
battery mmm you might be 70 or $90,000
that's<00:00:57.760> just<00:00:57.940> where<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.180> technology<00:00:58.780> is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
that's just where the technology is

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.170 
that's just where the technology is
today<00:00:59.110> in<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.350> future<00:00:59.680> you<00:01:00.310> know<00:01:00.400> 10<00:01:00.760> but<00:01:01.060> is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
today in the future you know 10 but is

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.270 
today in the future you know 10 but is
10<00:01:01.420> years<00:01:01.570> in<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.930> future<00:01:02.110> you'll<00:01:03.100> see

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
10 years in the future you'll see

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.070 
10 years in the future you'll see
battery<00:01:03.610> costs<00:01:04.000> come<00:01:04.150> down<00:01:04.180> but<00:01:04.540> we<00:01:04.720> have<00:01:04.900> to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
battery costs come down but we have to

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.550 
battery costs come down but we have to
build<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.619> lot<00:01:05.830> more<00:01:05.860> cars<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.460> lot<00:01:06.670> more<00:01:06.880> scale

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
build a lot more cars a lot more scale

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.889 
build a lot more cars a lot more scale
and<00:01:08.560> it's<00:01:08.859> a<00:01:08.920> little<00:01:09.130> bit<00:01:09.219> in<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.340> future

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
and it's a little bit in the future

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.149 
and it's a little bit in the future
another<00:01:10.899> question<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.350> comes<00:01:11.649> up<00:01:11.799> a<00:01:11.920> lot<00:01:12.009> in

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
another question that comes up a lot in

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.669 
another question that comes up a lot in
the<00:01:12.249> community<00:01:12.399> is<00:01:12.880> about<00:01:13.539> solar<00:01:13.990> panels<00:01:14.499> on

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
the community is about solar panels on

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.090 
the community is about solar panels on
the<00:01:14.770> roof<00:01:14.950> can<00:01:15.399> we<00:01:15.579> fit<00:01:15.880> more<00:01:16.210> solar<00:01:16.689> power

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the roof can we fit more solar power

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.130 
the roof can we fit more solar power
area<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.249> the<00:01:18.340> roof<00:01:18.520> generate<00:01:19.060> more<00:01:19.420> efficient

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
area on the roof generate more efficient

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.429 
area on the roof generate more efficient
energy<00:01:20.319> for<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.859> vehicle<00:01:21.329> solar<00:01:22.329> power<00:01:22.659> is<00:01:23.020> in

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
energy for the vehicle solar power is in

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.020 
energy for the vehicle solar power is in
that<00:01:23.590> same<00:01:23.829> kind<00:01:24.069> of<00:01:24.249> equation<00:01:24.700> we<00:01:24.789> talked

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
that same kind of equation we talked

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.580 
that same kind of equation we talked
about<00:01:25.149> batteries<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.810> mean<00:01:26.049> they're<00:01:26.229> they're

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
about batteries I mean they're they're

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.550 
about batteries I mean they're they're
efficient<00:01:27.340> but<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:27.939> takes<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.420> lot<00:01:28.689> of<00:01:28.719> them<00:01:29.289> to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
efficient but it takes a lot of them to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.219 
efficient but it takes a lot of them to
generate<00:01:29.799> enough<00:01:30.399> power<00:01:30.539> so<00:01:31.539> it's<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.079> was<00:01:32.200> a

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
generate enough power so it's it was a

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.469 
generate enough power so it's it was a
cost<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.829> efficiency<00:01:33.009> situation<00:01:33.999> so<00:01:34.149> we<00:01:34.270> put

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
cost and efficiency situation so we put

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.480 
cost and efficiency situation so we put
the<00:01:34.569> solar<00:01:34.780> panel<00:01:35.200> on<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.590> spoiler<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.429> the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the solar panel on the spoiler of the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.039 
the solar panel on the spoiler of the
back<00:01:36.639> of<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:36.880> leaf<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.450> on<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.719> SL<00:01:38.020> model

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
back of a leaf on the on the SL model

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.469 
back of a leaf on the on the SL model
that<00:01:38.920> provided<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.429> little<00:01:39.609> bit<00:01:39.789> of<00:01:39.909> energy<00:01:40.030> and

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
that provided a little bit of energy and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.539 
that provided a little bit of energy and
we<00:01:40.719> used<00:01:40.929> a<00:01:41.079> trickle<00:01:41.649> charge<00:01:41.889> the<00:01:42.100> 12-volt

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
we used a trickle charge the 12-volt

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.249 
we used a trickle charge the 12-volt
battery<00:01:42.850> onboard<00:01:43.210> but<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.600> really<00:01:43.749> power<00:01:43.990> the

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
battery onboard but to really power the

those who are just coming and learning
more<00:02:01.209> about<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.569> leaf<00:02:01.719> and<00:02:01.929> thinking<00:02:02.319> that

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
more about the leaf and thinking that

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.129 
more about the leaf and thinking that
perhaps<00:02:02.979> although<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.209> leaf<00:02:04.329> itself<00:02:04.509> is<00:02:04.899> zero

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
perhaps although the leaf itself is zero

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:08.400 
perhaps although the leaf itself is zero
emissions<00:02:05.590> all<00:02:06.490> we're<00:02:06.880> doing<00:02:07.209> is<00:02:07.359> pushing<00:02:07.689> the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
emissions all we're doing is pushing the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.690 
emissions all we're doing is pushing the
the<00:02:09.250> carbon<00:02:09.610> emissions<00:02:10.509> further<00:02:11.110> up<00:02:11.700> upstream

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
the carbon emissions further up upstream

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.759 
the carbon emissions further up upstream
on<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.939> energy<00:02:13.239> production<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> talk

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
on the energy production so can you talk

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.380 
on the energy production so can you talk
to<00:02:14.890> us<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.069> little<00:02:15.099> bit<00:02:15.549> about<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.909> trade-offs

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
to us a little bit about the trade-offs

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.100 
to us a little bit about the trade-offs
and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.690 
and
what<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.650> really<00:02:17.830> means<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.310> be<00:02:18.400> zero

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
what it really means to be zero

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.580 
what it really means to be zero

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.680 
emissions from the vehicle standpoint
it's<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.160> pretty<00:02:21.370> common<00:02:21.760> question<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:22.420> mean<00:02:22.540> our

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
it's a pretty common question I mean our

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.810 
it's a pretty common question I mean our
responsibilities<00:02:23.500> was<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.770> get<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.220> Nissan

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
responsibilities was to get the Nissan

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.520 
responsibilities was to get the Nissan
Leaf<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.240> be<00:02:25.360> zero<00:02:25.630> emission<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.350> what

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
Leaf to be zero emission and that's what

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.980 
Leaf to be zero emission and that's what
we<00:02:26.650> did<00:02:26.920> but<00:02:27.790> if<00:02:27.970> we<00:02:28.090> go<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.270> an<00:02:28.480> independent

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
we did but if we go to an independent

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.720 
we did but if we go to an independent
source<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.500> could<00:02:29.650> be<00:02:29.800> Department<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.340> Energy

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
source it could be Department of Energy

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.510 
source it could be Department of Energy
it<00:02:31.090> could<00:02:31.300> be<00:02:31.450> Electric<00:02:31.870> Power<00:02:32.020> Research

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
it could be Electric Power Research

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.010 
it could be Electric Power Research
Institute<00:02:33.520> even<00:02:34.060> Google<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.570> think<00:02:34.750> at<00:02:34.840> last

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
Institute even Google I think at last

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.810 
Institute even Google I think at last
count<00:02:35.200> there<00:02:35.560> have<00:02:35.650> been<00:02:35.740> 43<00:02:36.520> different

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
count there have been 43 different

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.690 
count there have been 43 different
studies<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.870> one<00:02:38.110> question<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.920> common

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
studies on this one question a common

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.730 
studies on this one question a common
answer<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.660> if<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.900> look<00:02:41.080> at<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.380> Nissan

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
answer is that if you look at the Nissan

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.800 
answer is that if you look at the Nissan
Leaf<00:02:41.970> versus<00:02:42.970> an<00:02:43.090> internal<00:02:43.480> combustion

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
Leaf versus an internal combustion

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.900 
Leaf versus an internal combustion
engine<00:02:44.050> car<00:02:44.440> total<00:02:45.100> emissions<00:02:45.490> on<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.730> leaf

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
engine car total emissions on the leaf

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.150 
engine car total emissions on the leaf
side<00:02:46.180> which<00:02:46.480> includes<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.380> electricity

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
side which includes the electricity

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.280 
side which includes the electricity
generation<00:02:48.580> we<00:02:49.390> are<00:02:49.920> 60%<00:02:51.330> better<00:02:52.330> off<00:02:52.600> than<00:02:53.080> an

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
generation we are 60% better off than an

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.290 
generation we are 60% better off than an
internal<00:02:53.709> combustion<00:02:54.040> engine<00:02:54.280> car<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.120> that's

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
internal combustion engine car so that's

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.270 
internal combustion engine car so that's
if<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.690> against<00:02:56.350> that's<00:02:56.530> not<00:02:56.739> really<00:02:56.980> even<00:02:57.190> an

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
if you against that's not really even an

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.130 
if you against that's not really even an
apples<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.700> oranges<00:02:57.790> kind<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.540> comparison

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
apples to oranges kind of comparison

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.320 
apples to oranges kind of comparison
you're<00:02:59.560> looking<00:02:59.860> at<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.070> leaf<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.580> taking<00:03:01.239> a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
you're looking at the leaf and taking a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.060 
you're looking at the leaf and taking a
look<00:03:01.540> at<00:03:01.630> its<00:03:01.780> fuel<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.350> you're<00:03:02.770> only<00:03:02.860> looking

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
look at its fuel and you're only looking

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.300 
look at its fuel and you're only looking
at<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.370> car<00:03:03.670> with<00:03:04.120> its<00:03:04.270> tailpipe<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:05.410> are<00:03:05.560> 60%

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
at a car with its tailpipe we are 60%

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.370 
at a car with its tailpipe we are 60%
better<00:03:06.430> off<00:03:06.700> even<00:03:06.970> at<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.660> kind<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.900> unfair

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
better off even at that kind of unfair

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.920 
better off even at that kind of unfair
comparison<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:09.190> think<00:03:09.790> if<00:03:10.060> people<00:03:10.390> were<00:03:10.540> to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
comparison I think if people were to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.510 
comparison I think if people were to
hear<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.650> number<00:03:11.890> they<00:03:12.100> wouldn't<00:03:12.340> think

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
hear that number they wouldn't think

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.320 
hear that number they wouldn't think
that<00:03:12.640> 60%<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.540> huge<00:03:14.080> savings<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.310> hear<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.239> on

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
that 60% is a huge savings I hear you on

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.030 
that 60% is a huge savings I hear you on
that<00:03:16.390> one<00:03:16.690> it's<00:03:16.900> it's<00:03:17.080> amazing<00:03:17.350> some<00:03:17.739> people

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
that one it's it's amazing some people

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.949 
that one it's it's amazing some people
think<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.670> an<00:03:18.940> electric<00:03:19.239> vehicle<00:03:19.390> because

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
think that an electric vehicle because

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.539 
think that an electric vehicle because
they<00:03:20.170> think<00:03:20.440> all<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.680> our<00:03:20.950> electricity<00:03:21.310> is

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
they think all of our electricity is

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.630 
they think all of our electricity is
coal-fired<00:03:22.120> generation<00:03:22.870> plants<00:03:23.519> first<00:03:24.519> of

all that's not true less than 50% of the

electricity is generated by coal but

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.850 
electricity is generated by coal but
they<00:03:28.840> automatically<00:03:29.290> think<00:03:29.350> that<00:03:29.620> they're

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
they automatically think that they're

they automatically think that they're
extremely<00:03:30.190> dirty<00:03:30.580> that's<00:03:30.820> not<00:03:31.030> really<00:03:31.420> true

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
extremely dirty that's not really true

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.680 
extremely dirty that's not really true

the electricity grids getting constantly

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.360 
the electricity grids getting constantly
cleaner<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.320> it's<00:03:35.440> going<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> get<00:03:35.920> cleaner<00:03:36.220> in

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
cleaner and it's going to get cleaner in

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.789 
cleaner and it's going to get cleaner in
the<00:03:36.459> future<00:03:36.820> but<00:03:37.480> on<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.989> comparison<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.680> I

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
the future but on that comparison that I

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.380 
the future but on that comparison that I
was<00:03:38.920> talking<00:03:39.340> about<00:03:39.400> it's<00:03:39.730> really<00:03:40.000> about<00:03:40.120> look

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
was talking about it's really about look

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.820 
was talking about it's really about look
at<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.630> internal<00:03:41.049> combustion<00:03:41.530> engine

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
at that internal combustion engine

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.560 
at that internal combustion engine
they're<00:03:41.980> only<00:03:42.100> looking<00:03:42.430> at<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:42.910> car<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.540> that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
they're only looking at that car in that

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.050 
they're only looking at that car in that
tailpipe<00:03:44.049> they're<00:03:44.769> not<00:03:44.920> looking<00:03:45.100> at<00:03:45.459> gas

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
tailpipe they're not looking at gas

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.520 
tailpipe they're not looking at gas
stations<00:03:46.690> they're<00:03:47.019> not<00:03:47.140> looking<00:03:47.260> at

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
stations they're not looking at

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.440

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
refineries they're looking at the trucks

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.930 
refineries they're looking at the trucks
transporting<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.500> fuel<00:03:50.739> back<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.250> forth<00:03:51.489> and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
transporting the fuel back and forth and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.310 
transporting the fuel back and forth and
if<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.150> take<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.450> argument<00:03:52.870> even<00:03:52.989> further

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
if you take the argument even further

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.259 
if you take the argument even further
than<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.650> there<00:03:54.310> are<00:03:54.459> some<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.910> would<00:03:55.030> say

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
than that there are some that would say

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.820 
than that there are some that would say
that<00:03:55.510> we'd<00:03:55.600> have<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.840> count<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.380> Air<00:03:56.500> Force

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
that we'd have to count the Air Force

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.620 
that we'd have to count the Air Force
the<00:03:57.070> Navy<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.610> Marines<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.420> all<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
the Navy and the Marines and all the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.750 
the Navy and the Marines and all the
emissions<00:03:59.049> from<00:03:59.380> our<00:03:59.620> military<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.730> are

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
emissions from our military that are

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.340 
emissions from our military that are
actually<00:04:01.120> protecting<00:04:01.690> our<00:04:01.780> shipping<00:04:02.019> lanes

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
actually protecting our shipping lanes

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.100 
actually protecting our shipping lanes
and<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.739> would<00:04:02.950> be<00:04:03.070> all<00:04:03.340> part<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.970> that<00:04:04.810> side

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
and that would be all part of that side

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.479 
and that would be all part of that side
of<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.320> equation<00:04:05.769> you<00:04:05.920> can<00:04:06.220> take<00:04:06.370> that

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
of the equation you can take that

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.190 
of the equation you can take that
argument<00:04:06.640> go<00:04:06.970> crazy<00:04:07.299> but<00:04:07.600> if<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.840> just<00:04:08.019> do

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
argument go crazy but if you just do

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.720 
argument go crazy but if you just do
