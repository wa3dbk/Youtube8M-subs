place<00:01:56.340> 30<00:01:56.670> years<00:01:56.790> ago<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.450> or<00:01:57.570> less<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.079> this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
place 30 years ago more or less so this

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
place 30 years ago more or less so this
had<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.619> I've<00:01:58.740> been<00:01:58.950> before<00:01:59.340> Roger<00:01:59.850> was

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
had so I've been before Roger was

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
had so I've been before Roger was
executed<00:02:00.750> before<00:02:00.840> Roger<00:02:01.200> even<00:02:01.439> became<00:02:01.770> Pirate

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
executed before Roger even became Pirate

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.670 
executed before Roger even became Pirate
King<00:02:02.369> because<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.210> correct<00:02:03.390> Roger<00:02:04.110> died

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
King because if I'm correct Roger died

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.630 
King because if I'm correct Roger died
roughly<00:02:05.840> 21<00:02:06.840> 22<00:02:07.530> years<00:02:07.860> ago<00:02:08.160> around<00:02:08.489> there

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
roughly 21 22 years ago around there

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.180 
roughly 21 22 years ago around there
because<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:09.090> Stein<00:02:09.599> at<00:02:09.810> 20<00:02:10.110> years<00:02:10.319> old<00:02:10.530> Roger

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
because a Stein at 20 years old Roger

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.490 
because a Stein at 20 years old Roger
died<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:12.030> before<00:02:12.209> Ace<00:02:12.599> was<00:02:12.629> born

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
died just before Ace was born

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.010 
died just before Ace was born
so<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.310> he<00:02:14.760> was<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.120> probably<00:02:15.480> this

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
so it's like he was like probably this

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.990 
so it's like he was like probably this
was<00:02:16.170> six<00:02:16.380> years<00:02:16.530> before<00:02:16.770> Raj<00:02:17.490> was<00:02:17.700> six<00:02:17.880> or

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
was six years before Raj was six or

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.220 
was six years before Raj was six or
seven<00:02:18.210> years<00:02:18.390> more<00:02:18.480> or<00:02:18.540> less<00:02:18.630> before<00:02:19.050> Roger

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
seven years more or less before Roger

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.750 
seven years more or less before Roger
became<00:02:19.710> Pirate<00:02:20.100> King<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.310> became<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.730> know

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
became Pirate King and became you know

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.670 
became Pirate King and became you know
notorious<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.600> was<00:02:21.750> quite<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.290> bit<00:02:22.530> before

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
notorious so this was quite a bit before

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.170 
notorious so this was quite a bit before
that<00:02:23.040> Roger<00:02:23.280> was<00:02:23.460> probably<00:02:23.760> still<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
mountains and preparing for this battle

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.699

so<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:56.910> like<00:02:57.060> again<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:58.020> adds<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> fact

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
so it's like again that adds to the fact

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.050 
so it's like again that adds to the fact
that<00:02:58.830> though<00:02:59.220> one<00:02:59.340> change<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.730> was<00:02:59.910> already

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
that though one change I was already

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.330 
that though one change I was already
notorious<00:03:00.810> at<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.110> point<00:03:01.350> if<00:03:01.590> Bart<00:03:01.980> was

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
notorious at this point if Bart was

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.010 
notorious at this point if Bart was
training<00:03:02.880> for<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.120> battle<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.660> little<00:03:03.900> bit

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
training for this battle a little bit

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.390 
training for this battle a little bit
disappointed<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.620> my<00:03:04.860> theory<00:03:05.070> when<00:03:05.310> it

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
disappointed that my theory when it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.710 
disappointed that my theory when it
comes<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.730> fruition<00:03:05.910> because<00:03:06.240> I<00:03:06.420> was<00:03:06.540> really

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
comes to fruition because I was really

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.330 
comes to fruition because I was really
hoping<00:03:06.990> that<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.230> was<00:03:07.350> something<00:03:07.530> really<00:03:08.130> big

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
hoping that it was something really big

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.920 
hoping that it was something really big
and<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.760> do<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:09.209> piece<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.600> stuff<00:03:09.780> like

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and to do it one piece of stuff like

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.270 
and to do it one piece of stuff like
that<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.470> nonetheless<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.980> was<00:03:11.070> still<00:03:11.250> a

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
that but nonetheless it was still a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.010 
that but nonetheless it was still a
pretty<00:03:11.550> freakin<00:03:11.880> interesting<00:03:12.330> backstory

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
pretty freakin interesting backstory

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.660 
pretty freakin interesting backstory
now<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.350> Luffy<00:03:13.680> pretty<00:03:13.890> much<00:03:14.040> put<00:03:14.310> his<00:03:14.459> head

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670

now that Luffy pretty much put his head
back<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.030> normal<00:03:15.420> I'm<00:03:15.540> betting<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.260> maybe

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
back to normal I'm betting that maybe

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.500 
back to normal I'm betting that maybe
he'll<00:03:17.130> still<00:03:17.430> have<00:03:17.640> some<00:03:17.910> sort<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.300> grudge

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
being a pirate but he might not have a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.190 
being a pirate but he might not have a
problem<00:03:23.550> with<00:03:23.730> Luffy<00:03:24.060> anymore<00:03:24.420> since<00:03:24.840> Luffy

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
problem with Luffy anymore since Luffy

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.780 
problem with Luffy anymore since Luffy
is<00:03:25.230> giving<00:03:25.650> him<00:03:25.769> back<00:03:25.950> his<00:03:26.160> head<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.580> now<00:03:26.730> he

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
is giving him back his head so now he

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.729 
is giving him back his head so now he
could<00:03:27.000> go<00:03:27.120> back<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.660> crack<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.200> content<00:03:28.620> and

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
could go back and crack the content and

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.110 
could go back and crack the content and
get<00:03:28.920> his<00:03:29.010> family's<00:03:29.400> treasure<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.880> everything
