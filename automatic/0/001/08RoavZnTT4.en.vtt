00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
something smaller I mean there's so many

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.660 
something smaller I mean there's so many
variables<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.230> we've<00:02:16.800> got<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> lot<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.220> things

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
variables so we've got a lot of things

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.260 
variables so we've got a lot of things
to<00:02:17.910> figure<00:02:17.940> out<00:02:18.209> there<00:02:18.660> first<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.800> all<00:02:19.890> and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
to figure out there first of all and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.000 
to figure out there first of all and
then<00:02:21.270> as<00:02:21.980> far<00:02:22.980> as<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.660> did<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.870> say<00:02:25.110> originally<00:02:25.980> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
then as far as so did I say originally I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.290 
then as far as so did I say originally I
was<00:02:26.100> hoping<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.400> get<00:02:26.490> pregnant<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:26.880> June<00:02:27.090> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
was hoping to get pregnant in June and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.540 
was hoping to get pregnant in June and
then<00:02:27.420> December<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.860> year<00:02:29.130> would<00:02:29.520> be

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
then December so this year would be

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.880 
then December so this year would be
great<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.360> don't<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.600> if<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:30.840> ready<00:02:31.080> but<00:02:31.860> I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
great but I don't know if we ready but I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.380 
great but I don't know if we ready but I
don't<00:02:32.100> think<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.580> wait<00:02:32.610> much<00:02:32.970> longer<00:02:33.000> I

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
don't think I can wait much longer I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
don't think I can wait much longer I
don't<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.810> hard<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.050> say<00:02:34.170> how<00:02:34.290> I'm

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
don't know it's hard to say how I'm

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.740 
don't know it's hard to say how I'm
gonna<00:02:34.500> feel<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.860> six<00:02:35.070> months<00:02:35.250> um

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.540 

them<00:02:38.320> being<00:02:38.620> too<00:02:38.860> little<00:02:39.220> over<00:02:39.400> two<00:02:39.520> years

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
them being too little over two years

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.070 
them being too little over two years
apart<00:02:39.940> i<00:02:40.090> think<00:02:40.240> is<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.360> great<00:02:40.510> separation

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
apart i think is a great separation

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.380 
apart i think is a great separation
between<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.740> two<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:41.980> them<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.760> alternative

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
between the two of them the alternative

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.060 
between the two of them the alternative
is<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.930> get<00:02:44.050> pregnant<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.650> coming<00:02:44.950> winter

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
is to get pregnant on this coming winter

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.560 
is to get pregnant on this coming winter
or<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.310> following<00:02:45.550> which<00:02:45.880> financially<00:02:46.450> would

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
or the following which financially would

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.020 
or the following which financially would
be<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.930> lot<00:02:47.230> easier<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:48.490> then<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.760> would<00:02:48.880> put

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
be a lot easier but then that would put

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.910 
be a lot easier but then that would put
them<00:02:49.150> over<00:02:49.240> three<00:02:49.540> years<00:02:49.720> apart<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.710> it's<00:02:50.860> like

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
them over three years apart so it's like

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.040 
them over three years apart so it's like
do<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:52.090> set<00:02:52.300> them<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.540> for<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.750> rest<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.960> the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
do you set them up for the rest of the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.610 
do you set them up for the rest of the
lives<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.790> know<00:02:54.820> being<00:02:55.060> further<00:02:55.300> apart<00:02:55.690> just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
lives you know being further apart just

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.050 
lives you know being further apart just
because<00:02:56.830> you're<00:02:56.980> better<00:02:57.160> off<00:02:57.250> financially<00:02:57.610> in

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
because you're better off financially in

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.550 
because you're better off financially in
the<00:02:58.090> meantime<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:58.480> mean<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.290> it's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
the meantime I mean it's really it's

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.470 
the meantime I mean it's really it's
it's<00:02:59.830> hard<00:03:00.190> family<00:03:01.030> planning<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.510> really<00:03:01.840> hard

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
it's hard family planning is really hard

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.240 
it's hard family planning is really hard

middle<00:04:16.650> child<00:04:16.890> issues<00:04:17.299> my<00:04:18.299> parents<00:04:18.930> both

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
middle child issues my parents both

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.110 
middle child issues my parents both
suffered<00:04:19.590> from<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.760> know<00:04:20.850> like<00:04:21.000> in

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
suffered from that so you know like in

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.390 
suffered from that so you know like in
there<00:04:21.660> my<00:04:22.260> dad<00:04:22.470> was<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.770> youngest<00:04:22.980> my<00:04:23.130> mom<00:04:23.250> is

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
there my dad was the youngest my mom is

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.860 
there my dad was the youngest my mom is
the<00:04:23.490> middle<00:04:23.730> they<00:04:23.910> both<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.330> issues<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:24.750> I'd

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
the middle they both have issues so I'd

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.100 
the middle they both have issues so I'd
rather<00:04:25.020> have<00:04:25.320> an<00:04:25.590> even<00:04:26.460> number<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.820> children

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
rather have an even number of children

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.300 
rather have an even number of children
now<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:28.380> matters<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:28.800> just<00:04:29.010> family

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
now that it matters is just family

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.890 
now that it matters is just family
experience<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.150> that's<00:04:30.330> all<00:04:30.480> I<00:04:30.570> have<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.780> base

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
experience so that's all I have to base

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.590 
experience so that's all I have to base
it<00:04:30.930> off<00:04:31.110> of<00:04:31.310> but

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
it off of but

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.210 
it off of but
if<00:04:33.720> we<00:04:33.870> have<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.020> girl<00:04:34.260> next<00:04:34.560> one<00:04:34.740> might<00:04:34.860> be<00:04:34.920> done

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
if we have a girl next one might be done

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.310 
if we have a girl next one might be done
if<00:04:35.730> we<00:04:36.210> have<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.330> boy<00:04:36.570> next<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.050> we'll<00:04:37.140> probably

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
if we have a boy next and we'll probably

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.640 
if we have a boy next and we'll probably
have<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.530> third<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.690> if<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:39.720> have<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:39.990> girl<00:04:40.260> next

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
have a third and if we have a girl next

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.580 
have a third and if we have a girl next
and<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.580> do<00:04:41.640> get<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:41.940> third<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.990> fourth<00:04:43.170> then<00:04:43.500> I

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
and I do get a third and a fourth then I

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.900 
and I do get a third and a fourth then I
don't<00:04:43.800> think<00:04:43.950> it'll<00:04:44.070> matter<00:04:44.220> as<00:04:44.460> much<00:04:44.490> as<00:04:44.760> far

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
don't think it'll matter as much as far

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.770 
don't think it'll matter as much as far
as<00:04:45.000> what<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.710> because<00:04:46.710> i'll<00:04:47.070> have<00:04:47.750> you<00:04:48.750> know

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
as what it is because i'll have you know

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.490 
as what it is because i'll have you know
like<00:04:48.930> two<00:04:49.140> girls<00:04:49.320> close<00:04:49.680> in<00:04:49.830> age<00:04:49.980> or<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:51.500> younger

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
like two girls close in age or a younger

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.200 
like two girls close in age or a younger
boy<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:53.400> know<00:04:53.520> where<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.790> middle<00:04:54.180> child

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
boy you know where the middle child

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.580 
boy you know where the middle child
being<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.810> girl<00:04:55.020> maybe<00:04:55.860> wouldn't<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:58.500> know

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
being a girl maybe wouldn't you know

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.570 
being a girl maybe wouldn't you know
that<00:04:58.770> wouldn't<00:04:59.010> be<00:04:59.100> stuck<00:04:59.310> in<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.490> middle

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
that wouldn't be stuck in the middle

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.580 
that wouldn't be stuck in the middle
because<00:04:59.790> their<00:05:00.510> care<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:00.960> their<00:05:01.050> own<00:05:01.170> if<00:05:01.440> that

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
because their care of their own if that

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.260 
because their care of their own if that
makes<00:05:01.770> sense<00:05:01.950> i<00:05:02.220> think<00:05:02.250> about<00:05:02.730> the<00:05:02.850> civil<00:05:03.090> time

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
makes sense i think about the civil time

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.590 
makes sense i think about the civil time
that's<00:05:04.230> it's<00:05:04.530> really<00:05:04.800> long<00:05:04.920> winded<00:05:05.280> um<00:05:05.640> okay

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
that's it's really long winded um okay

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.020 
that's it's really long winded um okay
so<00:05:06.630> how<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.620> where<00:05:08.490> did<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.790> meet<00:05:08.880> your
