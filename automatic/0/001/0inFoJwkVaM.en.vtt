00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.969
 Hi there, with you channel sea ​​pro android 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.650
 and today we will talk about the application 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.509
 which is called booster plus 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 I will say right away that the application is oriented 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.869
 on devices that do not have root rights 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.179
 if you have root rights you 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.829
 got them for your device then you 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.720
 this application is not 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.700
 useful because there are many 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.500
 other router-a van applications 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.120
 devices that will be more efficient 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.789
 to cope with these tasks 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.170
 and for owners of devices which still 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.329
 didn't get root-rights 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 This application seems to me to be 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.469
 great alternative 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.170
 the application works essentially like tass 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.120
 killer and cuts all background processes and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 applications that are inactive given 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.000
 moment and load your device order 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.559
 spending the most battery power and devouring 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 RAM let's say you want 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.510
 run some resource capacious game 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.240
 she starts to blunt while android 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 unload all applications is not always the way 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.720
 copes with this unload all 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 applications that this application will help 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.660
 one click to cut down all the well or they do not 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.880
 all almost all background processes on 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.280
 your device thereby unloaded your 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.890
 android smartphone or tablet to start 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 I will say that after installing this 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.210
 applications you will need to go 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.790
 in the settings basically this application 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.010
 she will offer you to put a tick there 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.110
 but if you're somewhere about this stick 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.390
 moment then go to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.470
 lining special features and check 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.500
 is it worth the tick 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.980
 here is the apus booster application on it 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.230
 plus 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.320
 if everything is fine you can go to 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.340
 working with the application itself she 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.990
 plain does not require any of you 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.360
 additional knowledge 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.700
 all you need to run the application and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.150
 see how many applications work 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.390
 background 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.090
 and slow down your android smartphone here 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.430
 now you see that I am basically a smartphone 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.000
 didn't reboot let's run yet 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.070
 some 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.580
 any additional applications 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.640
 so that they hang in the background and see how 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.010
 they like this application handle here 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.020
 run some more apps 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.310
 check with task manager what 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.220
 we are really hanging 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.980
 dad mx player and even more background 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.170
 besides background services task manager 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.020
 we do not show them and now we will see 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.820
 how will apus booster deal with this matter 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.160
 plus 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.540
 I will say one more thing to the application 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.709
 any 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.989
 you don't want to let him kill then 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.480
 just click on this application 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.820
 let 's do it with lucky patcher am she 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.360
 will go to the ignore list that is ignore list 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.580
 you will have this 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.980
 if you go in there let's say some 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.040
 the application don't want to kill so she 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.250
 weighed the background and after all this 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.880
 just click on the checkbox to speed up and 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.070
 wait a few seconds like that 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.650
 This application works 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.630
 kills on the sly and shows what 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.350
 application background she killed 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.299
 and how much your smartphone will be accelerated 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.290
 if you want to run some 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.760
 hard game then I advise you a few 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.610
 just start here even in my shop 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.230
 I killed several times run 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.540
 this application now i'm perry 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.540
 connect to continue 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.540
 story 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.780
 that's what happened i have all apps 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.760
 were killed you can click done 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.640
 view again the application that 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.890
 you were allowed in the exclusion lists 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.860
 if not then you can put it here 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:04.550
 check here and delete data 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:06.920
 application mode let's say maybe 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.270
 a white sheet, that is, an application that is not 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.760
 will stop and will not 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.710
 deactivated 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.410
 it's easy to say that the application that 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.780
 one click you can handle 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.360
 all applications hanging 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.390
 as I said that the first application 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.250
 the queue is designed for a smartphone and 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.520
 who do not have root rights only on 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.530
 smartphones on tablets in general so with 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.810
 all application tasks 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.880
 I managed to download perfectly 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.520
 will be a reference in the video description 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.840
 and I will finish this 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.670
