in<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.740> video<00:00:02.040> we're<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> take<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.730> look

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.910 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:03.090> how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> make<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> simple<00:00:03.990> modification<00:00:04.140> to

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
at how to make a simple modification to

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.240 
at how to make a simple modification to
a<00:00:04.950> post<00:00:05.279> processor<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.210> Bobcat<00:00:06.600> camp<00:00:07.220> here<00:00:08.220> I

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
a post processor and Bobcat camp here I

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.860 
a post processor and Bobcat camp here I
already<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> part<00:00:09.120> programmed<00:00:09.570> on<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
already have a part programmed on the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.660 
already have a part programmed on the
screen<00:00:10.170> as<00:00:10.349> well<00:00:10.559> as<00:00:10.679> I've<00:00:10.830> already<00:00:11.040> posted

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
screen as well as I've already posted

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.900 
screen as well as I've already posted
code<00:00:11.880> for<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.740> now<00:00:13.740> if<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.130> look<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.610> code

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
code for it now if we look at this code

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.250 
code for it now if we look at this code
it's<00:00:15.179> actually<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:17.869> here's<00:00:18.869> our<00:00:19.050> tool

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it's actually it's here's our tool

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.009 
it's actually it's here's our tool
change<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.840> we<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:22.080> see<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:23.539> here<00:00:24.539> let's<00:00:24.779> say

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
change and we can see in here let's say

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
change and we can see in here let's say
we're<00:00:25.320> using<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:26.960> go2<00:00:27.960> or<00:00:28.349> an<00:00:28.439> arc<00:00:28.710> move<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
we're using a go2 or an arc move on the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.030 
we're using a go2 or an arc move on the
corner<00:00:29.670> using<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.960> J<00:00:31.230> let's<00:00:31.529> say<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.859> want

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
corner using I and J let's say we want

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.790 
corner using I and J let's say we want
to<00:00:32.099> make<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> radius<00:00:32.940> value<00:00:33.420> instead<00:00:33.899> now

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
to make this a radius value instead now

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
to make this a radius value instead now
to<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.760> need<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> modify<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.600> post

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
to do that we need to modify the post

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.340 
to do that we need to modify the post
processor<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.670> easiest<00:00:39.600> way<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
processor so easiest way to get to the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
processor so easiest way to get to the
post<00:00:40.530> processor<00:00:41.190> here's<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.760> could<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.090> them

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
post processor here's we could see them

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.080 
post processor here's we could see them
using<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.629> Haas<00:00:42.840> VF<00:00:43.260> mill<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:45.030> to

right click and go to edit and when I go
to<00:00:47.640> select<00:00:48.000> my<00:00:48.149> post<00:00:48.420> processor<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> list

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to select my post processor I get a list

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.590 
to select my post processor I get a list
of<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.370> let's<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.270> they're<00:00:51.420> dot

whether or not that uses sequence
numbers<00:03:04.750> now<00:03:05.739> in<00:03:05.950> here<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.489> could<00:03:07.180> see<00:03:07.359> line<00:03:07.570> two

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
numbers now in here I could see line two

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.949 
numbers now in here I could see line two
two<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.170> twenty<00:03:08.590> two<00:03:09.000> arcs<00:03:10.000> enter<00:03:10.299> it<00:03:10.480> asked

two and twenty two arcs enter it asked

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.270 
two and twenty two arcs enter it asked
me<00:03:11.079> whether<00:03:11.230> or<00:03:11.440> not<00:03:11.530> if<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.829> want<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.100> use

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
me whether or not if I want to use

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.120 
me whether or not if I want to use
absolute<00:03:12.970> incremental<00:03:13.569> or<00:03:13.690> an<00:03:13.810> unsigned<00:03:14.319> or<00:03:14.620> a

radius<00:03:15.670> let's<00:03:15.880> go<00:03:16.060> ahead<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.299> use<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> radius

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
radius let's go ahead and use a radius

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.990 
radius let's go ahead and use a radius
that's<00:03:17.049> e<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:17.769> we'll<00:03:17.950> change<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.400> value<00:03:18.609> to<00:03:18.850> E

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
that's e so we'll change this value to E

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.170 
that's e so we'll change this value to E
and<00:03:19.420> save<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.109> post

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
and save the post

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.569

I'll come back to Bobcat and we'll push

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.229 
I'll come back to Bobcat and we'll push
the<00:03:25.760> code<00:03:25.939> again<00:03:26.860> now<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:27.890> could<00:03:28.159> see<00:03:28.400> on<00:03:28.670> any

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
the code again now I could see on any

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.089 
the code again now I could see on any
one<00:03:29.360> of<00:03:29.420> these<00:03:29.599> line<00:03:29.870> 64<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.590> where<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.860> arc

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
one of these line 64 is where the arc

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.429 
one of these line 64 is where the arc
outputs<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.790> now<00:03:31.939> outputs<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.480> radius<00:03:32.930> value

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 
outputs it now outputs a radius value

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.130 
outputs it now outputs a radius value
instead<00:03:33.829> of<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.000> J<00:03:35.090> absolute<00:03:35.810> Center

instead of the I and J absolute Center
or<00:03:36.290> incremental<00:03:36.950> centers<00:03:37.720> now<00:03:38.720> most<00:03:39.170> changes

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799
