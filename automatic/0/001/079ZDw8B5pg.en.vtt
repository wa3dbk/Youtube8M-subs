this<00:01:34.259> was<00:01:34.409> an<00:01:34.530> interesting<00:01:34.770> conversation

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this was an interesting conversation

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.270 
this was an interesting conversation
because<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:37.170> very<00:01:37.380> tricky<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.890> what

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
because like it's very tricky like what

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
because like it's very tricky like what
makes<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.939> game<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.540> game<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.170> especially<00:01:40.530> game

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
makes a game a game and especially game

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
makes a game a game and especially game
of<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> year<00:01:41.400> time<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:42.090> does<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
of the year time like how does that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.170 
of the year time like how does that
stack<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:44.070> last<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.490> us<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.820> bioshock

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
stack up to the last of us to bioshock

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.539 
stack up to the last of us to bioshock
infinite<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.960> splinter<00:01:46.530> cell<00:01:46.710> blacklist<00:01:46.740> how

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
infinite to splinter cell blacklist how

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
infinite to splinter cell blacklist how
does<00:01:47.700> something<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:47.970> God<00:01:48.270> home<00:01:48.509> stack<00:01:49.079> up

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
does something like God home stack up

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.380 
does something like God home stack up
and<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.740> say<00:01:50.009> put<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:50.790> there<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.180> I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and I say put it right there with it I

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.249 
and I say put it right there with it I
don't<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.720> should<00:01:51.810> be<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> separate

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
don't think it should be in a separate

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.200 
don't think it should be in a separate
category<00:01:52.380> honestly<00:01:53.100> uh<00:01:53.130> yeah<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.090> of

and<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.610> am<00:02:02.909> thinking<00:02:03.659> about<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.110> my<00:02:04.229> list

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and I am thinking about it in my list

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.899 
and I am thinking about it in my list
that<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:04.920> doing<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.310> my<00:02:05.369> other<00:02:05.610> channel

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
that I'm doing for my other channel

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.999 
that I'm doing for my other channel
pretty<00:02:06.060> much<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> be

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
pretty much it it is not going to be

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.040 
pretty much it it is not going to be
like<00:02:08.280> number<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.660> top<00:02:09.869> ten

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
like number one but if I do a top ten

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
like number one but if I do a top ten
list<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.500> certainly<00:02:10.920> reaching<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
list it is certainly reaching that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520 
list it is certainly reaching that
because<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.270> emotional<00:02:12.840> experience<00:02:13.379> that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
because of the emotional experience that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
because of the emotional experience that
it<00:02:13.620> gave<00:02:13.770> me<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.190> how<00:02:14.520> impeccably<00:02:14.940> designed

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
it gave me and how impeccably designed

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.580 
it gave me and how impeccably designed
it<00:02:15.480> was<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.900> now<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.020> lot<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.230> people<00:02:16.319> think

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it was and now a lot of people think

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.690 
it was and now a lot of people think
that<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.920> got<00:02:17.069> home<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.400> just<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.610> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that it got home is just like a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
pretentious thing because oh it's like a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.010 
pretentious thing because oh it's like a
snooty<00:02:20.280> art<00:02:20.310> game<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.940> story<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.569> stuff<00:02:21.810> I

snooty art game with a story and stuff I

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.690 
snooty art game with a story and stuff I
didn't<00:02:22.709> feel<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:22.980> way<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.129> went<00:02:23.370> into<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> just

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
didn't feel that way I went into it just

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.729 
didn't feel that way I went into it just
kind<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.970> going<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.330> what<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.530> came

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
kind of going of what is this and I came

kind of going of what is this and I came
out<00:02:25.920> feeling<00:02:26.489> chills<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.120> smiling<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.959> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and almost tears and I think that's cool

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.089 
and almost tears and I think that's cool
when<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.019> game<00:02:31.200> makes<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.470> feel<00:02:31.620> emotions<00:02:32.010> like

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
when a game makes you feel emotions like

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.009 
when a game makes you feel emotions like
that<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.370> last<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.670> us<00:02:32.790> did<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.239> God<00:02:33.840> home

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
that the last of us did it to God home

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.270 
that the last of us did it to God home
did<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.560> well<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.980> said<00:02:35.160> this

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
did it just as well and I said this

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.800 
did it just as well and I said this
before<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> fact<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.269> not<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.480> long

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
before but the fact that it's not a long

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.300 
before but the fact that it's not a long
game<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.260> don't<00:02:37.410> think<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.650> matters<00:02:37.830> at<00:02:38.160> all<00:02:38.190> i

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
game I don't think that matters at all i

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.130 
game I don't think that matters at all i
think<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.730> what<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.390> feel<00:02:39.420> what<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.900> get

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
think it's what you feel what you get

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.540 
think it's what you feel what you get
out<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.470> game<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.830> what<00:02:41.280> makes<00:02:41.400> it

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
out of the game is what makes it

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.530 
out of the game is what makes it
important<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.000> like<00:02:42.120> i<00:02:42.209> said<00:02:42.239> i<00:02:42.420> do

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
important but like i said i do

like<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> movie<00:02:55.950> that's<00:02:56.459> being<00:02:56.730> said<00:02:57.260> some

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
like a movie that's being said some

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.479 
like a movie that's being said some
people<00:02:58.349> think<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.800> yeah<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.159> like<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> movie

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
people think that yeah it's like a movie

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.699 
people think that yeah it's like a movie
but<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.940> doesn't<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.569> falls<00:03:00.900> short<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.440> movie

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
but it doesn't it falls short of a movie

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.740 
but it doesn't it falls short of a movie
I<00:03:01.860> don't<00:03:02.280> think<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.550> because<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.090> think<00:03:03.420> it's

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
I don't think so because I think it's

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.800 
I don't think so because I think it's
just<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.680> what<00:03:05.010> people<00:03:05.129> are<00:03:05.400> used<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
just so not what people are used to

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.990 
just so not what people are used to
considering<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.019> game<00:03:07.640> it's<00:03:08.640> just<00:03:08.909> a

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
considering that the game it's just a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.610 
considering that the game it's just a
basic<00:03:09.180> story<00:03:09.599> it's<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.930> story<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.409> family

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
basic story it's a story of a family

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.890 
basic story it's a story of a family
there's<00:03:11.250> no<00:03:11.459> plot<00:03:11.819> twist<00:03:12.150> there's<00:03:12.659> no

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
there's no plot twist there's no

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.470 
there's no plot twist there's no
supernatural<00:03:13.769> elements<00:03:14.489> there's<00:03:14.970> no<00:03:15.120> nothing

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
supernatural elements there's no nothing

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.390 
supernatural elements there's no nothing
there<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> big<00:03:16.500> sense<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.830> dread<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
there is a big sense of dread in the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.520 
there is a big sense of dread in the
game<00:03:17.550> but<00:03:17.760> overall<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.989> pretty<00:03:19.019> normal

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
game but overall it's a pretty normal

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.350 
game but overall it's a pretty normal
straightforward<00:03:20.489> tale<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.090> also<00:03:21.239> a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
straightforward tale it is also a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.240 
straightforward tale it is also a
fantastic<00:03:21.750> tale<00:03:22.319> which<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.590> why<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.739> love<00:03:23.099> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
fantastic tale which is why I love the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.640 
fantastic tale which is why I love the
game<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.430> much<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.909> had<00:03:24.239> fun<00:03:24.599> uncovering<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
game so much I had fun uncovering the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.410 
game so much I had fun uncovering the
story<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.190> for<00:03:26.340> me<00:03:26.430> fun<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.879> always<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.239> top

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
story and for me fun is always the top

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.030 
story and for me fun is always the top
consideration<00:03:28.049> but<00:03:28.170> back<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.470> what<00:03:28.500> makes<00:03:28.860> a

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
consideration but back to what makes a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.699 
consideration but back to what makes a
game<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.459> game<00:03:29.670> what<00:03:30.629> makes<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.930> game<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.140> game<00:03:31.409> I'm

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
game a game what makes a game a game I'm

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.530 
game a game what makes a game a game I'm
pretty<00:03:32.159> liberal<00:03:32.700> with<00:03:32.879> this<00:03:33.150> I'm<00:03:33.299> pretty<00:03:33.480> open

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
I think everything is a game mostly you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.080 
I think everything is a game mostly you
know<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.040> walking<00:03:38.040> dead<00:03:38.220> last<00:03:38.400> year<00:03:38.700> too<00:03:38.909> when

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090

walking<00:03:39.299> dead<00:03:39.569> started<00:03:39.870> popping<00:03:40.110> up<00:03:40.170> unless

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
walking dead started popping up unless

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.750 
walking dead started popping up unless
people<00:03:40.769> were<00:03:40.860> saying<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.190> same<00:03:41.370> thing<00:03:41.549> well

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
people were saying the same thing well

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.509 
people were saying the same thing well
you<00:03:42.000> know<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.269> not<00:03:42.360> really<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.780> game<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:44.099> is

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
point-and-click first-person game you do

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.350

like<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.720> right<00:03:51.989> like<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.379> remember<00:03:52.769> when<00:03:53.489> the

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
like this right like I remember when the

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.630 
like this right like I remember when the
big<00:03:54.060> games<00:03:54.090> were<00:03:54.780> missed<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.709> Riven<00:03:56.430> and

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
big games were missed and Riven and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.490 
big games were missed and Riven and
stuff<00:03:56.909> like<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.120> those<00:03:57.870> were<00:03:58.049> games<00:03:58.290> that

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
stuff like that those were games that

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.410 
stuff like that those were games that
were<00:03:58.590> totally<00:03:59.069> boring<00:03:59.340> totally<00:03:59.970> full<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.180> no

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
were totally boring totally full of no

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.929 
were totally boring totally full of no
shooting<00:04:00.840> nothing<00:04:01.439> but<00:04:02.220> they<00:04:02.310> were<00:04:02.430> games<00:04:02.670> and

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
shooting nothing but they were games and

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.699 
shooting nothing but they were games and
everybody<00:04:03.180> played<00:04:03.540> them<00:04:03.689> and<00:04:03.900> now<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.560> we're

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
everybody played them and now that we're

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.320 
everybody played them and now that we're
kind<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.920> going<00:04:05.069> back<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.549> but<00:04:05.970> kind<00:04:06.209> of

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
kind of going back to that but kind of

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.210 
kind of going back to that but kind of
reaching<00:04:06.900> more<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.170> an<00:04:07.260> emotional<00:04:07.500> human

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
reaching more of an emotional human

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.740 
reaching more of an emotional human
level<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.670> lot<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.269> people<00:04:09.480> are<00:04:09.540> kind<00:04:09.720> of

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
level a lot of people are kind of

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.119 
level a lot of people are kind of
rebelling<00:04:10.170> against<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.799> think<00:04:10.920> that's

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
rebelling against that so I think that's

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.410 
rebelling against that so I think that's
just<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.370> really<00:04:11.580> interesting<00:04:11.879> discussion

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
just a really interesting discussion

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.720 
just a really interesting discussion
because<00:04:12.689> like<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:12.959> said<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.409> really<00:04:14.099> really

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
because like I said I really really

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.640 
because like I said I really really
enjoyed<00:04:15.030> gone<00:04:15.269> home<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.689> know<00:04:15.810> some<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.290> out

enjoyed gone home I know some of you out
there<00:04:16.859> do<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.400> be<00:04:17.699> sure<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:17.970> let<00:04:18.060> me<00:04:18.120> know<00:04:18.209> and

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
there do not be sure to let me know and

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.270 
there do not be sure to let me know and
let<00:04:18.570> me<00:04:18.690> know<00:04:18.720> why<00:04:18.930> let's<00:04:19.229> talk<00:04:19.440> about<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.769> but

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
let me know why let's talk about it but

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.520 
let me know why let's talk about it but
for<00:04:20.850> me<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.209> think<00:04:21.630> it's<00:04:21.720> worthy<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:22.019> putting<00:04:22.440> it

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
for me I think it's worthy of putting it

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.170 
for me I think it's worthy of putting it
on<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.650> list<00:04:22.889> and<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.130> do<00:04:23.190> certainly<00:04:23.880> think<00:04:24.120> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
on a list and I do certainly think that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.040 
on a list and I do certainly think that
got<00:04:24.419> home

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
got home
