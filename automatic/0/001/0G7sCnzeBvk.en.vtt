00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.770
 Congratulations on a crazy one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.629
 victories actually yes i found it 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 also a very strange game one 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.040
 opponent who 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.969
 who played very grouped await 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.940
 the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.619
 are just the photo of psv and then they go 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.000
 came out 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.730
 the we were sick in the first of two 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.840
 days when it happened also what 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.960
 problems with it 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.880
 despite that recently i think we should 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.400
 we get a good head start and then make it 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 we make a childish mistake and then it becomes 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.759
 in one 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.680
 and then you walk out to three in one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.640
 crazy way as it had at that time 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.690
 she 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.610
 some more control over the game 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 someone might be a little more 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.559
 ball for that we all the time and yes but 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.600
 then you also see that comes to me a bit more 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.010
 space and then I have my slaves well 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 only then you will get another one 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.190
 goal against and then we know close of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.579
 of the rest yes and that I think 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 stuff 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.710
 yes there must be sound and on it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.230
 playing with two languages has much more 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.270
 enjoy the feeling of NASA score 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.500
 bolus then the ball clear 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.150
 on the roof of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 from the goal and then you actually have to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.470
 walk out after after maybe we can take three 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.240
 and those options were absolute 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.950
 clue became the goal of my bag 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.560
 in the end still wrong I want so 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.360
 no offside no yes see I have how 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 well the that i'm not coming at that moment 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.390
 so good rating 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.900
 I do n't hear from me there for sure 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 well what how said of that some 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.040
 situations 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 role with the 16 that he is somewhat debatable 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.880
 were yes because they according to my seed they 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.930
 above the neck of labyad and and left 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.659
 just carry on 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.590
 yes that is also true in a strange one 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.570
 ambience too 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.440
 I had the impression that players also what 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.230
 had trouble with it 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.050
 the substrate with it to the field it 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.270
 was cold stadium was not yet full what they 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.030
 also he only say they stadium that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.560
 for i yes i i personally and beg 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.940
 my own title, ridiculous 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.920
 we have to play a quarter to nine 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.350
 very nice game and I know too 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.090
 that perhaps the various 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.800
 agreements are and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 but I speak by personal type 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.010
 title is just ridiculous rain 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.200
 there are children who want them whole 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.430
 like what they look like 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.619
 to psv 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.490
 and then at a quarter to nine years the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.980
 of the fool anyway won 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.420
 semifinals reached that step is put 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.980
 know your goal is always in this kind 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.750
 competitions and and and I are all 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.420
 there are always surprises 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.030
 and luckily the question wasn't 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.400
 beyonce where do you mean to reach you still 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.880
 two races and then wanted to 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.880
 grab a cup
