Hi, it's Karena and Katrina from Toneitup.com,
and we're on Livestrong Woman.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.830
Get ready to channel your inner goddess and
build inner and outer strength with this empowering

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.830
workout.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.710
This is your goddess routine in honor of all
you Boho babes.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:36.090
Alright, beautiful goddesses, let's start
off with our first move, the Goddess Squat.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.000
We're standing with a wide stance, toes are
pointed 45 degrees, arms are bent like this,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.030
and we squat down, as you raise your arms
up in a nice slow, controlled motion.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.120
Squatting down, make sure your knees don't
go past your toes.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.070
We're working our glutes, our hamstrings,
our quads.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.070
Abs are tight.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.830
We're also working our shoulders.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.729
And you can add weights to this movement,
if you like.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:14.850
I like squeezing down and squeezing all my
postural muscles.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.850
Last one.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.850
Alright, now you're gonna go into it a Warrior
2 Lunge.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.191
And I want you to bring your arms up, lean
forward, push back with your triceps, and

00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:25.649
then extend back up.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:26.649
Great job.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.049
And I want you to inhale and exhale.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.299
Breath through your movement.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.229
Think about your intention during this workout
of being a goddess.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.560
Good.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.680
Now this last one, I'm going to stay right
there.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.810
Go into a Warrior 3, and then fine tone.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.680
You got, it's hard on the sand.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.789
Good job.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:52.810
Fine toning those triceps.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.530
You may recognize this from our Beach Babe
DVD.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.049
Other lunge, go up and then go down.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.429
So our fine toning method is working those
big muscle groups, and enjoying the whole

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.789
exercise, and then fine toning and then cinching
at the end.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.000
Alright, now you're going to go into Warrior
3 with a smile and a fine tone.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.080
I'll hold you in the sand.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.540
The other great thing is you should ask another
goddess to join you for your goddess workout.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.010
Alright, now we'll come down into a downward
facing dog position, and then we'll add wings.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.689
Cause goddesses have wings.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.150
Alright, so your head is nice and neutral
with your spine.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.209
Lift your leg up, and you're just going to
create a wing, and bring your leg in, and

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.239
then back out.

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.239
Great job.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.099
So your abs are tight, your shoulders are
stabilizing you.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.220
Make sure you're breathing throughout this
entire exercise.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.650
Great job.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.300
Other leg, bring it up.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.290
Make that wing.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:18.640
Good, so it just comes out, in and up.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.353
Out, in and up.

00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:21.353
Good work.

00:03:21.353 --> 00:03:23.930
Alright, starting in a plank position, coming
to side plank, arm over head.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.170
Now give yourself a nice, big, warm hug, and
come back up.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.599
Working our shoulders, our obliques.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.659
Your feet can be stacked, or one in front
of the other.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.439
It's up to you.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:42.200
Warm hug, and then we'll switch sides.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:50.640
Beautiful, so controlled.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:04:02.390
2 more.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.390
Beautiful job.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.069
Make sure you share this workout with a friend.

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:16.660
Leave a comment below with what you want to
see next time.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.340
Bye guys.
