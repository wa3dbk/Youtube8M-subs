into the plastic boots I'm not really

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.020 
into the plastic boots I'm not really
sure<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.350> old<00:00:37.379> the<00:00:37.770> machine<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
sure how old the machine is I do have a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.900 
sure how old the machine is I do have a
diagram<00:00:40.130> to<00:00:41.600> explain<00:00:42.600> how<00:00:42.810> its<00:00:43.020> put<00:00:43.170> together

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
diagram to explain how its put together

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.700 
diagram to explain how its put together
as<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> takes<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.410> big

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
as you can see it takes up a big

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
as you can see it takes up a big
circumference<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.700> think<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.570> read<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.840> it's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
circumference I think I read that it's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.910 
circumference I think I read that it's
about<00:00:49.380> 79<00:00:50.219> square<00:00:51.149> feet<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.410> takes<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
about 79 square feet then it takes out a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.280 
about 79 square feet then it takes out a
floor<00:00:53.370> space<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:56.600> 350<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.930> under

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
floor space it's about 350 it's under

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.579 
floor space it's about 350 it's under
350<00:01:00.739> pounds<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.640> will<00:01:02.910> take<00:01:03.149> probably<00:01:03.589> three

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
350 pounds it will take probably three

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.710 
350 pounds it will take probably three
guys<00:01:04.799> four<00:01:05.369> guys<00:01:05.399> in<00:01:05.969> a<00:01:06.060> truck<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:07.560> move<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
guys four guys in a truck to move it

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.840 
guys four guys in a truck to move it
it's<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.440> very<00:01:10.500> enjoyable<00:01:11.130> machine

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it's actually a very enjoyable machine
