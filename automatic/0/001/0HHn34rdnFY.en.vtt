I<00:03:07.989> think<00:03:08.650> being<00:03:08.829> tasered<00:03:09.040> three<00:03:09.370> times<00:03:09.609> was

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
I think being tasered three times was

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.510 
I think being tasered three times was
two<00:03:11.170> times<00:03:11.440> too<00:03:11.680> many<00:03:11.710> for<00:03:12.040> anybody<00:03:12.340> get

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
two times too many for anybody get

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.840 
two times too many for anybody get
tasered<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:14.620> think<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.100> national<00:03:15.460> policy<00:03:15.820> on

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
tasered I think a national policy on

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.660 
tasered I think a national policy on
tasering<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.660> then<00:03:16.870> more<00:03:17.200> oversight<00:03:17.710> on<00:03:18.010> use

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
tasering and then more oversight on use

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.090 
tasering and then more oversight on use
of<00:03:18.700> force<00:03:18.880> would<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.870> something<00:03:20.560> positive<00:03:20.740> to

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
of force would be something positive to

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.370
