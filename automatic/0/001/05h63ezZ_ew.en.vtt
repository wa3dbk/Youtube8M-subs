fructose<00:00:24.510> corn<00:00:24.779> syrup<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.010> grocery<00:00:26.460> store

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
fructose corn syrup in the grocery store

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.929 
fructose corn syrup in the grocery store
and<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.660> cupboards<00:00:28.080> now<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:29.400> question<00:00:29.609> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and in your cupboards now one question I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.569 
and in your cupboards now one question I
always<00:00:30.150> get<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.869> why<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.410> manufacturers<00:00:32.340> put

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
always get is why do manufacturers put

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
always get is why do manufacturers put
high<00:00:32.850> fructose<00:00:33.120> corn<00:00:33.390> syrup<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:34.200> my<00:00:34.440> food

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
high fructose corn syrup in my food

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.310 
high fructose corn syrup in my food
instead<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> sugar<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.420> much<00:00:36.870> much<00:00:37.260> cheaper

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
instead of sugar it's much much cheaper

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.190 
instead of sugar it's much much cheaper
for<00:00:38.129> them<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.030> chemical<00:00:39.629> high

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
for them to use this chemical high

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
for them to use this chemical high
fructose<00:00:40.440> corn<00:00:40.680> syrup<00:00:40.980> than<00:00:41.640> natural<00:00:41.910> sugar

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
fructose corn syrup than natural sugar

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
fructose corn syrup than natural sugar
so<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.590> their<00:00:44.010> food<00:00:44.370> items<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
so actually their food items will be a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.760 
so actually their food items will be a
little<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.510> cheaper<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.289> you're<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> one

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
little bit cheaper but you're the one

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.459 
little bit cheaper but you're the one
that<00:00:46.950> suffers<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.600> number<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.200> place

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
that suffers so the number one place

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.810 
that suffers so the number one place
most<00:00:49.829> people<00:00:49.920> are<00:00:50.250> getting<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.640> high

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
most people are getting that high

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.380 
most people are getting that high
fructose<00:00:51.059> corn<00:00:51.300> syrup<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.710> soda<00:00:53.340> now<00:00:54.000> the

carbonated water high fructose corn

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.450 
carbonated water high fructose corn
syrup<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> second<00:01:01.350> ingredient<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.160> here

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
syrup so the second ingredient in here

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
syrup so the second ingredient in here
is<00:01:02.640> high<00:01:02.940> fructose<00:01:03.300> corn<00:01:03.570> syrup<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.260> there

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
is high fructose corn syrup and there

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.730 
is high fructose corn syrup and there
are<00:01:04.890> 40<00:01:05.400> grams<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.119> sugar<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
are 40 grams of sugar in this one can of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
are 40 grams of sugar in this one can of
coke<00:01:08.010> which<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> equivalent<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.570> 10

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
coke which is the equivalent of 10

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.620 
coke which is the equivalent of 10
teaspoons<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.740> sugar<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.670> imagine<00:01:11.909> putting<00:01:12.240> 10

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
teaspoons of sugar so imagine putting 10

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.080 
teaspoons of sugar so imagine putting 10
teaspoons<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.290> sugar<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.979> cup<00:01:14.250> adding<00:01:14.880> some

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
teaspoons of sugar in a cup adding some

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
teaspoons of sugar in a cup adding some
water<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:15.960> drinking<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:16.860> even

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
water and then drinking that or even

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.609 
water and then drinking that or even
worse<00:01:17.430> giving<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.570> kids<00:01:18.840> now

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

having Gatorade yourself and you think
it's<00:01:36.509> actually<00:01:36.720> healthier<00:01:37.380> than<00:01:37.530> soda<00:01:37.829> you're

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it's actually healthier than soda you're

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
wrong because there's high fructose corn
