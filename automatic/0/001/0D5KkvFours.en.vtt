00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
in this electronics review I'm going to

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.170 
in this electronics review I'm going to
cover<00:00:03.689> all<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.890> important<00:00:05.549> stuff<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:06.029> would

speakers but quick to note that the hole

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.450 
speakers but quick to note that the hole
cutout<00:00:24.960> size<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.529> more<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> six<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
cutout size is more like a six and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.220 
cutout size is more like a six and
three-quarters<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.810> doing<00:00:28.019> an

three-quarters so if you are doing an

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.710 
three-quarters so if you are doing an
upgrade<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.240> replacing<00:00:30.240> some<00:00:30.269> existing

people five minutes of your time
watching<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.399> entire<00:00:47.610> video<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> find

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
watching this entire video just to find

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
watching this entire video just to find
out<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.079> information<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.370> grille<00:00:50.850> height

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
out that information the grille height

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
out that information the grille height
which<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.780> no<00:00:51.840> significance<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.949> it's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
which is of no significance but it's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
which is of no significance but it's
0.94<00:00:53.879> inches<00:00:54.270> basically<00:00:54.600> an<00:00:54.809> inch<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
0.94 inches basically an inch the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
0.94 inches basically an inch the
mounting<00:00:55.980> depth<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.430> two<00:00:56.730> point<00:00:57.059> three<00:00:57.329> two

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
mounting depth is two point three two

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.229 
mounting depth is two point three two
inches<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> muck<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.910> mounting

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
inches and then the muck the mounting

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.200 
inches and then the muck the mounting
hole<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> actual<00:01:01.140> hole<00:01:01.410> cutout<00:01:02.399> diameter<00:01:02.940> for

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
hole the actual hole cutout diameter for

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.479 
hole the actual hole cutout diameter for
the<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.080> speaker<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:05.339> get

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the back of the speaker to actually get

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.800 
the back of the speaker to actually get
it<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.820> there<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.170> 5<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.710> 3/4

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
it in there is going to be 5 and 3/4

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.230 
it in there is going to be 5 and 3/4
exactly<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.020> exactly<00:01:10.560> 5<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.070> 3/4<00:01:11.580> inches<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
exactly so exactly 5 and 3/4 inches is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.960 
exactly so exactly 5 and 3/4 inches is
what<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> need<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.260> mount<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.650> speaker

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
what you need to mount the speaker

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.859 
what you need to mount the speaker
correctly<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.090> your<00:01:15.119> boat<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.570> everything

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
correctly in your boat so everything

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
correctly in your boat so everything
will<00:01:15.960> line<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.820> be<00:01:17.820> fine<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.000> said

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
will line up and be fine so like I said

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
will line up and be fine so like I said
these<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.420> new<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.020> 2013<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.740> believe<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
these are new for 2013 I believe that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010 
these are new for 2013 I believe that
they<00:01:23.369> came<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.210> little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.630> late

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
they came out just a little bit late

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.880 
they came out just a little bit late
later<00:01:25.470> than<00:01:25.680> Clarion<00:01:26.369> might<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.670> hoped<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
later than Clarion might have hoped to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.069 
later than Clarion might have hoped to
some<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.119> 2013<00:01:30.119> Clarion<00:01:30.540> marine<00:01:30.810> stuff

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
some of the 2013 Clarion marine stuff

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.950 
some of the 2013 Clarion marine stuff
isn't<00:01:31.290> even<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.799> yet<00:01:31.850> don't<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.970> why<00:01:33.210> but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
isn't even out yet don't know why but

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.670 
isn't even out yet don't know why but
here<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:34.920> are<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> grilles<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.390> them

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
here they are with the grilles on them

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.380 
here they are with the grilles on them
not<00:01:37.680> too<00:01:37.860> bad-looking

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
not too bad-looking

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
not too bad-looking

in the industry nothing exciting you can
see<00:02:39.210> when<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.390> even<00:02:39.750> use<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.080> finger<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
see when I even use one finger that the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.610 
see when I even use one finger that the
whole<00:02:41.010> cone<00:02:41.310> doesn't<00:02:41.640> flex<00:02:42.290> which<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.320> very

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
whole cone doesn't flex which is very

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.730 
whole cone doesn't flex which is very
good<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:43.890> rigidity<00:02:44.690> however<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.710> a

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
good for rigidity however there is a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.310 
good for rigidity however there is a
passive<00:02:47.810> crossover<00:02:48.810> right<00:02:48.930> here<00:02:49.080> on<00:02:49.200> the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
passive crossover right here on the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.960 
passive crossover right here on the
tweeter<00:02:49.560> which<00:02:49.710> is<00:02:49.890> not<00:02:50.070> uncommon<00:02:50.460> for<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.760> set

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
tweeter which is not uncommon for a set

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.180 
tweeter which is not uncommon for a set
of<00:02:51.060> flooring<00:02:51.390> speakers<00:02:51.780> however<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.830> tweeter

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
of flooring speakers however the tweeter

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.520 
of flooring speakers however the tweeter
which<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.210> dome<00:02:54.570> type<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:55.050> tweeter<00:02:55.260> which<00:02:55.380> is

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
which is a dome type of tweeter which is

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.480 
which is a dome type of tweeter which is
good<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.890> will<00:02:55.980> give<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> very<00:02:56.400> good

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
good so it will give you a very good

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.210 
good so it will give you a very good
dispersion<00:02:56.940> angle<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.860> angle<00:02:58.860> Bowl<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
dispersion angle is not angle Bowl you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.190 
dispersion angle is not angle Bowl you
cannot<00:02:59.490> pivot<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.150> tweeter<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.690> any<00:03:00.870> way<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
cannot pivot the tweeter in any way and

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.390 
cannot pivot the tweeter in any way and
I<00:03:01.230> think<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.590> might<00:03:01.770> be<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> good<00:03:02.190> thing

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
I think that might be a good thing

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.910 
I think that might be a good thing
because<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.150> see<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.290> salt<00:03:04.620> water

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
because I can see you know salt water

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
might help Dynamat also would definitely

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.710

are<00:05:09.990> three<00:05:10.290> ohms<00:05:10.500> so<00:05:11.390> what<00:05:12.390> does<00:05:12.480> that<00:05:12.510> mean

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
are three ohms so what does that mean

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.870 
are three ohms so what does that mean

connected<00:05:37.380> to<00:05:37.470> them<00:05:37.620> harder<00:05:38.190> as<00:05:38.340> if<00:05:39.000> you<00:05:39.120> are

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
connected to them harder as if you are

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.780 
connected to them harder as if you are
using<00:05:39.510> a<00:05:39.780> forum<00:05:40.290> speaker<00:05:40.680> so<00:05:41.160> if<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:41.550> have

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
using a forum speaker so if you have

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.310 
using a forum speaker so if you have
less<00:05:42.150> resistance<00:05:42.360> you<00:05:42.780> can<00:05:42.900> have<00:05:43.050> less

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
less resistance you can have less

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.610 
less resistance you can have less
wattage<00:05:43.919> output<00:05:44.220> these<00:05:45.030> since<00:05:45.600> they<00:05:45.750> are<00:05:45.870> 3-3

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
wattage output these since they are 3-3

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.159 
wattage output these since they are 3-3
ohms<00:05:46.860> as<00:05:47.070> opposed<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.430> four<00:05:47.880> will<00:05:48.660> play<00:05:48.900> more

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
ohms as opposed to four will play more

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.690 
ohms as opposed to four will play more
louder<00:05:49.440> so<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:49.919> will<00:05:50.190> get<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.400> performance

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
louder so you will get a performance

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.670 
louder so you will get a performance
boost<00:05:51.060> if<00:05:51.630> you're<00:05:51.840> just<00:05:51.960> doing<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.320> replacement

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
boost if you're just doing a replacement

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.840 
boost if you're just doing a replacement
if<00:05:52.919> you're<00:05:53.010> putting<00:05:53.220> them<00:05:53.340> in<00:05:53.430> new<00:05:53.580> you'll

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
if you're putting them in new you'll

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.550 
if you're putting them in new you'll
never<00:05:54.060> know<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.210> difference<00:05:54.419> however<00:05:55.169> that

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
never know the difference however that

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.050 
never know the difference however that
is<00:05:55.680> very<00:05:55.890> beneficial<00:05:56.070> especially<00:05:56.669> if<00:05:56.940> you're

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
is very beneficial especially if you're

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.730 
is very beneficial especially if you're
using<00:05:57.180> an<00:05:57.360> external<00:05:57.419> amplifier<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:58.290> get<00:05:58.440> more

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
using an external amplifier to get more

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.730 
using an external amplifier to get more
power<00:05:59.040> out<00:05:59.310> of<00:05:59.340> your<00:05:59.460> system<00:05:59.880> I<00:06:00.030> like<00:06:00.750> that<00:06:01.020> so

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
power out of your system I like that so

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.880 
power out of your system I like that so
that's<00:06:01.980> cool<00:06:02.220> Clarendon<00:06:02.820> a<00:06:02.910> pretty<00:06:03.090> nice<00:06:03.270> job

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
that's cool Clarendon a pretty nice job

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.810 
that's cool Clarendon a pretty nice job
aside<00:06:04.890> from<00:06:05.010> that<00:06:05.070> there's<00:06:05.400> not<00:06:05.490> a<00:06:05.550> whole<00:06:05.640> lot

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
aside from that there's not a whole lot

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.210 
aside from that there's not a whole lot

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
these or the component speakers there

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.340 
these or the component speakers there
step<00:06:11.460> up<00:06:11.640> stuff<00:06:11.850> amps<00:06:12.330> head<00:06:12.660> units<00:06:13.020> whatever
