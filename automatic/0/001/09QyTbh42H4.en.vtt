okay second of all if you notice this I
was<00:01:00.060> playing<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.570> did<00:01:00.810> almost<00:01:00.990> all<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
was playing there I did almost all the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.070 
was playing there I did almost all the
leads<00:01:01.860> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> high<00:01:02.460> string<00:01:03.000> I've<00:01:03.180> given

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
leads on the high string I've given

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.340 
leads on the high string I've given
lessons<00:01:04.410> on<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.830> before<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.250> YouTube<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
lessons on this before on YouTube and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
lessons on this before on YouTube and
the<00:01:07.350> majority<00:01:07.800> of<00:01:07.830> my<00:01:08.040> leads<00:01:08.370> are<00:01:08.670> usually<00:01:09.240> on

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the majority of my leads are usually on

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.470 
the majority of my leads are usually on
a<00:01:09.450> single<00:01:09.870> string<00:01:13.580> here<00:01:14.580> those<00:01:14.760> two<00:01:15.060> low<00:01:15.270> notes

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
a single string here those two low notes

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:32.880 
a single string here those two low notes
are<00:01:15.690> just<00:01:15.810> ringing<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> drone

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.500 

so<00:01:33.890> if<00:01:34.010> I<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:34.159> all<00:01:34.490> leads<00:01:34.790> up<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.180> down<00:01:35.330> on<00:01:35.479> one

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
so if I do all leads up and down on one

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.780 
so if I do all leads up and down on one
string<00:01:36.140> then<00:01:36.530> all<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:36.890> need<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.280> do<00:01:37.400> is<00:01:37.549> teach

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
string then all I need to do is teach

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.330 
string then all I need to do is teach
you<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:39.049> simple<00:01:39.680> mid-eastern

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
you what that simple mid-eastern

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.600 
you what that simple mid-eastern
sounding<00:01:41.000> scale<00:01:41.750> is<00:01:42.110> now<00:01:43.009> I'm<00:01:43.190> not<00:01:43.400> going<00:01:43.520> to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
sounding scale is now I'm not going to

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.370 
sounding scale is now I'm not going to
give<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.820> notes<00:01:44.090> because<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.659> don't<00:01:45.170> know<00:01:45.259> how

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.289 
give you notes because I don't know how
to<00:01:45.470> read<00:01:45.680> music<00:01:45.890> what<00:01:46.610> I'm<00:01:46.700> going<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.880> do<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.180> I

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
to read music what I'm going to do is I

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.990 
to read music what I'm going to do is I
printed<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:47.810> out<00:01:48.050> go<00:01:48.800> get<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.009> pencil<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.670> a

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
printed this out go get a pencil and a

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.899 
printed this out go get a pencil and a
piece<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.360> paper<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.930> copy<00:01:51.619> down<00:01:52.009> this

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
piece of paper and copy down this

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.820 
piece of paper and copy down this
exactly<00:01:53.810> if<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.830> look<00:01:55.070> there<00:01:55.460> are<00:01:55.490> two<00:01:55.909> lines

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
exactly if you look there are two lines

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.160 
exactly if you look there are two lines
my<00:01:57.830> hand<00:01:58.070> there<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.549> is<00:01:58.729> Shane's<00:01:59.030> raga<00:01:59.420> scale

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
my hand there this is Shane's raga scale

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.779 
my hand there this is Shane's raga scale
it's<00:02:00.799> tuning<00:02:01.369> is<00:02:01.520> GDG<00:02:02.299> now<00:02:03.259> as<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.979> go<00:02:04.220> up<00:02:04.429> the

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
it's tuning is GDG now as I go up the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:05.350 
it's tuning is GDG now as I go up the
fretboard

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
fretboard

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.630 
fretboard
I<00:02:05.509> have<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.720> certain<00:02:06.170> scale<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.340> scale

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
I have a certain scale and the scale

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.290 
I have a certain scale and the scale
changes<00:02:08.420> as<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:08.720> go<00:02:08.899> down<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.440> fretboard<00:02:09.940> why<00:02:10.940> I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
changes as I go down the fretboard why I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.120 
changes as I go down the fretboard why I
don't<00:02:11.930> know<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.110> sounded<00:02:12.410> right<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.769> me<00:02:12.920> and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
don't know it sounded right to me and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.949 
don't know it sounded right to me and
then<00:02:13.310> as<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.610> was<00:02:13.640> studying<00:02:14.000> some<00:02:14.450> MIDI<00:02:14.630> Stern

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
then as I was studying some MIDI Stern

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.229 
then as I was studying some MIDI Stern
stuff<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.410> learned<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:16.400> sits<00:02:16.730> our<00:02:16.910> players

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
stuff I learned that sits our players

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.750 
stuff I learned that sits our players
often<00:02:17.810> do<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.950> scale<00:02:19.220> going<00:02:19.489> up

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
often do this that the scale going up

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.150 
often do this that the scale going up
differs<00:02:20.239> from<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.569> scale<00:02:20.870> going<00:02:21.110> down<00:02:21.440> so

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
differs from the scale going down so

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.220 
differs from the scale going down so
going<00:02:22.730> up<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.239> have<00:02:23.510> zero<00:02:24.130> which<00:02:25.130> means<00:02:25.160> open

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
going up you have zero which means open

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.559 
going up you have zero which means open
this<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.130> high<00:02:28.430> string<00:02:28.790> then<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.420> hit

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
this is on the high string then you hit

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.670 
this is on the high string then you hit
the<00:02:29.690> first<00:02:29.900> fret<00:02:30.290> 4<00:02:31.030> bit<00:02:32.380> 7<00:02:33.400> 10<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.690> 12<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:36.470> is

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the first fret 4 bit 7 10 and 12 this is

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.229 
the first fret 4 bit 7 10 and 12 this is
what<00:02:36.920> going<00:02:37.400> up<00:02:37.700> sounds<00:02:38.239> like<00:02:39.940> let<00:02:40.940> me<00:02:41.030> put

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
what going up sounds like let me put

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.750 
what going up sounds like let me put
that<00:02:41.269> there's<00:02:41.739> open<00:02:43.269> first<00:02:44.980> more<00:02:45.980> than<00:02:46.220> bread

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
that there's open first more than bread

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.720 
that there's open first more than bread
fifth<00:02:48.390> fret<00:02:49.730> seventh<00:02:50.730> fret<00:02:52.400> tenth<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.610> then

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
fifth fret seventh fret tenth and then

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.540 
fifth fret seventh fret tenth and then
twelve

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.910 

so

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.760 

going<00:03:02.920> down<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.810> start<00:03:05.110> at<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.290> twelfth<00:03:05.620> fret

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
going down you start at the twelfth fret

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.460 
going down you start at the twelfth fret
