00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
Stahley over here and I was using the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
fletching Buzzard as well and so I would

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.380 
fletching Buzzard as well and so I would
just<00:00:25.019> say<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.580> good<00:00:26.699> idea<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.180> live

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
just say that it's a good idea on live

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.669 
just say that it's a good idea on live
realms<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.789> a<00:00:30.170> couple<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.380> more

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
realms to get and a couple of more

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.950 
realms to get and a couple of more
flying<00:00:32.550> pets<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.450> will<00:00:33.630> need<00:00:33.780> them

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
flying pets because you will need them

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.780 
flying pets because you will need them
for<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.380> particular<00:00:34.739> instance<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
for this particular instance of the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.500 
for this particular instance of the
celestial<00:00:36.270> tournament<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.739> I'm<00:00:38.520> gonna<00:00:39.149> cast

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
celestial tournament so I'm gonna cast

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.580 
celestial tournament so I'm gonna cast
the<00:00:40.350> arcane<00:00:41.340> store<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.200> then<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the arcane store and then I'm going to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
the arcane store and then I'm going to
follow<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.160> search<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.610> power<00:00:44.879> because

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
follow up with search of power because

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
follow up with search of power because
and<00:00:45.629> yeah<00:00:46.440> well<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.550> good<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:49.039> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and yeah well it's really good and the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.790 
and yeah well it's really good and the
reason<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.520> start<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.800> arcing

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
reason to start with the and arcing

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.939 
reason to start with the and arcing
storm<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.489> screamer<00:00:53.820> takes<00:00:54.149> off<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
storm is because screamer takes off and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
storm is because screamer takes off and
the<00:00:55.949> reason<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> easier<00:00:57.180> well<00:00:57.629> thing

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the reason I have the easier well thing

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.630 
the reason I have the easier well thing
here<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> because<00:01:00.140> it's<00:01:01.140> strong<00:01:01.680> against<00:01:02.539> the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
here is because it's strong against the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.660 
here is because it's strong against the
screamer<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.530> attacks<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> Screamers

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
screamer and the attacks the Screamers

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.510 
screamer and the attacks the Screamers
using<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.240> weak<00:01:09.479> against<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.920> you're<00:01:11.189> well

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
using is weak against if you're well

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
using is weak against if you're well
think<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:13.170> I'm<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.390> swap<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.600> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
think so now I'm going to swap in this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.660 
think so now I'm going to swap in this
lettering<00:01:16.530> buzzard<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.340> reason<00:01:17.640> for

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
lettering buzzard and the reason for

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.300 
lettering buzzard and the reason for
that<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.270> both<00:01:18.720> because<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> has<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.860> lift<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that is both because it has the lift of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
that is both because it has the lift of
ability<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:20.970> also<00:01:21.030> because<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.930> see

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
ability but also because as you can see

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.890 
ability but also because as you can see
and<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> attacks<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:25.640> tricare<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.090> weak

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and the attacks that tricare has is weak

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.140 
and the attacks that tricare has is weak
against<00:01:28.350> him

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
against him

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.050 
against him
so<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.750> can<00:01:30.200> last<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.650> little<00:01:30.800> longer<00:01:30.950> drag<00:01:31.880> is

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
so you can last a little longer drag is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.870 
so you can last a little longer drag is
really<00:01:32.360> hard<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.660> be<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.260> you<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:34.280> really<00:01:34.700> want

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
really hard to be so you you really want

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.290 
really hard to be so you you really want
to<00:01:35.710> well<00:01:36.710> avoid<00:01:37.280> as<00:01:37.460> much<00:01:37.610> damage<00:01:37.910> as<00:01:38.180> possible

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
to well avoid as much damage as possible

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.800 
to well avoid as much damage as possible
and<00:01:38.930> get<00:01:39.560> as<00:01:39.710> much<00:01:39.860> damage<00:01:40.430> in<00:01:40.760> as<00:01:41.000> possible<00:01:41.510> so

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
and get as much damage in as possible so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.020 
and get as much damage in as possible so
we're<00:01:42.110> going<00:01:42.260> to<00:01:42.380> do<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.000> adrenaline<00:01:44.000> rush

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
we're going to do the adrenaline rush

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.070 
we're going to do the adrenaline rush
because<00:01:44.510> then<00:01:44.840> when<00:01:45.020> he<00:01:45.140> does<00:01:45.350> these<00:01:47.080> there's

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
because then when he does these there's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.020 
because then when he does these there's
a<00:01:48.140> chance<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.500> you're<00:01:48.800> still<00:01:49.040> faster<00:01:49.850> if<00:01:49.940> you

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
a chance that you're still faster if you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.810 
a chance that you're still faster if you
have<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.210> fast<00:01:50.450> pet<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.500> fast<00:01:51.890> flyer<00:01:52.190> which<00:01:52.610> is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
have a fast pet in a fast flyer which is

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.080 
have a fast pet in a fast flyer which is
you<00:01:53.660> know<00:01:53.690> good<00:01:53.990> because<00:01:54.520> otherwise<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.940> can

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
you know good because otherwise you can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.570 
you know good because otherwise you can
get<00:01:56.240> extra<00:01:56.600> damaging<00:01:57.080> on<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.350> now<00:01:58.310> Adelle

the attacks appears does will also be
efficient<00:02:45.890> against<00:02:46.370> my<00:02:47.120> real<00:02:47.360> thing<00:02:47.600> I'll<00:02:47.870> be

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
efficient against my real thing I'll be

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.870

he can do a lot of damage to me
hopefully<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:54.280> that's<00:02:55.280> what<00:02:55.580> we're<00:02:55.730> gonna<00:02:55.850> do

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180
