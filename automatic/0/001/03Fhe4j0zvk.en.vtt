usual<00:00:08.130> incipio<00:00:08.610> packaging<00:00:09.179> what<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.019> do<00:00:10.170> is

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
usual incipio packaging what you do is

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.020 
usual incipio packaging what you do is
just<00:00:10.500> take<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.800> bill<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.250> here<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.849> then

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
just take this bill but here and then

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.200 
just take this bill but here and then
the<00:00:12.179> case<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.170> front<00:00:13.410> pops<00:00:13.620> up<00:00:13.830> like<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.219> so

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this is the the case itself this is the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390 
this is the the case itself this is the
the<00:00:18.300> aluminium<00:00:18.539> part<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.410> refers<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
jewel pro shine it's called jewel pro

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.279 
jewel pro shine it's called jewel pro
because<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.880> actually<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> rubber<00:00:24.930> part

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
because it's actually got a rubber part

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.990 
because it's actually got a rubber part
that<00:00:25.560> she<00:00:25.740> sits<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> middle<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.849> you've

that she sits in the middle and you've

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.169 
that she sits in the middle and you've
got<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> hard<00:00:27.449> outer<00:00:27.990> shell<00:00:28.580> this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> stand

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
got a hard outer shell this is the stand

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.060 
got a hard outer shell this is the stand

you get so you can stand the the phone
in<00:00:32.279> portrait<00:00:32.820> or<00:00:32.969> landscape<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.010> inside

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
in portrait or landscape and then inside

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.880 
in portrait or landscape and then inside
here<00:00:35.700> we've<00:00:36.120> got<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.390> screen<00:00:37.110> protector<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
applicator card for applying the screen

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.560 
applicator card for applying the screen
protector<00:00:43.760> again<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> case

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
protector again so this is the case

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
protector again so this is the case

itself as you can see this is the the
aluminium<00:00:47.640> section<00:00:48.480> you've<00:00:49.050> actually<00:00:49.200> got

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
aluminium section you've actually got

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.959 
aluminium section you've actually got
this<00:00:49.590> sert<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.100> rule<00:00:50.309> part<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.760> sits

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
this sert this rule part that sits

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.869 
this sert this rule part that sits
inside<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.949> takes<00:00:52.949> any<00:00:53.219> impact<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
incipio logo there so if we just take

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.330 
incipio logo there so if we just take
the<00:00:58.230> case<00:00:58.410> apart<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> rubber<00:00:59.940> inner

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
aluminium part pressed over the top of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.609 
aluminium part pressed over the top of
it<00:01:27.420> has<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> lot<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.890> nice<00:01:29.009> finish<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
here you've got the the black detail

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.260 
here you've got the the black detail
right<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.020> camera<00:01:34.200> hole<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
right in the camera hole so if you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.880 
right in the camera hole so if you
insert<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> side<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> volume

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
insert the side of that the volume

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.819 
insert the side of that the volume
buttons<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.310> first<00:01:38.930> pop<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.229> there<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
buttons on first pop that in there and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.219 
buttons on first pop that in there and
then<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> idea<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.270> need<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> push

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
then the idea is you just need to push

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.179 
then the idea is you just need to push
that<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.619> make<00:01:44.430> sure<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.820> rub<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.630> place

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
that down make sure the rub is in place

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.010 
that down make sure the rub is in place
so<00:01:47.189> start<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> bottom<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> cutouts<00:01:48.720> here

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
so start the bottom of the cutouts here

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.050 
so start the bottom of the cutouts here
