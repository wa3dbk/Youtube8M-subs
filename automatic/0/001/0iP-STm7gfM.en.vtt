00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.140
 good day 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.710
 I decided to record another video of this 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.710
 same 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:20.910
 how do you lead spazu Greece 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.439
 i will say pretty well i had 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.070
 Vladimir Mashkov 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.169
 that's what I shot without a sight 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.169
 me here for u pushing pkm and lkm 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.230
 it still can not draw this bug 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.230
 I do n't know what I said 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.239
 really 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.700
 very imbalance on this game because 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.620
 yours and souls games one very dynamic 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.370
 so fast and texture 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 Well 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.140
 can be said not for this game 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:06.260
 let him age country music shoot 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.210
 and the more developers always say 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.630
 what 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.540
 I would like to do more realistic and 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.350
 so on but do quite the opposite 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.350
 it turns out 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.300
 right here with a sniper too 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.300
 yes although pressed pkm 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.210
 so I do not know start sending Nekrasov 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.210
 some kind of goes 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.560
 but honestly, yes in two 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.560
 the ambassador did not like playing 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.860
 Has played the weather in group there is around 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 Well 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.850
 Well, here's a doctor you could not see me 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.040
 pick up 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.920
 Well 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 I must think everything 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.310
 once again show you how to play 10 good luck 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.310
 until
