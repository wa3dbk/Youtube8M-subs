00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
for $2.99 it's quite expensive because

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.080 
for $2.99 it's quite expensive because
all<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> other<00:00:34.100> skin<00:00:35.100> packs<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.640> usually<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
all the other skin packs is usually a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.020 
all the other skin packs is usually a
dollar<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> dollar<00:00:37.020> ninety-nine<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.030> yeah

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
dollar or a dollar ninety-nine so yeah

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
dollar or a dollar ninety-nine so yeah
I'm<00:00:39.540> guessing<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.140> Marvel<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.920> have

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I'm guessing because of Marvel they have

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.549 
I'm guessing because of Marvel they have
to<00:00:41.190> bump<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.730> price<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.120> bit<00:00:42.350> but<00:00:43.350> either

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to bump up the price a bit but either

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
to bump up the price a bit but either

come on
I'm<00:04:19.730> not<00:04:19.880> too<00:04:20.000> sure<00:04:20.150> if<00:04:20.180> he's<00:04:20.330> actually<00:04:20.450> gonna

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
I'm not too sure if he's actually gonna

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.460 
I'm not too sure if he's actually gonna
do<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:23.270> showed<00:04:23.480> in<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.810> pictures<00:04:24.140> people

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
do it it showed in the pictures people
