00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
back from our laboratory in deerfield

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.129 
back from our laboratory in deerfield
beach<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.400> it<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.460> glazed<00:00:15.150> up<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> ready<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
beach and it is glazed up and ready to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.790 
beach and it is glazed up and ready to
be<00:00:16.260> inserted<00:00:17.449> we<00:00:18.449> did<00:00:18.690> want<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.529> over

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
be inserted we did want to just go over

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.349 
be inserted we did want to just go over
this<00:00:21.380> proceeding<00:00:22.430> video<00:00:23.430> first<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.210> you

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
this proceeding video first so that you

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.230 
this proceeding video first so that you
get<00:00:24.480> an<00:00:24.630> idea<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:25.019> how<00:00:25.490> we<00:00:26.490> ended<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:26.880> with<00:00:27.060> this

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
get an idea of how we ended up with this

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.370 
get an idea of how we ended up with this
case<00:00:27.650> if<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:29.400> recall<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:30.570> did<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.900> abyss<00:00:31.140> bake

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
case if you recall we did do abyss bake

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.889 
case if you recall we did do abyss bake
trying<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.880> felt<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.510> central

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
trying and we felt that the central

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.780 
trying and we felt that the central
incisors<00:00:34.290> were<00:00:34.710> somewhat<00:00:35.160> little<00:00:35.430> too<00:00:35.579> long

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
incisors were somewhat little too long

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.319 
incisors were somewhat little too long
so<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.329> ended<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.750> shortening<00:00:37.380> them<00:00:38.329> about

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
so we ended up shortening them about

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.200 
so we ended up shortening them about
three-quarters<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.320> millimeter<00:00:41.210> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
three-quarters of a millimeter the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.340 
three-quarters of a millimeter the
laboratory<00:00:42.690> also<00:00:43.290> added<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.809> cdjs<00:00:45.809> which

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
laboratory also added in the cdjs which

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
laboratory also added in the cdjs which
are<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.950> cement<00:00:47.340> enamel<00:00:47.760> junctions<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.539> make

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
are the cement enamel junctions to make

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.020 
are the cement enamel junctions to make
the<00:00:48.809> teeth<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.260> anatomically<00:00:50.030> correct

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the teeth look more anatomically correct

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.500 
the teeth look more anatomically correct
now<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:53.070> gum<00:00:53.399> line<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.180> gum

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
now I have the the gum line or the gum

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
now I have the the gum line or the gum
tissue<00:00:54.539> pulled<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.559> way<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.980> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
tissue pulled out of the way here just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.290 
tissue pulled out of the way here just
to<00:00:56.309> show<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:57.899> final<00:00:58.530> result<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.399> we

to get this case in for Ken will be
cementing<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> permanently<00:01:29.340> by<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.790> I've

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
cementing it permanently by the way I've

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.660 
cementing it permanently by the way I've
been<00:01:30.150> asked<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:31.229> type<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> cements<00:01:32.040> would

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
been asked what type of cements would

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.490 
been asked what type of cements would
you<00:01:32.820> prefer<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> put<00:01:34.200> them<00:01:34.380> in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you prefer I like to put them in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.539 
you prefer I like to put them in
permanently<00:01:35.240> there's<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.420> nothing<00:01:36.570> else

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
permanently there's really nothing else

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.030 
permanently there's really nothing else
I<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.390> case<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.590> were<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
I can do for this case if we were to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
I can do for this case if we were to
have<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.340> repair<00:01:41.700> something<00:01:42.000> along<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> way

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
have to repair something along the way

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.350 
have to repair something along the way
we<00:01:43.649> would<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> directly<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> mouth<00:01:44.939> so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
we would do it directly in the mouth so

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.350 
we would do it directly in the mouth so
I<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:46.439> anticipate<00:01:46.740> any<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:48.240> believe

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
I don't anticipate any and I believe

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.630 
I don't anticipate any and I believe
we're<00:01:48.930> well<00:01:49.280> structured<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> well

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
we're well structured and well

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
we're well structured and well
reinforced<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.899> putting<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.740> two

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
reinforced we are putting this in in two

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.200 
reinforced we are putting this in in two
pieces<00:01:53.270> these<00:01:54.270> are<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> abutments<00:01:56.060> will<00:01:57.060> be

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
pieces these are the abutments will be

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.200 
pieces these are the abutments will be
submitting<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> right<00:01:58.170> side<00:01:58.439> first<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.280> then

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
submitting the right side first and then

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539 
submitting the right side first and then
rechecking<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.899> contact<00:02:01.530> area<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.280> then

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
rechecking the contact area and then

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.569 
rechecking the contact area and then
cementing<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> left<00:02:03.509> side<00:02:04.100> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.280> dr.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
cementing the left side this is dr.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.550 
cementing the left side this is dr.
