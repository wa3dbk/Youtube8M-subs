00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.470
 evil now elected world of those of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.789

 do not want to make the effort ironing inserts 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.250
 laws remain rope that's 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.259
 really make the effort 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.729
 it is philippe rémond who has the time in 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:12.720
 hand and who knows it may be 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:14.340
 playable with the client and uses team 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.260

 2015 for him record of Algeria and well 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.130
 sure pascal thibaux collection between 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.810
 miles hour 11 am he was he is 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.380
 extremely beautiful almost too wise 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.210
 behind the second lever that I have a 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.730
 little bit that a little bit slowed down his 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.660
 ardors a tool that was before him 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.010
 before being pushed into the street 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.140
 maybe ask him to move away 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.040
 rather sell I send the finish 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.270
 the avenue thing failed to beat 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.520
 Caen to Algiers in any case it was very 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:14.420
 well conducted very well built and very 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:16.190
 applied in the attack the Algerian who 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.470
 just been 4 seconds and also from rené 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.310
 auguin marathonman today in 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.700
 the renault team to the indians 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.950
 he was treated to his full-page portrait 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.220
 this man indispensable to athletics 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.220
 French 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.700
 and here is philippe rémaud grands 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.130
 coaches of the middle distance filtered - which 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.120
 perf which chrono marcil payment of this 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.220
 that they talk about it later the best 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.540
 global performance in 2015 it's very 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.580
 far away his four seconds more 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.600
 the Olympic champion from london 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.760
 over 15 years it's a very interesting 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.020
 this court to see the application and the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.970
 how they built 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.710
 philippe meets the second catcher and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.210
 as he had been patient 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.500
 applied I think he has ants 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.140
 in the legs he would have liked to leave 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.380
 faster earlier but it was good 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.090
 is well measured and the result counts 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.160
 even if we are strong in advertising imagine 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.470
 that he is no longer leaving a little earlier 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.550
 but I believe that to calm them down 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.140
 ardors can hold to the end 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.140
 so it was very very well done 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.940
 and the hare a civic finished the race to 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.020
 note that he is second in 2 15 78 who 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.290
 have been the world's best place to 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.760
 the year to May 6 but when we know 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.130
 two finish makhloufi the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.770
 looseness also a looseness he has a 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.410
 eye on the clock he always has this 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.170
 terminal tip rather unique 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.490
 and we're really looking forward to sequins 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.340
 herculis meeting really from the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.590
 find on his team in the lead his 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.920
 woman at the lighthouse anyway on the on 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.170
 the 1000 m to people and for the important 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.750
 the pole and yet that's when we 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.040
 sees the two traits 08 new record 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.720
 from Algeria to the ficg makhloufi 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.950
 super record of Algeria worried it's 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.330
 always hard to announce a record is 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.330
 to get to her realized
