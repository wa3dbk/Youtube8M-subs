00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
taking place in Berlin so Berlin is a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.130 
taking place in Berlin so Berlin is a
part<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.790> Germany<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> fact<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.050> is

known<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.530> there<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> infer<00:00:35.399> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
known on there we can kind of infer that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
known on there we can kind of infer that
it'll<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.860> part<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> galaxy<00:00:38.190> note<00:00:38.460> 3

launching as there's nothing else in
Samsung's<00:00:41.100> line<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.820> says<00:00:42.149> note<00:00:42.420> in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
Samsung's line that really says note in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.420 
Samsung's line that really says note in

I could care less if it as horns growing
out<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.770> want<00:01:37.979> the

the phone I think that's what most geeks
like<00:01:42.210> myself<00:01:42.390> want<00:01:42.840> maybe<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.350> feasible

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
like myself want maybe it's not feasible

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.130 
like myself want maybe it's not feasible
for<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> average<00:01:44.340> consumer<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.509> again

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
of the note 3 specifications here I'm

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.090 
of the note 3 specifications here I'm
just<00:01:51.600> gonna<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.899> over<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> few<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.740> it'll

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
just gonna go over a few I think it'll

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.760 
just gonna go over a few I think it'll
either<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.399> 5.7<00:01:54.360> inches<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:54.750> 6<00:01:55.079> inches<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
either be 5.7 inches or 6 inches the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.249 
either be 5.7 inches or 6 inches the
ascend<00:01:56.100> mate<00:01:56.250> -<00:01:56.490> made<00:01:56.729> by<00:01:56.759> Huawei<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.540> about<00:01:57.869> 6

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
ascend mate - made by Huawei is about 6

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.980 
ascend mate - made by Huawei is about 6
point<00:01:58.590> 1<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.100> 6<00:01:59.430> point<00:01:59.640> 2<00:01:59.700> inches<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.750> kind

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
point 1 to 6 point 2 inches so it kind

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.690 
point 1 to 6 point 2 inches so it kind
of<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> extreme<00:02:01.799> end<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.369> don't<00:02:02.430> think

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
of is the extreme end and I don't think

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340 
of is the extreme end and I don't think
Samsung<00:02:02.909> wants<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.659> far<00:02:03.899> considering

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
Samsung wants to go that far considering

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.700 
Samsung wants to go that far considering
their<00:02:04.469> note<00:02:04.649> 2<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> only<00:02:05.579> 5.5<00:02:06.509> inches<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.469> we

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
their note 2 is only 5.5 inches so we

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.169 
their note 2 is only 5.5 inches so we
have<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> lot<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.160> expect<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.879> think<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
have a lot to expect here I think the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.639 
have a lot to expect here I think the
processor<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.690> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:09.989> absolutely

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
processor is going to be absolutely

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.680 
processor is going to be absolutely

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
flying off the doors I think

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.120 
flying off the doors I think
this<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.900> gonna<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> most<00:02:13.440> powerful<00:02:13.650> phone
