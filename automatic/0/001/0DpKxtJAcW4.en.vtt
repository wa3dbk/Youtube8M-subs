just<00:00:10.980> talking<00:00:11.370> about<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.750> for<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.809> purpose<00:00:13.080> of

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
just talking about it for the purpose of

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.039 
just talking about it for the purpose of
speed<00:00:13.530> i<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.889> whether<00:00:14.250> time<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.330> i<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.570> set

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
speed i have whether time so i can set

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.680 
speed i have whether time so i can set
the<00:00:16.260> weather<00:00:16.590> at<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.949> time<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> cool<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the weather at the time with a cool and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.670 
the weather at the time with a cool and
tough<00:00:19.439> nut<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.100> i<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.520> erase<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.090> mess<00:00:21.680> okay

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
tough nut so i can erase the mess okay

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.390 
tough nut so i can erase the mess okay
so<00:00:22.880> its<00:00:23.880> launch<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.420> server<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.400> somewhere

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
so its launch the server and somewhere

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.089 
so its launch the server and somewhere
it<00:00:26.519> should<00:00:26.789> say<00:00:27.060> create<00:00:27.619> creating<00:00:28.619> config

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
it should say create creating config

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.669 
it should say create creating config
file<00:00:29.310> config<00:00:29.849> file<00:00:30.029> created<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.500> not

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
file config file created if you have not

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
file config file created if you have not
ran<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.980> before<00:00:32.309> then<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> should<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.630> this

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
ran it before then you should get this

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.380 
ran it before then you should get this
little<00:00:34.079> config<00:00:34.559> folder<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.160> go<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
little config folder and go in here the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.569 
little config folder and go in here the
lower<00:00:36.600> bound<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> minimum<00:00:37.710> amount<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
lower bound is the minimum amount of

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369 
lower bound is the minimum amount of
time<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.120> will<00:00:39.210> take<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.719> us<00:00:39.780> no<00:00:39.960> block<00:00:40.200> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
time it will take for us no block to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.410 
time it will take for us no block to
form<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> want<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.790> instant

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
form so if you want it to be instant

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.889 
form so if you want it to be instant
you'd<00:00:42.660> put<00:00:42.899> 0<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.550> put<00:00:44.789> rd<00:00:45.360> time<00:00:45.629> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you'd put 0 and then you put rd time in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.069 
you'd put 0 and then you put rd time in
a<00:00:46.079> 0<00:00:46.800> because<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> rd<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:48.030> whatever<00:00:48.660> number

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
a 0 because the rd time whatever number

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.479 
a 0 because the rd time whatever number
you<00:00:49.110> put<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.010> generate<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you put in here it will generate a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.950 
you put in here it will generate a
random<00:00:51.079> value<00:00:52.079> between<00:00:52.440> 0<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.399> let's<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.329> 420

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
random value between 0 and let's see 420

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
random value between 0 and let's see 420
in<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.620> generate<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> random<00:00:56.340> value<00:00:56.640> between

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
in will generate a random value between

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.990 
in will generate a random value between
0<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.690> 20<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.350> add<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.489> onto<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.850> lower

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
0 and 20 and add that onto the lower

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.610 
0 and 20 and add that onto the lower
bound<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> don't<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> random

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
bound so if you don't want a random

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.590 
bound so if you don't want a random
value<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> end<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.730> stick<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.329> 0

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
value on the end of it just stick in 0

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.929 
value on the end of it just stick in 0
or<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> take<00:01:05.489> anywhere

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
or you can have it to take anywhere

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.940 
or you can have it to take anywhere
between<00:01:06.000> 60<00:01:06.720> seconds<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.970> two<00:01:08.970> minutes<00:01:09.330> so

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
between 60 seconds and two minutes so

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.289 
between 60 seconds and two minutes so
purpose<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.189> tutorial<00:01:11.400> anywhere

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
purpose of this tutorial anywhere

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.170 
purpose of this tutorial anywhere
between<00:01:12.420> 0<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.320> 10<00:01:13.560> seconds<00:01:14.130> max<00:01:14.939> height

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
between 0 and 10 seconds max height

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.960 
between 0 and 10 seconds max height
pretty<00:01:15.689> self-explanatory<00:01:16.670> it's<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> max

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
pretty self-explanatory it's the max

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.469 
pretty self-explanatory it's the max
height<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> let's<00:01:19.860> save<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.490> launch<00:01:21.270> our

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
height so let's save that and launch our

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:31.160 
height so let's save that and launch our
server<00:01:21.890> look<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.159> minecraft<00:01:29.689> toy<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.140> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
server look for not minecraft toy and I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.469 
server look for not minecraft toy and I
just<00:01:31.710> give<00:01:31.950> myself<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.570> tool<00:01:33.570> give<00:01:34.140> T<00:01:34.770> star<00:01:35.479> 34

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just give myself the tool give T star 34

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:47.389 
just give myself the tool give T star 34
working<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:38.659> slime<00:01:39.860> stick<00:01:44.509> ok<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.920> as

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
