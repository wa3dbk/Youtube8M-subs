00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
going to get good at Search and Destroy

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.880 
going to get good at Search and Destroy
and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.030> takes<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.420> lot<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.659> practice<00:01:58.229> don't

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and it takes a lot of practice don't

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
and it takes a lot of practice don't
don't<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.880> me<00:02:00.000> wrong<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.840> will<00:02:01.079> take<00:02:01.259> practice

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
don't get me wrong it will take practice

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.160 
don't get me wrong it will take practice
but<00:02:02.090> that's<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.299> I'm<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:04.079> to

teach you and then you gotta you know

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.620 
teach you and then you gotta you know
practice<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.390> you'll<00:02:06.540> get

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
practice this and you'll get

practice this and you'll get
considerably<00:02:07.140> better<00:02:07.320> over<00:02:07.710> time<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.729> um<00:02:09.149> one

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
considerably better over time so um one

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.449 
considerably better over time so um one
of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.810> easiest<00:02:10.080> ways<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:10.920> practice

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
of the easiest ways to you know practice

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.080 
of the easiest ways to you know practice
this<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.090> run<00:02:12.330> routes

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
this is to run routes

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.670 
this is to run routes
pick<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.330> map<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.930> once<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.170> start<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.530> match

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
pick a map and once you start the match

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.650 
pick a map and once you start the match
you<00:02:15.430> usually<00:02:15.580> have<00:02:16.060> enough<00:02:16.239> time<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.569> your

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
you usually have enough time in your

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.030 
you usually have enough time in your
head<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.900> think<00:02:17.110> about<00:02:17.319> this<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:17.680> just<00:02:17.920> be

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
head to think about this but just be

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.380 
head to think about this but just be
like<00:02:18.190> okay<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.670> want<00:02:18.879> to<00:02:18.910> go<00:02:19.000> left<00:02:19.269> right

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
like okay do I want to go left right

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.869 
like okay do I want to go left right
forward<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> middle<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.010> side<00:02:21.250> you

fast other than that you need to have a
machine<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.680> submachine<00:02:48.310> gun<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.599> reason

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
machine a submachine gun and the reason

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.660 
machine a submachine gun and the reason
being<00:02:50.049> is<00:02:50.290> there's<00:02:50.470> more<00:02:50.530> mobility<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.579> know

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
being is there's more mobility you know

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.339 
being is there's more mobility you know
extreme<00:02:52.360> conditioning<00:02:52.840> helps<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.200> run

extreme conditioning helps you run

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.509 
extreme conditioning helps you run
farther<00:02:53.620> but<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.920> doesn't<00:02:54.190> make<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.310> run

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
farther but it doesn't make you run

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.030 
farther but it doesn't make you run
faster<00:02:54.780> having<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.870> submachine<00:02:56.349> gun<00:02:56.560> will<00:02:56.829> do

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
faster having a submachine gun will do

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.190 
faster having a submachine gun will do
that<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:58.480> just<00:02:58.569> got<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> stay<00:02:58.989> mobile

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200
