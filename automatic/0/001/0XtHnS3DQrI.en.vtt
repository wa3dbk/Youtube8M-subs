them yes I'd like to see a few I think I

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.229 
them yes I'd like to see a few I think I
think<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.709> cool<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.880> special

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
think I think it's cool it's a special

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.289 
think I think it's cool it's a special
event<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.769> think<00:03:10.769> for<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> 250k<00:03:11.579> realistically

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
event I think for a 250k realistically

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.680 
event I think for a 250k realistically
like<00:03:12.690> more<00:03:13.680> than<00:03:13.829> two<00:03:14.040> would<00:03:14.340> be<00:03:14.690> stretching

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
like more than two would be stretching

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.410 
like more than two would be stretching
but<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.410> think<00:03:16.620> probably<00:03:17.280> one<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.700> year<00:03:17.970> as<00:03:18.209> like

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
but I think probably one a year as like

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.110 
but I think probably one a year as like
a<00:03:18.450> final<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.650> $100,000<00:03:20.400> buy<00:03:20.549> em<00:03:20.670> series<00:03:20.970> would

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
a final of $100,000 buy em series would

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.090 
a final of $100,000 buy em series would
be<00:03:21.209> sweet<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.350> mean<00:03:22.530> maybe<00:03:22.709> if<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.980> could

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
be sweet and I mean maybe if you could

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.099 
be sweet and I mean maybe if you could
find<00:03:23.340> enough<00:03:23.880> people<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.450> two-year<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.079> a

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
find enough people to two-year like a

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.780 
find enough people to two-year like a
one<00:03:25.350> in<00:03:25.470> Vegas<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.070> on<00:03:26.160> Carl<00:03:26.400> or<00:03:26.579> kind<00:03:26.760> of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
one in Vegas on and on Carl or kind of

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.420 
one in Vegas on and on Carl or kind of
thing<00:03:26.970> or<00:03:27.239> maybe<00:03:27.510> even<00:03:27.930> 31<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.769> Macau<00:03:29.010> one<00:03:29.310> in

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
thing or maybe even 31 in Macau one in

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.900 
thing or maybe even 31 in Macau one in
Vegas<00:03:29.459> one<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> Monte<00:03:30.120> Carlo<00:03:31.609> but<00:03:32.609> yeah<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.819> mean

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
Vegas one a Monte Carlo but yeah I mean

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.090 
Vegas one a Monte Carlo but yeah I mean
I<00:03:33.329> think<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.930> could<00:03:34.049> be<00:03:34.170> sweet<00:03:34.290> if<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:34.620> you

I think it could be sweet if it's you
know<00:03:35.190> if<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.430> starts<00:03:35.700> being<00:03:35.880> more<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.239> more<00:03:36.359> of
