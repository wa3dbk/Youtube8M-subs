00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.680
 good gentlemen today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.900
 make elements around the world this 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.269
 tutorial is dedicated to freestyle gioja 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.129
 dating juÃ¡rez and fer if I do not pronounce you 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.230
 the names correctly forgive me I am 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.719
 dyslexic this trick is based on all and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.970
 itvs in in 1 touch that is to say a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.990
 intermediate touch between them friends for 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.580
 learn to do this trick 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.349
 you should correctly follow these steps 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.759
 since it is very important to know the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.470
 technique and do it at the right time 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.390
 it's also fine and we're going to the point 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 you have to master the senses towards 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.599
 inside followed with the leg with the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.879
 that you want to learn it as I refer 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.410
 three minimums the more the better you learn to 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.510
 make an incidence inside raising 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.980
 the ball higher up so this is 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.899
 fundamental to learn movement 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.789
 initial focus on pushing the ball 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.379
 using the area to entertain the foot and the 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.059
 instep upwards so that the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.610
 ball but leaving you room to pass 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.800
 Leg 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.450
 Do the same as before but when you have 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.190
 passed about half of the 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.190
 return to the ball jumps with the leg of 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.080
 support so that he tries to imitate it 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.180
 now without the ball imitates the movement of 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.920
 Let's put the previous step into practice and 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.870
 just then add another turn more what 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.940
 faster than it was practiced several 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.100
 times after this throw the ball to 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.570
 soil and when bouncing jumps with the foot 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.340
 of support and gives the two returns to the ball 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.670
 Put the previous step into practice 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.780
 now the penultimate step let's recap 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.220
 starting from a position in which the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.200
 ball is close to your center 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.820
 gravity make a way inward that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.100
 go higher than normal height 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.110
 when you spend about half of 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.759
 the first round jumps with the leg of 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.920
 support and try to complete the second 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.330
 turn the ball completely past the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.310
 leg around as fast as 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.410
 You can even if you do not complete it, it's the same 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.509
 the technique you will already have it is the most 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.130
 important the final step is that you 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.080
 get to touch the ball and push towards 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.090
 up after the second revolution 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.619
 the touch technique is to catch the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.180
 appropriate moments to start the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.490
 movement jumping and moving the leg 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.530
 fast is transcendental as well as pass 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.900
 the revolutions completely around 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.740
 of the ball as final advice I can 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.360
 say you are 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.280
 you have to know how to combine these two 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.680
 ideas pass the full turns to 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.000
 ball and focus and move fast one 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.740
 Once you master it to gain speed 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.840
 you have to pass the leg attached to the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.330
 ball and incorporate it and train the lem 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.549
 in no jump never jump before 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.530
 time and depending on the extent of the 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.090
 physical of each one in the ball stuck 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.420
 center of gravity to guarantee 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.420
 stability
