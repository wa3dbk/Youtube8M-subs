00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
because as you know as you've been

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130 
because as you know as you've been
exercising<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:18.030> eating<00:01:18.240> healthy<00:01:18.450> you're

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
exercising and eating healthy you're

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.560 
exercising and eating healthy you're
gaining<00:01:19.409> muscle<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.250> muscle<00:01:21.210> weighs<00:01:21.540> more

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
gaining muscle and muscle weighs more

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.080 
gaining muscle and muscle weighs more
than<00:01:22.080> fat<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.490> doesn't<00:01:23.729> weigh<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.030> than

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
than fat or it doesn't weigh more than

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.660 
than fat or it doesn't weigh more than
fat<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.810> takes<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.470> less<00:01:25.799> space<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.280> it's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
fat but it takes up less space and it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.719 
fat but it takes up less space and it's
more<00:01:26.880> dense<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> may<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.799> getting<00:01:29.130> higher

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
more dense so you may be getting higher

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
more dense so you may be getting higher
on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> scale<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.930> your<00:01:31.170> weight<00:01:31.350> goes<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.799> but

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
on the scale as your weight goes up but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560 
on the scale as your weight goes up but
you're<00:01:32.189> getting<00:01:32.400> leaner<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.030> tighter<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you're getting leaner and tighter and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.390 
you're getting leaner and tighter and
that's<00:01:34.020> where<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> dress<00:01:34.740> sizes

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that's where you go with the dress sizes

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
that's where you go with the dress sizes
so<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.180> people<00:01:36.299> wanted<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.900> how<00:01:37.140> much
