00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
but just you know a definition building

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.940 
but just you know a definition building
is<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.340> I'll<00:01:29.460> call<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.320> because<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.829> know

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
is what I'll call it because you know

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.500 
is what I'll call it because you know

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
right now I'm focusing on healing

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.710 
right now I'm focusing on healing
but<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.410> really<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.550> important<00:01:37.240> for<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:37.600> many

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
but it really is important for so many

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.050 
but it really is important for so many
reasons<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.470> do<00:01:38.650> resistance<00:01:39.310> training<00:01:39.400> and

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
reasons to do resistance training and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.740 
reasons to do resistance training and
it's<00:01:40.450> not<00:01:40.690> just<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:42.280> know<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:43.450> when<00:01:43.600> you're

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
losing weight you're going to need to do

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.550 
losing weight you're going to need to do
resistance<00:01:46.180> training<00:01:46.270> because<00:01:46.810> as<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.290> age

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
resistance training because as you age

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.460 
resistance training because as you age
you<00:01:48.550> know<00:01:48.670> we're<00:01:48.940> all<00:01:49.090> aging<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:50.020> know<00:01:50.170> our

muscles they shrink they atrophy and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.640 
muscles they shrink they atrophy and

resistance training you know that stuff

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.180 
resistance training you know that stuff
will<00:04:30.490> melt<00:04:30.699> away

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
will melt away

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.730
