on that's crap also the dam for Griffin
that's<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.430> why<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> chose<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.270> case

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that's actually why I chose this case

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
that's actually why I chose this case
it's<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.830> Griffin<00:01:17.369> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it's because they in for Griffin is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
it's because they in for Griffin is
still<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> lot<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.299> money<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> market<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.409> if

still a lot of money on the market so if

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.140 
still a lot of money on the market so if
I<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.830> stat<00:01:20.100> rack<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> would<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.759> handy

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.960 

but<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.409> basically<00:01:49.829> was<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.369> them<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
but I basically was all of them and and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.450 
but I basically was all of them and and
I<00:01:51.180> lost<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.110> day<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.619> which<00:01:53.159> he

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
I lost it on the day in which he

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.450 
I lost it on the day in which he
literally<00:01:53.790> opened<00:01:54.630> twelve<00:01:55.350> cases<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.219> got

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
literally opened twelve cases and got

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.740 
literally opened twelve cases and got
only<00:01:56.939> blues<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.869> was<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.790> come<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.689> I

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
only blues and I was like come on and I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
only blues and I was like come on and I
was<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.200> can't<00:02:01.380> happen<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.979> me<00:02:02.159> right

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
was like that can't happen to me right

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
was like that can't happen to me right
so<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.180> decided<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> test<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.170> mean

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
so I decided to test it out I mean

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.499 
so I decided to test it out I mean
that's<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.520> interesting<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.119> think

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that's that would be interesting I think

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.869 
that's that would be interesting I think
I'll<00:02:06.689> check<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.429> watched<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
I'll check like because I watched the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.600 
I'll check like because I watched the
many<00:02:09.060> ways<00:02:09.239> before<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.709> my<00:02:11.069> opening

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
many ways before like I do my opening

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.250 
many ways before like I do my opening
I'll<00:02:11.760> check<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.150> he<00:02:12.360> got<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
I'll check what he got and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.750

still<00:03:28.109> good<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.099> I<00:03:29.160> thought<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.639> thought<00:03:29.970> maybe

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
still good so I thought I thought maybe

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.390 
still good so I thought I thought maybe
there<00:03:31.199> is<00:03:31.319> like<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> little<00:03:31.859> chance<00:03:32.250> of

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
there is like a little chance of

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.979 
there is like a little chance of
actually<00:03:32.669> getting<00:03:32.910> something<00:03:33.419> good<00:03:33.720> again

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
but I don't think it's happening

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.869 
but I don't think it's happening
come<00:03:36.690> on<00:03:37.349> firestarter<00:03:38.129> that's<00:03:38.609> bull<00:03:38.970> crap
