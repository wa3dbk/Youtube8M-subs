the patch the mp5 was outclassed in

recoil<00:02:05.410> is<00:02:05.650> slightly<00:02:05.890> higher<00:02:06.010> due<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.550> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
recoil is slightly higher due to the

recoil is slightly higher due to the
fire<00:02:06.850> rate<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.780> makes<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.289> much<00:02:08.470> more

895<00:03:40.250> rounds<00:03:40.610> per<00:03:40.730> minute<00:03:40.850> shooting<00:03:41.330> it<00:03:41.420> just<00:03:41.690> a

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
895 rounds per minute shooting it just a

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.570 
895 rounds per minute shooting it just a
little<00:03:41.810> bit<00:03:42.110> faster<00:03:42.380> than<00:03:42.800> its<00:03:43.190> cod4

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
little bit faster than its cod4

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.460 
little bit faster than its cod4
counterpart<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.330> because<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.200> also

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
counterpart and because of this it also

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.370 
counterpart and because of this it also
did<00:03:45.709> have<00:03:45.920> moderate<00:03:46.340> recoil<00:03:47.020> so<00:03:48.020> which<00:03:48.170> one<00:03:48.350> of

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
did have moderate recoil so which one of

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.140 
did have moderate recoil so which one of
these<00:03:48.500> two<00:03:48.560> weapons<00:03:49.040> was<00:03:49.190> better<00:03:49.459> which<00:03:50.000> one

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
these two weapons was better which one

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.490 
these two weapons was better which one
do<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.390> guys<00:03:50.510> think<00:03:50.750> was<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:50.959> best<00:03:51.200> leave<00:03:51.470> a

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
which one you guys thought was better

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.350 
which one you guys thought was better
maybe<00:03:54.740> you<00:03:54.860> just<00:03:54.980> thought<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.340> cod4<00:03:55.940> was

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
maybe you just thought the cod4 was

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.150 
maybe you just thought the cod4 was
morals<00:03:56.720> more<00:03:56.930> vintage<00:03:57.410> maybe<00:03:57.740> thought<00:03:57.950> the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
morals more vintage maybe thought the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.880 
morals more vintage maybe thought the
the<00:03:58.670> modern<00:03:58.910> warfare<00:03:59.000> 3<00:03:59.239> ones<00:03:59.540> just<00:03:59.690> was<00:04:00.080> more

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
the modern warfare 3 ones just was more

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.470 
the modern warfare 3 ones just was more
powerful<00:04:01.250> than<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.640> kata<00:04:01.820> for<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.239> or<00:04:02.360> maybe

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
powerful than the kata for one or maybe

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.030 
powerful than the kata for one or maybe
he<00:04:02.630> just<00:04:02.660> felt<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.080> one<00:04:03.170> felt<00:04:03.380> easier<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.860> use

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
he just felt that one felt easier to use

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.500 
he just felt that one felt easier to use
and<00:04:04.070> another<00:04:04.459> one<00:04:04.670> leave<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> comment<00:04:05.480> down

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
the other and the better mp5 was the mp5

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.410 
the other and the better mp5 was the mp5
from<00:04:12.560> modern<00:04:12.890> warfare<00:04:13.130> 3<00:04:13.310> although<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.270> did

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
from modern warfare 3 although it did

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
have the same stats as the mp5 from call

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.789 
have the same stats as the mp5 from call
of<00:04:16.549> duty<00:04:16.760> 4<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.299> did<00:04:17.780> have<00:04:18.020> just<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.410> little<00:04:18.440> bit

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
of duty 4 it did have just a little bit

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.710 
of duty 4 it did have just a little bit
more<00:04:18.980> which<00:04:19.340> made<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.700> come<00:04:19.820> out<00:04:19.940> on<00:04:20.060> top<00:04:20.270> it

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
more which made it come out on top it

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.659 
more which made it come out on top it
did<00:04:20.959> more<00:04:21.169> damage<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.830> had<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.130> headshot

the mp5 for modern warfare 3 shot a lot
faster<00:04:29.300> than<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.540> mp5<00:04:30.110> from<00:04:30.590> cod4<00:04:30.860> shooting

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
faster than the mp5 from cod4 shooting

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.990 
faster than the mp5 from cod4 shooting
at<00:04:31.790> 895<00:04:32.780> rounds<00:04:33.200> as<00:04:33.290> opposed<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.710> 800<00:04:34.250> on<00:04:34.790> top

at 895 rounds as opposed to 800 on top
of<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.360> did<00:04:35.510> have<00:04:35.690> moderate<00:04:36.080> recoil<00:04:36.290> and

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
of that it did have moderate recoil and

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.170 
of that it did have moderate recoil and
it<00:04:37.010> was<00:04:37.130> one<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.310> those<00:04:37.460> weapons<00:04:37.669> that<00:04:37.880> was<00:04:38.030> a

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180

it was one of those weapons that was a
little<00:04:38.330> bit

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
little bit

little bit
control<00:04:39.250> but<00:04:39.669> then<00:04:39.789> again<00:04:39.820> he<00:04:40.270> had<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.570> same

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
control but then again he had the same

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.870 
control but then again he had the same
amount<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:41.080> recoil<00:04:41.320> as<00:04:41.710> its<00:04:41.919> cod4<00:04:42.310> counterpart

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
amount of recoil as its cod4 counterpart

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.629 
amount of recoil as its cod4 counterpart
making<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:44.020> better<00:04:44.229> mp5<00:04:44.919> in<00:04:45.160> Call<00:04:45.310> of<00:04:45.340> Duty
