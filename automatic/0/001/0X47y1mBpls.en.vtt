challenging and dangerous tracks in the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.569 
challenging and dangerous tracks in the
world<00:00:47.120> we<00:00:47.750> hadn't<00:00:47.989> crafts<00:00:48.350> in<00:00:48.410> a<00:00:48.500> while<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.550> I

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
world we hadn't crafts in a while so I

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.340 
world we hadn't crafts in a while so I
was<00:00:50.000> thinking<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.420> know<00:00:50.450> maybe<00:00:50.809> we'll<00:00:51.140> crash

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
was thinking you know maybe we'll crash

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.680 
was thinking you know maybe we'll crash
here<00:00:51.649> maybe<00:00:51.680> not<00:00:52.160> we<00:00:52.730> had<00:00:52.820> gone<00:00:53.000> around<00:00:53.300> I

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
here maybe not we had gone around I

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.500 
here maybe not we had gone around I
think<00:00:54.410> almost<00:00:55.129> two<00:00:55.489> years<00:00:55.760> without<00:00:55.940> crashing

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
think almost two years without crashing

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.510 
think almost two years without crashing
the<00:00:56.660> day<00:00:56.899> before<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.350> accident<00:00:57.500> we<00:00:58.370> actually

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
the day before the accident we actually

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.389 
the day before the accident we actually
crashed<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.329> we<00:00:59.899> were<00:01:00.289> fine<00:01:00.500> like<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:01.039> little

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
crashed and we were fine like a little

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.490 
crashed and we were fine like a little
bit<00:01:01.489> like<00:01:01.789> that<00:01:02.210> come<00:01:02.329> out<00:01:02.450> but<00:01:02.660> nothing<00:01:03.350> too

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
bit like that come out but nothing too

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.820 
bit like that come out but nothing too
serious<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.160> and<00:01:04.729> then<00:01:05.449> we<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:06.140> we<00:01:06.410> did<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.619> run

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
serious so and then we that we did a run

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.920 
serious so and then we that we did a run
right<00:01:07.039> after<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.580> we<00:01:07.700> made<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:07.970> down<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.630> was

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
right after and we made it down so I was

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.449 
right after and we made it down so I was
confident<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:09.590> we<00:01:09.830> were<00:01:09.920> going<00:01:10.039> to<00:01:10.100> make<00:01:10.250> it

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:10.459 
confident that we were going to make it

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:12.699 
confident that we were going to make it
the<00:01:10.819> next<00:01:10.970> day<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.840> accident<00:01:12.229> happened<00:01:12.590> and

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:12.709 
the next day the accident happened and

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:15.309 
the next day the accident happened and
things<00:01:13.700> totally<00:01:14.090> switched<00:01:14.390> around<00:01:14.569> from<00:01:15.170> what

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
things totally switched around from what

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.190 
things totally switched around from what
I<00:01:15.350> remember<00:01:15.440> we<00:01:16.039> were<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:17.450> seemed<00:01:18.050> like<00:01:18.170> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
I remember we were it seemed like a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.740 
I remember we were it seemed like a
normal<00:01:18.410> run<00:01:18.709> we<00:01:18.979> pushed<00:01:19.610> off<00:01:19.819> and<00:01:20.179> everyone

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
normal run we pushed off and everyone

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.380 
normal run we pushed off and everyone
got<00:01:20.869> in<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.080> sled<00:01:21.259> fine<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.860> then<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.610> guess

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
got in the sled fine and then I guess

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.749 
got in the sled fine and then I guess
something<00:01:24.140> went<00:01:24.170> wrong<00:01:24.440> I<00:01:24.800> was<00:01:25.190> resting<00:01:25.550> for

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
something went wrong I was resting for

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.490 
something went wrong I was resting for
the<00:01:25.789> two-man<00:01:26.569> race<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.899> was<00:01:27.020> going<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.229> be<00:01:27.319> two

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
the two-man race I was going to be two

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.529 
the two-man race I was going to be two
days<00:01:27.649> later<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.190> I<00:01:28.759> was<00:01:28.910> doing<00:01:29.119> video<00:01:29.360> between

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
days later and I was doing video between

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.800 
days later and I was doing video between
corners<00:01:30.200> 12<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.649> 13<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.160> I<00:01:31.490> just<00:01:31.670> remember

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
corners 12 and 13 and I just remember

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.260 
corners 12 and 13 and I just remember
listening<00:01:32.810> like<00:01:33.220> listening<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.250> like<00:01:34.700> his<00:01:35.060> run

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
listening like listening to like his run

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.540 
listening like listening to like his run
and<00:01:35.509> all<00:01:35.899> I<00:01:35.929> hear<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.289> this<00:01:36.500> loud<00:01:36.679> bang<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.310> I

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
and all I hear is this loud bang and I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.609 
and all I hear is this loud bang and I
thought<00:01:37.759> in<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.840> back<00:01:38.959> of<00:01:39.020> my<00:01:39.170> head<00:01:39.349> I'm<00:01:39.380> like

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
thought in the back of my head I'm like

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.949 
thought in the back of my head I'm like
that's<00:01:40.160> that's<00:01:40.849> not<00:01:40.940> good<00:01:41.300> like<00:01:41.509> that's<00:01:41.780> not

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
that's that's not good like that's not

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.870 
that's that's not good like that's not
right<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.440> remember<00:01:42.890> rolling<00:01:43.399> into<00:01:43.520> one<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.819> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
right I remember rolling into one of the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.169 
right I remember rolling into one of the
corners<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.709> and<00:01:45.709> it<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:46.099> me<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.369> just<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.970> felt

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
corners and and it to me it just it felt

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.680 
corners and and it to me it just it felt
like<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> normal<00:01:48.140> crash<00:01:48.459> we<00:01:49.459> we<00:01:49.759> slid<00:01:50.030> up<00:01:50.149> up<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
like a normal crash we we slid up up the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.150 
like a normal crash we we slid up up the
track<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:51.200> bit<00:01:51.349> of<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.500> ways<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.830> then<00:01:51.950> we<00:01:52.009> came

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
track a bit of the ways and then we came
