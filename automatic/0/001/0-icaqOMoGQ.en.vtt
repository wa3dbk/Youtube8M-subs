00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:20.270
 that's why the truth has been something strong 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.520
 because he is not impressed by any 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.500
 thing lived a long time in europe has 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.610
 seen the best best friends and 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.669
 it has nothing to do with him 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.899
 I imagine that for those dt apart from 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.940
 the experience that one has to have 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.039
 as to be able to lead a team 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.809
 It also seems from intuition that I do not know 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.910
 if it is in your case that of who will change 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:50.430
 who does not at what time when the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:52.170
 changes that happens when you do not know what 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.159
 do an oval intuition and that's what 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.110
 would have 08 lose signs for one of 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.110
 the two steps these are poker these 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.940
 are tricks depends trick forest 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.710
 perfect hope to leave aside and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.420
 before starting apart from showing the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 which are logically all mixed 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.850
 like a mallet of this trick I think that you 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.110
 same month once more or less is 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.789
 according to the mix you give me 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.380
 about half because we're not going 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.479
 to play with all the cards but 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.179
 with a group and I'm going to ask for some 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 questions you after all 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:30.240
 excellent and with this we are going to put together 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.520
 three groups of letters without knowing which is 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.310
 the measure of some more so that more or 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.670
 less equal perfect 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.899
 perfect we do not have why I 'm not going to 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.220
 see in no time simply to 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.500
 show you and german if they want 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.510
 they know they are all different yes 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.510
 logically distinct and mixed 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.160
 so if there are more now I want 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.280
 chemicals just some of the three 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:10.360
 lots of riojas 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:12.490
 that is, for all of us to think 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.690
 just think a song and even 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.930
 I had to look to see what it is 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.310
 television and that once the league does not 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.260
 is white just in case 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.910
 you have forgotten to change what 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.569
 they already said what they are going to do is check 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:30.569
 that everything is perfect 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.220
 if it's not like that let's start with those 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.900
 that touching you is chosen 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.430
 mentally ball they say that what I 'm going 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.560
 to do is disguise the ones a little to 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.560
 change the order of the letters a little 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.629
 and you already know in which it can get to be 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.080
 no matter whether it's true or not just 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:06.280
 to show us we're going 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:10.080
 and as many of us know with the letter and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.080
 ask him if he really guessed right 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.910
 well this is to see what works 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.910
 it really works very well and for that 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:30.230
 what I'm going to do is to do again 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:32.989
 groups of three groups again 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.280
 and I think that this time you already did it very 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.620
 well I do not want to put pressure on you 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.060
 permission very well I think see if afterwards in 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.720
 which is he runs with an advantage that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.720
 knows 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.930
 and in which not what I get 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.990
 of 50 and 50 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.329
 Yes Yes 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.719
 of this but I have no idea what is 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.200
 the important thing the following you guessed right 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:16.509
 introduce yourself among a social group now 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.489
 well in my part I will start to spend 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:23.949
 one of the letters in this way 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:29.259
 ok trying to connect with each letter 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.259
 You do not know which ones, but yes 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.669
 challenge 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.680
 I will try to see if your letter without 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:46.099
 know what it is only by intuition I 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.849
 I want you to start demonstrating 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.849
 and I will even look 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.400
 vocation 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.159
 it is doing very well 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.170
 yes 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.150
 I have no idea what letter may be 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.710
 thought at first we mix them and 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.129
 they had all the time you spent 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.740
 how many 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.539
 of having been any of these 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.110
 it could have been some of these 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.110
 qualities 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.729
 i 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:57.729
 as every time is crazy 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.169
 letters 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
 single 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:22.150
 It is that I really want to hit 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.150
 the camera
