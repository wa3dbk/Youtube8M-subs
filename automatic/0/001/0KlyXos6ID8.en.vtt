this<00:00:01.499> is<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.650> demonstration<00:00:01.949> of<00:00:02.399> how<00:00:02.459> I<00:00:02.580> made<00:00:02.969> a

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
this is a demonstration of how I made a

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.790 
this is a demonstration of how I made a
Ukrainian<00:00:03.659> Easter<00:00:04.080> Egg<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.500> called<00:00:04.710> an

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:04.800 
Ukrainian Easter Egg that I called an

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.119 
Ukrainian Easter Egg that I called an
embroidered<00:00:05.370> egg<00:00:06.290> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.440> an<00:00:07.560> image<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:08.129 
embroidered egg this is an image of the

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.690 
embroidered egg this is an image of the
final<00:00:08.610> egg<00:00:09.230> so<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> first<00:00:10.559> part<00:00:10.799> is<00:00:11.009> to<00:00:11.099> divide

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
final egg so the first part is to divide

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.239 
final egg so the first part is to divide
the<00:00:11.879> egg<00:00:11.999> I<00:00:12.299> divide<00:00:12.959> the<00:00:13.110> egg<00:00:13.259> starting<00:00:13.829> at<00:00:14.039> the

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249 
the egg I divide the egg starting at the

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.910 
the egg I divide the egg starting at the
bottom<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.599> divide<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.959> in<00:00:16.110> half<00:00:16.380> with<00:00:16.650> one

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
bottom and I divide it in half with one

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.590 
bottom and I divide it in half with one
vertical<00:00:17.490> line<00:00:17.700> going<00:00:17.730> all<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.360> way<00:00:18.390> around

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
vertical line going all the way around

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.130 
vertical line going all the way around
the<00:00:18.900> egg<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.370> then<00:00:20.370> divide<00:00:20.760> each<00:00:21.000> half<00:00:21.360> in<00:00:21.690> half

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the egg I then divide each half in half

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.940 
the egg I then divide each half in half
with<00:00:22.620> another<00:00:23.010> vertical<00:00:23.550> line<00:00:27.830> once<00:00:28.830> I've

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
with another vertical line once I've

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.340 
with another vertical line once I've
done<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.520> divide<00:00:29.910> each<00:00:30.210> quarter<00:00:30.810> section

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
done that I divide each quarter section

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.639 
done that I divide each quarter section
in<00:00:31.590> half<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.850> line<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.719> horizontally

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
in half with a line going horizontally

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.229 
in half with a line going horizontally
through<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.120> fat<00:00:36.780> part<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.289> egg<00:00:37.379> and<00:00:38.239> now

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
through the fat part of the egg and now

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
through the fat part of the egg and now
I<00:00:39.269> have<00:00:39.420> an<00:00:39.510> egg<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.839> eight<00:00:40.379> parts<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.829> divide

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
I have an egg with eight parts I divide

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.119 
I have an egg with eight parts I divide
each<00:00:41.249> eight<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:42.059> half<00:00:42.659> with<00:00:43.289> a<00:00:43.320> line<00:00:43.679> starting

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
each eight in half with a line starting

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.189 
each eight in half with a line starting
from<00:00:44.249> the<00:00:44.399> center<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.089> I<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.569> an<00:00:45.659> egg<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:45.960> at

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
from the center and I have an egg now at

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.950 
from the center and I have an egg now at
16<00:00:46.409> I<00:00:46.890> turn<00:00:47.429> it<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.819> quarter<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.269> the<00:00:48.390> way<00:00:48.659> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
16 I turn it one quarter of the way and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
16 I turn it one quarter of the way and
I<00:00:49.829> do<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.129> exact<00:00:50.399> same<00:00:50.429> thing<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.819> I<00:00:50.940> just

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
I do the exact same thing that I just

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.849 
I do the exact same thing that I just
did<00:00:51.359> so<00:00:51.629> starting<00:00:51.899> from<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.109> center<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.589> draw<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
did so starting from the center I draw a

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.149 
did so starting from the center I draw a
line<00:00:53.039> out<00:00:53.339> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.269> side<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.069> the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
line out to the side to one of the

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.520 
line out to the side to one of the
original<00:00:56.699> vertical<00:00:57.089> lines<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.139> do<00:00:58.199> that

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
original vertical lines and I do that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.869 
original vertical lines and I do that
all<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.889> way<00:00:59.429> around<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> egg<00:00:59.999> on<00:01:00.539> both<00:01:00.749> sides

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
all the way around the egg on both sides

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.410 
all the way around the egg on both sides
the<00:01:02.879> next<00:01:03.179> step<00:01:03.389> is<00:01:03.659> to<00:01:04.649> divide<00:01:05.579> from<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the next step is to divide from the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.359 
the next step is to divide from the
bottom<00:01:06.840> there's<00:01:07.110> their<00:01:07.469> four<00:01:07.740> diamonds<00:01:08.009> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
bottom there's their four diamonds I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.120 
bottom there's their four diamonds I
divide<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> diamonds<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.750> half<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.439> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
divide one of the diamonds in half and I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.639 
divide one of the diamonds in half and I
look<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.240> center<00:01:12.990> where<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> where<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
look for the center where the where the

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.340 
look for the center where the where the
triangles<00:01:14.070> intersect<00:01:14.579> as<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:14.939> guide<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:16.170> do

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
triangles intersect as my guide and I do

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.139 
triangles intersect as my guide and I do
that<00:01:16.649> all<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> way<00:01:17.219> from<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> bottom<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
that all the way from the bottom up to

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.370 
that all the way from the bottom up to
the<00:01:18.299> top<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> once<00:01:20.850> you've<00:01:21.090> gone<00:01:21.329> from<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the top so once you've gone from the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.929 
the top so once you've gone from the
bottom<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.399> top<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.820> each

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
bottom all the way to the top in each

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
bottom all the way to the top in each
section<00:01:24.270> you'll<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.810> an<00:01:24.899> egg<00:01:25.079> with<00:01:25.490> 48

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
section you'll have an egg with 48

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.469 
section you'll have an egg with 48
equally<00:01:27.090> sized<00:01:27.299> triangles<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> second

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
equally sized triangles so the second

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.020 
equally sized triangles so the second
part<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.899> add<00:01:31.409> little<00:01:32.219> eyes<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.000> I

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
part is to add little eyes and what I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
part is to add little eyes and what I
did<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.479> found<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> diamond<00:01:34.289> in<00:01:34.469> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
did was I found the diamond in the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.099 
did was I found the diamond in the
center<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:36.000> egg<00:01:36.180> where<00:01:36.659> there's<00:01:36.840> four

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
center of the egg where there's four

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.969 
center of the egg where there's four
sections<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:39.780> each<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> four

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
sections and in each of the four

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.969 
sections and in each of the four
sections<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.850> did<00:01:42.359> what<00:01:43.079> looked<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.770> an

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
sections I did what looked to be like an

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.740 
sections I did what looked to be like an
eye<00:01:44.850> shape<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.890> teardrop<00:01:46.890> shape<00:01:47.219> and<00:01:47.509> I<00:01:48.509> did

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
eye shape or teardrop shape and I did

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.480 
eye shape or teardrop shape and I did
that<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.380> each<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.280> diamond<00:01:50.729> sections<00:01:51.240> in

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
that for each of the diamond sections in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:01.649 
that for each of the diamond sections in
the<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> egg

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.140 

once<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:03.250> did<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.430> all<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.640> way<00:02:04.760> around<00:02:05.060> the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
once I did that all the way around the

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.830 
once I did that all the way around the
egg<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.570> added<00:02:06.500> two<00:02:07.130> little<00:02:07.520> lines<00:02:07.729> on<00:02:08.209> the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
egg I added two little lines on the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.800 
egg I added two little lines on the
inside<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:09.770> each<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.729> petals<00:02:11.060> just<00:02:11.690> like

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
inside of each of the petals just like

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.570 
inside of each of the petals just like
this<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.110> third<00:02:15.290> part<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> inner

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
this so the third part is do the inner

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.520 
this so the third part is do the inner
diamond<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.330> stitching<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.380> what

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
diamond and the stitching this is what

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.470 
diamond and the stitching this is what
it's<00:02:18.650> gonna<00:02:18.770> look<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.700> end<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.180> I'm

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
it's gonna look like in the end and I'm

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.790 
it's gonna look like in the end and I'm
gonna<00:02:20.600> do<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.900> all<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.140> way<00:02:21.319> around<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.680> egg

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
gonna do that all the way around the egg

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.979 
gonna do that all the way around the egg
so<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.310> start<00:02:22.640> by<00:02:22.700> drawing<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.270> line<00:02:23.450> that's

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
so I start by drawing a line that's

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.720 
so I start by drawing a line that's
parallel<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.739> line<00:02:25.010> just<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.520> right<00:02:25.670> I

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
parallel to the line just to the right I

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.210 
parallel to the line just to the right I
use<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.120> as<00:02:26.209> my<00:02:26.239> guide<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.590> helps<00:02:28.040> keep

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
use that as my guide and that helps keep

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.150 
use that as my guide and that helps keep
everything<00:02:28.550> look<00:02:29.080> symmetrical<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:31.100> do

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
everything look symmetrical and I do

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.770 
everything look symmetrical and I do
that<00:02:31.370> on<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.550> inside<00:02:31.790> line<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.180> well<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.600> then

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
that on the inside line as well and then

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.380 
that on the inside line as well and then
I<00:02:32.810> curve<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.830> inner<00:02:34.070> triangle<00:02:34.730> line<00:02:35.120> around

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
I curve that inner triangle line around

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.680 
I curve that inner triangle line around
the<00:02:35.630> petal<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.470> fill<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:37.180> now<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.239> do<00:02:38.330> that

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
the petal and I fill it in now I do that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.330 
the petal and I fill it in now I do that
around<00:02:39.080> all<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> petals<00:02:39.980> around<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
around all of the petals around the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.729 
around all of the petals around the
whole<00:02:40.519> egg<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.690> once<00:02:42.170> it's<00:02:42.350> done<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.650> looks

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
whole egg and once it's done it looks

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.590 
whole egg and once it's done it looks
like<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.730> fill<00:02:43.940> in<00:02:44.030> those<00:02:44.150> last<00:02:44.360> bits

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
like this just fill in those last bits

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.540 
like this just fill in those last bits
and<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.110> how<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:45.920> gonna<00:02:45.980> look<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.459> it's

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
and this is how it's gonna look and it's

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.390 
and this is how it's gonna look and it's
ready<00:02:46.760> now<00:02:46.850> for<00:02:47.380> some<00:02:48.380> stitching<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.250> thought

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
ready now for some stitching I thought

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.009 
ready now for some stitching I thought
this<00:02:49.550> reminded<00:02:49.940> me<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.120> my<00:02:50.570> grandmother's

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
this reminded me of my grandmother's

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.670 
this reminded me of my grandmother's
embroidery<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:51.860> some<00:02:52.100> stitching<00:02:53.530> would<00:02:54.530> add<00:02:54.650> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
embroidery so some stitching would add a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.320 
embroidery so some stitching would add a
bit<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.980> visual<00:02:55.489> interest<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.000> did<00:02:56.180> that

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
bit of visual interest and I did that

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.710 
bit of visual interest and I did that
around<00:02:56.900> each<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.760> diamonds<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.450> didn't

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
around each of the the diamonds I didn't

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.040 
around each of the the diamonds I didn't
do<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.930> through<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.380> center<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:02.420> part<00:03:02.840> four

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
do it through the center in part four

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.509 
do it through the center in part four
we're<00:03:03.200> gonna<00:03:03.290> dye<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.590> egg<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:04.040> remove<00:03:04.400> the

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
we're gonna dye the egg and remove the

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.180 
we're gonna dye the egg and remove the
wax<00:03:04.640> so<00:03:05.060> first<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.600> tried<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.320> in<00:03:06.500> royal<00:03:06.860> blue<00:03:06.980> I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
wax so first I tried it in royal blue I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.280 
wax so first I tried it in royal blue I
lowered<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.850> egg<00:03:08.060> into<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.630> raw<00:03:08.870> blue<00:03:09.110> dye

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
lowered the egg into the raw blue dye

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.900 
lowered the egg into the raw blue dye
but<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.950> thought<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.459> looked<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.790> little

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
but I thought that it looked a little

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.210 
but I thought that it looked a little
bit<00:03:11.060> too<00:03:11.360> late<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.079> tried<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.560> for<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:12.829> minute

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
bit too late so I tried it for a minute

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.460 
bit too late so I tried it for a minute
in<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.579> purple<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.750> gave<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.110> deeper

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
in the purple and that gave it a deeper

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.650 
in the purple and that gave it a deeper
blue<00:03:15.650> color<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.640> lifted<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.180> egg<00:03:17.269> off<00:03:17.480> the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
blue color and I lifted the egg off the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.410 
blue color and I lifted the egg off the
spoon<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.410> piece<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:18.769> paper<00:03:19.040> towel<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.700> I

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
spoon with a piece of paper towel and I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.930 
spoon with a piece of paper towel and I
dabbed<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.170> dry<00:03:21.500> rather<00:03:22.190> than<00:03:22.489> rubbing

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
dabbed it dry rather than rubbing

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.220 
dabbed it dry rather than rubbing
rubbing<00:03:23.090> what<00:03:23.420> Cotts<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.840> dye<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.049> come<00:03:24.440> off

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
rubbing what Cotts the dye to come off

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.160 
rubbing what Cotts the dye to come off
so<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.350> next<00:03:27.530> section<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.880> remove<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.049> wax

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
so the next section is to remove the wax

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.560 
so the next section is to remove the wax
and<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.560> do<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.829> by<00:03:31.040> holding<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.790> egg<00:03:31.970> close

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
and you do that by holding the egg close

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.870 
and you do that by holding the egg close
to<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.019> flame<00:03:33.410> not<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.610> can<00:03:34.730> see

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
to the flame not in it and you can see

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.310 
to the flame not in it and you can see
where<00:03:35.060> there<00:03:35.239> where<00:03:35.540> it's<00:03:35.660> white<00:03:35.810> that's

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
where there where it's white that's

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.990 
where there where it's white that's
where<00:03:36.560> I've<00:03:36.680> removed<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.190> wax<00:03:37.280> already<00:03:37.730> and

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
where I've removed the wax already and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.489 
where I've removed the wax already and
this<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.110> how<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.530> looks<00:03:39.709> when<00:03:40.100> it's<00:03:40.280> done
