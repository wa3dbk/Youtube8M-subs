many comments about the flight and
crashes<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:04.980> my<00:00:05.160> Firebird<00:00:05.700> phantom<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.420> my

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
crashes of my Firebird phantom and my

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.770 
crashes of my Firebird phantom and my
Raven<00:00:07.379> are<00:00:07.649> q11<00:00:08.210> about<00:00:09.210> putting<00:00:09.540> them<00:00:09.630> back

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
Raven are q11 about putting them back

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.080 
Raven are q11 about putting them back
together<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.559> thought<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> would<00:00:11.700> go<00:00:11.849> ahead<00:00:11.880> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
together I thought I would go ahead and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.759 
together I thought I would go ahead and
try<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> do<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.019> show<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.259> why<00:00:13.559> they

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
try to do that and show you why they

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.890 
try to do that and show you why they
crashed<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.370> first<00:00:14.639> place

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
crashed in the first place

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.140 
crashed in the first place
first<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.440> all<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.890> phantom<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.850> tiny

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
first of all on the phantom the tiny

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.210 
first of all on the phantom the tiny
gear<00:00:18.570> was<00:00:18.750> loose<00:00:18.990> enough<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> shaft<00:00:19.920> of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
gear was loose enough on the shaft of

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.939 
gear was loose enough on the shaft of
the<00:00:20.250> servo<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.900> jammed<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> was<00:00:22.769> not

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the servo that it jammed and it was not

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.400 
the servo that it jammed and it was not
allowing<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.640> return<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.289> was

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
allowing it to return because it was

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.189 
allowing it to return because it was
slipping<00:00:25.830> well<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.670> took<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.970> off<00:00:27.210> centered<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199

slipping well I took it off centered the
pot<00:00:28.439> again<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.279> used<00:00:29.580> amazing<00:00:30.150> group<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
pot again and then used amazing group to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.120 
pot again and then used amazing group to
make<00:00:30.720> sure<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.199> little<00:00:31.380> gear<00:00:31.590> didn't<00:00:31.949> move

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
make sure that little gear didn't move

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.780 
make sure that little gear didn't move
again

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
again

next is a raven well you know the wing
came<00:01:23.020> off<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.710> flight<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.420> fiberglass

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
came off and flight and the fiberglass

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.840 
came off and flight and the fiberglass
fuselage<00:01:26.500> got<00:01:26.770> wrinkled<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.370> cracked<00:01:27.700> in

fuselage got wrinkled and cracked in
many<00:01:28.030> places<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.590> since<00:01:29.830> my<00:01:30.070> planes<00:01:30.400> are<00:01:30.640> built

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
many places so since my planes are built

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.700 
many places so since my planes are built
to<00:01:31.060> fly<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:31.660> don't<00:01:31.840> spend<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.170> lot<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.380> time

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
to fly I don't spend a lot of time

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.520 
to fly I don't spend a lot of time
repairing<00:01:33.400> them<00:01:33.580> making<00:01:33.760> them<00:01:33.940> look<00:01:34.090> pretty

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
ripped the whole wing off well since

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.510 
ripped the whole wing off well since
reinforced<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.200> patched<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.010> cracks<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
reinforced it and patched the cracks and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.360 
reinforced it and patched the cracks and
holes<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> fuselage<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:14.050> sealed<00:02:15.010> them<00:02:15.160> up

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
holes in the fuselage and sealed them up

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.970 
holes in the fuselage and sealed them up
with<00:02:15.720> Zapp<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.989> also<00:02:17.440> used<00:02:17.739> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
with Zapp and also used the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.949 
with Zapp and also used the
hundred-mile-an-hour<00:02:18.370> tape<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.510> wing<00:02:19.720> as

hundred-mile-an-hour tape on the wing as

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.229 
hundred-mile-an-hour tape on the wing as
a<00:02:19.989> secondary<00:02:20.590> failsafe<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.000> way<00:02:22.120> the

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
a secondary failsafe so that way the

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:36.940 
a secondary failsafe so that way the
wing<00:02:22.450> can't<00:02:22.750> come<00:02:22.959> off

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.559 

during<00:02:37.950> my<00:02:38.100> repair<00:02:38.490> what<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.760> neglected<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
during my repair what I neglected to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.900 
during my repair what I neglected to
really<00:02:39.990> see<00:02:40.230> was<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.530> my<00:02:40.890> push-pull<00:02:41.459> cables

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
really see was that my push-pull cables

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.870 
really see was that my push-pull cables
had<00:02:42.180> become<00:02:42.569> slacker<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> crash<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.040> then

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
had become slacker in the crash and then

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.610 
had become slacker in the crash and then
flutter<00:02:45.360> at<00:02:45.569> certain<00:02:45.870> speeds<00:02:46.230> became

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
flutter at certain speeds became

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.620 
flutter at certain speeds became
prominent<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:47.940> you're<00:02:48.090> gonna<00:02:48.239> see<00:02:48.480> the
