00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.560
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.460
 this new video on minecraft then 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.530
 long ago I started a home that was 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.810
 then lasted only two videos on 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.250
 minecraft traps the best traps 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.340
 but invented 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.650
 then this Saturday we take this up again 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.870
 argument not every Saturday but it 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.460
 we resume this Saturday 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.470
 then today I am going to explain one 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 very very very very useful trap e 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.659
 fundamental for the defense of yours 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.210
 home we go to see how built 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.030
 so first of all I have to explain the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.800
 basic concept you must know that a 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:10.979
 any excuse excused rexton activator 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.350
 which is why but no that's why me 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.330
 you are watching i 'm doing like 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.720
 tutorials please spy on me guys 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:30.210
 they are watching from the window, that is that 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.220
 what he's doing on my mom's leaving 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.590
 oh no sorry for a moment 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:44.750
 to the interruption but how to allow it 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:47.910
 but please leave but I look and 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.260
 scoundrel also touches me with the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.300
 sword when I do the tutorial 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:58.350
 ok then guys like I said before 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.460
 if we activate any generator 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.560
 of current 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.050
 the current will be sent to the four 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.170
 directions such as this one 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:12.150
 cross oh my God, excuse me, I'm sorry 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.400
 doing a tutorial, get out of here 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.879
 immediately go away 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.490
 Mamma mia these villains are cursed villains 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:29.220
 not rude guys with villains then 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.060
 I said if we just activate a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.620
 rexton generator the current comes 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.440
 sent in all directions 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.600
 except for the diagonal ones, that's why 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.030
 if for example we are going to position 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.210
 a block like this this block 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.920
 will come in a certain way there is a certain sense 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.920
 electrified and when this one will come to 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.090
 miss if they have consequences 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.370
 so what this trap is based on 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.950
 simply on the absence of a block 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.260
 or the presence of a block that yes 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.790
 will activate a series of mechanisms then 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.500
 we could go to set in 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 this case cooks a mechanism 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.890
 base for example we will be able to decide that 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.300
 if these two circuits are redzone 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.510
 agree we can go for a 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.180
 so called by me a little temple and here 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.710
 we can combine them in one circuit but 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.110
 this is another matter 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.530
 anyway let's see for a moment 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.600
 then how the trap is made 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.300
 welcome this is my home now 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.300
 I want to go to the mine I go to the mine 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:53.650
 the clash a little in the meantime a thief yes 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.650
 enter the house 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.480
 wow a mine but if you have 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.480
 created this trap 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:14.750
 then I have to go to the mine though 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.810
 better creative this is not ok I go to 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.440
 a perfect church we go immediately to 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.440
 steal something 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.440
 Oh God , I want to go 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.900
 help help all this guys for 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.390
 explain to you how it would work in theory 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.640
 this trap when you have to 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.830
 go away you will simply activate the 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.200
 lever so you will activate a mechanism ad 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.550
 alarm and as soon as this door will come 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.250
 open 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.800
 you can create a rexton event 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.950
 in this case I created this event 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.200
 redzone in which the piston will activate e 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.790
 I simulated that you could wash 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.660
 create any type of event 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.070
 you can make a joke maybe they fall 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.590
 confetti fall dyes you can 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.870
 create what you want but this is a 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.729
 fully functional system you can 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.830
 also make sure that for example the 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.380
 house is invaded by monsters I don't know 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.120
 you have to invent your own mechanism 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.320
 you want to use a trap 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.940
 if you don't want it to be a trap 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.400
 you can instead invent your own 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.919
 secret passage that is activated all 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.350
 insertion and opening of the door 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.960
 let's go well instead to explain how 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.690
 it works we go to break a moment 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.580
 these blocks as you saw in the 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:34.250
 previous part of the video is 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.510
 practically the system is in this way 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:42.010
 when an object goes to touch a 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.530
 let's say element that transmits rexton 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:48.729
 it is activated in this case not here 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.350
 we have no connection with this 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.289
 piston though if we go to 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.419
 place a block for example e 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.669
 opening and closing the door 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.250
 activating the lever naturally 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.470
 system as you see it works 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.330
 correctly therefore practically with 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.200
 this mechanism here that you can 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.360
 review anyway 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.820
 the first part you can pull yours 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.010
 perfect mechanisms mechanisms that yes 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.870
 will activate at the simple opening of 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.850
 a door guys for this video on 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.990
 traps and everything we feel with the 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.770
 next video 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.770
 Hi everyone
