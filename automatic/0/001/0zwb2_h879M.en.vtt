00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
more reps in a short period time it's

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120 
more reps in a short period time it's
the<00:00:24.180> same<00:00:24.300> thing<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.830> are<00:00:25.830> learning

the same thing like if you are learning

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.880 
the same thing like if you are learning
math<00:00:26.430> they<00:00:26.910> don't<00:00:27.090> give<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.359> one<00:00:27.890> problem

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
math they don't give you one problem

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.250 
math they don't give you one problem
that<00:00:29.099> uses<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.429> quadratic<00:00:29.849> equation<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.660> day

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that uses a quadratic equation a day

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.530 
that uses a quadratic equation a day
they<00:00:31.949> give<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> thirty<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.730> them<00:00:32.850> thank<00:00:33.420> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
they give you thirty of them thank you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.569 
they give you thirty of them thank you
and<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> same<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.890> problem<00:00:35.250> over

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and you do the same kind of problem over

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.740 
and you do the same kind of problem over
and<00:00:35.700> over<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.090> over<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.480> over<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.690> know

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and over and over and over you know

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.360 
and over and over and over you know
you're<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.079> okay<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> got<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you're like okay I got this right I

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.310 
you're like okay I got this right I
figured<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> exact<00:00:40.200> same

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
figured this out it's the exact same

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.889 
figured this out it's the exact same
thing<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> dog<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.480> working<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
thing for the dog when I'm working on a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.660 
thing for the dog when I'm working on a
skill<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> drill<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.920> skill<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
skill I want to drill that skill and I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.100 
skill I want to drill that skill and I
want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.120> many<00:00:45.360> reps<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.079> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
want to get as many reps of that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410 
want to get as many reps of that
behavior<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.489> compressed<00:00:47.850> timeframe<00:00:48.090> as

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
behavior in a compressed timeframe as

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.459 
behavior in a compressed timeframe as
possible<00:00:48.870> while<00:00:49.020> they're<00:00:49.110> trying<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> learn

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
possible while they're trying to learn

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.860 
possible while they're trying to learn
what<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> that'll<00:00:51.480> speed<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
what that is right and that'll speed the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.470 
what that is right and that'll speed the
process<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.489> tend<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> use<00:00:54.030> toys<00:00:54.329> in

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
process up so we tend not to use toys in

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
process up so we tend not to use toys in
the<00:00:54.570> beginning<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.140> much<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.829> don't

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the beginning as much because we don't

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
the beginning as much because we don't
get<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.190> many<00:00:56.340> reps<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:57.210> harder<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.899> some

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
get as many reps it's harder like some

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.540 
get as many reps it's harder like some
of<00:00:58.260> these<00:00:58.350> things<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.710> luring<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.430> dog

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
of these things like luring your dog

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
of these things like luring your dog
into<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.789> stand<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> toy<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.320> really

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
into a stand with a toy can be really

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.110 
into a stand with a toy can be really
hard<00:01:01.770> unless<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.250> dog<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.460> very<00:01:02.489> polite

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
hard unless your dog is very polite

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.170 
hard unless your dog is very polite
about<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.570> toy<00:01:03.719> right<00:01:04.350> because<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.339> push

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
about the toy right because then I push

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
about the toy right because then I push
they<00:01:06.360> grab<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.200> hand<00:01:07.439> they're<00:01:07.770> like

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
they grab it out of my hand they're like

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.380 
they grab it out of my hand they're like
leaping<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.820> they're<00:01:08.970> doing<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.210> kinds

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
leaping on you they're doing all kinds

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
leaping on you they're doing all kinds
of<00:01:09.450> craziness<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.409> teaching<00:01:10.710> those<00:01:10.979> behaviors

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
of craziness so teaching those behaviors

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
of craziness so teaching those behaviors
of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> toy<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.119> hard<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:12.960> people

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
of the toy can be hard there are people

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.240 
of the toy can be hard there are people
out<00:01:13.260> there<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.220> really

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
out there that do it that are really

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.050 
out there that do it that are really
good<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.760> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
good at it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.300 
good at it
but<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.720> difficult<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.830> takes<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
but it's it's difficult it's a takes a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.560 
but it's it's difficult it's a takes a
lot<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.490> physical<00:01:17.970> skill<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.270> timing<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
lot more physical skill and timing and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.469 
lot more physical skill and timing and
you<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:20.240> restraint<00:01:21.240> put

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you have to have a lot of restraint put

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
you have to have a lot of restraint put
on<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.720> dog<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:23.070> can't

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
on your dog so they know that they can't

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
on your dog so they know that they can't
grab<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> toy<00:01:23.820> until<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> tell<00:01:24.990> them<00:01:25.140> they

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
grab the toy until you tell them they

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
grab the toy until you tell them they
can<00:01:25.320> grab<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> toy<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.340> they<00:01:26.490> tend<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
can grab the toy so they tend to have to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:27.800 
can grab the toy so they tend to have to
be<00:01:27.060> further<00:01:27.240> along

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
be further along

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.350 
be further along
whereas<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> couldn't<00:01:30.030> bring<00:01:30.210> out

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
whereas with like you couldn't bring out

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.330 
whereas with like you couldn't bring out
a<00:01:30.390> little<00:01:30.689> puppy<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:30.990> use<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> toy<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.189> those

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
a little puppy and use a toy to do those

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670 
a little puppy and use a toy to do those
things<00:01:32.490> very<00:01:32.640> functionally<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:34.200> food<00:01:34.380> no

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
things very functionally but food no

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.080 
things very functionally but food no
problem<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.670> once<00:01:35.850> you've<00:01:35.970> established

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
problem and then once you've established

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.910 
problem and then once you've established
the<00:01:36.540> behavior<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.049> food<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.619> replace

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the behavior with food you can replace

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.760 
the behavior with food you can replace
the<00:01:38.100> food<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> toy<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.590> after<00:01:40.590> lunch

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the food with the toy and after lunch

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.690 
the food with the toy and after lunch
we'll<00:01:40.920> bring<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.280> we'll<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> little

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
we'll bring out and we'll do a little

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
we'll bring out and we'll do a little
play<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> toy<00:01:42.320> but<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.560> should<00:01:43.860> say<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
play with the toy but I should say that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.969 
play with the toy but I should say that
we<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> toy<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.659> an<00:01:46.530> obedience

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
we don't use the toy as an obedience

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.149 
we don't use the toy as an obedience

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.620 
because obviously if they don't want it
enough<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> reward<00:02:20.209> they<00:02:21.209> won't<00:02:21.450> let

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
enough it's not a reward they won't let

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.770 
enough it's not a reward they won't let
go<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.200> then<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.280> get<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:23.940> repetition<00:02:24.209> of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
go of it then I get one repetition of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.660 
go of it then I get one repetition of
whatever<00:02:25.170> behavior<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.620> want<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.190> then<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.550> have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
whatever behavior I want and then I have

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.030 
whatever behavior I want and then I have
a<00:02:26.700> fight<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.870> get<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> thing<00:02:28.290> back<00:02:28.319> so

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
a fight to get the thing back so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.370 
a fight to get the thing back so
whatever<00:02:29.819> good<00:02:30.180> things<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:30.570> learned<00:02:30.840> they

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
whatever good things they learned they

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.900 
whatever good things they learned they
just<00:02:31.590> unlearned<00:02:32.010> because<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.370> had<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.700> choke

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
just unlearned because I had to choke

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.820 
just unlearned because I had to choke
them<00:02:33.030> off<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.360> thing<00:02:33.570> afterwards<00:02:34.080> right<00:02:34.350> so

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
them off the thing afterwards right so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.140 
them off the thing afterwards right so
they<00:02:34.950> had<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> good<00:02:35.370> experience<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.030> then

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
they had a good experience and then

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.640 
they had a good experience and then
immediately<00:02:36.540> followed<00:02:36.810> by<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.930> bad<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.440> right

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
immediately followed by a bad one right

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.199 
immediately followed by a bad one right
so<00:02:37.950> that's<00:02:38.070> we<00:02:38.250> would<00:02:38.400> prefer<00:02:38.700> not<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:39.060> that

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
so that's we would prefer not to do that

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.670 
so that's we would prefer not to do that
and<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:39.870> won't<00:02:40.050> bring<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.290> back<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.590> you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
and if they won't bring it back to you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.960 
and if they won't bring it back to you
it's<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.860> problem<00:02:41.160> too<00:02:41.340> because<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:41.880> they

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
it's a problem too because then if they

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.360 
it's a problem too because then if they
pull<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.300> out<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.480> your<00:02:42.540> hand<00:02:42.780> or<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.920> throw<00:02:44.190> it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
pull it out of your hand or you throw it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.350 
pull it out of your hand or you throw it
and<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.730> got<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.910> chase<00:02:45.090> them<00:02:45.239> around

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and then you got to chase them around

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.150 
and then you got to chase them around
and<00:02:45.630> get<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.810> back<00:02:45.930> from<00:02:46.140> them<00:02:46.380> again<00:02:46.800> you

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and get it back from them again you

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160 
and get it back from them again you
introduce<00:02:47.489> conflict<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.420> disrupts

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
introduce conflict to your and disrupts

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.570 
introduce conflict to your and disrupts
the<00:02:49.260> flow<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.470> your<00:02:49.680> obedience<00:02:50.100> sessions<00:02:50.400> and

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the flow of your obedience sessions and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.130 
the flow of your obedience sessions and
potentially<00:02:51.000> introduces<00:02:51.420> conflict<00:02:51.840> into<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
potentially introduces conflict into the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.199 
potentially introduces conflict into the
relationship<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.220> what<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.550> want<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.850> do<00:02:54.000> is

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
relationship so what we want to do is

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.130 
relationship so what we want to do is
make<00:02:54.360> sure<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.570> get<00:02:54.690> those<00:02:54.840> things<00:02:55.019> all

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
make sure you get those things all

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.940 
make sure you get those things all
ironed<00:02:55.500> out<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.640> play<00:02:56.880> portion<00:02:57.950> before

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
you go on to using it in the obedience

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.410 
you go on to using it in the obedience

those things now at that point I can

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.020 
those things now at that point I can
start<00:03:15.090> using<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.230> toy<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:16.800> place<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.880> food

start using the toy in place of the food

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.690 
start using the toy in place of the food
in<00:03:18.269> obedience<00:03:18.750> games<00:03:19.410> right<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.190> tend<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.579> try

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
in obedience games right I tend to try

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.910 
in obedience games right I tend to try
to<00:03:20.790> get<00:03:20.940> those<00:03:21.030> things<00:03:21.650> established<00:03:22.650> as<00:03:22.769> their

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
to get those things established as their

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.830 
to get those things established as their
own<00:03:23.040> thing<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:24.030> typical<00:03:24.420> thing<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.720> me

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
own thing so a typical thing with me

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.970 
own thing so a typical thing with me
with<00:03:24.989> puppies<00:03:25.290> that'd<00:03:25.530> bring<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.739> puppy<00:03:25.950> out

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
with puppies that'd bring the puppy out

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.220 
with puppies that'd bring the puppy out
I'd<00:03:26.640> do<00:03:26.850> some<00:03:27.030> food<00:03:27.239> work<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.600> little<00:03:27.720> bit<00:03:27.959> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
I'd do some food work a little bit and

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.170 
I'd do some food work a little bit and
then<00:03:28.709> I'd<00:03:29.280> take<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.459> break<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.760> I'd<00:03:29.850> do<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> play

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
then I'd take a break and I'd do a play

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.780 
then I'd take a break and I'd do a play
session<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.870> then<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.860> do<00:03:31.920> those<00:03:32.190> repeatedly

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
session and then I do those repeatedly

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.310 
session and then I do those repeatedly
so<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> food<00:03:33.209> sessions<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.660> concentrate<00:03:34.200> on

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320

to me they're learning those things and

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.140 
to me they're learning those things and
then<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.739> merge<00:03:53.100> those<00:03:53.370> worlds<00:03:53.790> as<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:53.940> go

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
then I merge those worlds as you go

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.229 
then I merge those worlds as you go
along<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:55.370> you'll<00:03:56.370> have<00:03:56.549> some<00:03:56.730> dogs<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.060> are

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
along and you'll have some dogs that are

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.660 
along and you'll have some dogs that are
gonna<00:03:57.450> be<00:03:57.630> more<00:03:58.079> motivated<00:03:58.260> by<00:03:58.739> food<00:03:59.040> for

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
gonna be more motivated by food for

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.000 
gonna be more motivated by food for
their<00:03:59.760> entire<00:03:59.970> life<00:04:00.269> in<00:04:00.540> which<00:04:01.140> case<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.890> can

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
their entire life in which case you can

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.380 
their entire life in which case you can
use<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.190> toy<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.519> exercise<00:04:02.910> them<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.209> stuff

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
use the toy to exercise them and stuff

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.910 
use the toy to exercise them and stuff
but<00:04:03.600> you're<00:04:03.840> still<00:04:04.110> probably<00:04:04.260> when<00:04:04.709> doing

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
but you're still probably when doing

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.860 
but you're still probably when doing
obedience<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.400> are<00:04:05.489> gonna<00:04:05.610> use<00:04:05.670> food<00:04:06.510> more

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
obedience that are gonna use food more

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.180 
obedience that are gonna use food more
frequently<00:04:07.320> than<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.560> toy<00:04:07.739> because<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.130> a

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
frequently than a toy because it's a

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.860 
frequently than a toy because it's a
higher<00:04:08.340> value<00:04:08.700> reward<00:04:09.030> for<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.329> dog<00:04:09.570> and

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
higher value reward for that dog and

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.560 
higher value reward for that dog and
then<00:04:10.709> for<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:10.950> lot<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.190> other<00:04:11.340> dogs<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.940> play<00:04:12.209> is

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
then for a lot of other dogs the play is

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.479 
then for a lot of other dogs the play is
going<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.959> outstrip<00:04:13.470> their<00:04:13.709> desire<00:04:14.010> for<00:04:14.280> food

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
going to outstrip their desire for food

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.880 
going to outstrip their desire for food
rapidly<00:04:15.269> especially<00:04:16.079> we<00:04:16.169> start<00:04:16.380> working<00:04:16.590> with

their desire for the toy is much higher
than<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.280> desire<00:04:29.550> for<00:04:29.580> food<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:31.080> that

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
than the desire for food and so that

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.840 
than the desire for food and so that
means<00:04:31.470> that's<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.830> highest<00:04:32.100> value<00:04:32.370> reward<00:04:32.699> so

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
means that's the highest value reward so

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.550 
means that's the highest value reward so
in<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.060> end<00:04:33.180> we<00:04:33.509> want<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.750> use<00:04:33.960> what's<00:04:34.380> most

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
in the end we want to use what's most

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.590 
in the end we want to use what's most
rewarding<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.280> dog<00:04:35.430> right<00:04:35.789> because<00:04:36.389> if<00:04:36.509> we

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
rewarding to the dog right because if we

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.330 
rewarding to the dog right because if we
do<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.870> we<00:04:37.050> get<00:04:37.139> better<00:04:37.410> stronger<00:04:37.680> behaviors

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
do that we get better stronger behaviors

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.760 
do that we get better stronger behaviors
so<00:04:39.270> we'll<00:04:39.570> switch<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:40.199> whatever<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.620> dog

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
so we'll switch to whatever the dog

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.620 
so we'll switch to whatever the dog
likes<00:04:41.009> best<00:04:41.340> after<00:04:42.000> we've<00:04:42.180> done<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.479> initial

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630
