all<00:02:39.490> you<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:39.850> collect<00:02:40.750> flags<00:02:41.220> shoot<00:02:42.220> shapes

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
all you do is collect flags shoot shapes

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.870 
all you do is collect flags shoot shapes
and<00:02:43.530> move<00:02:44.530> forward<00:02:47.610> what<00:02:48.610> was<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:48.850> the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and move forward what was it in the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.610 
and move forward what was it in the
beginning<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.930> looked<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:50.319> there<00:02:50.500> were

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
beginning it looked like there were

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.890 
beginning it looked like there were
options<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:51.280> customize<00:02:51.940> yourself<00:02:52.390> there<00:02:52.810> were

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
options to customize yourself there were

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.570 
options to customize yourself there were
options<00:02:53.110> customize<00:02:53.830> yourself<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:56.580> suppose

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
options customize yourself so I suppose

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.030 
options customize yourself so I suppose
there's<00:02:57.880> there<00:02:58.570> could<00:02:58.810> potentially<00:02:58.959> be<00:02:59.500> quite

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
there's there could potentially be quite

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.449 
there's there could potentially be quite
a<00:03:00.070> bit<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.370> strategy<00:03:00.580> here<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:03.730> none<00:03:05.459> which
