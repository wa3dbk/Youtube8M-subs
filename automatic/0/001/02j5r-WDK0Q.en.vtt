00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.669
 in the same way that all studies of 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.610
 architecture have to have a 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:19.300
 organization some protocols of 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.980
 functioning that traditionally 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.160
 managed a character called 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.220
 backup manager and still doing it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.980
 the appearance of the new tools 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.079
 beam or not so new because it makes 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 enough time that they stick together 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.440
 are generalizing makes the level of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.230
 organization of a study 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.940
 architecture has to be still 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:53.390
 much more accurate and much more 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:57.290
 detailed the bim brings in exchange for this 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:02.730
 small organizational overstrain 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:05.970
 It brings a great return in terms of 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.780
 the control of the project 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 the fact that the bim this is a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.789
 collaborative environment that allows 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.700
 the different agents involved 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:22.680
 in a project work on a single 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 model in a coordinated way allows 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.030
 the project manager has a great 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.380
 control over everything that is 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.270
 happening 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.130
 and at the same time that all the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.649
 information that comes from the project 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.399
 have be consistent to the figure of the bid 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.979
 manager that is this character that is going to 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.340
 ensure that all these agents 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.210
 work in a coordinated way 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.520
 establishing the protocols of 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.220
 action necessary for this to be 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.450
 possible and for the exchange of 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.090
 information in a fluid way becomes a 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.380
 fundamental element the beat manager 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.830
 must know the different environments of 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.530
 collaborative work because and this is 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.410
 important you will never meet with 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.209
 a single work environment 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.910
 structural engineer works with 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.239
 your software with your environment the engineer 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.970
 of facilities works with yours and 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.459
 so on so that the bit 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.860
 spring should know the different 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:36.210
 work methodologies of the different 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.670
 involved in the project as well as 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.730
 the different environments with which 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.480
 work this means knowing a 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.080
 multiplicity of tools and a 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.460
 domain of exchange formats 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.490
 of standard data to get that 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.450
 effectively this uniqueness of project 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.450
 be completed 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.280
 ah 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.280
 or 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.630
 ah
