00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.649
 hello friends this little video for 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.269
 tell them how we woke up today I do not know 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.160
 how many centimeters of snow I already have 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 I 'm going to measure the meter , I'll see 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.269
 how many centimeters of snow 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.910
 they see him 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.630
 good 38 centimeters of snow 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.630
 go 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.630
 just as is the parking lot 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.400
 it is impossible to leave are 8 and 45 of the 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.560
 tomorrow I had an appointment at 9 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.320
 obviously I could not go 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.670
 maybe a 4x4 could come out not my 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.620
 car 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.600
 and those who go out to play sports do not 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.469
 could that people must walk by 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.929
 street because the platforms were lost 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.500
 running to that point that you start to 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.510
 fade in the fog 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.920
 and will be for at least three days to do 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.710
 a crane take it out 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.970
 buried cars 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 to the rims above the rims 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 has a clean yellow machinery 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.800
 snow small tractors cleaning the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.450
 platforms 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.450
 this area to clean in tn 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.240
 and these are great to clean the streets 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.730
 we are in mid -December we have a 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.460
 snow fall almost 40 centimeters like that 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.810
 of is half collapsed but so far 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.140
 is the first the first really 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.860
 important usually every winter in 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.380
 as it is not 12 of these otherwise there 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.000
 constant snowfall more or less 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.650
 8 or 10 centimeters of honey that are not 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.630
 greater things 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.020
 only me I can think out the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.350
 capacity like that because yes but s 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.189
 so he commissioned them a like 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.189
 good 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.000
 well the man is already in the car 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.020
 outside palm tree 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.050
 a failure came out after 45 minutes of 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.380
 be for yesterday my friend who lives in 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.710
 Miami sent me this image yesterday I was 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.360
 against minus 18 plus the factor 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.790
 wind 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.920
 we would be at minus 25 that is between 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.209
 miami and montreal had practically 50 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.040
 degrees of difference at the same time the 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.870
 same day at the same time 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.950
 that we are fighting snow 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.950
 It's 3 in the afternoon 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.700
 and we have struggled for half an hour trying to 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.560
 take out the car 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.319
 now that we have taken it out we have to 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.870
 leave half clean the entrance problems 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.870
 that we have a little stick for parana 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.400
 sand friends 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.400
 already quite cold 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.920
 It's nice although if you see the horizon 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.960
 up down because both the sky 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.960
 converted are the same blue color 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.710
 I could say that there is no shadow there is no 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.960
 nothing like it 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.760
 It is the country where we live and the country where 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.970
 possibly you want to live if you are 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.970
 all right 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.920
 it's still a wonderful country 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.800
 because if you want to come, it's because it's 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.660
 a little better than yours as it is a 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.900
 little better than mine 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.600
 I must accept it, friends, thank you very much for 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.940
 see the video he commissioned them a like for the 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.740
 cold 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.230
 a hug 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.230
 see you later bye bye 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.750
 famous
