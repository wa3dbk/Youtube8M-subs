00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.660
 arms 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.560
 m 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.390
 there will be just compulsive that's 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.419
 luxury and we end up today for 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.869
 a new top 5 on the traps of call 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.529
 of duty 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.019
 I saw that the first episode on 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.530
 wonder woman the famous top 5 wan web 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:40.059
 you have more so I decided to 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.970
 continue the series with the traps and we 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.680
 start without further delay with the trap 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.420
 good propeller for sure it's not the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.470
 trap of more useful it is very pity 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.399
 frankly because it's a trap 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.019
 very bad ass I would have liked that utility 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.370
 either but that's what everyone 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.500
 world just forget this trap of if he 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.030
 can because nobody uses it's 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
 normal it's really trap really 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.090
 so that's why that's all 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.140
 world forget it's really a pity 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.879
 because it's a very beautiful trap 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.899
 found I think that several people 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.000
 will agree with me it's in 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.270
 quite original case but 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.830
 efficiency for the unfortunately and 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.390
 buys immediately with 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.789
 fourth position again on 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.429
 a furniture maubeuge 2 dead with the famous 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.080
 acid cage that is very very nice big 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.630
 way for no big run it's 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.130
 really the trap to use in addition 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.619
 you have the little kraft table for 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.500
 your shields you have no better 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.360
 Max places that's really the trap is 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.890
 used for a very very original group 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 as a trap frankly it's the only 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.429
 trap to try to find find in 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.759
 the game and frankly surely both the 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.140
 dead 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.380
 we can not have better maps 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.959
 for this kind of trap of one goes on 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.530
 right away with the top 3 with the 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:48.550
 trap one says the trap of china where the I 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.979
 do not know how a pleasure frankly 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.369
 there's more blur mouth not the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.410
 left flank 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.200
 I do not know if it's non- degree - granting coop 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.989
 the trap who who is the most badass 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.580
 in my opinion of the game there is pa pai not a 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:02.200
 more badass cache than those on this game 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.020
 frankly that's if the trap of 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.159
 the ultimate smash for clothes 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.170
 frankly I would have liked better who 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.230
 had more looting like that on this 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.940
 game there the pitfalls really we mean 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.280
 that we can not replace them is good 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.420
 I know if the most beautiful say it's 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.300
 not the worst is considered more useful but 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.629
 it's my favorite is question question 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.819
 badass so again we continue with it 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.200
 top 2 Belgian electric families 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.910
 we all know these traps the bone 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.110
 it's normal because there is 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.330
 a lot of electric traps on black 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.069
 ops oms we are invaded by his never again 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.569
 it remains that we never get tired 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.720
 disable these very beautiful traps 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.380
 very original also the traps the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.260
 electric traps 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.450
 frankly I could not live without it 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.800
 it is very useful and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.300
 yeah frankly there are several 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.879
 strategies that can be done with these 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.050
 traps the iphone ssq with its banks of 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.959
 what we can use different 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.620
 different statuses strata one can 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.090
 make double double dip 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.040
 ddd small dip in trap for 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.780
 do a kind of strategy for example 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.640
 as rocks of several strategies 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.200
 that can be changed with these traps 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.700
 Power there that could not 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.380
 do with other fishing hours so 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.959
 for those very well we can iron 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.060
 in very quickly entrusted 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.220
 unlike, for example, the trap 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.950
 trap tried to compose easily 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.480
 so that's very very good for this and 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.180
 So here we continue and immediately 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.769
 we continue with the top 20 the famous 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.720
 9am traps why the trap does not have 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.430
 mounted points you will tell me bah 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.610
 it's because it's just 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.430
 because of the enormous efficiency that we have on 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.670
 the map that will tell us how to trap 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.019
 ultimate to use on a kino run 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.310
 simply because there is no henvic 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.099
 can you touch if you put in 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.049
 the spa everything I'm very familiar with 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.230
 this map the ja to 15000 all 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.630
 Spain will rush into the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.639
 trap and without you having to do 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.190
 something you let them burst 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.500
 wanted to leave cramer and it's very 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.690
 well when I sit down the ultimate trap 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.489
 used very effective so I hope that 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.810
 the top 5 you enjoyed do not hesitate to 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.760

 favorite trap is your top 5 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.400
 what is your top 5 of traps on call 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.560
 of duty 1 ghz
