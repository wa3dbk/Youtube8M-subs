00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hi, how are you, my name, I'm in this little video, I'll explain how 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.769
 choose a good polarized 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.759
 to catch a polarized flight it is very difficult to know the amount of this 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.530
 only watching it 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.440
 touching him 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.720
 or by the color of this one 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.890
 or the popular belief that says the polarized one between darker 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.050
 more protects from heat 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.310
 that is totally false 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.790
 commonly when you are going to buy it in a warehouse when you were independent 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.340
 polarized either for your vehicle helmet has blinked milestone 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.860
 he does it trusting in the person who is going to provide the inter-aogo service 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.680
 Closed 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.000
 he thinks that he is applying polarized black and that is not the case 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.250
 because in the trade there are different qualities of polarized with the same 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.080
 appearance 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.280
 and consistent with the quality so the price the life cycle and the benefit 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 of this one 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 then as a whip to choose a polarized 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.870
 what you should know is that the polarized provides 4 benefits 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.390
 first it rejects the ultraviolet rays that ray that of color and san 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.880
 furniture curtains and furnishings 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 second peters to visible light 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.780
 third reject the heat 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.370
 4th gives security in case of breaking albir 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.320
 to the naked eye when he finished polarized the only thing he can appreciate 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.470
 of the benefits are points 2 and 4 what is 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.610
 how much visible light does it pass according to the tonality of the polarized one that is going to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.460
 Apply 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.820
 and that apply to provide security in case the money is agreed 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 preventing people from getting hurt 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.770
 but point 1 and 3 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.770
 You can only know with state-of-the-art equipment 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.870
 This teams 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.580
 tells us how much polarized heat delay and how much delay of the rays 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.910
 ultraviolet 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.759
 to demonstrate the quality of any polarized 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.630
 it does 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.860
 with this latest technology instrument that explodes infrared lights 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.799
 to avoid the sun's rays 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.409
 will demonstrate the energy efficiency of any polarized in terms of 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:21.779
 ultraviolet rays 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.109
 the visible 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.109
 infrared or heat roosters 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.879
 in this image the equipment is on, marking on the board 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.299
 100% ultraviolet rays 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.009
 100% in visible light 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.009
 100% infrared or heat rays 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:46.009
 imitating facades young tarascon them without any protection against 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.289
 inclemencies rays of the sun 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:53.919
 next you will see a comparison between the polarized titanium which is a 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.209
 product well known in the market 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.489
 and lose quality go down 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.269
 and comparing it with the polarized the remove high quality 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.079
 here 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.229
 whether the sample is placed in the latest technology equipment 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.319
 of a sample of polarized 80 and 40 percent titan 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.129
 and on the other side in the polarized lineage is a sample 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.379
 of percentage 40 percent i 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.929
 in the polarized titanium 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.160
 percent the team shows 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.479
 to let go 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.490
 0% ultraviolet rays which means it's never effective 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.220
 the polarized so against the ultraviolet rays so that no color is given and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.720
 c 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.189
 the furniture curtains with six 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.870
 the same also applies for the polarized stand is also very 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.659
 efficient delaying 100% of ultraviolet rays 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.339
 now occupies the part of visible light 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:55.179
 lets pass the pentium percent visible light which means it protects the 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:57.569
 69% of visible light 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.689
 rejected part the sunburst 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.009
 the same 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.629
 the polarized to you 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.859
 lets pass 31% ultraviolet rays 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.859
 so who rejects the world 69% 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.429
 here exploded difference the polarized 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:20.489
 40% titanium lets heat pass 82 percent which means that they protect 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.039
 or more 18% heat 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:29.759
 while the polarized one I decided to let pass 28% protecting 72% of the 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:30.499
 hot 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.849
 and this is where the polarized of you is shown 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.280
 compared to titanium 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.850
 in the high quality polarized because it delays the heat more efficiently 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.589
 there we're going to get more air conditioning performance and if 

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:49.629
 this one in a vehicle is going to be more pompous 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.669
 inside the vehicle 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.449
 an earlier explanation is shown that the polarized between 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.969
 fine greater than the benefit in terms of heat rejection 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.899
 portrait the ultraviolet rays and the most important thing that the total investment will be 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:07.339
 long-term 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.689
 then do not hesitate to call us and with so much not to install the best 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.249
 polarized 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:15.830
 I speak to him and we are bouquets 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.020
 until a next opportunity
