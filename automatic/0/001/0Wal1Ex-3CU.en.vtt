00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
gets this area right here but

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.840 
gets this area right here but

strengthening that core will really help

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.580 
strengthening that core will really help
you<00:02:08.250> power<00:02:08.580> forward

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
you power forward

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.800 
you power forward
um<00:02:09.920> start<00:02:10.519> working<00:02:10.819> out<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.150> kind<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.420> area

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
um start working out that kind of area

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.750 
um start working out that kind of area
and<00:02:12.050> then<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.739> know<00:02:12.860> another<00:02:13.129> benefit<00:02:13.580> other

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and then you know another benefit other

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.040 
and then you know another benefit other
than<00:02:13.849> running<00:02:14.090> faster<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.870> have

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
than running faster is that you have

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.229 
than running faster is that you have
really<00:02:15.349> good<00:02:15.470> looking<00:02:15.709> abdomen<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.090> that's

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
really good looking abdomen so that's

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.000 
really good looking abdomen so that's
the<00:02:17.330> first<00:02:17.510> tip<00:02:17.780> back<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.319> is<00:02:18.470> actually<00:02:18.860> what

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
the first tip back in is actually what

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.770 
the first tip back in is actually what
you're<00:02:19.220> doing<00:02:19.430> that's<00:02:19.550> not<00:02:19.940> exercise<00:02:20.450> and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
you're doing that's not exercise and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.170 
you're doing that's not exercise and
it's<00:02:20.900> eating<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.500> staying<00:02:21.769> hydrated<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.819> is

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
it's eating and staying hydrated it is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.210 
it's eating and staying hydrated it is
very<00:02:23.420> difficult<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:24.170> run<00:02:24.319> fast<00:02:24.650> if<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.069> are

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
very difficult to run fast if you are

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.920 
very difficult to run fast if you are
dehydrated<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:26.000> need<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.269> have<00:02:26.450> enough<00:02:26.690> water

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
dehydrated you need to have enough water

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.509 
dehydrated you need to have enough water
on<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:27.410> also<00:02:27.560> difficult<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.099> run<00:02:28.280> if<00:02:28.430> you

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
on you it's also difficult to run if you

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.059 
on you it's also difficult to run if you
gotta<00:02:28.700> go<00:02:28.879> pee<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.810> my<00:02:30.230> recommendation<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:31.010> you

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
gotta go pee so my recommendation is you

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.650 
gotta go pee so my recommendation is you
use<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.519> restroom<00:02:31.640> before<00:02:32.030> you're<00:02:32.420> going<00:02:32.599> to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
use the restroom before you're going to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.030 
use the restroom before you're going to
run<00:02:32.810> or<00:02:32.989> something<00:02:33.170> but<00:02:33.620> make<00:02:33.799> sure<00:02:33.830> that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
run or something but make sure that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800 
run or something but make sure that
you're<00:02:34.129> drinking<00:02:34.400> enough<00:02:34.700> water<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.330> staying

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
you're drinking enough water and staying

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.180 
you're drinking enough water and staying
hydrated<00:02:36.080> especially<00:02:36.410> when<00:02:37.099> you're

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
hydrated especially when you're

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.280 
hydrated especially when you're
exercising<00:02:37.459> you're<00:02:37.940> sweating<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.599> your<00:02:39.200> body

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
exercising you're sweating and your body

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.479 
exercising you're sweating and your body
is<00:02:39.410> losing<00:02:39.739> moisture<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.310> need<00:02:40.430> to

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
is losing moisture so you need to

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.830 
is losing moisture so you need to
replenish<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.910> also<00:02:41.420> make<00:02:41.569> sure<00:02:41.720> you're

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
replenish that also make sure you're

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.710 
replenish that also make sure you're
eating<00:02:41.989> healthy<00:02:42.819> some<00:02:43.819> people<00:02:44.090> have<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.569> idea

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
eating healthy some people have the idea

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.500 
eating healthy some people have the idea
of<00:02:44.989> carbo<00:02:45.440> loading<00:02:45.799> before<00:02:46.099> running<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
of carbo loading before running it's the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.970 
of carbo loading before running it's the
idea<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:47.989> they<00:02:48.230> want<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.500> eat<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> ton<00:02:48.920> of

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
idea that they want to eat a ton of

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.100 
idea that they want to eat a ton of
carbs<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.849> their<00:02:50.000> body<00:02:50.209> can<00:02:50.599> be<00:02:50.810> ready<00:02:51.019> to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
carbs so that their body can be ready to

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.860 
carbs so that their body can be ready to
run<00:02:51.610> that's<00:02:52.610> kind<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:53.000> true<00:02:53.239> but<00:02:53.480> kind<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.810> not

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
run that's kind of true but kind of not

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.809 
run that's kind of true but kind of not
your<00:02:54.290> body<00:02:54.500> definitely<00:02:55.010> needs<00:02:55.190> carbohydrates

and<00:02:56.000> glucose<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.810> run<00:02:57.049> but<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.310> needs<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:58.700> be

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
and glucose to run but it needs to be

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.640 
and glucose to run but it needs to be
eaten<00:02:59.180> before<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.900> run<00:03:00.079> but<00:03:00.290> not<00:03:00.410> right

before a run you want to make sure that

there<00:03:21.920> are<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.160> good<00:03:22.549> idea<00:03:22.880> in<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.269> case

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
there are a good idea in this case

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.390 
there are a good idea in this case
because<00:03:23.989> they<00:03:24.139> can<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.920> know<00:03:24.950> give<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.280> an

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
because they can you know give you an

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
immediate source of energy but eat

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.479 
immediate source of energy but eat
before<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.410> drink<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.739> lot<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.980> water<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.310> stay

before I drink a lot of water and stay

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.400 
before I drink a lot of water and stay
hydrated<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.359> way<00:03:29.480> you're<00:03:29.630> not<00:03:29.660> cramping

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
hydrated so that way you're not cramping

hydrated so that way you're not cramping
when<00:03:30.620> you're<00:03:30.739> running<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.609> do<00:03:31.849> have

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
when you're running and you do have

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.000 
when you're running and you do have

enough fuel to push you forward to the
end<00:03:34.130> another<00:03:34.609> tip<00:03:34.849> is<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.150> try<00:03:35.630> some<00:03:35.989> hills<00:03:36.380> go

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
end another tip is to try some hills go

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.280 
end another tip is to try some hills go
hiking<00:03:37.220> reason<00:03:38.209> why<00:03:38.359> is<00:03:38.419> because<00:03:38.720> when<00:03:39.139> we're

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
hiking reason why is because when we're

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.440 
hiking reason why is because when we're
hiking<00:03:39.530> up<00:03:39.859> hills<00:03:40.160> we're<00:03:40.669> using<00:03:40.940> different

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
hiking up hills we're using different

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.089 
hiking up hills we're using different
muscles<00:03:41.599> when<00:03:42.109> we're<00:03:42.260> running<00:03:42.620> we're<00:03:42.769> using<00:03:42.919> a

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
muscles when we're running we're using a

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.159 
muscles when we're running we're using a
lot<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.280> our<00:03:43.519> apps<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:44.030> lot<00:03:44.209> of<00:03:44.329> our<00:03:44.450> hamstrings

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
lot of our apps a lot of our hamstrings

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.890 
lot of our apps a lot of our hamstrings
a<00:03:45.440> little<00:03:46.310> bit<00:03:46.579> of<00:03:46.639> our<00:03:46.760> calves<00:03:47.030> now<00:03:47.419> when<00:03:47.720> we

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
a little bit of our calves now when we

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.710 
a little bit of our calves now when we
hike<00:03:48.260> we<00:03:48.829> are<00:03:48.980> using<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.459> ton<00:03:49.849> of<00:03:49.880> our<00:03:50.090> calves<00:03:50.480> a

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
hike we are using a ton of our calves a

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.559 
hike we are using a ton of our calves a
ton<00:03:51.079> of<00:03:51.109> our<00:03:51.650> side<00:03:52.340> muscles<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:52.970> our<00:03:53.090> buttocks

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
ton of our side muscles and our buttocks

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.839 
ton of our side muscles and our buttocks
we<00:03:54.290> have<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.530> gluteus<00:03:54.889> minimus<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.519> gluteus

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
we have the gluteus minimus the gluteus

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.000 
we have the gluteus minimus the gluteus
medius<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.660> gluteus<00:03:56.930> maximus<00:03:57.620> those<00:03:57.829> are

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
medius and the gluteus maximus those are

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.830 
medius and the gluteus maximus those are
the<00:03:58.069> three<00:03:58.370> layers<00:03:58.669> of<00:03:58.940> muscle<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.450> your<00:03:59.480> butt

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
the three layers of muscle on your butt

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.979 
the three layers of muscle on your butt
so<00:04:00.470> your<00:04:00.650> butt<00:04:00.980> is<00:04:01.190> like<00:04:01.220> one<00:04:01.669> huge<00:04:01.910> muscle<00:04:02.480> now

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
so your butt is like one huge muscle now

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.500 
so your butt is like one huge muscle now
running<00:04:03.410> helps<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.609> butt<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.790> little<00:04:05.030> bit<00:04:05.269> but

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
running helps the butt a little bit but

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.710 
running helps the butt a little bit but
hiking<00:04:06.079> blasts<00:04:06.859> that<00:04:07.040> butt<00:04:07.459> into<00:04:07.730> action<00:04:08.209> so

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
hiking blasts that butt into action so

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.900 
hiking blasts that butt into action so
if<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.870> go<00:04:09.200> hiking<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:10.099> are<00:04:10.250> really<00:04:10.549> going<00:04:10.849> to

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
if you go hiking you are really going to

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.300 
if you go hiking you are really going to
tone<00:04:11.180> up<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.569> but<00:04:11.900> then<00:04:12.739> let's<00:04:13.010> say<00:04:13.099> that<00:04:13.250> you

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
tone up that but then let's say that you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.250 
tone up that but then let's say that you
can<00:04:13.459> hike<00:04:13.639> up<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:13.940> hill<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.450> well<00:04:14.630> well

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
can hike up that hill really well well

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.900 
can hike up that hill really well well
guess<00:04:15.440> what<00:04:15.620> when<00:04:15.859> you<00:04:15.950> get<00:04:16.099> back<00:04:16.400> on<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.729> normal

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
guess what when you get back on a normal

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.930 
guess what when you get back on a normal
track<00:04:17.450> you<00:04:17.810> will<00:04:17.930> be<00:04:18.049> able<00:04:18.140> to<00:04:18.289> run

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
track you will be able to run

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.490 
track you will be able to run
sir<00:04:19.120> because<00:04:19.450> these<00:04:19.630> muscles<00:04:20.110> are<00:04:20.230> not<00:04:20.260> used

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
sir because these muscles are not used

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.990 
sir because these muscles are not used
to<00:04:20.650> hiking<00:04:20.920> which<00:04:21.220> is<00:04:21.370> harder<00:04:21.730> than<00:04:21.820> running

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
to hiking which is harder than running

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.490 
to hiking which is harder than running
so<00:04:22.660> when<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:22.960> work<00:04:23.140> out<00:04:23.290> those<00:04:23.470> muscles

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
so when you work out those muscles

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.440 
so when you work out those muscles
differently<00:04:24.370> they'll<00:04:24.670> get<00:04:24.790> accustomed<00:04:25.090> to

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
differently they'll get accustomed to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.510 
differently they'll get accustomed to
that<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:26.440> that<00:04:26.620> way<00:04:26.740> when<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.980> run<00:04:27.190> it'll<00:04:27.430> be

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
runner on living to run faster sprint it

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.800 
runner on living to run faster sprint it
out<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.430> very<00:05:57.640> last<00:05:57.940> tip<00:05:58.150> that<00:05:58.270> I<00:05:58.330> have<00:05:58.510> is

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
out a very last tip that I have is

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.900 
out a very last tip that I have is
stretching<00:05:59.530> you<00:05:59.860> guys<00:06:00.040> know<00:06:00.310> that<00:06:00.340> stretching

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
stretching you guys know that stretching

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.390 
stretching you guys know that stretching
before<00:06:01.090> and<00:06:01.630> after<00:06:02.169> a<00:06:02.200> run<00:06:02.470> is<00:06:02.710> very<00:06:03.100> essential

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
before and after a run is very essential

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.400 
before and after a run is very essential
to<00:06:03.730> preventing<00:06:04.210> injury<00:06:04.630> because<00:06:04.930> you<00:06:05.140> stretch

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
to preventing injury because you stretch

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.110 
to preventing injury because you stretch
without<00:06:05.560> you<00:06:05.919> you<00:06:06.460> know<00:06:06.580> get<00:06:06.730> those<00:06:06.910> muscles

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
without you you know get those muscles

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.600 
without you you know get those muscles
ready<00:06:07.510> but<00:06:08.050> it's<00:06:08.169> also<00:06:08.410> essential<00:06:08.890> to<00:06:09.130> running

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
ready but it's also essential to running

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.970 
ready but it's also essential to running
faster<00:06:10.120> reason<00:06:11.020> why<00:06:11.200> I<00:06:11.230> think<00:06:11.560> of<00:06:11.650> it<00:06:11.710> is<00:06:11.830> like

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
faster reason why I think of it is like

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.220 
faster reason why I think of it is like
squeaky<00:06:12.370> door<00:06:12.730> hinges<00:06:13.180> what<00:06:13.570> happens<00:06:13.960> if<00:06:14.110> the

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
squeaky door hinges what happens if the

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.360 
squeaky door hinges what happens if the
door<00:06:14.440> hinge<00:06:14.680> doesn't<00:06:15.070> have<00:06:15.160> enough

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
door hinge doesn't have enough

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.159 
door hinge doesn't have enough
lubrication<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:15.970> gets<00:06:16.120> squeaky<00:06:16.660> and<00:06:16.780> sticky

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
lubrication it gets squeaky and sticky

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.290 
lubrication it gets squeaky and sticky
and<00:06:17.380> it<00:06:17.470> doesn't<00:06:17.770> work<00:06:17.950> right<00:06:18.160> same<00:06:18.940> with<00:06:19.150> our

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
and it doesn't work right same with our

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.450 
and it doesn't work right same with our
muscles<00:06:19.750> if<00:06:20.020> they're<00:06:20.380> not<00:06:20.590> warmed<00:06:20.980> up<00:06:21.130> if<00:06:21.340> we

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
muscles if they're not warmed up if we

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.190 
muscles if they're not warmed up if we
haven't<00:06:21.700> stretched<00:06:21.970> their<00:06:22.300> squeaky<00:06:23.020> their

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
haven't stretched their squeaky their

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.170 
haven't stretched their squeaky their
sticky<00:06:23.590> they<00:06:23.890> don't<00:06:24.100> want<00:06:24.250> to<00:06:24.310> go<00:06:24.460> as<00:06:24.640> fast<00:06:24.850> you

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
sticky they don't want to go as fast you

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.140 
sticky they don't want to go as fast you
know<00:06:25.300> their<00:06:25.450> head<00:06:25.630> of<00:06:25.750> tough<00:06:26.020> and<00:06:26.430> stiff<00:06:27.430> now

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
know their head of tough and stiff now

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.270 
know their head of tough and stiff now
if<00:06:28.360> we're<00:06:28.539> stretching<00:06:28.990> these<00:06:29.289> out<00:06:29.560> guess<00:06:30.220> what

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
if we're stretching these out guess what

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.950 
if we're stretching these out guess what
happens<00:06:30.640> when<00:06:30.760> we

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
happens when we

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.930 
happens when we
run<00:06:31.080> if<00:06:31.289> we<00:06:31.470> run<00:06:31.680> after<00:06:32.069> we've<00:06:32.190> stretched<00:06:32.580> it's

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
run if we run after we've stretched it's

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.490 
run if we run after we've stretched it's
almost<00:06:33.330> like<00:06:33.509> putting<00:06:33.780> oil<00:06:33.960> on<00:06:34.169> that<00:06:34.229> door

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
almost like putting oil on that door

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.499 
almost like putting oil on that door
lubrication<00:06:35.039> our<00:06:35.400> muscles<00:06:35.729> are<00:06:35.789> ready<00:06:36.090> we<00:06:36.389> can

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
lubrication our muscles are ready we can

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.540 
lubrication our muscles are ready we can
run<00:06:36.720> faster<00:06:37.229> because<00:06:37.410> our<00:06:37.680> body<00:06:37.979> is<00:06:38.250> moving

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
run faster because our body is moving

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.870 
run faster because our body is moving
more<00:06:38.940> fluid<00:06:39.449> it's<00:06:39.569> working<00:06:40.050> better<00:06:40.199> and<00:06:41.009> so

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
more fluid it's working better and so

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.790 
more fluid it's working better and so
that's<00:06:42.030> a<00:06:42.210> huge<00:06:42.419> tip<00:06:42.690> is<00:06:42.900> not<00:06:43.199> all<00:06:43.319> you<00:06:43.440> stretch

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
that's a huge tip is not all you stretch

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.409 
that's a huge tip is not all you stretch
to<00:06:43.979> prevent<00:06:44.250> injury<00:06:44.610> but<00:06:44.819> also<00:06:45.000> to<00:06:45.270> make

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
to prevent injury but also to make

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.089

everything work better and more
fluid-like<00:06:47.669> think<00:06:48.090> of<00:06:48.180> it<00:06:48.270> as<00:06:48.360> oiling<00:06:48.810> up<00:06:48.900> a

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
fluid-like think of it as oiling up a
