00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
bike and it's the reason why it's mostly

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.640 
bike and it's the reason why it's mostly
the<00:01:28.320> reason<00:01:28.799> why<00:01:28.920> did<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.340> well<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.820> game

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
the reason why did so well in this game

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.929 
the reason why did so well in this game
and<00:01:31.729> I'm<00:01:32.729> running<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> perk<00:01:33.840> setup<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
and I'm running with the perk setup of

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:44.179 
and I'm running with the perk setup of
hardline<00:01:39.500> sleight<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> hand<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.780> ninja<00:01:43.100> but<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
hardline sleight of hand and ninja but I

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490 
hardline sleight of hand and ninja but I
think<00:01:44.399> those<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.579> some<00:01:44.909> good<00:01:45.119> perk<00:01:45.750> setups<00:01:46.229> or

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
think those are some good perk setups or

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.020 
think those are some good perk setups or
whatever<00:01:47.420> um<00:01:48.590> yeah<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.460> running<00:01:50.610> those
