00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.970 
the MX one so John can you just tell us
a<00:00:27.240> little<00:00:27.330> bit<00:00:27.480> please<00:00:27.750> about<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> M<00:00:28.439> x1

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
a little bit please about the M x1

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
a little bit please about the M x1
yeah<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> MX<00:00:29.580> 1<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.910> introduced<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.390> morning

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
yeah the MX 1 we introduced this morning

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260 
yeah the MX 1 we introduced this morning
it's<00:00:31.199> falls<00:00:31.920> under<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> eye<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.730> compact

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it's falls under the eye in compact

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.900 
it's falls under the eye in compact

backlit<00:00:46.590> CMOS<00:00:46.890> sensor<00:00:47.450> it's<00:00:48.450> 12<00:00:48.719> megapixel

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.410 
resolution it's got an articulated LCD
screen<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.559> great<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.579> low<00:00:53.699> level<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.239> high

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
screen so great for low level or high

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.229 
screen so great for low level or high
high<00:00:54.899> angle<00:00:55.230> shooting<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.850> what

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
high angle shooting but really what

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
high angle shooting but really what
makes<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.570> unique<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.559> construction<00:00:59.070> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
makes it unique is the construction of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.200 
makes it unique is the construction of
the<00:00:59.250> camera

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the camera

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
the camera
we<00:01:00.840> incorporated<00:01:01.289> brass<00:01:01.620> covers<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
we incorporated brass covers on the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
we incorporated brass covers on the
camera<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.600> kind<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.840> reminiscent<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
camera it's kind of reminiscent of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.820 
camera it's kind of reminiscent of
classic<00:01:05.250> film<00:01:05.790> camera<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.380> will<00:01:07.470> age<00:01:07.619> with

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
classic film camera and it will age with

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
classic film camera and it will age with
time<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.760> brass<00:01:08.970> will<00:01:09.510> start

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
time it's the the brass will start

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.450 
time it's the the brass will start
showing<00:01:10.229> through<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.830> use<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> camera

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
showing through as you use the camera

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
showing through as you use the camera
and<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> sit<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:13.020> guess<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.380> could

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and it's like you sit I guess I could

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.630 
and it's like you sit I guess I could
say<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> little<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> adding

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
say a little bit about it adding

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.649 
say a little bit about it adding
strength<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.270> well

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
strength as well

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.530 
strength as well
yes<00:01:15.869> strength<00:01:16.290> definitely<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> much<00:01:18.390> more

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
yes strength definitely it's a much more

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.719 
yes strength definitely it's a much more
rigid<00:01:19.189> cover<00:01:20.189> than<00:01:20.520> than<00:01:20.939> illumine

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
rigid cover than than illumine

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.850 
rigid cover than than illumine
or<00:01:22.119> polycarbonate<00:01:22.840> something<00:01:23.530> along<00:01:23.680> those

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
or polycarbonate something along those

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.830 
or polycarbonate something along those
lines<00:01:23.979> accent<00:01:24.759> what<00:01:25.090> about<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> what<00:01:25.659> about

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
lines accent what about the what about

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.940 
lines accent what about the what about
the<00:01:25.930> lens<00:01:26.110> on<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.380> camera<00:01:26.409> as<00:01:26.680> well<00:01:26.799> can<00:01:26.920> we

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
the lens on the camera as well can we

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.840 
the lens on the camera as well can we
just<00:01:27.009> take<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.250> look<00:01:27.400> at<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.549> front<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.759> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
just take a look at the front of the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.760 
just take a look at the front of the
lens<00:01:28.000> oh<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.479> just<00:01:29.170> take<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.350> look<00:01:29.500> at<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.680> he

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
lens oh and just take a look at that he

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.350 
lens oh and just take a look at that he
said<00:01:29.950> it's<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.220> four<00:01:30.640> times<00:01:30.850> optical<00:01:31.330> zoom

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
said it's a four times optical zoom

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.020 
said it's a four times optical zoom
equivalent<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.170> roughly<00:01:32.430> 28<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.549> 112

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
equivalent to roughly 28 to 112

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.680 
equivalent to roughly 28 to 112
millimeters<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:35.110> again<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.470> f<00:01:35.710> 1.8<00:01:36.310> 2.5<00:01:37.240> put

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
millimeters and again is f 1.8 2.5 put

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.779 
millimeters and again is f 1.8 2.5 put
in<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.229> just<00:01:39.039> briefly<00:01:39.250> could<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.490> tell<00:01:39.640> us<00:01:39.670> a

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
in and just briefly could you tell us a

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:40.920 
in and just briefly could you tell us a
little<00:01:39.820> bit<00:01:40.030> about<00:01:40.119> this<00:01:40.330> screen<00:01:40.659> size<00:01:40.899> that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
little bit about this screen size that

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.200 
little bit about this screen size that
they're<00:01:41.229> in<00:01:41.350> that's<00:01:41.890> a<00:01:42.070> three<00:01:42.280> inch<00:01:42.399> LCD<00:01:42.580> yep

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
they're in that's a three inch LCD yep

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.219 
they're in that's a three inch LCD yep
and<00:01:43.570> it's<00:01:44.369> $920,000<00:01:45.369> resolution<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.990> again

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
and it's $920,000 resolution and again

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.950 
and it's $920,000 resolution and again
articulated<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.130> those<00:01:48.369> nice<00:01:48.610> overhead<00:01:49.270> high

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
articulated so those nice overhead high

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.350 
articulated so those nice overhead high
angle<00:01:50.170> shots<00:01:50.380> or<00:01:50.860> waist<00:01:51.189> level<00:01:51.430> shooting<00:01:51.880> kind

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
angle shots or waist level shooting kind
