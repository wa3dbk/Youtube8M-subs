super<00:00:38.890> coin<00:00:39.130> yet<00:00:39.400> but<00:00:39.720> I'm<00:00:40.720> pretty<00:00:41.020> hopeful

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
super coin yet but I'm pretty hopeful

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
and the shallowness of them that there

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:55.200 
and the shallowness of them that there
should<00:00:46.840> be<00:00:46.870> some<00:00:47.140> silver<00:00:47.470> here<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:55.030> looks
