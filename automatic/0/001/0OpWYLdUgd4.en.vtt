underwater<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.400> LEDs<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:23.200> like<00:01:23.560> automation

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
underwater the LEDs as like automation

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.400 
underwater the LEDs as like automation
there<00:01:24.370> are<00:01:24.460> three<00:01:24.790> of<00:01:24.910> them<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.140> comes

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
for it um it does feature on the back a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.310 
for it um it does feature on the back a
LED<00:01:41.320> light<00:01:41.680> indicator<00:01:42.130> I'll<00:01:42.820> discuss<00:01:43.690> what

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
LED light indicator I'll discuss what

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.180 
LED light indicator I'll discuss what
each<00:01:44.740> individual<00:01:45.400> light<00:01:45.670> means<00:01:45.970> later<00:01:47.190> it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
each individual light means later it

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.160 
each individual light means later it
also<00:01:48.369> has<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.700> high<00:01:49.030> performance<00:01:49.540> electronic

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
also has a high performance electronic

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.770 
also has a high performance electronic
switch<00:01:50.500> which<00:01:50.979> simply<00:01:51.790> turns<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.390> light<00:01:52.570> on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
switch which simply turns the light on

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.560 
switch which simply turns the light on
and<00:01:52.960> off<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:54.130> there<00:01:54.430> are<00:01:54.580> multiple<00:01:54.850> modes

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
and off but there are multiple modes

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.340 
and off but there are multiple modes
since<00:01:55.780> wise<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.979> has<00:01:57.040> low<00:01:58.000> medium<00:01:58.810> high<00:01:59.050> and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
since wise it has low medium high and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.030 
since wise it has low medium high and
also<00:01:59.920> strobe<00:02:00.640> mode<00:02:01.350> turn<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.560> go<00:02:02.680> through<00:02:02.920> is

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
also strobe mode turn and go through is

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.730 
also strobe mode turn and go through is
basic<00:02:03.430> functions<00:02:03.880> now<00:02:04.119> right<00:02:04.960> here<00:02:05.170> voice<00:02:05.440> on

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
basic functions now right here voice on

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.059 
basic functions now right here voice on
this<00:02:05.890> will<00:02:06.070> press<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.580> once<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:08.530> goes<00:02:08.710> on<00:02:08.920> to

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
this will press it once it goes on to

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.050 
this will press it once it goes on to
low<00:02:09.250> press<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.270> again<00:02:10.800> let's<00:02:11.800> medium<00:02:12.310> press

it again goes on to high and now to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.870 
it again goes on to high and now to
access<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.990> stroke<00:02:17.590> feature<00:02:18.160> which<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.670> do

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
access a stroke feature which you can do

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.680 
access a stroke feature which you can do
it<00:02:19.000> any<00:02:19.180> stage<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:21.340> hold<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.940> busing<00:02:22.900> for

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
it any stage you just hold it busing for

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.440 
it any stage you just hold it busing for
so<00:02:23.900> for<00:02:24.170> second

in this review but also let's take the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.740 
in this review but also let's take the
battery<00:03:18.600> out<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:19.019> here<00:03:19.970> let<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:21.480> what<00:03:21.690> it

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
battery out of here let you see what it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.180 
battery out of here let you see what it
looks<00:03:21.959> like

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
looks like

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.170 
looks like
Lag<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:25.230> it's<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:28.590> rated<00:03:29.070> as<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> 8.4

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180

on<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.569> stem<00:05:17.930> but<00:05:18.470> it<00:05:18.590> could<00:05:18.830> be<00:05:18.949> placing

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
on the stem but it could be placing

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.020 
on the stem but it could be placing
other<00:05:19.669> various<00:05:20.270> parts<00:05:20.750> on<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.139> bike<00:05:22.030> there's
