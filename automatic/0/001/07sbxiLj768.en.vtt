movies but this book reminded me of that
movie<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:32.310> when<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.340> read<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.820> blurb<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.300> I

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
movie and when I read the blurb and I

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.850 
movie and when I read the blurb and I
saw<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.019> was<00:03:35.140> kind<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.380> like<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.680> that's

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
saw that it was kind of like that that's

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.410 
saw that it was kind of like that that's
what<00:03:36.100> made<00:03:36.250> me<00:03:36.430> want<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.670> try<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.030> book<00:03:37.209> I

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
what made me want to try this book I

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.449 
what made me want to try this book I
really<00:03:38.019> enjoyed<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.709> only<00:03:38.920> thing<00:03:39.130> that<00:03:39.430> I

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
really enjoyed it the only thing that I

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.370 
really enjoyed it the only thing that I
didn't<00:03:39.790> like<00:03:39.910> about<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.269> book<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:41.170> feel

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
didn't like about this book is I feel

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.070 
didn't like about this book is I feel
like<00:03:41.440> it's<00:03:41.769> written<00:03:42.100> for<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:43.030> younger<00:03:43.870> audience

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
like it's written for a younger audience

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.500 
like it's written for a younger audience
if<00:03:44.769> this<00:03:45.100> was<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.610> horror<00:03:45.940> movie<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.300> would<00:03:46.360> be<00:03:46.420> a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
if this was a horror movie it would be a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.580 
if this was a horror movie it would be a
pg-13<00:03:46.840> not<00:03:47.380> on<00:03:47.500> our<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.459> dares<00:03:49.209> are<00:03:49.720> they

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
pg-13 not on our the dares are they

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.040 
pg-13 not on our the dares are they
don't<00:03:50.830> really<00:03:51.340> get<00:03:51.550> that<00:03:51.610> bad<00:03:52.090> even<00:03:52.450> at<00:03:52.870> the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
don't really get that bad even at the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.500 
don't really get that bad even at the
end<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.560> mean<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.769> guess<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.130> grand<00:03:54.580> finale<00:03:55.000> Dare

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
end I mean I guess the grand finale Dare

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.070 
end I mean I guess the grand finale Dare
is<00:03:55.660> pretty<00:03:56.019> scary<00:03:56.410> but<00:03:57.280> not<00:03:57.940> compared<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.720> the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
is pretty scary but not compared to the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.410 
is pretty scary but not compared to the
movie<00:03:59.380> that<00:03:59.500> we<00:03:59.620> watched<00:03:59.830> like<00:04:00.220> someone<00:04:01.180> super

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
movie that we watched like someone super

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.870 
movie that we watched like someone super
twisted<00:04:01.959> did<00:04:02.110> not<00:04:02.230> write<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.590> book<00:04:02.800> Jan<00:04:03.610> Ryan

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
is not a super twisted person and her

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.800 
is not a super twisted person and her
book<00:04:05.860> would<00:04:06.070> get<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> pg-13<00:04:06.760> rating<00:04:07.150> because

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
book would get a pg-13 rating because

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.120
