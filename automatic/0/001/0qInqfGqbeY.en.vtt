00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
is what I have done I created um an

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.330 
is what I have done I created um an
edging<00:00:54.590> stitch<00:00:55.130> that<00:00:56.380> varies<00:00:57.380> in<00:00:57.410> height<00:00:57.950> of

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
edging stitch that varies in height of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.830 
edging stitch that varies in height of
the<00:00:58.489> different<00:00:58.820> stitches<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.480> kind<00:00:59.750> of

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
the different stitches that kind of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.860 
the different stitches that kind of
makes<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:00.170> all<00:01:00.320> even<00:01:00.590> out<00:01:00.950> so<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.850> dip<00:01:02.180> parts

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
makes it all even out so the dip parts

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.840 
makes it all even out so the dip parts
are<00:01:03.140> going<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:03.380> need<00:01:03.620> taller<00:01:03.980> stitches<00:01:04.579> and

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
are going to need taller stitches and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.309 
are going to need taller stitches and
then<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.969> parts<00:01:07.969> that<00:01:08.030> are<00:01:08.240> taller<00:01:08.479> are<00:01:09.049> going

00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:09.319 
then the parts that are taller are going

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.050 
then the parts that are taller are going
to<00:01:09.380> need<00:01:09.530> shorter<00:01:09.950> stitches<00:01:10.219> so<00:01:10.579> that<00:01:10.609> it<00:01:10.909> all

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
to need shorter stitches so that it all

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.080 
to need shorter stitches so that it all
evens<00:01:11.990> out<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.530> be<00:01:13.039> as<00:01:13.159> flat<00:01:13.429> as<00:01:14.049> possible<00:01:15.069> so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
evens out to be as flat as possible so

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.669 
evens out to be as flat as possible so
pretty<00:01:17.090> much<00:01:17.270> you're<00:01:17.539> just<00:01:17.600> going<00:01:18.079> to<00:01:18.229> repeat

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
pretty much you're just going to repeat

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.849 
pretty much you're just going to repeat
it<00:01:19.389> after<00:01:20.389> you've<00:01:20.840> done<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.139> once<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.619> just

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
it after you've done it once you just

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.559 
it after you've done it once you just
keep<00:01:22.100> repeating<00:01:22.249> it<00:01:22.639> until<00:01:22.969> you<00:01:23.119> get<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.450> the

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
keep repeating it until you get to the

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.569 
keep repeating it until you get to the
end<00:01:23.719> of<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:23.959> row<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:24.530> I'm<00:01:24.799> just<00:01:25.219> going<00:01:25.520> to

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
end of that row so I'm just going to

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.719 
end of that row so I'm just going to
show<00:01:25.819> you<00:01:25.850> one<00:01:26.749> or<00:01:26.869> two<00:01:27.049> sets<00:01:27.319> of<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.039> then

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.039 

you<00:01:31.729> can<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.060> repeat<00:01:32.389> it<00:01:32.539> and<00:01:32.689> I'll<00:01:32.869> also

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049
