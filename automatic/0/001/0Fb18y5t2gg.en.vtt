00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
did at school and and it's kind of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
did at school and and it's kind of
turned<00:00:32.610> into<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.000> thing<00:00:33.390> two<00:00:33.809> years<00:00:33.930> later

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
turned into this thing two years later

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.840 
turned into this thing two years later
it's<00:00:34.440> kind<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.860> guts<00:00:35.190> legs<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.760> it's

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's kind of like guts legs and it's

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.450 
it's kind of like guts legs and it's
doing<00:00:36.380> doing<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.469> stuff<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.190> weird

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
doing doing it stuff it's really weird

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.799 
doing doing it stuff it's really weird
to<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.860> seonyu<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:41.100> there

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
to be here right now seonyu out there

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.040 
to be here right now seonyu out there
also<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.140> also<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.390> some<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.719> cartoon

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
also so also I think some of the cartoon

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
also so also I think some of the cartoon
Amin<00:00:46.260> from<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> very<00:00:47.309> beginning<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
Amin from the very beginning because you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
Amin from the very beginning because you
pitch<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.140> own<00:00:49.289> voice<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.980> such<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
pitch it in your own voice it's such a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.119 
pitch it in your own voice it's such a
distinctive<00:00:51.000> sound<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.289> catchphrases<00:00:52.860> in

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
distinctive sound the catchphrases in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.520 
distinctive sound the catchphrases in
the<00:00:53.280> show<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.899> there's<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the show I think you know there's just a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
the show I think you know there's just a
certain<00:00:55.710> distinct<00:00:56.219> vocal<00:00:56.610> quality<00:00:57.030> about<00:00:57.180> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
certain distinct vocal quality about it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.029 
certain distinct vocal quality about it
how<00:00:57.600> does<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.809> kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> work<00:00:58.500> maybe<00:00:58.710> between

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
how does that kind of work maybe between
