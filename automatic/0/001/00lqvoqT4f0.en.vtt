00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.990
 release of a software update 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.519

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.679
 a google patch is no better 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 specified and optimization 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.820
 power 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.380
 now this video of course will have to 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.000
 be mounted and this will be one thing 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.380
 really nice because i don't think of 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.570
 being able to publish them android boh not 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.590
