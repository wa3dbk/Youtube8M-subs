enjoying the 52 lick series today we're

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.280 
enjoying the 52 lick series today we're
going<00:00:10.790> to<00:00:10.879> go<00:00:10.969> over<00:00:11.000> a<00:00:11.209> bill<00:00:11.510> Stewart<00:00:11.959> lick

going to go over a bill Stewart lick

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.490 
going to go over a bill Stewart lick
that's<00:00:13.100> super<00:00:13.639> hip<00:00:13.850> but<00:00:14.570> what<00:00:14.869> makes<00:00:15.139> it<00:00:15.320> hip

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
that's super hip but what makes it hip

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.680 
that's super hip but what makes it hip
is<00:00:15.680> the<00:00:15.889> phrasing<00:00:16.490> of<00:00:16.609> it<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.150> pen<00:00:17.420> how<00:00:17.630> he

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
is the phrasing of it and the pen how he

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.019 
is the phrasing of it and the pen how he
voices<00:00:18.050> it<00:00:18.380> around<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:18.740> kit<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.520> actual

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
voices it around the kit the actual

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.480 
voices it around the kit the actual
pattern<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:20.779> execution<00:00:21.440> of<00:00:21.560> it<00:00:21.710> isn't<00:00:22.310> hard

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
pattern the execution of it isn't hard

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.380 
pattern the execution of it isn't hard
at<00:00:22.580> all<00:00:22.730> in<00:00:23.090> fact<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.340> core<00:00:25.340> pattern<00:00:25.910> is<00:00:26.120> so

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
at all in fact the core pattern is so

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.560 
at all in fact the core pattern is so
common<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.010> simple<00:00:28.670> that<00:00:28.880> it<00:00:29.090> shows<00:00:29.330> up

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
common and so simple that it shows up

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.840 
common and so simple that it shows up
all<00:00:30.110> over<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.470> place<00:00:30.560> in<00:00:30.920> fact<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.400> couple<00:00:31.789> of

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
all over the place in fact a couple of

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.880 
all over the place in fact a couple of
the<00:00:31.940> different<00:00:31.970> videos<00:00:32.329> that<00:00:32.930> I've<00:00:33.440> done<00:00:33.469> in

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
the different videos that I've done in

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.979 
the different videos that I've done in
this<00:00:34.010> little<00:00:34.340> series<00:00:34.789> have<00:00:35.449> all<00:00:35.600> been<00:00:35.809> based

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
this little series have all been based

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.500 
this little series have all been based
around<00:00:36.230> something<00:00:36.770> similar<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:37.609> let's<00:00:38.210> break

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
around something similar so let's break

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.259 
around something similar so let's break
that<00:00:38.780> down<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.940> root<00:00:41.480> pattern<00:00:42.079> is<00:00:42.289> simply

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
that down the root pattern is simply

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.200 
that down the root pattern is simply
right<00:00:44.269> left<00:00:45.109> foot<00:00:45.769> it's<00:00:46.579> a<00:00:46.760> three<00:00:47.030> note

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
right left foot it's a three note

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.139 
right left foot it's a three note
pattern<00:00:47.659> and<00:00:48.190> we've<00:00:49.190> discussed<00:00:49.609> before<00:00:50.120> about

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
pattern and we've discussed before about

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.669 
pattern and we've discussed before about
how<00:00:50.510> there's<00:00:50.719> a<00:00:50.780> bunch<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:51.050> different<00:00:51.350> ways<00:00:51.469> to

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
how there's a bunch of different ways to

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.069 
how there's a bunch of different ways to
break<00:00:51.859> that<00:00:52.069> but<00:00:52.339> it's<00:00:52.460> simply<00:00:52.879> right<00:00:53.629> left

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
break that but it's simply right left

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.579 
break that but it's simply right left
foot<00:00:54.499> we're<00:00:54.920> going<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.100> start<00:00:55.489> by

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
foot we're going to start by

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.709 
foot we're going to start by
incorporating<00:00:57.589> part<00:00:57.979> of<00:00:58.219> his<00:00:58.429> voicings<00:00:59.179> so

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
incorporating part of his voicings so

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.270 
incorporating part of his voicings so
we're<00:00:59.870> going<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.019> play<00:01:00.170> right<00:01:00.559> left<00:01:00.979> on<00:01:01.190> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
we're going to play right left on the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.619 
we're going to play right left on the
snare<00:01:01.460> drum<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:01.940> then<00:01:02.179> we're<00:01:02.299> going<00:01:02.389> to<00:01:02.449> play

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
snare drum and then we're going to play

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.570 
snare drum and then we're going to play
foot<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.280> without<00:01:04.460> left<00:01:04.850> foot<00:01:06.580> and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
foot on the on without left foot and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.350 
foot on the on without left foot and
this<00:01:08.570> isn't<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.899> triple<00:01:09.259> a--<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.560> one<00:01:09.829> two<00:01:10.549> three

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
this isn't a triple a-- so one two three

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:20.709 
this isn't a triple a-- so one two three
four<00:01:11.899> just<00:01:15.310> like<00:01:16.310> that

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.940 

so<00:01:21.719> now<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.929> we<00:01:22.079> have<00:01:22.170> an<00:01:22.289> understanding<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
so now that we have an understanding of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.580 
so now that we have an understanding of
the<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.549> core<00:01:23.850> pattern<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.810> little<00:01:25.049> 3<00:01:25.380> note

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the the core pattern that little 3 note

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.609 
the the core pattern that little 3 note
grouping<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.729> let's<00:01:27.000> talk<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.200> second

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
grouping now let's talk about the second

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
grouping now let's talk about the second
layer<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.359> phrasing<00:01:30.929> of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
layer of this which is the phrasing of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.649 
layer of this which is the phrasing of
him<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.770> he's<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.219> play<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
him so he's going to play this in a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.599 
him so he's going to play this in a
three<00:01:34.020> beat<00:01:34.259> pattern<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:35.340> know<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> think

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
three beat pattern you know I think

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.069 
three beat pattern you know I think
those<00:01:35.789> three<00:01:36.000> notes<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.630> group<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:36.929> in

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
those three notes and group them in

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.929 
those three notes and group them in
triplets<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.709> mean<00:01:38.189> he's<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> play<00:01:38.819> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
triplets I mean he's going to play it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.630 
triplets I mean he's going to play it
with<00:01:39.000> four<00:01:39.240> four<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.659> he's<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:39.899> to<00:01:39.990> loop<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
with four four but he's going to loop it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.219 
with four four but he's going to loop it
twice<00:01:41.640> every<00:01:42.149> three<00:01:42.630> beats

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
twice every three beats

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.740 
twice every three beats
so<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.979> phrase<00:01:44.250> will<00:01:44.429> sound<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.209> one

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
so the phrase will sound like this one

00:01:45.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
so the phrase will sound like this one
two<00:01:46.560> three<00:01:47.399> four<00:01:53.329> two<00:01:54.329> three<00:01:55.170> four<00:02:07.640> first<00:02:08.640> pass

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
two three four two three four first pass

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
two three four two three four first pass
I<00:02:09.179> counted<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.810> four<00:02:10.079> four<00:02:10.349> second<00:02:10.920> pass<00:02:11.129> I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
I counted it in four four second pass I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.979 
I counted it in four four second pass I
counted<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.239> its<00:02:12.390> grouping<00:02:12.750> what<00:02:12.870> is

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
counted it just in its grouping what is

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.900 
counted it just in its grouping what is
a<00:02:13.019> three<00:02:13.349> beat<00:02:13.560> grouping<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.340> there's<00:02:14.760> an

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
a three beat grouping and there's an

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.869 
a three beat grouping and there's an
accent<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:15.569> when<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> pattern<00:02:16.200> starts

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
accent right when the pattern starts

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:24.350 
accent right when the pattern starts
that's<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.060> next<00:02:18.450> layer

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.600 

the<00:02:24.450> following<00:02:25.020> layer<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.310> be<00:02:26.430> we're

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
the following layer is going to be we're

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.250 
the following layer is going to be we're
going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.760> add<00:02:26.970> another<00:02:27.450> sound<00:02:27.840> source

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
going to add another sound source

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.900 
going to add another sound source
instead<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:28.830> all<00:02:29.220> being<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
instead of it just all being on the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.480 
instead of it just all being on the

three<00:02:34.740> beats<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> downbeat<00:02:36.060> we're<00:02:36.240> going

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
three beats on the downbeat we're going

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.790 
three beats on the downbeat we're going

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
to move our right hand to the ride

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.240 
to move our right hand to the ride
cymbal<00:02:38.840> for<00:02:39.840> every<00:02:40.590> time<00:02:40.710> our<00:02:40.860> right<00:02:41.040> hand

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.900 
cymbal for every time our right hand
plays<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:42.630> going<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.900> go<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.580> if<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.820> a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
plays so it's going to go so if it's a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.020 
plays so it's going to go so if it's a
three<00:02:51.180> beat<00:02:51.360> pattern<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.130> it's<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.400> triplets

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
three beat pattern and it's in triplets

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.460 
three beat pattern and it's in triplets
that<00:02:54.120> our<00:02:54.300> right<00:02:54.540> hand<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.990> gonna<00:02:55.170> play<00:02:55.350> all

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
that our right hand is gonna play all

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:06.470 
that our right hand is gonna play all
the<00:02:55.620> downbeat<00:02:56.070> one<00:02:56.520> two<00:02:57.120> three<00:02:57.810> four<00:02:58.530> one<00:03:05.480> so

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the downbeat one two three four one so

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.949 
the downbeat one two three four one so
that's<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.020> pattern

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.020 

the<00:03:12.530> final<00:03:12.920> step<00:03:13.129> is<00:03:13.310> going<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.519> be<00:03:13.579> adding

the final step is going to be adding

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.970 
the final step is going to be adding
some<00:03:14.060> extra<00:03:14.420> phrasing<00:03:15.170> things<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:15.739> some

some extra phrasing things and some

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.030 
some extra phrasing things and some
voicing<00:03:16.459> things<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.909> really<00:03:17.239> hip<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.599> up<00:03:18.040> for

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
voicing things to really hip it up for

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.190 
voicing things to really hip it up for
starters<00:03:19.549> we're<00:03:20.030> going<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.239> add<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.450> pickup<00:03:20.870> on

the hi-hat so in this pattern of

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.309 
the hi-hat so in this pattern of
momentarily<00:03:25.040> rippling<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.750> third<00:03:27.019> triplet

momentarily rippling the third triplet

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.069 
momentarily rippling the third triplet
which<00:03:27.650> sounds<00:03:28.010> like<00:03:28.129> a<00:03:28.189> swung<00:03:28.609> up<00:03:28.790> beat<00:03:29.180> which

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
which sounds like a swung up beat which

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.569

do is we're going to take our very first
left<00:03:55.099> stroke<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:55.790> instead<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.060> playing<00:03:56.389> them

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
left stroke and instead of playing them

left stroke and instead of playing them
snare<00:03:56.959> zone<00:03:57.230> we're<00:03:57.769> going<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:57.980> move<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.340> over

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
snare zone we're going to move it over

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.699 
snare zone we're going to move it over
to<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.120> open<00:03:59.269> hi-hat<00:03:59.720> which<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.409> going<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.620> be

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
to the open hi-hat which is going to be

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.009 
to the open hi-hat which is going to be
opening<00:04:01.040> up<00:04:01.220> just<00:04:01.760> from<00:04:01.909> our<00:04:02.090> leg<00:04:02.359> opening<00:04:02.900> and

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
opening up just from our leg opening and

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.399 
opening up just from our leg opening and
closing<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:04.400> play<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.819> upbeat<00:04:05.629> in<00:04:05.870> our<00:04:06.049> foot

closing to play that upbeat in our foot
so<00:04:07.069> now<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.670> sounds<00:04:07.970> like<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:08.239> one<00:04:08.689> two<00:04:09.319> three

so now it sounds like this one two three

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.110 
so now it sounds like this one two three
four

and<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:22.340> last<00:04:22.670> layer<00:04:23.120> is<00:04:24.370> when<00:04:25.370> this<00:04:25.550> is<00:04:25.730> not

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
and the last layer is when this is not

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.030 
and the last layer is when this is not
playing<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.330> open<00:04:26.720> hi-hat<00:04:27.020> we're<00:04:27.860> going<00:04:27.980> to
