fail

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.920 

hopefully<00:00:12.120> though<00:00:12.299> you'll<00:00:12.600> see<00:00:17.150> 27<00:00:18.150> with<00:00:18.810> the

hopefully though you'll see 27 with the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:45.250 
hopefully though you'll see 27 with the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.380 

sweetheart

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.790 

she<00:00:53.390> does

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.180 

it's<00:00:57.130> so<00:00:57.340> smooth

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:21.050 

so<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.880> risk<00:01:02.090> doesn't<00:01:02.330> empirical<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:10.280> works

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 

how<00:01:21.600> nice<00:01:21.840> those<00:01:22.080> days<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.010> can

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
how nice those days and then you can

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:37.010 
how nice those days and then you can
course<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.549> change

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.090 

you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.340 

and<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.970> these<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.630> would<00:01:42.930> allow<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and so these are would allow you to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.010 
and so these are would allow you to
change<00:01:43.650> your

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.560 

and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> baby<00:01:46.829> here<00:01:48.320> yeah<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.500> is

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
and then this baby here yeah this is

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:07.310 
and then this baby here yeah this is
with<00:01:51.260> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.540 

is<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> newest<00:02:08.970> latest<00:02:09.210> greatest

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.339 

a<00:02:31.980> resolution<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:34.530> create<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.849> then<00:02:36.349> ability

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
a resolution to create and then ability

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.319 
a resolution to create and then ability

a lot like the first one it looks like

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.680 
a lot like the first one it looks like
it's<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> little<00:03:12.090> bit<00:03:12.269> faster<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:14.480> it's<00:03:15.480> a

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
it's a little bit faster but it's a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's a little bit faster but it's a
really<00:03:15.900> sense

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
really sense

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.930 
really sense
yeah<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.800> smaller<00:03:20.100> format<00:03:20.670> which<00:03:20.910> is

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
yeah it's just a smaller format which is

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
yeah it's just a smaller format which is
touch<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.350> can<00:03:22.710> rotate<00:03:22.980> see<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.570> he<00:03:24.780> makes

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
touch so you can rotate see so he makes

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.260 
touch so you can rotate see so he makes
a<00:03:25.110> really<00:03:25.290> leave<00:03:25.650> inside<00:03:26.190> -<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.670> sure<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:28.250> but

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
a really leave inside - I sure do but
