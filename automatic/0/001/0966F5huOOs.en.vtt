00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
 It introduced more than 10,000 spectators 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.470
 jenaer serious abbe stadion zum 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.599
 quarter-final match for the thÃ¼ringenpokal 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.849
 between title holder fc carl zeiss 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.740
 jena and third division red white erfurt 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.449
 The atmosphere in jena the stadium so good 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.090
 filled like no longer 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.529
 against Bayer Leverkusen in the first 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 dfb-cup were not that many 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.510
 windows like today and they are visible 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.179
 very exciting derby that hardly 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.250
 wishes let red-white erfurt with 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.219
 the better start after eight minutes 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.920
 subtracts dominick drexler from the left 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.530
 penal border and indicates with it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.300
 We want our favorite role here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.539
 to live up to everyone 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.620
 but alois black knows everyone can 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.730
 in the meantime again a bit 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 football play the last 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.660
 success experiences in the regionalliga 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 have given confidence and tino 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.079
 schmidt leaves the stadium for the first time 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.969
 get really loud 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.670
 There was not much missing as well 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.649
 before the shot of nick changer the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.270
 red and white succeed in the sequence 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.369
 a slight overweight was also 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.320
 reflected in the third and the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.659
 The fourth will be really dangerous for you 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.820
 The gate of Tino Berbig because metal 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.010
 only hits the outside post 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.000
 So the host has a shower that he 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.340
 does not get here in residue 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.410
 the best chance of the first half the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.470
 has red white erfurt but by dominick 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.930
 Drexler in the 33 minute but tino 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.479
 Berbig in Jena Tor reacts great 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.790
 and keeps his box clean 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.580
 with a slightly happy for everyone 0 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.380
 to 0, it went into the halftime break then 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.630
 red again knows with more 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.640
 single-minded to the goal and has two goals 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.690
 kevin ewald the chance of the third division 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.780
 to lead 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.820
 but does not do anything that keeps China 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.729
 in the game the regional alligist will leave the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.619
 60 minutes more courageous and leaves the climate 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.750
 ball again tino schmidt with the 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.880
 Schusschance after nice play by 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.460
 Marcel Schlosser plays both teams 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.570
 now also a gate is missing therefore 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.220
 brings recovery after a long time 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.800
 injury break in their morabit 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.050
 during those due to injury 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.700
 defender must renounce the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.979
 has broken his ankle without 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.080
 foreign influence that causes unrest 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.310
 the jenaer defense and as everything 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.860
 already been set for an extension 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.590
 there comes the one decisive ball 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.010
 mio tunjic and that hits in the 89th 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.380
 minute 1 0 for erfurt and how 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.480
 Last time, derby becomes literally 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.209
 At the last minute decided this time 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.080
 but for the fc red-white accordingly 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.630
 downcast 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.150
 the mood with the guest at the good against 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.250
 kept thinking then so briefly before 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.560
 then it is natural to retire 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.959
 Of course, the different needs of course 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.459
 feeling at the winner I think that 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.989
 Over 90 minutes actually the best 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.480
 team that we had a lot of good 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.280
 possibilities now has 90 minutes each 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.420
 no hundred percent goal shot had 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.250
 and these are nothing 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.170
 admitted and therefore pulls 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.450
 does not deserve an undeserved semifinals 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.280
 one as well as meuselwitz today 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.299
 13 0 in the geratal successful before the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.299
 following man we have in
