00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.140
 Look, I came in the end, I see. 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.800
 I already turned around for raising that you 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.730
 see 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.250
 I already turned around, look there, see. 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.140
 here I am making the decays repair 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.269
 until he starts to make a scorer 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.310
 What is it that you do not see? 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.920
 Look how it's here, see. 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.720
 Do not have a look here. 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.970
 Look there then you'll just need it 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.570
 finish placing what point is here 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.180
 O 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 along with this initial then you pass 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.820
 your needle through the two chains that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 You made the needle pull the sardines and 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.170
 finishes with a very low point 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.320
 again you climb two dots to 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.610
 the height of the loop and in that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.059
 People are going to make a half a point high 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.830
 for every high point you have 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.560
 in his previous career 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.010
 in this career at any moment you 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.479
 will make decreases at any time you 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.179
 will make increases is one by one okay there 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.310
 so come back in the end again 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:24.640
 play the cookie I need to learn 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.560
 this speck here in the beginning two 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.439
 The little chains that I made to climb reminds me 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.590
 step and makes a low point for 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.170
 to learn two more currents to 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.899
 up at the same point you will make a point 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.240
 a half- pedro high is talking a 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.380
 very low point then you do the same 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.359
 point a half a point high made the first 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.179
 makes the second and the next is already the 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:52.600
 reduction then makes the first and 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:57.009
 half of the loop makes the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.289
 next with 1 234 las or 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.380
 You got it all at once. 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.310
 again you will do one by one did the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 first 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.600
 11 more made the second again of miley 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.680
 ground there found pulled out the point 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.920
 bought in half 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.750
 I'm in love again, staying with 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.720
 four points 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.060
 There you find it, it's everything and so you go 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.610
 doing a little 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.730
 decrease until 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.090
 half the other side okay 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.450
 There is no secret, let's go, so look. 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.720
 I arrived there the other half is seeing 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.840
 I started here I'm here already so now 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.280
 I'm leaving half a high point 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.620
 when he escaped 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 I'm leaving now, making a half point 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.900
 high for each point I have in 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.110
 previous career 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.860
 Okay, there's no secret, you can not. 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.660
 making 1 for each one you have 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.959
 in the previous career look there 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.300
 I finished this career too right now 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.550
 I'll learn passing here for two 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.550
 that man has a beginning and point 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.940
 very low to learn again in this 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:17.860
 Career I'm going to work half a point. 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.250
 high for each point I have in 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.660
 previous career without performing any 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:29.320
 type of increase or decrease girls 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.549
 look only for 13 careers 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.680
 You will have to do this procedure. 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.410
 a career of eminem floor and a 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.959
 career where you will make one for one 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.380
 a declining career and another 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.930
 career where you will make one for one 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.810
 so there is no mystery to you 13 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.590
 carreirinha this is the fourth then we 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.739
 Let's work even more seven 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.180
 thus making decreases and 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.450
 then one to one 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.060
 layoffs a loaf until we get to 13 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.060
 It's a good job, let's go, then.
