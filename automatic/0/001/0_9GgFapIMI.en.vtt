00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.200
 then same my name is one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.120
 I'm a table tennis coach 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.069
 bonn and this video I'll show you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.940
 a very good leg work with friction 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.139
 two benches table tennis men could 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.090
 yesterday or the day before yesterday I have one 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.949
 cool video seen a few 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 excerpts from professional trainings were 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 and there was a very interesting exercise 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.810
 I work for the two today 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.019
 of course directly with a customer 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.760
 wanted to try and he gave me that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.980
 Feedback given that it is very intense 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.739
 was very exhausting but also 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.120
 Creative was not that easy 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.340
 I just have it myself 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.750
 I have to try my top level 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.360
 show you here now 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.660
 short to explain the exercise we will 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.370
 between the banks of Beijing's rulers 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.260
 Make sure we are right down 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.629
 have tension as in the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.690
 basic short paragraphs on the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.090
 train 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.239
 and so a path through always moderate 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.239
 and I will now times 12 times times 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.929
 So it is a very effective exercise 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:02.579
 Next is a combination of taking 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:05.130
 sides and squats we are 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.380
 we want to release the bank charges here 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.959
 turn around is therefore nothing 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.810
 Squats with built-in very 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.670
 exhausting though there is a short distance 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.670
 She realizes I'm out of breath 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.989
 it is really nice white combined 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 is are the salt stetter important 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.310
 When building the distance between the two benches 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.069
 so world that is also the table free from 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.510
 comes close because we do not want 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.519
 have a longer distance than the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.350
 plate I hope that we through it 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.920
 If yes, there is on the thumb 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.049
 up 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.440
