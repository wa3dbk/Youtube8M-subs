00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.930 
Friday promo code that gave me 40% off
of<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.870> box<00:00:13.200> which<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:14.250> think<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> boxes<00:00:14.820> are

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
of this box which I think the boxes are

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.720 
of this box which I think the boxes are
normally<00:00:15.240> $21<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:17.130> made<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> price<00:00:17.580> of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
normally $21 so that made the price of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.029 
normally $21 so that made the price of
this<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:17.880> closer<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.590> $12<00:00:19.590> which<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.890> thought

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
this one closer to $12 which I thought

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.010 
this one closer to $12 which I thought
was<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.340> good<00:00:20.609> price<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.570> did<00:00:21.750> tweet

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
