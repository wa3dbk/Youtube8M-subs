printer i picked it up a little while

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.610 
printer i picked it up a little while
ago<00:00:07.189> it's<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.370> very<00:00:08.910> low<00:00:09.480> cost<00:00:09.840> very<00:00:10.410> low

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
ago it's a very low cost very low

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.499 
ago it's a very low cost very low
quality<00:00:10.889> printer<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.670> commodore<00:00:12.179> used<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
quality printer that commodore used to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.259 
quality printer that commodore used to
sell<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.380> when<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.799> save<00:00:14.040> up<00:00:14.250> cost<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.940> low

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
sell and when you save up cost and low

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.630 
sell and when you save up cost and low
quality<00:00:15.680> that<00:00:16.680> means<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> piece<00:00:17.460> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
quality that means it's a piece of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.300 
quality that means it's a piece of
but<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.900> used<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> sell<00:00:19.410> these<00:00:19.560> i<00:00:19.770> guess<00:00:20.070> by

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
but they used to sell these i guess by

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250 
but they used to sell these i guess by
the<00:00:20.369> millions<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.090> well<00:00:21.150> as<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.810> commodore

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the millions as well as the commodore

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.000 
the millions as well as the commodore
64's

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
64's

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.060 
64's
when<00:00:23.789> i<00:00:23.820> first<00:00:24.150> got<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.050> ribbon<00:00:25.710> was

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
when i first got it the ribbon was

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
when i first got it the ribbon was
extremely<00:00:26.760> dry<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:27.720> wasn't

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
extremely dry and it really wasn't

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
extremely dry and it really wasn't
printing<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> used<00:00:29.550> an<00:00:29.910> old<00:00:30.150> technique

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
printing so I used an old technique

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.049 
printing so I used an old technique
which<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.859> open<00:00:32.099> up<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> ribbon<00:00:32.820> cartridge

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
which is to open up the ribbon cartridge

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.780 
which is to open up the ribbon cartridge
you<00:00:33.930> take<00:00:34.170> off<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> top<00:00:34.559> cover<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.250> exposed<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you take off the top cover it exposed a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.590 
you take off the top cover it exposed a
ribbon<00:00:36.090> spray<00:00:37.050> some<00:00:37.320> wd-40<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.700> then

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
ribbon spray some wd-40 on it and then

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.590 
ribbon spray some wd-40 on it and then
if<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.200> use<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.469> screwdriver<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:42.059> advance<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
if you use a screwdriver to advance the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.080 
if you use a screwdriver to advance the
ribbon<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.200> starts<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.620> soak<00:00:43.980> up<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.430> wd-40

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
ribbon so it starts to soak up the wd-40

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.600 
ribbon so it starts to soak up the wd-40
I<00:00:45.420> used<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> little<00:00:46.500> bit<00:00:46.649> too<00:00:46.860> much<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.399> there's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I used a little bit too much so there's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.760 
I used a little bit too much so there's
a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.850> bit<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> grease<00:00:48.559> still<00:00:49.559> laying

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
a little bit of grease still laying

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.389 
a little bit of grease still laying
around

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
around

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.470 
around
now<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.390> store<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> printer<00:00:52.410> repair<00:00:52.770> house

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
now you store get a printer repair house

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.520 
now you store get a printer repair house
repairing<00:00:54.480> printers<00:00:54.840> before<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.410> would

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
repairing printers before we would

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.709 
repairing printers before we would
throttle<00:00:55.920> now<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.120> agents<00:00:57.510> were<00:00:57.600> all

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
throttle now now with agents were all

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.090 
throttle now now with agents were all
mount<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.230> break<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.890> used<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
mount when they break but we used to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
mount when they break but we used to
repair<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> tell<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> this

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
repair them and I have to tell you this

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.920 
repair them and I have to tell you this
is<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> worst<00:01:02.570> printer<00:01:03.570> ribbon

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is one of the worst printer ribbon

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.219 
is one of the worst printer ribbon
mechanisms<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.180> hideous<00:01:06.450> you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
mechanisms I see it's just hideous you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.840 
mechanisms I see it's just hideous you
have<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> wrap<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> ribbon<00:01:08.070> around<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.549> blue

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
have to wrap the ribbon around this blue

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.969 
have to wrap the ribbon around this blue
thing<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.310> horrible

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
thing and it's just horrible

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
thing and it's just horrible
anyways<00:01:13.979> I'll<00:01:14.189> put<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> cover<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.720> most

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
anyways I'll put the cover on on most

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.090 
anyways I'll put the cover on on most
dot<00:01:16.740> matrix<00:01:16.950> printers<00:01:17.689> when<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.840> press<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.789 
line feed button and turn it on it runs

button on this printer call the paper
advance<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.759> align<00:01:29.970> feed<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.450> I'll

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
advance that is the align feed so I'll

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.999 
advance that is the align feed so I'll
turn<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.259> run<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> self-test<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:34.710> let<00:01:34.860> that

turn it on run a self-test and let that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.690 
turn it on run a self-test and let that
run<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.640> while<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.530> you'll<00:01:38.490> see

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
run for a little while and you'll see

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.609 
run for a little while and you'll see
the<00:01:38.790> print<00:01:39.030> quality<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.630> pretty<00:01:39.840> lousy<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the print quality is pretty lousy I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.679 
the print quality is pretty lousy I
don't<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> ribbon

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
don't know if that's because the ribbon

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.469 
don't know if that's because the ribbon
is<00:01:42.899> pretty<00:01:43.200> lousy<00:01:43.409> or<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.670> printer<00:01:45.000> itself<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
is pretty lousy or the printer itself is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.600 
is pretty lousy or the printer itself is
pretty<00:01:45.750> lousy

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
pretty lousy

00:01:46.610 --> 00:02:03.110 
pretty lousy
probably<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> combination<00:01:47.930> of<00:01:48.380> both

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.210 

now<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.540> see<00:02:04.780> how<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:06.780> different<00:02:08.070> how<00:02:09.070> it

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
now you can see how the different how it

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.400 
now you can see how the different how it
changes<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.450> still<00:02:10.690> working<00:02:11.080> some<00:02:11.290> of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
changes so it's still working some of

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.800 
changes so it's still working some of
that<00:02:11.500> wd-40<00:02:12.400> through<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.670> ribbon<00:02:12.880> anyways

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
that wd-40 through the ribbon anyways

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.100 
that wd-40 through the ribbon anyways
I'm<00:02:14.110> going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.320> turn<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.620> off<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:16.000> then<00:02:16.870> turn

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
I'm going to turn it off and then turn

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.400 
I'm going to turn it off and then turn
it<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.440> non<00:02:18.100> self<00:02:18.459> test<00:02:18.760> mode<00:02:19.030> but<00:02:20.020> in<00:02:20.140> normal

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
it on non self test mode but in normal

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.490 
it on non self test mode but in normal
mode<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.910> wrote<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> very<00:02:22.209> small<00:02:22.720> program<00:02:23.020> on

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
mode and I wrote a very small program on

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.960 
mode and I wrote a very small program on
my<00:02:23.650> Commodore<00:02:24.160> 64<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.060> I'll<00:02:25.720> run<00:02:25.930> there<00:02:26.170> oh

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.449 

it's<00:02:33.970> very<00:02:34.150> exciting<00:02:35.280> basically<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.430> just

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
it's very exciting basically it just

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.540 
it's very exciting basically it just
does<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.850> for<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.390> equals<00:02:37.900> 1<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.230> 10<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.709> then

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
does a for I equals 1 to 10 and then

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.699 
does a for I equals 1 to 10 and then
does<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.880> print<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:41.940> I'll<00:02:42.940> also<00:02:43.390> do<00:02:44.260> one<00:02:44.440> last

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
does a print I and I'll also do one last

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.880 
does a print I and I'll also do one last
thing<00:02:45.040> I'll<00:02:45.670> send<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.360> output<00:02:47.230> from<00:02:47.739> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
thing I'll send the output from the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:03:11.770 
thing I'll send the output from the
screen<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.520> printer<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.150> do<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.270> list

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.050 

well<00:03:12.290> I<00:03:12.470> forgot<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.920> close<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.430> printer<00:03:13.820> so

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.930 
well I forgot to close the printer so
I'll<00:03:14.450> just<00:03:14.630> turn<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.990> off<00:03:15.700> turn<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.730> on

and there it is you can see also some of

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.650 
and there it is you can see also some of
the<00:03:23.040> some<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.220> ink<00:03:24.520> coming<00:03:24.970> true<00:03:25.210> again

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
the some of the ink coming true again

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.190 
the some of the ink coming true again
because<00:03:26.020> I<00:03:26.140> put<00:03:26.380> too<00:03:26.740> much<00:03:26.790> wd-40<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.630> I'm<00:03:28.930> just

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
because I put too much wd-40 so I'm just

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.930 
because I put too much wd-40 so I'm just
gonna<00:03:29.320> run<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.740> let<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.040> mess<00:03:30.280> around<00:03:30.430> for<00:03:30.910> a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
gonna run it let it mess around for a

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.990 
gonna run it let it mess around for a
bit<00:03:31.150> hopefully<00:03:31.570> it'll<00:03:31.690> absorb<00:03:31.870> some<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.440> that

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
bit hopefully it'll absorb some of that

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.430 
bit hopefully it'll absorb some of that
wd-40<00:03:34.000> back<00:03:34.180> into<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.570> ink<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:34.930> not<00:03:35.080> look<00:03:35.260> so

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
wd-40 back into the ink and not look so

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.040 
wd-40 back into the ink and not look so
bad<00:03:35.590> anyways<00:03:36.520> that<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.940> Commodore<00:03:37.570> MPs

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
bad anyways that is the Commodore MPs

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.480 
bad anyways that is the Commodore MPs
803<00:03:38.830> this<00:03:39.520> is<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.880> commodore<00:03:40.600> 64<00:03:40.750> color<00:03:41.710> there

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
803 this is the commodore 64 color there

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.910 
803 this is the commodore 64 color there
was<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.760> later<00:03:43.060> version<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.230> same<00:03:44.560> exact

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
was a later version of the same exact

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.170 
was a later version of the same exact
printer<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:45.670> gray<00:03:46.240> which<00:03:46.990> they<00:03:47.230> sold<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.710> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
printer in gray which they sold for the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.630 
printer in gray which they sold for the
plus<00:03:49.180> for<00:03:49.510> computers<00:03:50.080> i<00:03:50.320> guess<00:03:51.010> they<00:03:51.190> had<00:03:51.400> lots

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
plus for computers i guess they had lots

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.150 
plus for computers i guess they had lots
of<00:03:51.790> stock<00:03:52.060> left<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.690> they<00:03:53.590> needed<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.950> dump

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
of stock left and they needed to dump

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.660 
of stock left and they needed to dump
them<00:03:54.310> anyways<00:03:55.180> bye
