reminder<00:04:15.900> shaft<00:04:16.170> upgrade

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.469 

2.7<00:04:27.880> megabytes<00:04:30.090> so<00:04:31.090> while<00:04:31.240> that's<00:04:31.330> loading

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
2.7 megabytes so while that's loading

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.810 
2.7 megabytes so while that's loading
out<00:04:31.840> let's<00:04:32.050> take<00:04:32.259> a<00:04:32.289> look<00:04:32.500> at<00:04:32.680> some<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.699> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
out let's take a look at some of the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.240 
out let's take a look at some of the
other<00:04:33.850> options<00:04:34.419> on<00:04:34.570> here<00:04:34.900> see<00:04:35.800> just<00:04:36.009> how<00:04:36.100> much

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
other options on here see just how much

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.800 
other options on here see just how much
memory<00:04:36.520> that's<00:04:36.789> gobbling<00:04:37.210> up<00:04:40.770> so<00:04:41.770> we've<00:04:41.919> got

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
memory that's gobbling up so we've got

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.570 
memory that's gobbling up so we've got
116<00:04:43.810> point<00:04:44.050> 3<00:04:44.380> megabytes<00:04:44.740> of<00:04:44.889> at<00:04:45.039> memory<00:04:45.370> free

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
116 point 3 megabytes of at memory free

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.040 
116 point 3 megabytes of at memory free
so<00:04:45.900> probably<00:04:46.949> launches<00:04:47.949> with<00:04:48.100> 128<00:04:48.810> we've<00:04:49.810> got

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
so probably launches with 128 we've got

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.860 
so probably launches with 128 we've got
one<00:04:50.530> point<00:04:50.800> eight<00:04:51.009> gigs<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.610> storage<00:04:52.449> memory

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
one point eight gigs of storage memory

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.969 
one point eight gigs of storage memory
so<00:04:53.139> two<00:04:53.830> gigs<00:04:54.100> really<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:56.169> 16<00:04:56.530> gig<00:04:56.710> memory

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
so two gigs really and the 16 gig memory

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.219 
so two gigs really and the 16 gig memory
card<00:04:57.250> so<00:04:57.490> got<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.449> fair<00:04:58.720> bit<00:04:58.750> of<00:04:58.900> wiggle<00:04:59.110> room

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
card so got a fair bit of wiggle room

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.040 
card so got a fair bit of wiggle room
there<00:04:59.699> it<00:05:00.699> would<00:05:00.820> still<00:05:01.030> be<00:05:01.060> nice<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.479> have<00:05:01.630> a

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
there it would still be nice to have a

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.159 
there it would still be nice to have a
little<00:05:02.259> bit<00:05:02.590> more<00:05:02.740> application<00:05:03.340> space<00:05:03.520> but

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
little bit more application space but

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.270 
little bit more application space but
this<00:05:05.169> is<00:05:05.349> a<00:05:05.380> definitely<00:05:06.250> an<00:05:06.460> improvement<00:05:08.280> now

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
this is a definitely an improvement now

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.150 
this is a definitely an improvement now
let's<00:05:09.490> take<00:05:09.699> a<00:05:09.759> look<00:05:09.940> at<00:05:10.479> our<00:05:12.180> versions<00:05:13.180> here

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
let's take a look at our versions here

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.909 
let's take a look at our versions here
there<00:05:15.160> we<00:05:15.250> go<00:05:15.370> that<00:05:15.639> is<00:05:15.669> a<00:05:16.120> less<00:05:16.840> version<00:05:17.229> 5.0

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
there we go that is a less version 5.0

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.360 
there we go that is a less version 5.0
point<00:05:18.220> no<00:05:18.370> point<00:05:18.870> 287<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:20.620> haven't<00:05:21.280> been

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
point no point 287 I haven't been

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.550 
point no point 287 I haven't been
keeping<00:05:21.610> up<00:05:21.910> on<00:05:22.090> on<00:05:22.389> what<00:05:22.539> the<00:05:22.750> latest<00:05:23.229> Bills

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
keeping up on on what the latest Bills

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.110 
keeping up on on what the latest Bills
have<00:05:23.740> been<00:05:23.770> from<00:05:24.009> the<00:05:24.070> leaks<00:05:24.310> but<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:24.940> is

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
have been from the leaks but this is

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.839 
have been from the leaks but this is
what<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:26.470> verizon<00:05:26.979> version<00:05:27.009> of<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.639> strong

what the verizon version of the strong

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:37.260 
what the verizon version of the strong
two<00:05:28.000> will<00:05:28.210> be<00:05:28.330> shipping<00:05:28.539> with<00:05:33.599> and<00:05:35.699> let's<00:05:36.699> take

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
two will be shipping with and let's take

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.610 
two will be shipping with and let's take
a<00:05:37.330> look<00:05:37.690> at<00:05:37.870> actually<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.260> landscape

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
a look at actually the landscape

00:05:38.620 --> 00:06:06.760 
a look at actually the landscape
keyboard<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:39.310> haven't<00:05:39.550> tried<00:05:39.639> that<00:05:39.849> out<00:05:39.909> yet

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.529 

still<00:06:07.770> not<00:06:07.919> perfect<00:06:08.159> on<00:06:08.490> us<00:06:08.699> that<00:06:08.970> jump<00:06:09.300> did

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
still not perfect on us that jump did

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.350 
still not perfect on us that jump did
not<00:06:09.569> quite<00:06:10.050> turn<00:06:10.289> out<00:06:10.409> right<00:06:10.970> still<00:06:11.970> practice

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
not quite turn out right still practice

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.689 
not quite turn out right still practice
makes<00:06:12.569> perfect<00:06:12.780> it<00:06:13.139> is<00:06:13.229> a<00:06:13.620> very<00:06:14.190> different<00:06:14.610> way

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
makes perfect it is a very different way

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.540 
makes perfect it is a very different way
