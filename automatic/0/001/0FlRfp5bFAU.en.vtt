00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.920
 I enjoyed myself because the truth is that 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.690
 It caught my attention when I 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.730
 I saw and said this I have to bring it because 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.559
 I am an authentic 'jurassic' fan 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.720
 park ' and I 'm sure many of you 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.849
 you are also what we are seeing 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.730
 are we say the works of the artist to the 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.529
 what order and universal work on 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.380
 an animated series of the franchise 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.960
 'jurassic park' and have been published 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.789
 those drawings those works on the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.239
 good movie about the series that was going 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.520
 to do during the 90s there was a 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.410
 authentic fury with the dinosaurs more 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.020
 that now with jurassic walk even me 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.149
 I think he could well be greater if it had 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.030
 come out that animated series of 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.410
 'jurassic park' that was proposed by and 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.780
 universal 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.850
 william estÃ³n cartoonist who is 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.429
 commissioned the project has spoken recently 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.559
 about that animation series and has 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.079
 presented his sketches are those that 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.420
 we are watching and attentive to the words 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.180
 who has expressed on his blog says they wanted 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.010
 that the series was an adult series 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.480
 in prime time with the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.150
 best writers and the most 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.530
 experienced in television animation 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.630
 with some computer animation and 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.940
 universal cartoon studies wanted to give 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.430
 a touch of graphic novel to the series yo 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.979
 I showed them my jobs and I 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.619
 they hired however good the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.540
 project did not go ahead due 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.580
 let's say to the boredom that he apparently suffered 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.410
 steven spielberg about the tremendous 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.020
 marketing that was generating its 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.509
 franchise says the following we made a 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.000
 trailer to show the look and 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.009
 sensations of the series and also 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.330
 we showed how we wanted to combine the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.759
 computer animation with the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.560
 traditional everything we needed 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.630
 it was the approval of steven spielberg 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.270
 that however it was not achieved and 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.460
 both the series was forgotten 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.800
 I listened through radio I carry him 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.380
 he never bothered to see what we had 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.950
 done well the truth is that there are 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.360
 rumors good rumors statements of 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.640
 people who were working in 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.260
 this series will be who creates them will be 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.140
 who does not believe them 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.329
 but the truth is that this could be a 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.340
 animated television series that 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.900
 it would have happened that you would wait 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 a series of is on maximum schedule 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.269
 audience in addition 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.269
 Well, that's the way it is 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.440
 all this happened in the 90s has 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.140
 a long time and now what 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.140
 we can see are these images that today 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.170
 by now they have come to light after 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.790
 so much time will one day come to create 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.640
 an animation series of 'jurassic 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.840
 park 'or jurassic world in this case 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.569
 do not 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.540
