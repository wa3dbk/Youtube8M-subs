sm58<00:00:07.379> microphone<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.099> see<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.460> right

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
sm58 microphone you can see it right

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.240 
sm58 microphone you can see it right
here<00:00:08.900> and<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.080> plugged<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.590> using<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.070> mic

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
here and it's plugged in using a mic

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.220 
here and it's plugged in using a mic

this<00:00:22.140> microphone<00:00:22.760> into<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.109> 1/4<00:00:25.109> inch

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this microphone into a 1/4 inch

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.929 
this microphone into a 1/4 inch
connection<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.980> has<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> transformer<00:00:26.849> in

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
connection but it has a transformer in

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.870 
connection but it has a transformer in
between<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.590> which<00:00:28.590> allows<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.160> increase

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
between that which allows it to increase

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.200 
between that which allows it to increase
the<00:00:30.119> impedance<00:00:30.960> from<00:00:31.550> 150<00:00:32.550> ohms<00:00:32.700> which<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the impedance from 150 ohms which is the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.720 
the impedance from 150 ohms which is the
output<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.690> microphone<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:35.040> 800<00:00:35.610> ohms

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
output of this microphone to 800 ohms

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.840 
output of this microphone to 800 ohms
which<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.559> minimum<00:00:37.559> required<00:00:38.129> impedance

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
website I also post a link to a couple

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330 
website I also post a link to a couple
that<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.600> recommend<00:01:13.220> including<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.990> and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
that I recommend including this one and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.710 
that I recommend including this one and
it<00:01:17.340> seems<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.670> work<00:01:17.790> pretty<00:01:17.909> well<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.509> allows

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it seems to work pretty well it allows

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.840 
it seems to work pretty well it allows
you<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> plug<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.650> dynamic<00:01:20.250> microphone<00:01:20.460> like

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you to plug in a dynamic microphone like

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.359 
you to plug in a dynamic microphone like
this<00:01:21.060> sure<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:22.290> also<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.830> another<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.130> at

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
this sure I also have another one at

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.679 
this sure I also have another one at
home<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.759> PG<00:01:24.180> 48<00:01:25.310> there's<00:01:26.310> also<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> PG<00:01:27.090> 58

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
home the PG 48 there's also the PG 58

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.950 
home the PG 48 there's also the PG 58
the<00:01:28.400> sm58<00:01:29.479> there's<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> bunch<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.869> different

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the sm58 there's a bunch of different

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960 
the sm58 there's a bunch of different
microphones<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.310> setup<00:01:32.549> will<00:01:32.790> allow

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
microphones that this setup will allow

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.450 
microphones that this setup will allow
you<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> use<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.689> iPhone<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:35.250> allow<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
you to use with your iPhone to allow a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.480 
you to use with your iPhone to allow a
higher<00:01:35.759> higher<00:01:36.380> sound<00:01:37.380> pressure<00:01:37.590> level<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
higher higher sound pressure level this

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.840 
higher higher sound pressure level this
microphone<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.150> great<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:40.820> interviews<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
microphone is great for interviews and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
microphone is great for interviews and
things<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.390> where<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> hold<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
things like that where you hold it up to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
things like that where you hold it up to
somebody's<00:01:43.799> mouth<00:01:43.950> rather<00:01:44.759> than<00:01:45.090> having<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
somebody's mouth rather than having a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.770 
somebody's mouth rather than having a
lavalier<00:01:46.409> microphone<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.570> another

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
lavalier microphone so it's just another

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.560 
lavalier microphone so it's just another
option<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.740> bag<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.430> goodies<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.329> see

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
option in my bag of goodies you can see

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.429 
option in my bag of goodies you can see
I<00:01:52.070> have<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.659> have<00:01:54.659> some<00:01:54.869> other<00:01:54.990> other

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
I have I have some other other

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.609 
I have I have some other other
microphone<00:01:55.950> adapters<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.729> bag<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.619> my

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
microphone adapters in this bag and my

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.039 
microphone adapters in this bag and my
plan<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.549> a<00:02:00.060> setup<00:02:00.570> where<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.840> could

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
plan is to have a setup where I could

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.560 
plan is to have a setup where I could
take<00:02:01.290> pretty<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:01.860> any<00:02:02.100> microphone<00:02:02.670> straight

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
take pretty much any microphone straight

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.990 
take pretty much any microphone straight
into<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> iPhone<00:02:04.159> instead<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> having<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.729> use

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
into the iPhone instead of having to use

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.460 
into the iPhone instead of having to use
a<00:02:06.030> mixer<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.170> use<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:08.099> use<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:09.470> bridging

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
a mixer or I use they use a bridging

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.920 
a mixer or I use they use a bridging
amplifier<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.430> sure<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.239> a
