 [music] 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.950
 cute except name afends league good 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.940
 meadow sod needs care after 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.220
 long winter 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.790
 can be observed and chaga bastards Vani and 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.550
 plant and character formation not 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.530
 for the care of such grounds as well as for 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.220
 combing felled areas 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.290
 There are many special guns 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.780
 these guns are intensity controlled 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.940
 work and have a positive 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.500
 additional effect on turfs 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.030
 slightly damage the grass root system 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.979
 these light injuries lead to 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.390
 the formation of shoots and therefore more 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:58.879
 thick der me except quality enhancement 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.559
 sods in this way there is also 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.470
 additional equipment which 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:13.549
 calls grass and seeds up 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:15.979
 stuff in young turf and long before 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.350
 1 mower was hung on 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.060
 the tractor was known to be the right one 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.000
 feeding grounds care 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.950
 is an important point for getting 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 quality feed well maintained meadows 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.540
 less infected with weeds and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.540
 guarantees high yields 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.299
 care ensures a smooth surface 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.970
 land and minor pollution 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:51.270
 feed less pollution means 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.229
 best quality hay fat 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:00.750
 taste high digestibility 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:10.229
 feed the best economy in one word 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:12.060
 less dirt more milk from less and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.769
 blades of grass and weeds lead to 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.989
 the formation of fallen down layer of plants 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:23.069
 where such a carpet is formed do not grow 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.069
 useful plants in the sod does not appear 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.239
 empty places that lead to a decrease 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.190
 calorie feed in such spaces 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.500
 weeds grow so about 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.500
 quality feed will have to forget 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.379
 there are different things to care for the meadows 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.330
 equipment has long been used 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.330
 netted ram and drag 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.870
 the teeth of the netted sheep are combed 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.549
 felted layer of turf providing 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.230
 young shoots the best growth conditions 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:05.370
 additional effect teeth stimulates 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.769
 overgrowth due to 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.870
 mechanical impact is formed 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.739
 more side shoots 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.739
 compacted 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.730
 all read ram can also 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.860
 combine with leveling bar 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.230
 [music] 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.080
 this beam flattens out such irregularities 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.590
 soils such as mole of guilt in one 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.760
 pass 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.770
 [music] 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.250
 it is important to reduce pollution 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.250
 stern 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.760
 drag draws a similar effect she 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.099
 does not work so intensively but has 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.400
 simpler design and lower 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.400
 the cost 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.220
 alignment effect of scraps and better but 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.360
 to fight down old sod 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.360
 ram better 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.829
 under the influence of frost and the flag top 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.609
 soil layer rises that can 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:24.919
 lead to rupture of the roots of it directly 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:27.289
 affects the yield to plants 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.330
 could fully develop necessary 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:34.729
 restore contact as soon as possible 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:40.310
 roots with soil best with this 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:42.680
 the task copes rink to work 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.320
 rink was effective it should be 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.610
 quite heavy up to one and a half tons on 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.610
 working width meter 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.710
 speed is also important 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.590
 motion best results 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.889
 provided at slow speed 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.900
 [music] 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.780
 during the work of a skating rink the soil should not be 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.370
 too wet it may cause 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.370
 negative compaction 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.190
 only highly productive plants 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:26.450
 provide good regular feed 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.610
 planting herbs justifies this 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.889
 prevents the appearance of thick 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.169
 gaps do not carry 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.680
 occur when grazing livestock or when 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.680
 frost 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:44.330
 great value for successful sowing 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.250
 has enough moisture besides 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.300
 grass should not yet be too 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.919
 high to determine appropriate 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.700
 seeding time 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.110
 need a subtle flair 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.110
 [music] 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.600
 total feed 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:09.580
 ranges from 5 to 10 kilograms per 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.740
 hectares per year exactly those drills work in 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.370
 which seed is fed by 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.290
 hoses 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.390
 to a small dispenser under 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.280
 compressed air pressure 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.730
 [music] 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:28.010
 With this technology, the wind is no longer 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:30.530
 plays another advantage seed 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.550
 herbs are distributed directly 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.500
 in front of the rollers 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:44.750
 it guarantees good growth
