00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.820
 bread balls and potatoes 2 kg of potatoes 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.660
 100 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil three 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.180
 sandwiches 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.759
 face comes simplicity took me 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 in the word potatoes are already no so crude or 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.960
 raw apron to fail the potatoes is 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.640
 really forgotten 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.870
 thank goodness we have our chef who 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.120
 it calls me to order then we must 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.720
 peel and grate the violet between 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.000
 many more as you peel the potatoes 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.010
 and so very simple then ok then later 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.870
 all free, put a grater 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 inside the free levers inside ii e 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.180
 let's make a little dough 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.410
 own potatoes and a bit of bread 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.580
 grated just to make 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.280
 soft that more than just skins 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.369
 soft to pet soft croquette 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:12.500
 come on then I prepare here instead of the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:15.080
 type of croutons where as of how 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.570
 I said it's just an almost variation 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.750
 however it is fun a6 very tired 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:30.300
 found proven 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:33.210
 ok away this is this good no more 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.740
 you have the other one I can 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.370
 cut half said help 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.370
 half so good ok ok 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.040
 as you can see here are the others to the facts 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.710
 conspicuous we have exact here we already have 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.960
 prepared the blanched potatoes cut 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.040
 cubes as they also then 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.210
 let's cut cubes, we're just going to do 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.680
 just our bread variation of 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.890
 potatoes 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.920
 then I warm up the oil for a moment 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.259
 because then later we go to pass the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.790
 potatoes 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.439
 in cubes we brown them remaining 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.720
 without paper there is now a roll of 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:22.150
 so big paper 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.519
 what god sends but not too much voila 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.120
 I'm the breadcrumbs let's go to how 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.370
 it is said to give a little more consistency 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.489
 neither blame nor is there so it dries in deeds 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:41.840
 less yes salt and pepper thanks then here 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:46.900
 we put our potatoes there 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.340
 we have to brown for good ok 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.209
 just like that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.170
 leather wakes up the total morbidelli 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.560
 they must have a little shape 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.250
 we know how to say round 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.650
 disorder and not too controlled 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.750
 thin so the current fa I did a little 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:13.699
 chrome style men a skilled looks like you 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.310
 i can tell you the exact exact baby girl it is 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.840
 the spirit is a little this one could 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.799
 do also with the baby fish 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:28.370
 yes yes here is this is another is another 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:31.609
 starting point for a new madelin recipe 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.180
 non-stick and well made by adding oil 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:38.329
 olive 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:44.690
 you see that already or femme but must 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:47.599
 enter you press lightly and suspect 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.980
 slowly you do so see the so and e 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.980
 let's refine a little 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:04:00.580
 ok bread even when some want 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.580
 lateral is a second we ask for some 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.290
 I would not burn as many no no no no 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.170
 see if they are doing yes to the limit 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.080
 when it is so second I want to do 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:21.460
 lower it you can stand the flame has 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:23.720
 studied a genius well and is 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:33.380
 so at this point here too 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:36.380
 we put a little pepper in the potatoes and 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.490
 at this point it is already put pepper to give it 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.490
 a peppery here 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.640
 and at this point we give a little wall 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.710
 of taste on butter we entrust ourselves to 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.760
 taste taste a bit of oiliness so 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.100
 here too the whole takes a lot better 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:03.050
 taste just the triumph of the yellow gen 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:07.880
 you are pretty good as good as you are 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:10.610
 says monochromatic but they have then like 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.320
 it is said in quite different colors and 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.090
 then what I wanted to say what 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.520
 I want to prove on these recipes here 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.000
 when you do them at home anyway 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.250
 always with two ingredients only but with 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.890
 of slightly different textures 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.540
 they look like many more ingredients instead 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.130
 are always the caritas states and cook 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.630
 even a little belly order at home 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.110
 it comes but I don't think so 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.740
 no 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.740
 yes yes ok 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:43.180
 after manna season of this game there is 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:47.400
 peace is because he who is immediately of 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.400
 ready to me not wise not wise to me 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:55.720
 I would say to put some height at the 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:06:00.160
 flat you look like one of the real ones 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:03.280
 center well this is our first 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.290
 proposal there is just a touch of oil 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.290
 just light is the same
