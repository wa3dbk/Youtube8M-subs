now<00:00:03.330> let's<00:00:03.600> concentrate<00:00:04.049> on<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:05.390> chess960

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
now let's concentrate on the chess960

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.650 
now let's concentrate on the chess960
functions<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.470> clock<00:00:07.970> this<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.030> also<00:00:09.360> by

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
functions of this clock this is also by

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.390 
functions of this clock this is also by
its<00:00:09.780> name<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.380> DT<00:00:11.130> 960<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.450> can<00:00:12.809> determine<00:00:13.590> one

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
its name is DT 960 it can determine one

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.500 
its name is DT 960 it can determine one
of<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.929> 960<00:00:15.929> starting<00:00:16.500> position<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.730> J's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
of the 960 starting position of the J's

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.779 
of the 960 starting position of the J's
960<00:00:20.390> variation<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.750> chess<00:00:22.170> game<00:00:22.519> this<00:00:23.519> was

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
960 variation of the chess game this was

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.730 
960 variation of the chess game this was
also<00:00:24.300> thought<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.500> by<00:00:25.680> Bobby<00:00:26.400> Fischer<00:00:27.740> so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
also thought up by Bobby Fischer so

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189 
also thought up by Bobby Fischer so
that's<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.340> big<00:00:29.880> starting<00:00:30.390> position<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.019> not

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that's the big starting position is not

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.880 
that's the big starting position is not
always<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.920> same<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:33.000> randomize<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
always the same but you can randomize it

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.810 
always the same but you can randomize it
and<00:00:35.570> until<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.230> had<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> use<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:38.399> dice

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and until now you had to use some dice

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.020 
and until now you had to use some dice
or<00:00:39.329> cards<00:00:40.230> or<00:00:40.739> flipping<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.430> cards<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
or cards or flipping the cards to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.170 
or cards or flipping the cards to
determine<00:00:42.469> any<00:00:43.469> random<00:00:44.100> starting<00:00:44.670> position

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
determine any random starting position

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.430 
determine any random starting position
but<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.370> clock

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
but now we can do this with this clock

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.350 
but now we can do this with this clock
zoom<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.860> bit<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.610> function<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:56.149> we<00:00:57.149> can

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
zoom in a bit of this function so we can

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.590 
zoom in a bit of this function so we can
see<00:01:00.590> symbols<00:01:01.590> better<00:01:03.110> we<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> model<00:01:04.710> now

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
see symbols better we have the model now

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.770 
see symbols better we have the model now
and<00:01:06.770> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> left<00:01:08.430> side<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and on the left side we can see a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.039 
and on the left side we can see a
blinking<00:01:11.000> set<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.180> dice<00:01:14.330> when<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> push<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
blinking set of dice when I push the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.249 
blinking set of dice when I push the
plus<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.799> minus<00:01:16.979> button<00:01:17.790> doesn't<00:01:18.450> matter

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
plus or minus button doesn't matter

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.539 
plus or minus button doesn't matter
which<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:21.020> can<00:01:22.020> choose<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.740> random<00:01:22.950> number

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
which one I can choose a random number

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.679 
which one I can choose a random number
which<00:01:23.900> correspondent<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.880> set<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
which correspondent with a set up of the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.700 
which correspondent with a set up of the
pieces<00:01:28.259> which<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.340> explain<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:31.259> every

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
pieces which we will explain so every

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.800 
pieces which we will explain so every
time<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.189> push<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.860> button<00:01:35.119> there<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
time I push this button there will be a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
time I push this button there will be a
number<00:01:37.200> between<00:01:37.470> 1<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.600> 960<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.520> with<00:01:41.520> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
number between 1 and 960 and with this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.569 
number between 1 and 960 and with this
number<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> starting<00:01:43.649> position<00:01:44.159> in

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
number there is a starting position in

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.999 
number there is a starting position in
this<00:01:44.820> case<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.420> means<00:01:46.399> Bishop<00:01:47.399> look

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
this case it means Bishop look

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:58.340 
this case it means Bishop look

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.230 

and<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.470> can<00:01:59.680> do<00:01:59.860> this<00:02:00.040> again<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.670> again<00:02:00.909> for

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
and I can do this again and again for

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
and I can do this again and again for
every<00:02:01.780> starting<00:02:02.380> position<00:02:02.830> but<00:02:03.549> also<00:02:03.820> I<00:02:04.540> can

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
every starting position but also I can

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.690 
every starting position but also I can
set<00:02:06.070> up<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.430> number<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:07.000> myself<00:02:07.800> say<00:02:08.800> let's<00:02:09.099> say

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
one way of doing it but the other way is

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.309 
one way of doing it but the other way is
you<00:02:48.940> can<00:02:49.390> see<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.660> already

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
you can see it already

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.340 
you can see it already
and<00:02:50.650> move<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.010> cursor<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.730> one<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.959> chess

and move the cursor to one of the chess

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.680 
and move the cursor to one of the chess
figures<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:55.690> alter<00:02:55.989> these<00:02:56.410> two<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:58.090> when<00:02:58.540> I

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
figures I can alter these two but when I

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.069 
figures I can alter these two but when I
alter<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.620> first<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.760> rest<00:03:01.000> girls<00:03:01.330> because<00:03:01.840> I

alter the first the rest girls because I

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.880 
alter the first the rest girls because I
have<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.530> choose<00:03:02.980> one<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.340> them<00:03:03.609> too<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.680> can

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
have to choose one of them too but I can

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.759 
have to choose one of them too but I can
only<00:03:06.130> choose<00:03:06.579> one<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.450> legal<00:03:07.690> positions<00:03:08.560> I

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
only choose one of the legal positions I

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.030 
only choose one of the legal positions I
have<00:03:09.070> already<00:03:09.340> chosen<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.420> queen<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.739> queen

have already chosen a queen so the queen

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.840 
have already chosen a queen so the queen
will<00:03:12.400> not<00:03:12.670> appear<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:13.239> anymore

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
will not appear here anymore

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.170 
will not appear here anymore
I'll<00:03:15.850> choose<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.690> night<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:18.670> choose<00:03:18.910> a
