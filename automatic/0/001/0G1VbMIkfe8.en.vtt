00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Dad, my game! You promised.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.000
Listen, it's my son's big game.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.300
Last game of the season. Santa Series.
I gotta be there. I promised.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll be there. 
My word is my bond.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.000
Look what Jack drew!

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.000
Look what Jack drew!

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.200
What's that?

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.450
Fire.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.500
Fire! Really?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Is that our plane?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
- Who are these people?
- That's Jack, that's me, that's Mom...

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.500
...and that's you.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.000
Where's my parachute?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.611
Why didn't I have a parachute?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.400
Take a wild guess.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.000
Jack, next season, I'm coming 
to six games. I promise.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.500
Yeah, be sure to buy 
enough videotape.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.000
My word is my bond.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.300
Yeah, junk bond!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.300
When are you gonna stop
acting like a child?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500
I am a child.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800
Grow up.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.000
Now, pay attention, class.
We have a lot to go over.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.000
"Lesson one: Why parents 
hate their children."

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.000
Your father went to your sister's
school play, did he not?

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.050
But did he go to your 
baseball game?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000
How'd you know about that?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.900
He missed the most important game
on the most important day...

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.400
Go on.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.200
You know you want to.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.392
Give it a try.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500
Go on.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.100
Make time stand still, laddie.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.120
For always making promises
and breaking them!

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.000
For never doing anything with me.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
For a father who's never there, Jack?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.500
Now it's time to be
whatever you want to be.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This is for all the games
your daddy missed.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.500
He's stealing second!

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.300
Very violent sport, isn't it, baseball?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.800
I can see why you have trouble
finding a happy thought.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.200
So many sad memories.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.000
You'll wake up, you'll be Peter Banning,
a selfish man who drinks too much...

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.000
...who's obsessed with success and runs
and hides from his wife and children.
