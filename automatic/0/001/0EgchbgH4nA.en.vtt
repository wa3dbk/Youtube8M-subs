00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
going to stand for very long now that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
going to stand for very long now that
Rick<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.479> gang<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.689> there<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.710> there

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
Rick and the gang is there because there

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
Rick and the gang is there because there
is<00:01:50.009> no<00:01:50.189> way<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.600> town<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.320> to

is no way that that town is going to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.050 
is no way that that town is going to
stand<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:52.979> we've<00:01:53.159> had<00:01:53.399> some<00:01:53.729> form<00:01:53.939> of

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
stand when we've had some form of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.179 
stand when we've had some form of
foreshadowing<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> past<00:01:55.409> two<00:01:55.680> episodes

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

which<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> dive<00:01:57.060> into<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.890> found

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
which I want to dive into so we found

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
which I want to dive into so we found
out<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.700> think<00:01:59.790> on<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.180> first<00:02:00.509> episode<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> this

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
out I think on the first episode of this

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.770 
out I think on the first episode of this
midseason<00:02:01.770> doctor<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.090> group<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.659> was

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
midseason doctor was this group that was

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.389 
midseason doctor was this group that was
going<00:02:03.990> around<00:02:04.079> butchering<00:02:04.860> people<00:02:05.040> cutting

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
going around butchering people cutting

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.249 
going around butchering people cutting
them<00:02:05.579> into<00:02:05.729> pieces<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.210> stuff<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
them into pieces and stuff like that and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.809 
them into pieces and stuff like that and
then<00:02:07.649> we're<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.890> all<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> way<00:02:08.369> across<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
then we're going all the way across the

unaware that he's completely unaware and
I'm<00:02:16.459> going<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.700> assume<00:02:17.060> either<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.980> town

going to assume is going to happen and

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.569 
going to assume is going to happen and
that's<00:02:35.870> going<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.079> be<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.470> main<00:02:36.709> plot<00:02:37.280> when<00:02:37.489> it

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
that's going to be the main plot when it

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.729 
that's going to be the main plot when it
focuses<00:02:37.730> are<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:38.299> know<00:02:38.420> Rick<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.870> leave<00:02:39.170> this
