00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.330 

ah

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:36.820 

what<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:23.969> you<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.829> did<00:01:25.829> he<00:01:25.920> give<00:01:26.159> me<00:01:26.369> harm<00:01:26.640> 8

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.040 

so<00:01:37.830> I've<00:01:37.950> heard<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.490> each<00:01:38.729> time<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.210> put

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
so I've heard that each time you put

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.640 
so I've heard that each time you put
them<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.770> gets<00:01:41.040> easier<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:42.030> easier<00:01:42.650> so

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
them on it gets easier and easier so

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:53.240 
them on it gets easier and easier so
hopefully<00:01:44.659> next<00:01:45.659> time<00:01:49.220> all<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.520> toes<00:01:51.800> each<00:01:52.800> toe

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
hopefully next time all my toes each toe

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.920 
hopefully next time all my toes each toe
its<00:01:53.729> own<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.420> pocket

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930
