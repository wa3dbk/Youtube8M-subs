Steve really just a layup line for the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.960 
Steve really just a layup line for the
most<00:04:27.750> part<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.170> me<00:04:28.290> not<00:04:28.950> much<00:04:29.190> defense<00:04:29.670> at<00:04:29.850> all

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
either way super defensive play I mean

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.550 
either way super defensive play I mean
if<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.150> pass<00:04:33.420> gets<00:04:33.720> through<00:04:34.050> it's<00:04:34.230> probably

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
if that pass gets through it's probably

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.010 
if that pass gets through it's probably
two<00:04:34.740> points<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.340> he<00:04:35.820> knew<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.030> he<00:04:36.660> knew<00:04:36.870> if

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
two points and he knew that he knew if

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.570 
two points and he knew that he knew if
it<00:04:37.110> gets<00:04:37.320> through<00:04:37.560> it's<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.860> score<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:38.400> that's

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
it gets through it's a score so that's

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.940 
it gets through it's a score so that's
why<00:04:38.730> he<00:04:38.880> sold<00:04:39.180> out<00:04:39.450> for<00:04:39.750> it<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.020> got<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.470> hand<00:04:40.770> on

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
why he sold out for it and got a hand on
