00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
that they seem to be a lean but we got

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.480 
that they seem to be a lean but we got
some<00:02:07.389> of<00:02:07.509> their<00:02:07.719> technology<00:02:08.410> we<00:02:09.009> recovered

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
some of their technology we recovered

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.420 
some of their technology we recovered
exotic<00:02:11.120> we<00:02:11.930> haven't<00:02:12.110> figured<00:02:12.380> out<00:02:12.470> how<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.740> add

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
exotic we haven't figured out how to add

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.270 
exotic we haven't figured out how to add
oil<00:02:13.490> Adam<00:02:13.970> duplicate<00:02:14.750> yet<00:02:14.990> so<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.860> real<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
oil Adam duplicate yet so the real the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.950 
oil Adam duplicate yet so the real the
first<00:02:16.490> question<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.120> what<00:02:17.450> do<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.540> do<00:02:17.840> with

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
first question is what do you do with

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.630 
first question is what do you do with
this<00:02:18.080> information<00:02:18.350> do<00:02:18.740> we<00:02:18.770> tell<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.190> world<00:02:19.400> or

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
this information do we tell the world or

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.360 
this information do we tell the world or
do<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.210> not<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:21.350> guess<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:21.920> would<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.160> one<00:02:22.310> of

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
do we not I guess that would be one of

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.670 
do we not I guess that would be one of
the<00:02:22.460> first<00:02:22.670> questions<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:24.020> very<00:02:24.320> well<00:02:24.380> might

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
the first questions it very well might

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.790 
the first questions it very well might
have<00:02:24.890> been<00:02:25.660> Truman's<00:02:26.660> initial<00:02:27.140> instinct<00:02:27.620> to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
have been Truman's initial instinct to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.130 
have been Truman's initial instinct to
say<00:02:28.040> yes<00:02:28.370> I'd<00:02:28.580> like<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.760> tell<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.180> world<00:02:29.330> but

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
say yes I'd like to tell the world but

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.410 
say yes I'd like to tell the world but
then<00:02:30.260> even<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.740> think<00:02:30.770> twice<00:02:31.240> one<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
then even have to think twice one of the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.790 
then even have to think twice one of the
things<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.750> don't<00:02:32.990> have<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.170> be<00:02:33.290> aware<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.530> is

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
things you don't have to be aware of is

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.410 
things you don't have to be aware of is
if<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.040> tell<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.400> world<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.880> got<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.180> alien

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
if you tell the world you got this alien

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.720 
if you tell the world you got this alien
artifact<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.830> going<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> lot<00:02:37.490> harder

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
artifact it's going to be a lot harder

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.450 
artifact it's going to be a lot harder
not<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.510> share<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.350> with<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.100> rest<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.340> the

not to share it with the rest of the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.460 
not to share it with the rest of the

with whom there was a cold war going at

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.440 
with whom there was a cold war going at
the<00:02:44.240> time<00:02:44.920> it's<00:02:45.920> certainly<00:02:46.400> true<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the time it's certainly true that the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.910 
the time it's certainly true that the
u.s.<00:02:47.660> didn't<00:02:47.990> want<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.230> share<00:02:48.440> its<00:02:48.620> atomic

technology with the world I can imagine

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.580 
technology with the world I can imagine
that<00:02:53.720> they<00:02:53.810> would<00:02:53.840> want<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.170> share<00:02:54.350> something

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
that they would want to share something

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.100 
that they would want to share something
as<00:02:54.800> exotic<00:02:55.190> as<00:02:55.460> alien<00:02:55.850> technology<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.930> what

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
as exotic as alien technology so what

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.140 
as exotic as alien technology so what
they<00:02:57.230> might<00:02:57.410> do<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.920> one<00:02:58.790> thing<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.030> they

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
they might do and one thing that they

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150 
they might do and one thing that they
did<00:02:59.210> do<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.720> get<00:02:59.900> it<00:02:59.990> done<00:03:00.320> group<00:03:00.980> together

man<00:03:51.170> former<00:03:51.470> governors<00:03:51.890> that<00:03:52.070> not<00:03:52.340> true

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
man former governors that not true

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.180 
man former governors that not true
Richard<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.270> think<00:03:53.990> that's<00:03:54.140> exactly<00:03:54.620> true<00:03:54.710> I

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
Richard I think that's exactly true I

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.910 
Richard I think that's exactly true I
think<00:03:55.670> that's<00:03:55.850> been

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
think that's been

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.100 
think that's been
one<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.790> motivations<00:03:58.180> for<00:03:58.540> moving<00:03:58.870> this

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
one of the motivations for moving this

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.870 
one of the motivations for moving this
whole<00:03:59.290> secret<00:03:59.650> private<00:03:59.860> but<00:04:00.220> I<00:04:00.400> think<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
whole secret private but I think the

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.970 
whole secret private but I think the
primary<00:04:01.150> motivation<00:04:01.959> isn't<00:04:02.110> women<00:04:02.500> profit

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
primary motivation isn't women profit

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.680 
primary motivation isn't women profit
and<00:04:03.190> power<00:04:04.230> by<00:04:05.230> those<00:04:05.410> people<00:04:05.860> who<00:04:06.450> have<00:04:07.450> had

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
and power by those people who have had

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.960 
and power by those people who have had
the<00:04:08.230> dominant<00:04:08.770> control<00:04:09.160> over<00:04:09.550> national

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
the dominant control over national

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.490 
the dominant control over national
governments<00:04:10.390> all<00:04:10.510> along<00:04:10.750> anyway<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.170> think

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
governments all along anyway I think

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.680 
governments all along anyway I think
they<00:04:11.620> just<00:04:11.650> wanted<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.760> control<00:04:13.060> over<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.390> UFO

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
they just wanted to control over the UFO

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.809 
they just wanted to control over the UFO
separate<00:04:14.050> as<00:04:14.140> well<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:15.250> if<00:04:15.340> we<00:04:15.459> could<00:04:15.610> put<00:04:15.790> a

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
separate as well and if we could put a

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.580 
separate as well and if we could put a
parallel<00:04:16.389> and<00:04:16.540> I<00:04:16.570> hate<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.870> use<00:04:17.019> this<00:04:17.169> parallel

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
parallel and I hate to use this parallel

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.770 
parallel and I hate to use this parallel
but<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.769> have<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.250> will<00:04:19.209> we<00:04:19.329> think<00:04:19.570> about<00:04:19.720> the

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
but I have to will we think about the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.569 
but I have to will we think about the
indigenous<00:04:20.380> people<00:04:20.709> let's<00:04:20.889> take<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.310> Native

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
indigenous people let's take the Native

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.129 
indigenous people let's take the Native
Americans<00:04:22.090> for<00:04:22.210> example<00:04:22.660> who<00:04:22.810> lived

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
Americans for example who lived

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.140 
Americans for example who lived
peacefully<00:04:23.710> for<00:04:24.040> perhaps<00:04:24.520> thousands<00:04:25.150> of

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
peacefully for perhaps thousands of

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.650 
peacefully for perhaps thousands of
years<00:04:25.380> yeah<00:04:26.380> they<00:04:26.620> never<00:04:26.830> expected<00:04:27.190> an<00:04:28.090> alien

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
years yeah they never expected an alien

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.170 
years yeah they never expected an alien
invader<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.320> come<00:04:29.530> in<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.919> basically<00:04:30.610> wipe

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
invader to come in and basically wipe

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.200 
invader to come in and basically wipe
almost<00:04:31.870> wipe<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.380> cultures<00:04:32.830> out<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.490> they

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
almost wipe the cultures out and they

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.460 
almost wipe the cultures out and they
probably<00:04:34.389> thought<00:04:34.720> that<00:04:34.960> they<00:04:35.050> had<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.290> best

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
probably thought that they had the best

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.960 
probably thought that they had the best
intentions<00:04:35.560> but<00:04:36.100> we<00:04:36.220> all<00:04:36.340> know<00:04:36.490> what<00:04:36.520> happened

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
intentions but we all know what happened

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.700 
intentions but we all know what happened
not<00:04:37.090> only<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.510> United<00:04:37.540> States<00:04:37.840> but<00:04:38.650> in

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
not only in the United States but in

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.490 
not only in the United States but in
pretty<00:04:39.070> much<00:04:39.130> every<00:04:39.610> continent<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.900> can<00:04:41.290> we

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
pretty much every continent so can we

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.190 
pretty much every continent so can we
say<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:41.770> this<00:04:42.250> may<00:04:42.550> be<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.880> case<00:04:43.120> if<00:04:43.419> a<00:04:43.990> more

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
say that this may be the case if a more

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.690 
say that this may be the case if a more
advanced<00:04:44.470> civilization<00:04:45.130> were<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.430> come<00:04:45.580> in

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
advanced civilization were to come in

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.400 
advanced civilization were to come in
contact<00:04:45.910> with<00:04:46.180> us<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.960> answer<00:04:47.229> is<00:04:47.290> that

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
contact with us and the answer is that

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.150 
contact with us and the answer is that
we<00:04:47.530> don't<00:04:47.979> know<00:04:48.220> but<00:04:48.639> we<00:04:48.700> can<00:04:49.210> also<00:04:49.389> say<00:04:49.810> that

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
we don't know but we can also say that

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.800 
we don't know but we can also say that
we<00:04:51.160> cannot<00:04:51.669> say<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.120> hundred<00:04:52.450> percent<00:04:52.750> sure

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
we cannot say the hundred percent sure

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.120 
we cannot say the hundred percent sure
that<00:04:53.260> they'll<00:04:53.440> come<00:04:53.650> with<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.919> best

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
that they'll come with the best

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.719 
that they'll come with the best
interests<00:04:55.000> in<00:04:55.180> mind<00:04:55.240> well<00:04:55.960> now<00:04:56.080> exactly

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
interests in mind well now exactly

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.890 
interests in mind well now exactly
