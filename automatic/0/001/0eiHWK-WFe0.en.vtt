to run pick and roll there big stuffed
up<00:03:46.170> so

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
up so

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.890 
up so
three-point<00:03:48.599> shots<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:49.860> were<00:03:50.750> the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.030 

being<00:03:55.170> aggressive<00:03:56.299> step<00:03:57.299> that<00:03:57.569> they<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.900> find

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
being aggressive step that they can find

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.960 
being aggressive step that they can find
somebody's<00:04:01.110> development<00:04:02.700> that's

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.940

that was you're taking em and it seemed

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.100 
that was you're taking em and it seemed
like<00:04:07.980> every<00:04:08.370> time<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.730> got<00:04:08.910> closed<00:04:09.510> early

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
like every time you got closed early

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.260 
like every time you got closed early

wasn't<00:04:17.910> deflating<00:04:18.420> at<00:04:18.510> all<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.840> point<00:04:19.109> I

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
wasn't deflating at all that point I

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
wasn't deflating at all that point I
mean<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:20.090> mean<00:04:21.090> at<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.420> time<00:04:21.450> it<00:04:21.780> was<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:22.440> little

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
mean I mean at the time it was a little

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.370 
mean I mean at the time it was a little
bit<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.820> mean<00:04:24.150> then<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.360> look<00:04:24.510> up<00:04:24.660> you're<00:04:25.140> still

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
bit I mean then you look up you're still

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.460 
bit I mean then you look up you're still
playing<00:04:25.560> time<00:04:26.060> we<00:04:27.060> come<00:04:27.510> back<00:04:27.720> from<00:04:28.230> these

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
playing time we come back from these

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.650 
playing time we come back from these
they're<00:04:28.710> going<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:29.010> early<00:04:29.040> this<00:04:29.370> year<00:04:29.660> pass

they're going that early this year pass
here<00:04:31.020> so<00:04:31.380> this<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.580> part<00:04:32.820> of<00:04:32.850> just<00:04:32.970> keeping<00:04:33.270> our

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
here so this is part of just keeping our

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.690 
here so this is part of just keeping our
composure<00:04:33.780> but<00:04:34.080> getting<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.280> seemed<00:04:35.550> like

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
composure but getting it seemed like

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.910 
composure but getting it seemed like
every<00:04:35.940> time<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.390> kind<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.020> made<00:04:37.170> a<00:04:37.200> push<00:04:37.470> they

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
every time we kind of made a push they

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.590 
every time we kind of made a push they
would<00:04:38.100> come<00:04:38.250> out<00:04:38.430> get<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.760> big<00:04:38.940> shot<00:04:39.210> towards

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
would come out get a big shot towards

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.200 
would come out get a big shot towards
the<00:04:39.660> net<00:04:39.810> shot<00:04:40.020> clock<00:04:40.320> or<00:04:40.650> just<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.670> three<00:04:42.000> that

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.150 

it<00:06:20.120> happens

it happens

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.450 
it happens
well<00:06:22.760> I<00:06:22.790> think<00:06:22.910> part<00:06:23.300> of<00:06:23.360> it<00:06:23.450> is<00:06:23.570> the<00:06:23.720> schedule

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
well I think part of it is the schedule

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.810 
well I think part of it is the schedule
playing<00:06:25.460> some<00:06:25.610> very<00:06:25.880> very<00:06:26.090> good<00:06:26.240> teams

experienced team to coach so you go out
there<00:06:34.940> you<00:06:35.330> need<00:06:35.450> is<00:06:35.660> 30<00:06:35.870> minutes<00:06:36.200> long<00:06:36.940> we

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
there you need is 30 minutes long we

I<00:06:48.100> thought<00:06:48.550> we<00:06:48.670> had<00:06:48.790> some<00:06:48.970> lapses<00:06:49.390> but<00:06:49.600> I<00:06:49.690> also

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
I thought we had some lapses but I also

I thought we had some lapses but I also
probably<00:06:50.320> puts<00:06:50.590> memory<00:06:51.600> for<00:06:52.600> stretches<00:06:53.020> for

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
probably puts memory for stretches for

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.410 
probably puts memory for stretches for
