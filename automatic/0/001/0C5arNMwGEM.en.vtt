00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello everyone and sms that brings you today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.069
 a new pokémon xy challenge this time 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.650
 I'm against role that is a passerby 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.410
 American if I remember correctly that I do 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.509
 he challenged me one night when I was online 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.039
 and since I already had a team ready for 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.109
 the challenges because at that moment he was 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.730
 challenging just the users that I am 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 they had contacted I decided to do 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.119
 this challenge with him and turned out to be one 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.099
 short challenge but full of pokémon 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.910
 hardly seen around I start 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 with cicinho my berni that was me 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.579
 kindly granted by another of the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 boys of the gem family that group 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.390
 here I am registered on youtube group that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.010
 I reiterate I recommend because it is a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.329
 great group if you talk about beating in 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.250
 competitive and above all of breeding 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.890
 in fact this gagged name was 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.289
 just donated I don't remember if 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.360
 exchanged or just given thank you 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.640
 obviously the user who did it and is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.359
 a beast as you see has just done 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.460
 kick out with a series of sweeps 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.040
 slaps enhanced by the band of your choice 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.619
 this cheers having chosen and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.229
 the ability abi the bond that allows him 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.659
 to always do five strokes on the moves 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.869
 that precisely work with more than one 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.200
 blow as for example if machine gun 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.119
 silent said he attacked in the rounds 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.460
 a minute and 20 cicinho has already done 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.479
 out of two pokémon of my team 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.189
 opponent 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.869
 Now suello sends him on the field that is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.970
 a pokemon that worried me a lot 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.150
 since the team I'm using now 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.390
 to a single defensive wall that is mine 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.070
 bayliss leg my wonderful mum 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.689
 bayliss I wanted to do from time to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.530
 finally I did but unfortunately it is 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.930
 weak in balde wings then I send a gala 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.750
 which has the focal tape in this way 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.670
 I can cash in the facade and shoot 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.520
 I set up a bolide dragon on the ground 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.460
 I could have used also the ma 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.020
 because he would have taken it out anyway 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.880
 however, I reveal it also because 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.399
 other lamas are not very precise they are 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.590
 straight off of dragon bolide e 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.659
 fortunately the pig goes ko 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.580
 now my opponent gets into 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.730
 Field croda wmt which is a Pokémon that 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.920
 fortunately I know why it follows 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.750
 an American user who among other things vi 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.000
 shadi penguin advice he used 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.400
 this type of crow dow or credant 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.220
 with adaptability and most likely 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.260
 dragon dance sacrifice duggal apple that 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.750
 I didn't want her to do dragon dance I was 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.430
 went directly to the attack and send 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.129
 in the field to zoom because zooming the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.660
 mola crowe downs completely since 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.349
 his top moves are in fact 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.819
 hammered and deprived both 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.040
 resisted by the fatah type and type 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.040
 water of my fievel swells sails 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.750
 use just cuteness and then 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.120
 I destroy the cincimino of life that it is 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.000
 stayed thanks to focal tape with a water 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.629
 jet he destroyed me he has me 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.629
 cast out the cedar boat so not 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.030
 I will recover life but I still manage little 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.519
 before being used by this smasch 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.599
 mega to the mega Kazan at the house but 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.819
 really a special attack 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.799
 incredible though personally not 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.379
 I appreciate how pokémon because it's too much 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.060
 fragile is really too fragile and with 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.519
 even such a flame around really does 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.750
 little use of jet water that makes it 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.120
 over half life 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.329
 and at this point I let myself send ko 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.470
 to then return to the field and precisely 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.720
 raven kill this to the kazan with the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.280
 my talent in this one is the second 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.430
 such a film I make is about 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.230
 hayabusa which is a fla such a flame 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.239
 supporter rather than attacker use 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.620
 mainly brad bird as a priority 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.169
 but otherwise it is such an offline 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.069
 support but maybe I'll show you another one 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.599
 challenge 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.459
 nothing the challenge ends here I know it is 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.290
 very short, however, is the only challenge I have 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.849
 to be published this week and there 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.579
 I wanted to put at least one and then 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.230
 however there have been a lot of pokémon 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.329
 he details himself and little seen here 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.950
 surrenders because only symbian has remained there 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.389
 see you at the next challenges I hope 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.579
 feel the quality of the new microphone 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.579
 and that the audio has improved bye
