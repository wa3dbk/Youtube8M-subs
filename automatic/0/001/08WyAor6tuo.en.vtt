00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
off of this burner pan there really is

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.460 
off of this burner pan there really is
two<00:00:47.980> benefits<00:00:48.520> number<00:00:49.300> one<00:00:49.540> it<00:00:49.720> gives<00:00:49.870> all<00:00:50.230> the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
two benefits number one it gives all the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.069 
two benefits number one it gives all the
oxygen<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.250> flame<00:00:51.430> needs<00:00:51.880> anytime<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.930> have

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
oxygen that flame needs anytime you have

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.750 
oxygen that flame needs anytime you have
a<00:00:53.140> flame<00:00:53.470> you<00:00:53.500> need<00:00:53.950> something<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.520> make<00:00:54.670> it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
a flame you need something to make it

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.940 
a flame you need something to make it
efficient<00:00:55.239> which<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:55.540> oxygen<00:00:55.810> most<00:00:56.710> seal

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
efficient which is oxygen most seal

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.430 
efficient which is oxygen most seal
systems<00:00:57.610> starve<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.420> flame<00:00:58.750> from<00:00:59.050> oxygen

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
systems starve the flame from oxygen

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.530 
systems starve the flame from oxygen
this<00:00:59.980> gives<00:01:00.220> it<00:01:00.370> all<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.850> oxygen<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.510> needs

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
this gives it all the oxygen it needs

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.410 
this gives it all the oxygen it needs
it's<00:01:02.230> like<00:01:02.470> having<00:01:02.860> an<00:01:03.010> open<00:01:03.430> burner<00:01:03.640> flame<00:01:04.030> in

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
a sealed system the second thing is it's

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.109 
a sealed system the second thing is it's
easy<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:08.020> clean<00:01:08.170> as<00:01:08.560> spill<00:01:09.219> overs<00:01:09.520> come<00:01:09.820> off

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
the burner pen is below the elevation

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.230 
the burner pen is below the elevation
burner<00:01:13.689> and<00:01:13.960> it<00:01:14.469> is<00:01:14.680> not<00:01:15.009> hot<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:15.759> is<00:01:15.880> easy

now<00:01:19.729> most<00:01:20.030> manufacturers<00:01:20.840> would<00:01:21.080> go<00:01:21.290> to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
now most manufacturers would go to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.010 
now most manufacturers would go to
smaller<00:01:21.740> burners<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.280> get<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.880> lower<00:01:23.540> simmer

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020

smaller burners to get to a lower simmer
not<00:01:24.650> us<00:01:24.950> every<00:01:25.700> one<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.000> these<00:01:26.360> burners<00:01:26.869> go

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
not us every one of these burners go

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.710 
not us every one of these burners go
down<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.799> we<00:01:28.040> call<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.400> very<00:01:28.790> similar<00:01:29.299> the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
down and we call it very similar the

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.480 
down and we call it very similar the
reason<00:01:30.080> we<00:01:30.200> use<00:01:30.229> smaller<00:01:30.830> burners<00:01:31.250> in<00:01:31.460> the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
reason we use smaller burners in the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.910 
reason we use smaller burners in the
back<00:01:31.850> was<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.630> accommodate<00:01:33.200> different<00:01:33.229> sized

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
back was to accommodate different sized

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.160 
back was to accommodate different sized
cookware<00:01:34.520> because<00:01:34.970> consumers<00:01:35.690> said<00:01:35.869> they<00:01:35.990> had

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
cookware because consumers said they had

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.469 
cookware because consumers said they had
smaller<00:01:36.500> pots<00:01:36.830> for<00:01:37.130> like<00:01:37.310> coffee<00:01:37.610> or<00:01:37.850> melting

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
smaller pots for like coffee or melting

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.660 
smaller pots for like coffee or melting
butter<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:39.320> we<00:01:39.350> wanted<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.920> give<00:01:40.100> them<00:01:40.280> smaller

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
butter so we wanted to give them smaller

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.690 
butter so we wanted to give them smaller

these<00:01:44.090> simmers<00:01:44.570> are<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.200> sophisticated<00:01:45.740> and

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549

griddle<00:03:25.790> goes<00:03:26.540> right<00:03:26.780> into<00:03:27.079> here<00:03:27.669> now<00:03:28.669> because

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
griddle goes right into here now because

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.659 
griddle goes right into here now because
this<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.510> lighter<00:03:29.840> in<00:03:30.199> different<00:03:30.620> material<00:03:31.190> it

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
this is lighter in different material it

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.250 
this is lighter in different material it
retains<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.269> heat

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
retains the heat

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.500 
retains the heat
so<00:03:33.560> with<00:03:33.800> this<00:03:33.980> griddle<00:03:34.310> we<00:03:34.970> will<00:03:35.150> give<00:03:35.360> you

something<00:03:51.590> also<00:03:51.980> about<00:03:52.640> these<00:03:52.940> burners<00:03:53.300> these

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
something also about these burners these

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.009 
something also about these burners these
burners<00:03:54.560> have<00:03:54.860> sure<00:03:55.220> spark<00:03:55.849> ignition<00:03:56.209> which

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
burners have sure spark ignition which

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.140 
burners have sure spark ignition which
means<00:03:57.410> that<00:03:57.680> every<00:03:58.040> burner<00:03:58.310> has<00:03:58.700> its<00:03:58.970> own

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
means that every burner has its own

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.229 
means that every burner has its own
igniter<00:03:59.630> we<00:04:00.500> life-term<00:04:01.010> test<00:04:01.400> these<00:04:01.640> igniters

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
igniter we life-term test these igniters

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.479 
igniter we life-term test these igniters
and<00:04:02.540> we<00:04:02.630> had<00:04:02.810> our<00:04:02.840> first<00:04:02.989> failure<00:04:03.620> at<00:04:03.800> 46<00:04:04.400> years

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489
