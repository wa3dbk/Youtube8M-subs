material to go make the curved edge very
few<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.439> them<00:00:22.590> actually<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.670> glass

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
very impressed with the install of it I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.630 
very impressed with the install of it I
had<00:01:06.780> previously<00:01:07.260> installed<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.950> iPhone<00:01:08.250> 6

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880 
had previously installed an iPhone 6
version<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.320> good<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.710> this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
version of it and that was good but this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
version of it and that was good but this
was<00:01:11.070> even<00:01:11.460> better<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.000> goes<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.360> very<00:01:12.390> easily

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
was even better it goes on very easily

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.340 
was even better it goes on very easily
and<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:14.790> think<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.270> looks<00:01:15.479> wonderful<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.200> your

really appreciate it the easy install

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.600 
really appreciate it the easy install
because<00:01:22.560> some<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> edge<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.220> edge<00:01:23.340> ones

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
because some of the edge to edge ones

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
because some of the edge to edge ones
are<00:01:23.729> awful<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> install<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
are awful to install but this one the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.130 
are awful to install but this one the
adhesive<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.130> great<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:27.090> overall<00:01:27.509> install

experience<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.250> very<00:01:29.460> positive

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
experience was very very positive

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.569 
experience was very very positive
unfortunately<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.680> quite<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.310> case

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
unfortunately this is not quite as case

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
unfortunately this is not quite as case
compatible<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.540> had<00:01:33.659> hoped<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.170> going

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
compatible as I had hoped it was going

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.340 
compatible as I had hoped it was going

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.100 
to be h2 edge screen protectors are
generally<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:38.159> case<00:01:38.460> compatible<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.960> add

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
generally not case compatible they add

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.060 
generally not case compatible they add
thickness<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.640> edges<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.899> iPhone<00:01:43.619> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
thickness to the edges of your iPhone so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
thickness to the edges of your iPhone so
cases<00:01:44.790> don't<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.390> very<00:01:45.600> much<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
cases don't like that very much and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.340 
cases don't like that very much and
often<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.460> play<00:01:47.820> nicely<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.570> with

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
often do not play nicely at all with

often do not play nicely at all with
edge<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> edge<00:01:49.860> screen<00:01:50.130> protectors<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.810> had

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
edge to edge screen protectors so I had

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
edge to edge screen protectors so I had
hope<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.770> cinder<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.369> very<00:01:53.670> thin

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
hope because the cinder is so very thin

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
hope because the cinder is so very thin
and<00:01:54.360> very<00:01:54.390> curved<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.110> edges<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> was

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and very curved on the edges that it was

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.789 
and very curved on the edges that it was

have<00:02:00.659> tried<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:00.960> cases<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.270> unfortunately

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
have tried with cases but unfortunately

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.660 
have tried with cases but unfortunately
when<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:04.590> tried<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.310> cases

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
when I actually tried it on with cases

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
when I actually tried it on with cases
this<00:02:05.820> afternoon<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.719> results<00:02:07.200> were<00:02:07.469> really

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
this afternoon the results were really

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.320 
this afternoon the results were really
rather<00:02:08.250> mixed<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.640> typically<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.849> cases<00:02:12.180> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
rather mixed so typically the cases that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.800 
rather mixed so typically the cases that
worked<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.050> were

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
worked with it were

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
worked with it were
either<00:02:14.810> very<00:02:15.110> minimal<00:02:15.500> cases<00:02:15.950> which<00:02:16.190> didn't

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
either very minimal cases which didn't

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.900 
either very minimal cases which didn't
go<00:02:16.880> very<00:02:17.060> far<00:02:17.180> up<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.840> edges<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:19.100> definitely

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
go very far up the edges and definitely

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.760 
go very far up the edges and definitely
didn't<00:02:20.210> interfere<00:02:20.450> with<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.080> glass<00:02:21.320> edges

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
didn't interfere with the glass edges

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.640 
didn't interfere with the glass edges
here<00:02:22.100> or<00:02:22.370> ones<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.090> went<00:02:23.390> up<00:02:23.570> further<00:02:24.140> but

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
here or ones that went up further but

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.300 
here or ones that went up further but
fit<00:02:25.250> loosely<00:02:25.550> or<00:02:27.190> did<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:30.320> fit<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.560> them<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
fit loosely or did the fit of them the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.250 
fit loosely or did the fit of them the
edges<00:02:31.940> are<00:02:32.120> straight<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.870> they're<00:02:33.020> kind<00:02:33.200> of

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
edges are straight so they're kind of

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.850 
edges are straight so they're kind of
going<00:02:33.410> above<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.580> curved<00:02:35.120> edges<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.290> in

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
going above the curved edges and in in

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.590 
going above the curved edges and in in
that<00:02:37.100> way<00:02:37.250> they<00:02:37.460> are<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:37.730> interfering<00:02:38.570> with

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
that way they are not interfering with

that way they are not interfering with
