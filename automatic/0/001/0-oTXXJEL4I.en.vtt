00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 on the 22nd the military college 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.690
 feliciano nunes pires received by 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.240
 the second consecutive time the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.950
 educator elpídio barbosa for having stayed 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 first in the enem between the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.170
 public schools of santa catarina 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 wii that I feel in languages ​​but the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.630
 and in all public schools 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.630
 prevents the state of Santa Catarina 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:58.469
 this year the initial college that already 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:01:00.120
 and was beyond this award the ideb 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.670
 index of development of education 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.619
 the military college in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.290
 fourth place in relation to colleges 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.450
 the country's military police and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.549
 state public schools the college 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.439
 is second in the ideb 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.299
 the reason for so much prominence of the college 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.729
 I do not see Santa Catarina military 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.700
 no secret formula is right for the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.040
 good placements in enem and ideb comes from 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.509
 discipline and dedication of professionals 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.119
 and students 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.270
 I believe it's the secret to both. 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.630
 success comes in the endeavor of a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 professional team and commitment that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.130
 all students and the determination and focus 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.350
 that they have to have successful achievement 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 professional and personal fulfillment 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.390
 discipline is imperative for the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.220

 play in a moment of leisure of 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.640
 a way in general and also a moment 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.250
 of study are telling our students 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.850
 which in the first place is the second study 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.129
 The third study is the study and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.750
 everything there is your discipline and always 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.489
 applying the maxim of treating the other 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.600
 How would you like to be treated? 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.030
 proof of strict discipline 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.260
 of classes start all students if 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.960
 position in front of the flags of the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.340
 country and state college to sing 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.920
 the institution's anthem 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.920
 but before the supervisor's adjustments 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.380
 already in the classroom the head of class 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:20.290
 hosted teacher input to the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:22.870
 standing students and college students 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.110
 the rules and methodology 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.300
 we leave the office 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.400
 the college gives enough incentive so 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.530
 present study nobody else to 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.230
 who has average above 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.150
 Eight and a half is a little star gain, this is a 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.190
 feeling very great gift 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.570
 the teacher explains how they help 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.760
 so that the students have a good 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.350
 income at school and also good 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.480
 results in enem 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.870
 throughout the year we had classes 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.150
 strengthening the period against turn them 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.380
 were from high school mothers then it was 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.830
 done in the afternoon 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.660
 classes and they had a class 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.970
 reinforcement on the content that people 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.610
 works in the classroom and beyond 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.350
 class plus a dedicated tutorial 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.760
 to enem's activities at school is 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.120
 considered public but level is very 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.970
 above the majority 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.290
 then it's worth being all schools 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.290
 should have our standard 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.670
