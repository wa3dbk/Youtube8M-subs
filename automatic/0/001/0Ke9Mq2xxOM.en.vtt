this<00:00:01.329> is<00:00:01.480> another<00:00:01.720> method<00:00:01.960> for<00:00:02.290> determining

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:03.009 
this is another method for determining

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.789 
this is another method for determining
total<00:00:03.759> carbon<00:00:04.150> is<00:00:04.690> called<00:00:04.960> the<00:00:05.049> leuco<00:00:05.350> carbon

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:05.799 
total carbon is called the leuco carbon

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.860 
total carbon is called the leuco carbon
nitrogen<00:00:05.919> analyzer<00:00:06.730> and<00:00:07.359> that<00:00:07.540> beauty<00:00:07.779> of

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
nitrogen analyzer and that beauty of

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.839 
nitrogen analyzer and that beauty of
this<00:00:08.020> instrument<00:00:08.410> is<00:00:08.769> that<00:00:08.980> it<00:00:09.160> analyzes<00:00:09.490> for

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:09.849 
this instrument is that it analyzes for

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.759 
this instrument is that it analyzes for
total<00:00:10.150> nitrogen<00:00:10.330> at<00:00:10.840> the<00:00:10.929> same<00:00:11.170> time<00:00:11.410> as

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
total nitrogen at the same time as

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.579 
total nitrogen at the same time as
carbon<00:00:12.360> what<00:00:13.360> we<00:00:13.480> do<00:00:13.660> is<00:00:13.929> we<00:00:14.080> take<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:14.379> sample

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:14.589 
carbon what we do is we take the sample

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.120 
carbon what we do is we take the sample
and<00:00:15.580> put<00:00:15.879> it<00:00:16.000> in<00:00:16.150> a<00:00:16.240> boat<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.470> place<00:00:17.710> it<00:00:17.949> into

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
and put it in a boat and place it into

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.190 
and put it in a boat and place it into
the<00:00:18.250> balanced

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.800 

this<00:00:23.770> is<00:00:23.920> what<00:00:24.100> an<00:00:24.190> empty<00:00:24.340> ceramic<00:00:25.060> boat<00:00:25.270> looks

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
this is what an empty ceramic boat looks

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.119 
this is what an empty ceramic boat looks
like

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.220 

we<00:00:33.640> can<00:00:33.820> reuse<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.390> boats<00:00:34.570> even<00:00:34.870> though<00:00:35.079> they

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
we can reuse the boats even though they

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.869 
we can reuse the boats even though they
look<00:00:35.410> like<00:00:35.440> this<00:00:35.829> because<00:00:36.250> all<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.519> carbon

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
look like this because all the carbon

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.950 
look like this because all the carbon
and<00:00:36.969> nitrogen<00:00:37.090> has<00:00:37.780> been<00:00:37.960> hurt

now been transferred to the analyzer
remove<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.640> sample<00:00:49.030> from<00:00:49.210> the<00:00:49.270> balance<00:00:49.810> and

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
remove the sample from the balance and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.680 
remove the sample from the balance and
then<00:00:50.560> move<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:50.890> analyzer

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
then move to the analyzer

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.340 
then move to the analyzer
