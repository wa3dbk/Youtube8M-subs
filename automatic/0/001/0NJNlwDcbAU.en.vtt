00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.420 
conservation dollars I look at this exam
and<00:05:34.720> see<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.080> as<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.560> cutting<00:05:35.919> edge<00:05:36.130> of

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
and see it as the cutting edge of

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.850 
and see it as the cutting edge of
conservation<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:38.320> tree<00:05:38.500> kangaroo

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860

conservation<00:05:39.490> program<00:05:39.940> has<00:05:40.360> been<00:05:40.539> this

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
conservation program has been this

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.540 
conservation program has been this
opportunity<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:42.310> really<00:05:42.850> learn<00:05:43.210> about<00:05:44.550> the

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
opportunity to really learn about the

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.330 
opportunity to really learn about the
importance<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.600> science<00:05:47.229> the<00:05:47.560> importance<00:05:48.160> of

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
importance of science the importance of

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.129 
importance of science the importance of

conservation work the importance of

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.129 
conservation work the importance of
working<00:05:50.410> together<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.600> think<00:05:52.870> that

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
working together and so I think that

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.810 
working together and so I think that
tree<00:05:53.440> kangaroo<00:05:53.770> conservation<00:05:54.280> program<00:05:54.580> can

tree kangaroo conservation program can

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.510 
tree kangaroo conservation program can
leave<00:05:55.030> that<00:05:55.270> legacy<00:05:55.539> of<00:05:56.050> true<00:05:56.830> community

leave that legacy of true community
