00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
super blonde back then so they don't

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.509 
super blonde back then so they don't
match<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.170> don't<00:00:25.710> wear<00:00:25.830> them<00:00:25.949> out<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.490> I

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
haven't bothered coloring them today

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.589 
haven't bothered coloring them today
we're<00:00:28.619> gonna<00:00:28.710> fishtail<00:00:29.279> um<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.210> gonna<00:00:30.359> do

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
we're gonna fishtail um and I'm gonna do

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.680 
we're gonna fishtail um and I'm gonna do
kind<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> side<00:00:31.320> fishtail<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:33.450> we're<00:00:33.600> gonna

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
kind of a side fishtail so we're gonna

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
kind of a side fishtail so we're gonna
start<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.320> by<00:00:34.469> gathering<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.190> hair<00:00:35.430> into<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
start just by gathering your hair into a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600 
start just by gathering your hair into a
side<00:00:36.360> ponytail<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.219> need<00:00:38.430> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
side ponytail so you just really need it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.180 
side ponytail so you just really need it
to<00:00:38.730> kind<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.969> hold<00:00:39.180> everything<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> side

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
to kind of hold everything to the side

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.799 
to kind of hold everything to the side
so<00:00:41.190> my<00:00:41.340> fishtail<00:00:41.790> might<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.210> some<00:00:42.450> awkward

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
so my fishtail might have some awkward

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690 
so my fishtail might have some awkward
pieces<00:00:43.200> sticking<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.710> partially<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
pieces sticking out partially because it

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.860 
pieces sticking out partially because it
just<00:00:44.820> looks<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.450> terribly

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
just looks like I have a terribly

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.690 
just looks like I have a terribly
layered<00:00:46.170> haircut<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.160> extensions

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
layered haircut because of my extensions

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
layered haircut because of my extensions
but<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.809> gonna<00:00:48.930> basically<00:00:49.200> show<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
but I'm gonna basically show you the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.119 
but I'm gonna basically show you the
concept<00:00:50.870> what<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.530> bind<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.890> hair

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
concept what you do is to bind your hair

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.779 
concept what you do is to bind your hair
in<00:00:53.219> half<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> more<00:00:54.570> even<00:00:58.070> okay<00:00:59.070> so

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
in half and get that more even okay so

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.459 
in half and get that more even okay so
we've<00:00:59.879> got<00:00:59.910> two<00:01:00.300> instead<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.960> three<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
we've got two instead of three like a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.539 
we've got two instead of three like a
normal<00:01:01.829> braid<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> pull<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.840> hair<00:01:07.549> from

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
normal braid and you pull one hair from

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.480 
normal braid and you pull one hair from
the<00:01:09.330> far<00:01:09.570> section<00:01:10.140> bring<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> middle

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the far section bring it to the middle

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460 
the far section bring it to the middle
and<00:01:11.790> basically<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.630> gonna<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.200> join

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and basically what it's gonna do is join

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.859 
and basically what it's gonna do is join
that<00:01:13.770> side<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.720> then<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:17.189> side

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
that side and then on the other side

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.850 
that side and then on the other side
you're<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> same<00:01:19.439> thing<00:01:19.680> you're

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
you're gonna do the same thing you're

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
you're gonna do the same thing you're
gonna<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.189> over<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.150> join<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
gonna go over and join it in with that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.200 
gonna go over and join it in with that
side<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> similar<00:01:29.100> very<00:01:29.640> very<00:01:29.939> similar

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
side so it's a similar very very similar

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.789 
side so it's a similar very very similar
concept<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> braiding<00:01:31.759> except<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:32.939> just

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
concept to braiding except you're just

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.600 
concept to braiding except you're just
using<00:01:34.799> two<00:01:35.280> strands<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.439> you're<00:01:37.439> still<00:01:38.340> going

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
using two strands and you're still going

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.950 
using two strands and you're still going
to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> center<00:01:44.210> if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> really

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to the center if you want a really

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.569

sections

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.679 

okay<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.880> kind<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.390> coming

okay you can kind of see it coming

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.850 
okay you can kind of see it coming
together<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:11.870> it's<00:02:12.870> difficult<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.500> run<00:02:13.709> out

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
together there it's difficult to run out

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.130 
together there it's difficult to run out
of<00:02:13.890> hair<00:02:14.220> when<00:02:14.910> you're<00:02:15.000> fishtailing<00:02:15.569> because

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
of hair when you're fishtailing because

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.380 
of hair when you're fishtailing because
you<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.069> keep<00:02:17.250> adding<00:02:17.489> hair<00:02:17.879> from<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.239> other

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
you just keep adding hair from the other

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.300 
you just keep adding hair from the other
side<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.860> other<00:02:19.890> side<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.319> adjust<00:02:22.860> dues

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
side to the other side so I adjust dues

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.800 
side to the other side so I adjust dues
once<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.879> in<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.030> rhythm<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.629> keep

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
once you get in the rhythm is just keep

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:45.480 
once you get in the rhythm is just keep
going

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.030 

yours<00:02:46.150> will<00:02:46.360> be<00:02:46.450> much<00:02:46.480> more<00:02:47.140> polished<00:02:47.710> since

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
yours will be much more polished since

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.820 
yours will be much more polished since
you<00:02:48.160> won't<00:02:48.280> have<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.640> take<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.360> deal<00:02:49.600> with<00:02:49.870> two

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
you won't have to take to deal with two

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:59.730 
you won't have to take to deal with two
wildly<00:02:51.640> varying<00:02:52.150> lengths<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:59.380> can<00:02:59.500> kind<00:02:59.680> of

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
wildly varying lengths you can kind of

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.470 
wildly varying lengths you can kind of
see<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.100> I'm<00:03:00.250> raking<00:03:00.670> through<00:03:00.880> each<00:03:01.180> section

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
see that I'm raking through each section

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:14.010 
see that I'm raking through each section
with<00:03:01.780> my<00:03:01.930> fingers<00:03:02.320> just<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.740> keep<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.160> clean

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:37.540 

okay<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.940> we'll<00:03:16.090> go<00:03:16.240> a<00:03:16.270> few<00:03:16.600> more

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:44.670 

okay<00:03:38.300> I'll<00:03:38.990> finish<00:03:39.200> up<00:03:39.470> right<00:03:39.710> about<00:03:39.950> here

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.280 

grab<00:03:45.680> another<00:03:45.950> clear<00:03:46.250> rubber<00:03:46.460> band<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:51.140> put

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
grab another clear rubber band and put

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.960 
grab another clear rubber band and put
that<00:03:51.410> right<00:03:51.470> around<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.010> base<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.640> braid

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
that right around the base of the braid

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.480 
that right around the base of the braid
for<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.900> fishtail<00:03:56.740> okay<00:03:57.740> and<00:03:57.950> then<00:03:58.280> mine's

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
for the fishtail okay and then mine's

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.610 
for the fishtail okay and then mine's
already<00:03:58.760> kind<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.180> coming<00:03:59.510> looser<00:03:59.840> because<00:04:00.020> of

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
already kind of coming looser because of

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.120 
already kind of coming looser because of
the<00:04:01.600> varying<00:04:02.600> lengths<00:04:02.960> of<00:04:03.110> my<00:04:03.230> hair<00:04:03.440> but<00:04:04.040> if

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
the varying lengths of my hair but if

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.410 
the varying lengths of my hair but if
you<00:04:04.220> wanted<00:04:04.490> to<00:04:04.580> kind<00:04:04.820> of<00:04:04.880> make<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.390> little

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
you wanted to kind of make it a little

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.720 
you wanted to kind of make it a little
bit<00:04:05.750> wider<00:04:05.990> all<00:04:06.350> you<00:04:07.010> would<00:04:07.130> do<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:07.340> kind<00:04:07.670> of

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
bit wider all you would do is kind of

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.010 
bit wider all you would do is kind of
gently<00:04:08.000> separated<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:14.420> there<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.690> have<00:04:14.840> it

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
gently separated so there you have it

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.870 
gently separated so there you have it
that's<00:04:15.440> how<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.680> fishtail<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.670> a<00:04:16.700> very

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
that's how to fishtail it's a very

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.120 
that's how to fishtail it's a very
simple<00:04:17.299> concept<00:04:17.810> but<00:04:17.959> don't<00:04:18.799> be<00:04:18.890> frustrated

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
simple concept but don't be frustrated

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.920 
simple concept but don't be frustrated
if<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.670> can't<00:04:19.880> get<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.180> first<00:04:20.360> time<00:04:20.600> once

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
if you can't get it the first time once

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.080 
if you can't get it the first time once
you<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.200> understand<00:04:21.739> how<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.430> sections<00:04:22.940> just

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
you can understand how the sections just

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.090 
you can understand how the sections just
go<00:04:23.420> to<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.720> other<00:04:23.930> section<00:04:24.470> over<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:24.920> over

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
go to the other section over and over

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.920 
go to the other section over and over
and<00:04:25.250> over<00:04:25.310> it'll<00:04:26.060> make<00:04:26.180> more<00:04:26.330> sense<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.870> I'm

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
and over it'll make more sense and I'm

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.790 
and over it'll make more sense and I'm
sure<00:04:27.140> you'll<00:04:27.290> be<00:04:27.350> able<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.710> do

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
sure you'll be able to do

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.720 
sure you'll be able to do
