00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
megabytes which is probably the only

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.010 
megabytes which is probably the only
slight<00:01:47.939> issue<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> could<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.899> with

slight issue that I could have with

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.100 
slight issue that I could have with
advice<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.829> limited<00:01:50.159> ram<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
advice is just the limited ram in it

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.359 
advice is just the limited ram in it
it's<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.229> very<00:01:52.470> noticeable<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.280> know

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it's not very noticeable but you know

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.719 
it's not very noticeable but you know
we'll<00:01:53.579> get<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.820> later<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.299> another<00:01:54.390> video

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
take a look at the two devices

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.740 
take a look at the two devices
side-by-side<00:03:29.820> from<00:03:30.000> different<00:03:30.269> angles<00:03:30.600> and

side-by-side from different angles and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.050 
side-by-side from different angles and
see<00:03:31.049> how<00:03:31.170> they<00:03:31.320> pair<00:03:31.530> up<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:32.489> as<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.790> can<00:03:32.880> see

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
see how they pair up so as you can see

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.569 
see how they pair up so as you can see
the<00:03:33.150> 720<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.870> noticeably<00:03:34.799> thinner<00:03:35.190> than<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
the 720 is noticeably thinner than the

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.940 
the 720 is noticeably thinner than the
920<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.329> terms<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.900> actual<00:03:37.140> dimensions<00:03:37.709> and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
920 in terms of actual dimensions and

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.280 
920 in terms of actual dimensions and
that's<00:03:38.070> due<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.280> being<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.579> smaller<00:03:39.150> phone<00:03:39.450> with

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
that's due to being a smaller phone with

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.229 
that's due to being a smaller phone with
a<00:03:40.590> lesser<00:03:40.980> weight<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.370> actually<00:03:41.790> weighs<00:03:41.880> only

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
a lesser weight it actually weighs only

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:51.789 
a lesser weight it actually weighs only

or<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.340> 720<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.000> actually<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.600> back<00:04:37.810> of

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
or the 720 is actually on the back of

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.960 
or the 720 is actually on the back of
the<00:04:38.080> device<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.740> this<00:04:39.100> won't<00:04:39.250> focus<00:04:39.700> for<00:04:39.850> some

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.030 
the device and this won't focus for some
reason<00:04:40.240> that's<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.020> speaker<00:04:41.200> on<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.410> 720<00:04:41.920> the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
reason that's the speaker on the 720 the

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.560 
reason that's the speaker on the 720 the
speaker<00:04:42.310> on<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.400> 920<00:04:42.850> is<00:04:43.060> right<00:04:43.300> there

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
speaker on the 920 is right there

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.620 
speaker on the 920 is right there
alongside<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.980> microUSB<00:04:45.400> port<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.150> that's

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
alongside the microUSB port and that's

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.010 
alongside the microUSB port and that's
the<00:04:46.840> microUSB<00:04:47.080> port<00:04:47.500> on<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.920> 720<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.930> it's

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
the microUSB port on the 720 so it's

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.600 
the microUSB port on the 720 so it's
pretty<00:04:50.110> much<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.410> for<00:04:50.560> hardware<00:04:50.860> comparison<00:04:51.460> I

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
pretty much it for hardware comparison I

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.250 
pretty much it for hardware comparison I
mean<00:04:51.790> as<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.270> can<00:04:52.300> tell<00:04:52.570> they<00:04:52.900> both<00:04:53.080> have

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
mean as you can tell they both have

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.020 
mean as you can tell they both have
beautiful<00:04:53.710> designs<00:04:54.040> I<00:04:54.400> actually<00:04:54.580> prefer<00:04:54.940> the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
beautiful designs I actually prefer the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.150 
beautiful designs I actually prefer the
design<00:04:55.240> in<00:04:55.330> 720<00:04:55.840> since<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.110> just<00:04:56.200> fits<00:04:56.470> in<00:04:56.710> the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
design in 720 since it just fits in the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.820 
design in 720 since it just fits in the
palm<00:04:57.310> of<00:04:57.370> your<00:04:57.460> hand<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.790> lot<00:04:57.970> nicer<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:59.440> also

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
palm of your hand a lot nicer and I also

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.140 
palm of your hand a lot nicer and I also
forgot<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.220> mention<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.580> they<00:05:00.730> both<00:05:00.880> have

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
forgot to mention that they both have

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.030 
forgot to mention that they both have
curved<00:05:01.510> screens<00:05:01.900> it's<00:05:02.650> probably<00:05:02.919> difficult

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
curved screens it's probably difficult

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.690 
curved screens it's probably difficult
to<00:05:03.370> see<00:05:03.520> on<00:05:03.730> video<00:05:04.180> but<00:05:04.540> it's<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.650> very<00:05:06.550> nice

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
to see on video but it's a very nice

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.159 
to see on video but it's a very nice
curve<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.240> just<00:05:07.390> allows<00:05:07.600> your<00:05:07.750> finger<00:05:07.900> to

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
curve that just allows your finger to

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.650 
curve that just allows your finger to
smooth<00:05:08.610> slide<00:05:09.610> smoothly<00:05:10.060> over<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.450> screen

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
smooth slide smoothly over the screen

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.690 
smooth slide smoothly over the screen
it's<00:05:10.840> very<00:05:11.020> nicely<00:05:11.260> built<00:05:11.650> so<00:05:12.310> these<00:05:12.430> are<00:05:12.580> both

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
it's very nicely built so these are both

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.610 
it's very nicely built so these are both
