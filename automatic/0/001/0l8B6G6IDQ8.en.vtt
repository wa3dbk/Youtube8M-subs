 there are heavy jobs even in the registry 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.639
 It is also important to know how to differentiate between these 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:12.290
 and as far as the floor is concerned, the light vocals that it is and the west, by itself, 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:14.019
 These two models 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.859
 are works that help produce a sound 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.399
