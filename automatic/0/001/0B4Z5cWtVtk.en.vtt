00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
going to do a test so he can see what it

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.180 
going to do a test so he can see what it
feels<00:04:39.540> like<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:40.140> have<00:04:40.230> his<00:04:40.350> bones<00:04:40.620> ligaments

does<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:44.040> then<00:04:44.190> all<00:04:44.340> of<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.460> sudden<00:04:44.520> guess

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
does that then all of a sudden guess

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.850 
does that then all of a sudden guess
what<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.570> muscles<00:04:46.020> don't<00:04:46.290> have<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.680> support

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
what the muscles don't have to support

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.100 
what the muscles don't have to support
the<00:04:47.520> structure<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.330> muscles<00:04:48.660> don't<00:04:48.780> have<00:04:48.990> to

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
the structure the muscles don't have to

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.510 
the structure the muscles don't have to
support<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.560> structure<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.040> doesn't<00:04:50.250> take

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
support the structure that doesn't take

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.129 
support the structure that doesn't take
additional<00:04:50.700> energy<00:04:51.240> which<00:04:51.630> is<00:04:51.750> going<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.930> make

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
additional energy which is going to make

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.510 
additional energy which is going to make
you<00:04:52.290> run<00:04:52.530> longer<00:04:52.979> which<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.190> called

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
you run longer which is called

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.310 
you run longer which is called
efficiency<00:04:53.940> today<00:04:54.690> we're<00:04:54.930> working<00:04:55.200> on

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
efficiency today we're working on

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.530 
efficiency today we're working on
efficiency<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.190> here's<00:04:56.790> what<00:04:56.970> we<00:04:57.060> do<00:04:57.180> Kevin

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
efficiency so here's what we do Kevin

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.990 
efficiency so here's what we do Kevin
