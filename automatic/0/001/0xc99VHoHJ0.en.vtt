00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.250
 asphalt is a liquid substance of 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.360
 black color derived from distillation 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.309
 of crude oil 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.590
 It is a key element in materials 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.780
 waterproofing and insulation 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.300
 It is also used to make covers 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.400
 for rooftops but its application more 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.400
 known is paving roads 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.660
 Asphalt cement is a product 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.340
 derived from oil and it is this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 the one that mixes with rocks 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 crushed and other minerals to make 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.940
 asphalt production starts at the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 quarry of the factory where about 15 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 meters below the surface 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.519
 the operators use heavy machinery 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.470
 to pick up the granite rocks that 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.470
 they fall after flying the rock walls 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.480
 the trucks transport the rocks to the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.230
 pavement factory located in the 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.230
 own quarry 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.800
 they deposit their load in the crusher 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.409
 main one machine whose jaws 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.500
 of steel transform these huge rocks 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.180
 in fragments of about 20 centimeters it 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.970
 you need tremendous strength to 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.040
 crush the solid rock 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.930
 the steering wheels that increase the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.110
 Motor power weigh more than 6 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.110
 tons 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.530
 the main crusher unloads the 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.049
 fragments on a conveyor 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.649
 that sends the crushed stone to an area 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.649
 storage 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.590
 When it's time to do the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.299
 asphalt the stone travels on a treadmill 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.130
 from the storage area to a 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.310
 sieve building where is 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.710
 classified by size 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.899
 there the rock falls on a series of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.280
 metal grilles whose holes more 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.330
 large have a size of 10 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.610
 centimeters wide 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.650
 the larger pieces are sent to a 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.690
 second crusher that reduces it to 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.810
 stones whose size does not exceed 10 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.940
 centimeters later they are sent to a 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.560
 third or fourth crusher that the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.649
 Transforms into fragments of 2 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.479
 centimeters or less the stones what 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.370
 small enough to go through 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.800
 skip grids crusher 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.069
 secondary school and are sent directly to 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.739
 the third 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.859
 after this last phase the stones more 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.450
 big ones are now about two centimeters 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.340
 fragments not exceeding five 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.680
 millimeters are deposited in a pile 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.129
 Including the resulting stone powder 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.129
 of the crushed 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.890
 the stones between 10 and 14 millimeters 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.890
 they are deposited in another heap 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.190
 those that measure between 5 and 10 millimeters in 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.530
 other 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.330
 the trucks carry the material of each 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.790
 heap to different compartments 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.170
 called feed hoppers the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.240
 material that is used to produce 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.520
 asphalt depends on what is going to 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.580
 pave but in general these are the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.580
 four main sand components 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.890
 stone powder 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.060
 stones between 5 and 10 millimeters 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.099
 and stones between 10 and 14 millimeters 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.959
 the proportions of the components 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.400
 vary according to the use to be given to the 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.379
 asphalt 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.400
 the stones together with the sand and the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.470
 stone powder 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.500
 they usually make up 95 percent 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.890
 of the mixture the remaining that is added 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.840
 then it will be liquid asphalt cement 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.670
 each hopper releases a quantity of 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.520
 material that falls on a tape that 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.470
 circulate under it the tapes converge 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.420
 in a principal that deposits the 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.330
 ingredients already combined in another yet 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.010
 that leads to a dryer the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.520
 drying process that lasts on a 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.900
 minute removes remnants of moisture 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.600
 this will allow the materials to be 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.700
 mix better with asphalt cement 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.920
 a screen set separates again 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.250
 the dry ingredients allowing thus 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.200
 weigh the exact amount of each 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.560
 then everything is sent to a 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.560
 mixer 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.480
 as you can see in the images the 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.480
 machine mixes all the elements 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.440
 it's time to pump cement 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.440
 hot asphalt 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.340
 oil refineries make cement 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.010
 asphaltic with what remains after 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.290
 processed the crude oil this mixture 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.230
 contains at least 5% cement 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.360
 asphalt 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.130
 so if you want to make a cake of 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.870
 Asphalt for pavements in your house 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.300
 add a good amount of cement 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.460
 hot asphalt and remove the 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.510
 ingredients should bind in about 30 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.900
 seconds 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.060
 ah 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.710
 the mixer empties the product in 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.320
 trucks that take you to the area to 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.120
 pave a paving machine there 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.550
 scattered the hot asphalt on the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.889
 road after a steamroller what 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.330
 compact the asphalt one hour later 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.330
 it will have cooled and hardened
