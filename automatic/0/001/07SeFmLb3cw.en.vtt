00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 to all the boys then continues 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.529
 therefore we are always solved precisely that is 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.230
 related how to do then 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.540
 there are three races and nature reserves of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.549
 perfect movie guys 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 let's see something you have to do I don't know 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.410
 just that you have to do 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.710
 it doesn't matter right when I have to save 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.710
 I know 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.949
 sorry you saw a project that 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.610
 my house went down to our house 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:44.550
 home is full of atmospheric dust 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:47.329
 I have to admit 50 hectares are lent 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.800
 passing a good mid-August 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.530
 how strange that we are doing the movie 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.930
 no matter then we know everything for 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:03.060
 have it here , but I know I have to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.780
 go through the woods and beautifully scattered 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.010
 but his family say yes people 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.380
 because what ever brings you to 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:17.800
 running races kg this has passed 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.570
 really well we do well thanks 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.290
 they are also beautiful made with balloons 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.470
 I like it coast and much 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.720
 imaginative the truth is fantastic 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.000
 the machines talking about the right sweetness 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.130
 too much head that I went before 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 too strong this does not engage a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.250
 jump a super throat up to much less 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.040
 very fine just super fine that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.690
 it sanctions so however there is a lot of 95 st 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.140
 cute we imagine a step 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.140
 tried 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.540
 the first time I played it though 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 I realized that it was easy to wanted 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.060
 here is what I have to say a little 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.180
 take the leap to force and don't look for the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.810
 jump 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.950
 I can tell you practically not 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.390
 let's see if I can get there 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 greater than the nuclei that the lever 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.940
 our left is not confused with the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:23.150
 head first immediately down this first here 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.040
 so make jump so you make the jump a 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.480
 There is a little bit of amplitude there 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.370
 makes the jump 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.370
 but no matter we are already on the second lap 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.160
 we see only the social of the band with 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.540
 the explicit sigo too well I like a 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.540
 nice little guys jump 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.819
 I really want to see if he could 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.290
 reached part with balloon 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.290
 are at the top than after a 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.880
 yes really that this music a lot 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.410
 beautiful 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.280
 then you know the one that made me there 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.100
 see in the game box we are at home 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.110
 that precedent, in short, there is the jukebox 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.120
 who showed a music no yes 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.800
 call will end my favorite because 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.800
 beautiful but unfortunately 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.790
 I've never heard in this game perhaps 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.980
 I was distant competing scared not 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.220
 we matter we compete lucid 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.220
 one is dead 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.100
 it is made creates scratched do not know why 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.390
 I entered there but fortunately I am 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.580
 boys still in advantage 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.050
 yes because at the beginning with the indicator 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.390
 del made me turn slightly 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.090
 because before because it was orange when 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.030
 you have in your head did not say wait are 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.130
 I thought that a second dish 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.650
 hand where the sergeant because he was known 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.350
 that of overcoming then I saw that he has me 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.840
 passed had turned blue must 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.130
 to be in the lead 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.710
 I didn't understand anything at the beginning a 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.830
 that kidnapped that if yellow orange them 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:08.320
 it means that then you are in the lead 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.390
 now instead of the eyes that it is 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.500
 turned blue instead I'm not in 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.320
 head but we can't good point because 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.470
 ago because he passed me but me 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.830
 immediately logical massafra that you want it 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.830
 hoped 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.140
 the first risked falling there 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.320
 allow the organ to feel nice 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.320
 little 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.380
 both first time I lost 12 times to do 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.780
 that leap in blood 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.870
 and my time I thought that from that crane 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.090
 where they were hung with logs and saronno 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:53.090
 I thought that those who fell in the head 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:56.090
 then he fell he can pay even more 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.480
 steady guys after I do it anymore 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.070
 to see which one 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.070
 you will work it with all your heart 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.820
 I don't know that you made that leap of 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.110
 Cabbage but it doesn't matter yeah 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.140
 I couldn't wait to do the former play 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.000
 because you know just now it was 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.620
 turning on the camera I said 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.060
 finally because guys don't 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:29.580
 we ended up saying it's practically 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.780
 I was very busy loading 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.700
 the videos of in the other extra on I have 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.580
 due also sees progress and therefore not 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.830
 it was easy now we are then 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.190
 therefore first 63 then second sergeant 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.260
 third flow fourth and fifth wins 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.320
 call like that and for now you must call 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.740
 he loses because he arrived fifth than not 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.540
 me those years and now they risk it 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.460
 of the courthouse then the 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:01.230
 court to know how to start another 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:05.210
 race well then continue maximum 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:09.330
 salvario are to write certain digits cerci 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:13.220
 in montebello this is very beautiful and then the 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.220
 new painting of 7 thousand boys 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.750
 today it explains Christian to stand up 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.880
 to you to express the calls in 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.950
 alive from the TV is quite far away 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.710
 so that since me 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:34.550
 since yes the thread is too long 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.160
 I ca n't see them playing together 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:41.480
 I wanted 3 to do it willingly 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.250
 classified not that the scale is not there 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.740
 I put a lot of time kids there 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.810
 nice thing is that you have to wait too 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.940
 this case of Rome even if the image 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:56.030
 of the room with 8 that compete of 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:57.980
 night nothing but those already the game for 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.940
 nintendo understands that he had there 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.710
 races against world champions 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.420
 other dystonia because she is a player 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.040
 I can anticipate too many things 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:12.920
 I can only anticipate what to do a thousand 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:15.350
 splash no week will be anyway 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.710
 for now guys see you in the next 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.250
 event 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.250
 Hello
