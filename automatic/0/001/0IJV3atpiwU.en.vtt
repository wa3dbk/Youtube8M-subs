00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.389
 the austria in the bright white 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.070
 little girl with llevant hasenhüttl 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.139
 storm tops and she tries from the beginning 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.350
 to make the first possibility 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.240
 for floodlights, the upper styrian ones the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.210
 strong defeats of the last 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.980
 Round the very very deep sit the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 back off and start very much 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.230
 defensive 78 mandate for a single 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.689
 storm sabitzer and that means 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 that the austria from the beginning optically 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.989
 is clearly superior 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.450
 she therefore did not need the room in part 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.850
 fast enough so can the donawitz 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.100
 defend against libero week 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.100
 of aus has to form quite well 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.700
 Captain Stankovic played 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.210
 midfielder wing and the two 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.090
 storm tops are covered and man 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.370
 a good opportunity for the sudden 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.820
 Free advanced defender 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.820
 cutter 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.550
 About 3500 spectators just before 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.020
 At the beginning of the game, the rain came slippery 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.560
 some slippery terror and the first 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.960
 possibility then by hanger at the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.970
 few counter bumps of the home team 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.710
 the way with a very clear defensive 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.990
 system has come into play and through 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.390
 the counter-chance has waited further 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.940
 the austria has optical advantages 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.790
 here birds fell equal to two men 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.970
 necessary for the dynamic 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.010
 midfielder to stop if mika 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.260
 howright sorrowful look free kick 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.590
 feel the ball over the wall 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.110
 20 minutes 1 back since you know 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.090
 this very sentimentally upscale ball 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.410
 a little badly calculated responds 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.010
 maybe too late and there is the ball 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.190
 already in tor 1 0 by stöger after 20 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.190
 minutes 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.200
 he will broska is satisfied 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.540
 the course that made them vote 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.760
 second pressure continues to provide opportunities 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.290
 and then verstolpert from mosquitoes that 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.290
 possibility for the 2 0 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.710
 only rarely do the upper Styrians come out 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.710
 out of your own half 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.450
 that was really hard the sabitzer acts 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.450
 a little isolated front all alone 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.600
 the mower olivera next to volkov falls 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.000
 also a free state for the ton 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.640
 wheat head of the advanced kovacic 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.780
 the best way of donawitzer in 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.780
 the first 45 minutes 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.950
 always traveling with the long wide pass 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.800
 You miss the defense of the Donawitzer 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.590
 and an owner of babelsbergs the 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.770
 Upper Styrian luck jumps from the pole 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.050
 the ball rolled into the gate safely 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.190
 can not intervene 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.790
 the unfortunate fake ball and 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.790
 again the austria 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.090
 as medium 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:28.950
 and a game camp from staiger 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.110
 break score 1 0 for Austria to 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.180
 But the weather changes completely 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.800
 other donawitz landscape immediately 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.710
 after the restart one makes pressure now 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.390
 you remember that you have a home game 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.450
 Offensivspiel must and chances come 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.430
 and as stankovic as peter were the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.710
 now tries to shoot files 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.480
 He too has the chance to do it all 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.460
 had a few seconds to re-start 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.080
 the came into the team 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.390
 brings fresh momentum to the team of 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.060
 Upper Styrian team is not now 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.550
 recognize the austria now only 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.320
 still defensive is going back and forth 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.260
 swirled and stankovic with the second 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.760
 possibility just over spectators 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.220
 almost can not believe it 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.880
 and on it goes with the storm run of the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.880
 Donawitzer 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.860
 magnificent flank of Schwegler and no 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.390
 cent responds from zero degrees so three 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.680
 huge opportunities for compensation but 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.290
 not a single one used 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.460
 the austria is still leading now 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.870
 the austria gets better again 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.740
 game now the game is faster 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.750
 open prosenik he gets the ball 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.730
 once again and from three meters brings 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.240
 the trick still the ball over the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.980
 still beat one to zero 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.790
 was suddenly this game exciting 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:48.970
 and interesting 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:48.970
 stöger free kick for austria 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:59.159
 and on the line kovacic jumps 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:59.159
 ball out the valent scenes again 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:08.139
 the austria still leads 10 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.569
 Only a few minutes to play stöger 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.680
 he loses the ball 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.259
 leave now on the following scene 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.550
 on finger pursued by stöger 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:20.770
 this case of stöger that gives yellow 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.599
 after a foul on fenger already yellow in 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.889
 the first half has been seen 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.509
 referee graf yes nothing else 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:31.749
 left red card for staiger so that 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:38.379
 austria in the last few minutes only 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:40.510
 with ten men already just under 93 minutes 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.870
 played 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.850
 ok powerful push still good there 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.110
 the ball jumps away there comes too 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.560
 finger to the ball and that is 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.750
 sufficed 1 to 1 in the 93 minute 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.090
 seen repetition are a bit 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.880
 Good luck with the protection of beginners 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.760
 equal to 1 1 and the donawitzer 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.910
 then players celebrate this one point 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.910
 Earn worth balance one on one 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.980
 I find it incomprehensible to me 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.450
 must be said with the game firstly can 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.490
 to be satisfied but what second 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.600
 which was certainly offered more 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.400
 as indisputable 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.280
 why we still have to do that ourselves 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.139
 I think that maybe 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.550
 some players second half too 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.870
 are lifted gone to the games 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.060
 and that just goes against you 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.400
 ambitious donawitzer team with 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.750
 safety not i have to say we 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.430
 have second half for sure very well 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.560
 played and I believe designs as 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.520
 fair and we are sure that today 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.520
 a deserved point
