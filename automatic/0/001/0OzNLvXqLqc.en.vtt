forward a bit so there's not an obvious

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.480 
forward a bit so there's not an obvious
harsh<00:02:13.430> line<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:15.140> I'm<00:02:15.350> just<00:02:15.530> going<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.980> use<00:02:16.220> a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
harsh line then I'm just going to use a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.590 
harsh line then I'm just going to use a
generic<00:02:17.120> black<00:02:17.720> eyeliner<00:02:18.290> pencil<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.600> I'm

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
generic black eyeliner pencil and I'm

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.710 
generic black eyeliner pencil and I'm
just<00:02:20.870> going<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.170> draw<00:02:21.380> first<00:02:21.650> align<00:02:22.720> right

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
just going to draw first align right

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:33.250 
just going to draw first align right
into<00:02:24.020> my<00:02:24.140> crease<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:31.430> down<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.180> see<00:02:32.990> I've<00:02:33.080> got<00:02:33.230> a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
into my crease and down I see I've got a

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.690 
into my crease and down I see I've got a
little<00:02:33.440> bit<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.620> fallout<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.550> going

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
little bit of fallout so I'm just going

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.560 
little bit of fallout so I'm just going
to<00:02:34.790> whisk<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.120> away<00:02:35.540> right<00:02:35.810> now<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:37.570> think

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
to whisk that away right now I think

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.470 
to whisk that away right now I think
it's<00:02:38.690> because<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.680> I've<00:02:40.160> been<00:02:40.520> I've<00:02:41.240> got<00:02:41.450> a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
it's because the I've been I've got a

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.240 
it's because the I've been I've got a
mirror<00:02:41.810> over<00:02:42.170> here<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.740> I'm<00:02:42.860> kind<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.100> trying

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
mirror over here so I'm kind of trying

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.680 
mirror over here so I'm kind of trying
to<00:02:43.370> look<00:02:43.520> into<00:02:43.730> both<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:43.910> mirror<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
to look into both the mirror and the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.060 
to look into both the mirror and the
camera<00:02:45.050> because<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.350> camera<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.650> too<00:02:45.830> small

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
camera because the camera is too small

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.520 
camera because the camera is too small
to<00:02:46.280> really<00:02:46.430> let<00:02:46.700> me<00:02:46.850> know<00:02:47.000> how<00:02:47.989> things<00:02:48.260> are

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
to really let me know how things are

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.380 
to really let me know how things are
going<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:50.950> don't<00:02:51.950> have<00:02:52.340> DNA<00:02:52.670> here<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.270> good

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
going I don't have DNA here it's a good

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.030 
going I don't have DNA here it's a good
thing<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.570> practice<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.260> other<00:02:54.350> day<00:02:54.470> doing<00:02:54.830> it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
thing I practice the other day doing it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.440 
thing I practice the other day doing it
without<00:02:55.160> Danny<00:02:55.550> because<00:02:55.760> sure<00:02:56.060> enough<00:02:56.270> it's

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
without Danny because sure enough it's

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.449 
without Danny because sure enough it's
Christmas<00:02:56.780> holidays<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.500> he's<00:02:57.950> out<00:02:58.130> running

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
around with his friends now once we get

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.660 
around with his friends now once we get
me<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.870> make<00:03:03.050> sure<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.230> got<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.680> there<00:03:03.860> this

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
me just make sure I got it in there this

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.560 
me just make sure I got it in there this
far<00:03:04.910> forward<00:03:05.269> as<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.540> do<00:03:05.600> on<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.930> other<00:03:06.260> side

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
far forward as I do on the other side

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.000 
far forward as I do on the other side
let's<00:03:08.570> see<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.110> nuts<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.680> comes<00:03:09.860> to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
let's see the nuts that it comes to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.259 
let's see the nuts that it comes to
there<00:03:10.190> on<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.640> side<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.850> him<00:03:11.030> but<00:03:11.120> that's

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
there on that side of him but that's

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.990 
there on that side of him but that's
about<00:03:11.600> even<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.140> think<00:03:12.670> me<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.700> little<00:03:13.850> bit

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
about even I think me a little bit

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.050 
about even I think me a little bit
further<00:03:14.209> okay<00:03:15.430> maybe<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.519> forgot<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.850> put<00:03:16.970> my

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
further okay maybe I forgot to put my

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.570 
further okay maybe I forgot to put my
highlighter<00:03:17.510> on<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.980> highlighter<00:03:19.340> will

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
highlighter on and the highlighter will

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.460 
highlighter on and the highlighter will
help<00:03:19.730> depends<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:20.180> glide<00:03:20.420> better<00:03:20.690> with<00:03:21.290> any

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
help depends on glide better with any

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.410 
help depends on glide better with any
luck<00:03:21.560> at<00:03:21.769> all<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.670> on<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.000> other<00:03:23.120> side<00:03:23.390> I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
luck at all because on the other side I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.170 
luck at all because on the other side I
had<00:03:23.690> already<00:03:23.840> done<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.380> highlighting<00:03:25.180> before

okay and then I'm sorry about that i had
to<00:04:19.280> look<00:04:19.430> into<00:04:19.639> my<00:04:19.760> mirror<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.120> lot<00:04:20.150> when<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.540> was

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
to look into my mirror a lot when I was

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.789 
to look into my mirror a lot when I was
do<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:21.019> because<00:04:21.109> it's<00:04:21.320> very<00:04:21.380> hard<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.650> get

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
do that because it's very hard to get

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.110

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
video about 13 times and had to redo it

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.379 
video about 13 times and had to redo it
because<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.150> just<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.910> then<00:04:32.060> we're<00:04:32.180> just

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
because it just and then we're just

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.200 
because it just and then we're just
drawing<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.990> line<00:04:33.169> down<00:04:33.470> on<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.889> underside<00:04:34.430> and

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
drawing a line down on the underside and

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.969 
drawing a line down on the underside and
filling<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:35.750> in<00:04:37.810> it's<00:04:38.810> just<00:04:39.080> very<00:04:39.289> hard<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.800> get

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
filling it in it's just very hard to get

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.270 
filling it in it's just very hard to get
