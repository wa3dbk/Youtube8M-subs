it does or doesn't but we can look at
the<00:02:48.959> facts<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.890> matter<00:02:50.540> which<00:02:51.540> are<00:02:51.720> just

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
the facts of the matter which are just

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.880 
the facts of the matter which are just
as<00:02:52.110> important<00:02:52.940> when<00:02:53.940> jinx<00:02:54.570> has<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:55.260> prior

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
as important when jinx has a prior

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.729 
as important when jinx has a prior
evolution<00:02:56.760> before<00:02:57.180> becoming<00:02:57.540> jinx<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.709> a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
evolution before becoming jinx it is a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.140 
evolution before becoming jinx it is a
smoochum<00:02:59.670> smoochum<00:03:00.020> has<00:03:01.020> no<00:03:01.739> comodo<00:03:02.520> when<00:03:03.030> it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
smoochum smoochum has no comodo when it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.610 
smoochum smoochum has no comodo when it
evolves<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.750> gains<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.170> Komodo

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
evolves it gains the Komodo

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.620 
evolves it gains the Komodo
where<00:03:04.830> did<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> Komodo<00:03:05.430> come<00:03:05.730> from<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.239> don't

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
where did the Komodo come from I don't

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.180 
where did the Komodo come from I don't
know<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:09.000> leads<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.780> question<00:03:10.320> did<00:03:10.709> jinx

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
know so that leads the question did jinx

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.580 
know so that leads the question did jinx
acquired<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.880> evolution<00:03:12.780> or<00:03:12.959> did<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.200> pick<00:03:13.470> it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
acquired in evolution or did it pick it

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.160 
acquired in evolution or did it pick it
up<00:03:13.739> obviously<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.790> did<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.209> pick<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.050> it

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
up obviously it did not pick it up so it

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.830 
up obviously it did not pick it up so it
is<00:03:16.320> an<00:03:16.440> acquired<00:03:16.830> trait<00:03:17.310> through<00:03:17.910> evolution

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
is an acquired trait through evolution

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.600 
is an acquired trait through evolution
now<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:20.310> indeed<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.660> an<00:03:22.110> acquired<00:03:23.070> trait

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
now if indeed it is an acquired trait

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.690 
now if indeed it is an acquired trait
through<00:03:23.880> evolution<00:03:24.630> how<00:03:25.110> does<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:26.070> help<00:03:26.430> it

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
through evolution how does it help it

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.320 
through evolution how does it help it
survive<00:03:27.000> more<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.440> I'm<00:03:28.860> going<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.459> get<00:03:29.850> a

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
survive more so I'm going to get a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.370 
survive more so I'm going to get a
little<00:03:30.660> weird

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
little weird

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.550 
little weird
here<00:03:31.710> and<00:03:32.070> just<00:03:32.280> stick<00:03:32.610> with<00:03:32.790> me<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.260> front

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
here and just stick with me on the front

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.730 
here and just stick with me on the front
it<00:03:34.890> has<00:03:35.100> two<00:03:35.490> large<00:03:35.850> cups<00:03:36.450> for<00:03:36.960> what<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.260> assume

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
it has two large cups for what I assume

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.440 
it has two large cups for what I assume
are<00:03:38.010> supposed<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.520> be<00:03:38.670> breasts

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
are supposed to be breasts

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.470 
are supposed to be breasts
however<00:03:40.200> it's<00:03:40.350> not<00:03:40.620> exactly<00:03:41.250> stated<00:03:41.940> if<00:03:42.090> jinx

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
however it's not exactly stated if jinx

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.110 
however it's not exactly stated if jinx
is<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> woman<00:03:43.230> or<00:03:43.410> not<00:03:43.490> other<00:03:44.490> than<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.820> fact

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
is a woman or not other than the fact

other<00:03:47.370> features<00:03:48.620> insinuating<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.830> mean

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
other features insinuating this mean

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.280 
other features insinuating this mean
long<00:03:50.850> hair<00:03:51.180> doesn't<00:03:51.450> necessarily<00:03:52.110> guarantee

a<00:03:52.590> female<00:03:53.210> on<00:03:54.210> top<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.690> fact<00:03:54.990> that<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.620> mean

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
a female on top of the fact that I mean

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.010 
a female on top of the fact that I mean
how<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.400> tell<00:03:56.850> if<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.060> thing<00:03:57.540> as<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.720> female

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
how you tell if that thing as a female

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.870 
how you tell if that thing as a female
or<00:03:58.230> not<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.830> because<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.190> has<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> long<00:03:59.580> hair

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
or not just because it has a long hair

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.970 
or not just because it has a long hair
and<00:04:00.090> large<00:04:00.570> lips<00:04:00.960> again<00:04:01.890> not<00:04:02.550> defining<00:04:03.510> traits

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
and large lips again not defining traits

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.590 
and large lips again not defining traits
but<00:04:04.980> nevertheless<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:06.150> have<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:07.190> understand

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
but nevertheless you have to understand

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.580 
but nevertheless you have to understand
if<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:10.490> attempt<00:04:11.490> to<00:04:11.720> try<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.110> see<00:04:13.320> what's

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
if you attempt to try and see what's

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.460 
if you attempt to try and see what's
under<00:04:13.980> jinxes<00:04:14.550> dress<00:04:14.850> there<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.600> nothing<00:04:16.080> and

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
under jinxes dress there is nothing and

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.880 
under jinxes dress there is nothing and
you<00:04:16.650> can<00:04:16.680> see<00:04:16.980> this<00:04:17.160> in<00:04:18.410> several<00:04:19.410> games<00:04:19.620> that

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
you can see this in several games that

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.520 
you can see this in several games that
allow<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.370> look<00:04:20.489> up<00:04:20.850> jinxes<00:04:21.390> dress<00:04:21.660> not

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
allow you to look up jinxes dress not

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.700 
allow you to look up jinxes dress not
saying<00:04:22.920> that<00:04:23.810> it's<00:04:24.810> something<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.560> should

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
saying that it's something you should

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.880 
saying that it's something you should
probably<00:04:25.860> go<00:04:26.430> out<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.820> do<00:04:26.990> but<00:04:27.990> researching

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
probably go out and do but researching

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.130 
probably go out and do but researching
is<00:04:29.190> research<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.060> jinx<00:04:31.610> well<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:33.000> have<00:04:33.900> no<00:04:34.110> idea

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
is research and jinx well I have no idea

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.000 
is research and jinx well I have no idea
how<00:04:34.830> or<00:04:35.190> if<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.210> woman<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:37.590> supposed

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
how or if it is a woman that is supposed

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.160 
how or if it is a woman that is supposed
to<00:04:38.100> resemble<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.730> female<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.540> real<00:04:40.440> life<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:42.170> have

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
to resemble a female in real life I have

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.770 
to resemble a female in real life I have
an<00:04:43.290> opinion<00:04:43.740> on<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:43.920> but<00:04:44.370> again<00:04:44.610> that's<00:04:45.540> not

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
an opinion on it but again that's not

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.200 
an opinion on it but again that's not
the<00:04:45.840> video<00:04:46.170> so<00:04:46.800> if<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.280> does<00:04:47.520> acquire<00:04:48.000> this

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
the video so if it does acquire this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.070 
the video so if it does acquire this
Komodo<00:04:48.980> why<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.040> two<00:04:50.640> breasts<00:04:51.030> piece<00:04:51.360> if<00:04:51.750> it

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
Komodo why the two breasts piece if it

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.020 
Komodo why the two breasts piece if it
doesn't<00:04:52.470> have<00:04:52.650> breasts<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:55.700> can't<00:04:56.700> it<00:04:56.850> feel

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
doesn't have breasts and can't it feel

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.470 
doesn't have breasts and can't it feel
pain<00:04:57.300> there<00:04:57.600> also<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:59.280> this<00:04:59.730> some<00:05:00.150> type<00:05:00.450> of

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
pain there also is this some type of

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.720 
pain there also is this some type of
armor<00:05:01.200> that<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.590> feels<00:05:01.830> nothing<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:02.700> just

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
armor that it feels nothing and it just

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.220 
armor that it feels nothing and it just
requires<00:05:03.450> an<00:05:03.690> evolution<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:05.010> does<00:05:05.750> pose<00:05:06.750> a

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
requires an evolution it does pose a

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.480 
requires an evolution it does pose a
good<00:05:07.620> question

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
good question

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.770 
good question
this<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.240> some<00:05:09.480> fact<00:05:09.950> that<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.670> acquires<00:05:12.480> it

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
this is some fact that it acquires it

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.010
