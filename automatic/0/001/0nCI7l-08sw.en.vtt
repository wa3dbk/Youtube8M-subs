00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.770
 We are very happy with the same 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.770
 performance of all the girls 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.409

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.190
 and it really is not, we're girls of 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.580

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.580
