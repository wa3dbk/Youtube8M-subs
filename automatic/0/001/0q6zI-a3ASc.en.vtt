00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello good in this case I come with some 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:11.879
 California wicks you know there are 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.900
 countless ways to do them in this 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.539
 If a few months ago I made to Nerea 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.150
 some California wicks that this is the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.650
 result that remained 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.789
 to watch the video click on the link 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.949
 above 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.090
 We made on a chocolate base 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.550
 then lighter wicks in the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.989
 points and in this case what I wanted was 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.050
 to leave behind his chestnut tree that would 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.970
 brown and then already to the clear tips 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.210
 without it would look in stripes but 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.909
 degraded languages so let's see 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.159
 that slight change that we're not going to 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.649
 darken this area and re-lighten 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.189
 a little the tips and the intermediate 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:04.089
 re-apply that chocolate brown and 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:07.390
 nothing very simple here you have the step to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:12.659
 step first we divide into a form of 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.659
 star part of the crown 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.070
 that we will do at the end 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.860
 and we are going to divide the rest into four 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.790
 as we have done on other occasions 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:37.619
 sideburns on one side and the parts 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.619
 later divided into two also 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.750
 how are we going to apply a dark brown 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.300
 let's give a cream an oil 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.950
 product that you use to not leave 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.840
 spots around the contour and we're going to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.830
 start in such a way if you have already 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 seen the previous video you see that according to 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.330
 let's lower each wick in each one we go to 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.660
 have to do a different one 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.690
 then in this one that I already had in his day 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.500
 lighter I'm applying the brown 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.600
 chocolate in the central area and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.530
 tips I leave because you already have the clear 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.740
 that I want 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.230
 in the next section what we are going to 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.120
 clarify is the tip because of the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.750
 previous time I did not have it clear then 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.840
 what I apply is chocolate brown and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.720
 at the tip above discoloration at ten 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.680
 volumes for me to clarify how the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.680
 previous sees in the brown range clarified 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 we see the following what we have to 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.319
 to do is darken a little towards brown 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:10.379
 that central area of ​​the other's wick 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:12.959
 once we go down another section more in this 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.420
 case there is some face so applied 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.189
 the dark brown at the root and what 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.099
 I'm going to do is clarify the tip with the 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:26.329
 brown and discoloration depending on 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.709
 the base that your client brings you 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.639
 you will choose what you have that 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:37.590
 do in each section 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:39.419
 that you are going down in this case we have 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.730
 that darken the shawn we had 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.909
 bleached the previous time so 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.489
 we apply chocolate brown in the area 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.489
 central and we leave the clear tip 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:10.829
 we return to the dark brown nose and the 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:12.659
 chocolate in media also depending 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.549
 as far as you want the height to reach 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:20.669
 of the dark chestnut you can apply it 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.830
 even without gray pepper until 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.500
 a little bit lower to where 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.270
 you want and here at the tip as 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.900
 it was not clear from the travel what 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.600
 we do is apply chocolate brown and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.310
 the discoloration just at the tips in 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.699
 this case also you clarify 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.970
 clarify and aix of losing up to where 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.970
 you want 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.120
 and we are going to do so all the way 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.430
 where we have darkened the dark 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.300
 above and where we have to clarify 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.300
 we clarify 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.430
 sideburns had to work it 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.390
 let's do exactly the same in the 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.060
 front area 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:24.080
 let's go applying the dark brown 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:31.010
 nothing there and here in the 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:33.020
 means chocolate brown we go down another 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.960
 section 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.000
 the chestnut school in the rai 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.180
 and in this case we are going to make the tips 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.660
 with chocolate brown and discoloration 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.660
 over 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.220
 ah 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.550
 in this case dark brown and then the 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.550
 brown chocolate 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:05.220
 the front area we give the dark brown 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.460
 up to the height that we 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.460
 we want 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.100
 and then the chocolate brown 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.580
 ah 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.920
 ah 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.170
 and we continue with the rest 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.080
 in this case in the chestnut root 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.210
 dark and as I have seen there is a 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.160
 little table there is a little clearer because it 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.310
 I give the brown as I did in the 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.620
 previous section 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:44.550
 since the tip then a little 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.139
 brown with a little bit of discoloration and 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.430
 the other side of the pin we work 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:52.919
 same and the star that we had left 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.169
 in that area of ​​the crown what we're going 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.199
 to do is work with chestnut 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:11.160
 dark down a little more towards 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:16.530
 means and at the tips what we're going to 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:20.699
 to do is give chocolate brown though 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:22.759
 do not look good with discoloration to 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:26.970
 dry the worked by the diffuser 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:31.919
 read alder a bit that front area will 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:35.069
 I'm messed up and here we have the 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:37.770
 final result that goes from a chestnut 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:43.880
 dark chocolate at the root brown 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:43.880
 means and a light blond at the tips 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:58.190
 I hope you liked this one 

00:07:55.199 --> 00:08:01.680
 another technique of making also wicks 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:04.759
 Californian and nothing see you soon 

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.759
 see you later
