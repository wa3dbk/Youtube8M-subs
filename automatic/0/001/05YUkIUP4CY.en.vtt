is

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.910 
is
I<00:04:33.180> think<00:04:33.810> all<00:04:33.960> those<00:04:34.080> things<00:04:34.140> are<00:04:34.590> things<00:04:34.620> that

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
I think all those things are things that

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.920 
I think all those things are things that
people<00:04:35.520> can't<00:04:35.880> measure<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.450> you<00:04:36.540> never<00:04:36.750> will

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930

be<00:04:37.140> able<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:38.760> know<00:04:38.790> I<00:04:38.910> think<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:39.330> the

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
be able to you know I think on the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.600 
be able to you know I think on the
Filipino<00:04:40.020> being<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.440> big<00:04:40.710> guy<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.310> can<00:04:41.430> move

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
Filipino being a big guy that can move

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.670 
Filipino being a big guy that can move
around<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:42.060> little<00:04:42.180> bit<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.630> extend<00:04:43.020> place<00:04:43.290> and

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
around a little bit and extend place and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.170 
around a little bit and extend place and
change<00:04:43.860> those<00:04:44.160> points

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
change those points

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.150 
change those points
I<00:04:45.210> guess<00:04:45.990> separates<00:04:46.410> me<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> little<00:04:46.830> bit<00:04:46.950> from

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
I guess separates me a little bit from

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.060 
I guess separates me a little bit from
from<00:04:47.820> some<00:04:47.970> other<00:04:48.120> guys<00:04:48.330> but<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:49.320> think<00:04:49.740> being

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
from some other guys but I think being

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.470 
from some other guys but I think being
able<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.370> compete<00:04:50.700> and<00:04:50.970> compete<00:04:51.210> at<00:04:51.390> a<00:04:51.450> high

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
able to compete and compete at a high

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.790 
able to compete and compete at a high
level<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:52.290> there's<00:04:52.530> something<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.950> I

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800
