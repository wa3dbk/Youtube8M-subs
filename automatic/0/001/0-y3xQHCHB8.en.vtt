00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
shape album of course that probably

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.650 
shape album of course that probably
doesn't<00:00:26.220> surprise<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.029> I'm<00:00:27.359> totally

doesn't surprise you because I'm totally

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.439 
doesn't surprise you because I'm totally
addicted<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.439> shape<00:00:28.680> albums<00:00:29.189> however<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.240> have

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
addicted to shape albums however I have

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.060 
addicted to shape albums however I have
lots<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> other<00:00:31.019> ways<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.679> other

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
lots of other ways and other

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.630 
lots of other ways and other
applications<00:00:32.660> that<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.290> idea<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.070> used

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
applications that this idea can be used

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.240 
applications that this idea can be used
with<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.570> little<00:00:36.690> bit<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> resizing<00:00:37.620> I

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
with just a little bit of resizing I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420 
with just a little bit of resizing I
think<00:00:39.239> there's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.780> possibilities<00:00:40.430> so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
think there's a lot of possibilities so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.360 
think there's a lot of possibilities so
but<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.050> today<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.160> going

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
but for this but for today we are going

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.360 
but for this but for today we are going
to<00:00:44.670> look<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> shape<00:00:45.629> album<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.219> am

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
cut file I simply just shaped a piece of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.679 
cut file I simply just shaped a piece of
cardstock<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.409> window<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.329> then<00:02:06.329> punch

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
cardstock to the window and then punch

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.320 
cardstock to the window and then punch
the<00:02:06.930> edge<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> Martha<00:02:08.580> Stewart<00:02:08.789> lattice

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.440 

and<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.040> course<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.490> thought<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.820> plaid<00:02:16.150> paper

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.420 
and of course I thought this plaid paper
looks<00:02:16.780> kind<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.170> wallpaper<00:02:17.650> for<00:02:18.340> our

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
looks kind of like wallpaper for our

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.090 
looks kind of like wallpaper for our
little<00:02:18.580> country<00:02:19.020> looking<00:02:20.020> in<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.800> country

wind window looking out just lots of
ideas<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.530> guess<00:03:05.740> for<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.100> book<00:03:06.400> you're

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
ideas and I guess for this book you're

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.220 
ideas and I guess for this book you're
on<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.150> outside<00:03:07.540> looking<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.600> hope<00:03:11.020> you

on the outside looking in so I hope you

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.320 
on the outside looking in so I hope you
like<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.310> lots<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.670> other<00:03:12.850> ideas<00:03:13.300> for

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
like it I have lots of other ideas for

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.960 
like it I have lots of other ideas for
it<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:14.170> can't<00:03:14.560> remember<00:03:14.770> if<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.040> said<00:03:15.340> or<00:03:15.490> not<00:03:15.670> but

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
it I can't remember if I said or not but

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.940 
it I can't remember if I said or not but
just<00:03:16.180> with<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.360> little<00:03:16.450> bit<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.780> resizing<00:03:17.350> I

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
just with a little bit of resizing I

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.920 
just with a little bit of resizing I
think<00:03:18.520> it<00:03:18.640> would<00:03:18.790> make<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> very<00:03:19.150> cute

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
think it would make a very cute

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.310 
think it would make a very cute
dimensional<00:03:20.739> card<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:22.000> put<00:03:22.239> with<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.450> gift<00:03:22.870> and

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
dimensional card to put with a gift and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.240 
dimensional card to put with a gift and
I<00:03:24.250> can<00:03:24.459> see<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.880> made<00:03:25.209> much<00:03:25.480> larger<00:03:26.140> maybe<00:03:26.739> for

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
I can see it made much larger maybe for

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.310 
I can see it made much larger maybe for
the<00:03:27.310> cover<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.630> book<00:03:28.870> or<00:03:29.380> an<00:03:29.620> album<00:03:31.170> make<00:03:32.170> it

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
the cover of a book or an album make it

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.560 
the cover of a book or an album make it
smaller<00:03:32.620> maybe<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:33.220> some<00:03:33.370> gift<00:03:33.610> tags<00:03:33.910> lots<00:03:34.450> of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
smaller maybe for some gift tags lots of

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.910 
smaller maybe for some gift tags lots of
ideas<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.959> have<00:03:35.080> lots<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.350> things<00:03:35.590> floating

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
ideas I have lots of things floating

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.610

little<00:04:04.239> cobblestone<00:04:04.870> street<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:07.360> I

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
little cobblestone street and so I

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.490 
little cobblestone street and so I
thought<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.750> toy<00:04:08.080> store<00:04:08.380> would<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.709> neat<00:04:09.040> and

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
thought a toy store would be neat and

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.040 
thought a toy store would be neat and
again<00:04:11.500> it's<00:04:11.680> just<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.190> all<00:04:12.400> one<00:04:12.970> piece<00:04:13.300> score

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
again it's just the all one piece score

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.490 
again it's just the all one piece score
