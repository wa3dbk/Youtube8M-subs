especially in the first seven episodes I

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.639

felt and it was really easy for me to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.469 
felt and it was really easy for me to
see<00:01:48.859> how<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.340> series<00:01:49.579> really<00:01:49.939> didn't<00:01:50.329> pick

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
in season 1 is really whiny insecure

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.250

and you compare that to the Clark end of
season<00:03:53.299> 10<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:54.440> know<00:03:54.500> he's<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:55.040> little<00:03:55.340> you

season 10 and you know he's a little you

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.090 
season 10 and you know he's a little you
know<00:03:56.209> always<00:03:56.540> teetering<00:03:57.170> on<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.500> little<00:03:57.889> bit<00:03:58.069> of

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
know always teetering on a little bit of

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.280 
know always teetering on a little bit of
the<00:03:58.340> whiny<00:03:58.790> side<00:03:59.180> but<00:03:59.480> he<00:03:59.720> would<00:03:59.840> definitely

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
the whiny side but he would definitely

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.410 
the whiny side but he would definitely
stepped<00:04:00.680> up<00:04:00.889> more<00:04:01.160> in<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.340> later<00:04:01.459> seasons<00:04:01.790> and

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
stepped up more in the later seasons and

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.240 
stepped up more in the later seasons and
showed<00:04:02.810> himself<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.230> be<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.380> true<00:04:03.650> leader<00:04:03.680> and

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
showed himself to be a true leader and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.509 
showed himself to be a true leader and
here<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.299> know<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:05.720> really<00:04:06.620> was<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.980> girl<00:04:07.190> he

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
here you know it really was a girl he

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.550 
here you know it really was a girl he
was<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.700> kid<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.540> really<00:04:09.019> noticed<00:04:09.380> that

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
was a kid and you really noticed that

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.170 
was a kid and you really noticed that
and<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.069> thought<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.489> Tom<00:04:10.670> Welling<00:04:11.000> is<00:04:11.090> an

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
and I thought that Tom Welling is an

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.729 
and I thought that Tom Welling is an
actor<00:04:11.480> who's<00:04:11.630> definitely<00:04:11.840> matured<00:04:12.500> over<00:04:12.590> the

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
actor who's definitely matured over the

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.410 
actor who's definitely matured over the
years<00:04:12.950> as<00:04:13.069> an<00:04:13.220> actor<00:04:13.549> you<00:04:13.730> could<00:04:14.269> definitely

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
years as an actor you could definitely

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.349 
years as an actor you could definitely
see<00:04:14.930> here<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.680> he's<00:04:15.829> a<00:04:16.039> little<00:04:16.489> stoic<00:04:17.209> the

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
see here that he's a little stoic the

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.629 
see here that he's a little stoic the
little<00:04:17.599> places<00:04:18.289> performance<00:04:18.979> is<00:04:19.099> very<00:04:19.130> safe

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
little places performance is very safe

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.129 
little places performance is very safe

obsessed with her dead parents through a

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.600 
obsessed with her dead parents through a
really<00:05:35.750> unhealthy<00:05:36.199> level<00:05:36.650> but<00:05:37.099> actually<00:05:37.460> did

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
really unhealthy level but actually did

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.430 
really unhealthy level but actually did
think<00:05:37.820> there<00:05:37.970> was<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.120> strong<00:05:38.449> character<00:05:39.320> in

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
think there was a strong character in

think there was a strong character in
there<00:05:39.560> this<00:05:39.770> initial<00:05:40.160> season<00:05:40.520> who<00:05:40.610> really

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
there this initial season who really

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.089 
there this initial season who really
wanted<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.240> break<00:05:41.479> free<00:05:41.780> from<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:42.199> you<00:05:42.979> know

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
never happens in later seasons and I

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.339 
never happens in later seasons and I
like<00:06:10.669> that<00:06:10.909> just<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.389> actors<00:06:11.810> and<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:11.990> they

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
all had a great dynamic with each other

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.279 
all had a great dynamic with each other
and<00:06:14.150> we<00:06:14.270> were<00:06:14.419> very<00:06:14.810> interesting

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
and we were very interesting

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.620 
and we were very interesting
relationships<00:06:15.919> I<00:06:16.070> felt<00:06:16.340> you<00:06:17.000> know<00:06:17.030> season<00:06:17.479> 1

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
relationships I felt you know season 1

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.939 
relationships I felt you know season 1
is<00:06:17.720> not<00:06:17.870> you<00:06:18.199> know<00:06:18.289> groundbreaking

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
is not you know groundbreaking

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.219 
is not you know groundbreaking
television<00:06:19.449> but<00:06:20.449> I<00:06:20.479> do<00:06:20.599> think<00:06:20.870> it<00:06:21.110> actually

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
television but I do think it actually

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.100 
television but I do think it actually
has<00:06:21.620> aged<00:06:22.240> relatively<00:06:23.240> well<00:06:23.509> it's<00:06:23.870> still

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
has aged relatively well it's still

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.110 
has aged relatively well it's still
enjoyable<00:06:24.380> although<00:06:25.159> there<00:06:25.340> are<00:06:25.460> still<00:06:25.789> some

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
enjoyable although there are still some

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.529 
enjoyable although there are still some
strong<00:06:26.840> weaknesses<00:06:27.699> to<00:06:28.699> it<00:06:28.849> so<00:06:29.270> I'm<00:06:29.389> gonna

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
strong weaknesses to it so I'm gonna

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.980 
strong weaknesses to it so I'm gonna
give<00:06:29.810> it<00:06:29.840> about<00:06:30.440> you<00:06:31.370> know<00:06:31.520> what<00:06:31.669> a<00:06:31.820> 7<00:06:32.419> point<00:06:32.599> 5
