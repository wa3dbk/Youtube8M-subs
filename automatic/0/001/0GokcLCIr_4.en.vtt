chase which I think like we organized

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.050 
chase which I think like we organized
about<00:00:33.990> two<00:00:34.500> months<00:00:34.860> three<00:00:35.220> months<00:00:35.490> ago<00:00:35.970> or

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
about two months three months ago or

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.700 
about two months three months ago or
something<00:00:36.210> which<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.570> ridiculous<00:00:37.140> anyway

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
something which was ridiculous anyway

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.910

lead<00:00:37.920> off<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.690> spondee<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.350> gave<00:00:40.680> him<00:00:40.830> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
lead off with spondee and I gave him a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590 
lead off with spondee and I gave him a
no<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> limit<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:41.820> he<00:00:41.970> whore<00:00:42.210> too<00:00:42.420> much

not a lot it's going to do to tangrowth
I<00:02:09.720> decided<00:02:10.049> to<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> T

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.319 
hacks even though it's pretty much
pointless<00:02:16.709> because<00:02:17.100> tan<00:02:17.400> growth<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.850> slow<00:02:18.209> as

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
pointless because tan growth is slow as

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.740

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
lose and he sucker-punched me while I'm

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.290 
lose and he sucker-punched me while I'm
sleeping<00:06:00.740> is<00:06:01.160> like<00:06:01.310> where's<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.640> logic<00:06:01.940> in

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
sleeping is like where's the logic in

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.080 
sleeping is like where's the logic in
that<00:06:02.330> because<00:06:03.200> if<00:06:03.410> I<00:06:03.590> would<00:06:03.860> just<00:06:04.460> sleep<00:06:04.640> then

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
that because if I would just sleep then

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.710 
that because if I would just sleep then
i<00:06:05.180> wouldn't<00:06:05.419> even<00:06:05.510> attack<00:06:05.900> so<00:06:06.350> it's<00:06:06.500> just<00:06:06.620> like

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
i wouldn't even attack so it's just like

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.250 
i wouldn't even attack so it's just like
stupid<00:06:08.720> game<00:06:09.680> anyway<00:06:10.640> he<00:06:11.090> Crips<00:06:11.540> my<00:06:11.750> dragonite

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.170 
no he doesn't not yet I d-wave him and
then<00:06:14.870> I<00:06:14.900> ruched<00:06:15.320> and<00:06:15.560> then<00:06:15.800> he<00:06:15.950> crypt<00:06:16.280> me<00:06:16.490> but

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
then I ruched and then he crypt me but

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.760 
then I ruched and then he crypt me but
at<00:06:17.240> this<00:06:17.360> point<00:06:17.600> I'm<00:06:17.810> just<00:06:17.840> like<00:06:18.200> I<00:06:18.470> didn't

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
at this point I'm just like I didn't

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.440 
at this point I'm just like I didn't
even<00:06:18.830> attack<00:06:19.310> I<00:06:19.460> don't<00:06:19.669> know<00:06:19.790> why<00:06:19.970> I<00:06:20.000> didn't

attack<00:06:20.540> him<00:06:20.900> I<00:06:21.050> guess<00:06:21.320> is<00:06:21.500> because<00:06:21.620> I<00:06:21.800> really

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
attack him I guess is because I really

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.340 
attack him I guess is because I really
didn't<00:06:22.669> care<00:06:22.910> anymore<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:23.630> i<00:06:23.930> knew<00:06:24.140> i<00:06:24.169> was
