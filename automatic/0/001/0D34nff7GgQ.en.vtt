Fame because of the building that's
shaped<00:00:19.270> kind<00:00:19.450> of<00:00:19.570> like<00:00:19.630> a<00:00:19.780> basketball<00:00:20.500> and

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
shaped kind of like a basketball and

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.660 
shaped kind of like a basketball and
because<00:00:21.940> of<00:00:22.090> this<00:00:22.180> huge<00:00:22.630> tower<00:00:23.140> that<00:00:23.980> as<00:00:24.220> as

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
because of this huge tower that as as

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.850 
because of this huge tower that as as
you<00:00:24.880> may<00:00:25.030> have<00:00:25.060> guessed<00:00:25.330> a<00:00:25.680> basketball<00:00:26.680> at<00:00:26.800> the

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
you may have guessed a basketball at the

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.820 
you may have guessed a basketball at the
very<00:00:27.070> top<00:00:27.340> of<00:00:27.370> it<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:28.270> things<00:00:28.570> a<00:00:28.780> giant

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
very top of it the things a giant

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.850 
very top of it the things a giant
our<00:00:30.550> task<00:00:30.850> is<00:00:31.240> to<00:00:31.300> find<00:00:31.420> out<00:00:31.810> how<00:00:32.140> tall<00:00:32.200> this

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
our task is to find out how tall this

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.250 
our task is to find out how tall this
tower<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.450> what<00:00:34.600> we<00:00:34.690> need<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:34.960> do<00:00:35.079> is<00:00:35.230> a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
tower is so what we need to do is a

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.340 
tower is so what we need to do is a
couple<00:00:35.469> of<00:00:35.680> things<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:37.149> we<00:00:37.510> have<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.960> find<00:00:38.200> the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
couple of things one we have to find the

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.310 
couple of things one we have to find the
angle<00:00:38.890> that<00:00:39.070> we're<00:00:39.219> viewing<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.899> is<00:00:41.109> the

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
angle that we're viewing and what is the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.430 
angle that we're viewing and what is the
angle<00:00:41.829> that<00:00:42.160> we're<00:00:42.339> viewing<00:00:42.609> at<00:00:43.140> we've<00:00:44.140> built

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
angle that we're viewing at we've built

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.110 
angle that we're viewing at we've built
a<00:00:44.589> simple<00:00:44.920> tool<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.460> can<00:00:45.579> use<00:00:45.789> to<00:00:45.999> measure

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
a simple tool you can use to measure

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.910 
a simple tool you can use to measure
angles<00:00:46.659> it's<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:46.929> protractor<00:00:47.499> a<00:00:47.530> little<00:00:47.769> hole

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
angles it's a protractor a little hole

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.329 
angles it's a protractor a little hole
in<00:00:48.100> it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
in it

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.939 
in it
and<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:49.420> tape<00:00:49.629> a<00:00:49.659> straw<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.440> very<00:00:50.649> top<00:00:50.920> of

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
and you tape a straw to the very top of

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.040 
and you tape a straw to the very top of
it<00:00:51.280> through<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:51.969> hole<00:00:52.269> you<00:00:52.300> put<00:00:52.510> some<00:00:52.780> fishing

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
it through the hole you put some fishing

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.869 
it through the hole you put some fishing
wire<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.980> end<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.249> fishing<00:00:54.519> wire<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.760> put

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
wire the end of the fishing wire you put

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.939 
wire the end of the fishing wire you put
a<00:00:54.909> lead<00:00:55.059> weight<00:00:55.210> gravity<00:00:56.079> pulls<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.800> lead

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
a lead weight gravity pulls the lead

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.139 
a lead weight gravity pulls the lead
weight<00:00:57.129> towards<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.579> center<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.059> earth

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
weight towards the center of the earth

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.969 
weight towards the center of the earth
so<00:00:58.510> you're<00:00:59.170> looking<00:00:59.350> at<00:00:59.589> something<00:00:59.649> that's

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
so you're looking at something that's

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.059 
so you're looking at something that's
perfectly<00:01:00.489> horizontal<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:02.199> string<00:01:02.829> is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069 
perfectly horizontal that string is

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.340 
perfectly horizontal that string is
going<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.370> hang<00:01:03.609> right<00:01:04.150> at<00:01:04.300> 90<00:01:04.449> degrees<00:01:04.960> which

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
going to hang right at 90 degrees which

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.649 
going to hang right at 90 degrees which
we're<00:01:05.560> going<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.770> call<00:01:05.950> zero<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:07.210> as<00:01:07.420> you

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
we're going to call zero and as you

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.210 
we're going to call zero and as you
begin<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.080> look<00:01:08.229> up<00:01:08.470> at<00:01:08.710> something<00:01:08.740> that's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
begin to look up at something that's

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.160 
begin to look up at something that's
taller<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:10.080> taller<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.470> taller<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.960> weight

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
taller and taller and taller the weight

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.069 
taller and taller and taller the weight
continues<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.920> hang<00:01:15.070> straight<00:01:15.369> down<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.960> we

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
continues to hang straight down so we

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.469 
continues to hang straight down so we
can<00:01:17.229> use<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.920> change<00:01:18.490> in<00:01:18.790> angle<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.390> the

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
can use this change in angle of the

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.090 
can use this change in angle of the
protractor<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:20.110> measure<00:01:20.170> from<00:01:20.469> zero<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.890> ten

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
protractor and measure from zero to ten

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.850 
protractor and measure from zero to ten
to<00:01:21.280> 20<00:01:21.549> degrees<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.450> determine<00:01:22.869> how<00:01:23.020> high<00:01:23.409> an

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
to 20 degrees to determine how high an

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.109 
to 20 degrees to determine how high an
object's<00:01:24.820> angle<00:01:25.390> of<00:01:25.630> elevation<00:01:26.049> is<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.909> here

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
object's angle of elevation is so here

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.700 
object's angle of elevation is so here
we<00:01:28.240> are<00:01:28.360> out<00:01:28.509> in<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.659> field<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.200> there<00:01:29.350> we<00:01:29.469> are

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
we are out in the field and there we are

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.219 
we are out in the field and there we are
we<00:01:30.280> look<00:01:30.490> through<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.759> straw<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.299> we<00:01:31.600> cite<00:01:32.020> it

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
we look through the straw and we cite it

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.020 
we look through the straw and we cite it
in<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:33.340> basketball<00:01:34.000> it's<00:01:34.899> coming<00:01:35.590> it's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
in on the basketball it's coming it's

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.060 
in on the basketball it's coming it's
there<00:01:38.030> we<00:01:38.240> got<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.510> perfectly<00:01:38.900> sited<00:01:39.410> now

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
there we got it perfectly sited now

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:51.649 
there we got it perfectly sited now
let's<00:01:40.310> read<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.730> see<00:01:40.880> what<00:01:41.030> we<00:01:41.120> get

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.999 

39<00:01:52.649> degrees<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:54.450> what<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> need<00:01:54.719> to<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:58.009> in

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
39 degrees so now what I need to do in

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.160 
39 degrees so now what I need to do in
order<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.820> measure<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> distance

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
order to do this is measure the distance

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.080 
order to do this is measure the distance
from<00:02:02.180> my<00:02:03.259> location<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> base<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.939> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
from my location to the base of that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.820 
from my location to the base of that
tower<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> got<00:02:07.049> my<00:02:07.229> trusty<00:02:07.619> trundle<00:02:08.190> wheel

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
tower and I got my trusty trundle wheel

00:02:09.830 --> 00:03:03.020 
tower and I got my trusty trundle wheel
so<00:02:10.830> let's<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.310> ahead<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.760> that<00:03:01.880> look<00:03:02.880> we

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
so let's go ahead and do that look we

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.599 
so let's go ahead and do that look we
got<00:03:03.209> ourselves<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.690> right<00:03:03.870> triangle<00:03:04.519> all<00:03:05.519> right

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
got ourselves a right triangle all right

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.190 
got ourselves a right triangle all right
we<00:03:05.760> decided<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.269> we<00:03:06.510> were<00:03:06.630> seeing<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.109> at

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
we decided that we were seeing it at

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.360 
we decided that we were seeing it at
about<00:03:07.290> 39<00:03:07.950> degrees<00:03:08.549> elevation<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:10.079> that<00:03:10.370> we

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
about 39 degrees elevation and that we

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.020 
about 39 degrees elevation and that we
were<00:03:11.489> located<00:03:13.609> 57<00:03:14.609> meters<00:03:14.819> away<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
were located 57 meters away so the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.400 
were located 57 meters away so the
question<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.540> how<00:03:18.870> tall<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.579> device<00:03:21.410> well

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
question is how tall is this device well

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.319 
question is how tall is this device well
if<00:03:22.560> this<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:22.859> right<00:03:23.069> triangle<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
if this is a right triangle this is the

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.930 
if this is a right triangle this is the
opposite<00:03:24.900> side<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.609> adjacent

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
opposite side and this is the adjacent

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.400 
opposite side and this is the adjacent
side<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:28.470> some<00:03:29.220> angle<00:03:29.900> let's<00:03:30.900> go<00:03:31.049> over<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.230> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
side of some angle let's go over to the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.410 
side of some angle let's go over to the
math<00:03:32.389> we<00:03:33.389> know<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.019> tangent<00:03:34.500> or<00:03:35.420> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
math we know that the tangent or the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.470 
math we know that the tangent or the
angle<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.859> equal<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.519> opposite<00:03:39.030> divided

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
angle is equal to the opposite divided

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.410 
angle is equal to the opposite divided
by<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.660> adjacent

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
by the adjacent

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.260 
by the adjacent
and<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.260> we'll<00:03:42.890> do<00:03:43.010> algebra<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.819> solve<00:03:44.000> for

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
and so we'll do algebra to solve for

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.010 
and so we'll do algebra to solve for
opposite<00:03:44.750> side<00:03:44.990> now<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:47.510> got<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.720> get<00:03:47.810> rid<00:03:47.930> of

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
opposite side now we got to get rid of

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.780 
opposite side now we got to get rid of
adjacent<00:03:48.650> on<00:03:48.770> this<00:03:48.920> side<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.310> equation<00:03:49.400> so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
adjacent on this side of the equation so

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.520 
adjacent on this side of the equation so
we<00:03:49.850> multiply<00:03:50.240> both<00:03:50.420> sides<00:03:50.660> by<00:03:50.750> adjacent<00:03:51.110> so

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
we multiply both sides by adjacent so

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.250 
we multiply both sides by adjacent so
the<00:03:51.650> tangent<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> angle<00:03:53.080> times<00:03:54.080> the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
the tangent of the angle times the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.830 
the tangent of the angle times the
adjacent<00:03:54.890> side<00:03:55.150> should<00:03:56.150> be<00:03:56.330> equal<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.660> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
adjacent side should be equal to the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.750 
adjacent side should be equal to the
opposite<00:03:57.230> side<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.709> in<00:03:57.830> fact<00:03:58.070> our<00:03:58.280> algebra

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
opposite side and in fact our algebra

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.540 
opposite side and in fact our algebra
solves<00:03:59.240> for<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.510> unknown<00:04:00.550> so<00:04:01.550> let's<00:04:01.790> plug<00:04:02.060> in

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
solves for the unknown so let's plug in

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.550 
solves for the unknown so let's plug in
tangent<00:04:04.550> of<00:04:04.640> 39<00:04:05.209> degrees<00:04:06.100> times<00:04:07.480> 57<00:04:08.480> meters<00:04:09.260> I

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
tangent of 39 degrees times 57 meters I

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.280 
tangent of 39 degrees times 57 meters I
plug<00:04:10.310> in<00:04:10.489> I<00:04:10.640> find<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.940> tangent<00:04:11.150> 39<00:04:11.900> degrees

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
plug in I find the tangent 39 degrees

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.310 
plug in I find the tangent 39 degrees
comes<00:04:12.560> out<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.800> be<00:04:12.890> about<00:04:12.980> point<00:04:13.400> eight<00:04:13.760> I

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
comes out to be about point eight I

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.620 
comes out to be about point eight I
multiply<00:04:15.320> that<00:04:15.470> by<00:04:15.530> fifty-seven<00:04:16.459> I'm<00:04:17.329> coming

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
multiply that by fifty-seven I'm coming

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.830 
multiply that by fifty-seven I'm coming
up<00:04:17.720> with<00:04:17.870> 46<00:04:18.590> point<00:04:18.890> one<00:04:19.280> five

meters or 46 meters or the kind of
precision<00:04:24.139> we<00:04:24.260> can<00:04:24.440> get

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
precision we can get

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.050 
precision we can get
well<00:04:27.500> after<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.860> was<00:04:28.040> done<00:04:28.310> playing<00:04:28.340> outside<00:04:28.850> I

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
well after I was done playing outside I

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.150 
well after I was done playing outside I
got<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.420> go<00:04:29.540> inside<00:04:29.720> he's<00:04:30.110> really<00:04:30.590> fastening

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
got to go inside he's really fastening

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.860 
got to go inside he's really fastening
the<00:04:31.580> walls<00:04:31.850> were<00:04:32.060> covered<00:04:32.210> with<00:04:32.390> pictures<00:04:32.660> of

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
the walls were covered with pictures of

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.720 
the walls were covered with pictures of
people<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.320> were<00:04:33.410> real<00:04:33.680> influential<00:04:34.610> in

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
people that were real influential in

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.500 
people that were real influential in
basketball<00:04:35.390> I'm<00:04:36.290> kind<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.280> fan<00:04:37.550> myself<00:04:38.090> but

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
basketball I'm kind of a fan myself but

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.050 
basketball I'm kind of a fan myself but
mostly<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.920> Syracuse<00:04:40.340> Orangemen<00:04:40.670> I

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
mostly of the Syracuse Orangemen I

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.020 
mostly of the Syracuse Orangemen I
really<00:04:41.900> like<00:04:42.140> Syracuse<00:04:42.770> University<00:04:43.460> they've

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
really like Syracuse University they've

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.300 
really like Syracuse University they've
got<00:04:44.240> some<00:04:44.390> amazing<00:04:44.960> teams<00:04:45.260> and<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.070> coach<00:04:46.280> is

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
got some amazing teams and the coach is

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.150 
got some amazing teams and the coach is
great<00:04:46.840> anyway<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:47.870> met<00:04:47.990> Susan<00:04:48.380> askin<00:04:48.920> who<00:04:49.040> is

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
great anyway I met Susan askin who is

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.340 
great anyway I met Susan askin who is
the<00:04:49.280> education<00:04:49.970> coordinator<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.930> she<00:04:51.110> let<00:04:51.260> me

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
the education coordinator and she let me

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.170 
the education coordinator and she let me
play<00:04:51.560> with<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.830> shoes<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.430> Shaquille<00:04:52.820> O'Neal

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
play with the shoes of Shaquille O'Neal

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.160 
play with the shoes of Shaquille O'Neal
and<00:04:53.450> Yao<00:04:53.750> Ming<00:04:54.190> so<00:04:55.190> now<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.370> do<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.550> volume

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
and Yao Ming so now you do a volume

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.990 
and Yao Ming so now you do a volume
experiment<00:04:57.170> we're<00:04:57.410> trying<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.890> calculate<00:04:58.430> how

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
experiment we're trying to calculate how

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.610 
experiment we're trying to calculate how
many<00:04:59.060> things<00:04:59.600> would<00:04:59.720> fit<00:04:59.930> inside<00:05:00.200> of<00:05:00.260> here<00:05:00.470> and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
many things would fit inside of here and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.930 
many things would fit inside of here and
then<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.920> actually<00:05:01.190> pour<00:05:01.370> them<00:05:01.520> in<00:05:03.790> I'll<00:05:04.790> look

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
then you actually pour them in I'll look

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.070 
then you actually pour them in I'll look
at<00:05:05.120> two<00:05:05.600> left<00:05:05.810> feet<00:05:06.550> mm-hmm<00:05:07.610> yeah<00:05:08.080> that's

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
at two left feet mm-hmm yeah that's

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.780 
at two left feet mm-hmm yeah that's
awesome<00:05:09.320> Susan<00:05:09.920> thank<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:10.220> so<00:05:10.370> much<00:05:10.520> did<00:05:10.700> you
