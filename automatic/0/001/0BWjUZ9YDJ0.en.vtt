this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.610> second<00:00:03.270> part<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:04.230> how<00:00:04.859> to

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
this is the second part to how to

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.780 
this is the second part to how to
recalibrate<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:06.060> chronograph

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
recalibrate a chronograph

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.259 
recalibrate a chronograph
with<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> Swiss<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.540> see<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.780> movement<00:00:11.000> on<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
with a Swiss I see a movement on the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.970 
with a Swiss I see a movement on the
first<00:00:12.960> part<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.700> recalibrated<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.910> Invicta

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
first part I recalibrated and Invicta

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.310 
first part I recalibrated and Invicta
with<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> switch<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.550> see<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.789> movement<00:00:18.029> now<00:00:18.779> this

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
with a switch I see a movement now this

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.890 
with a switch I see a movement now this
model<00:00:19.590> right<00:00:19.920> here<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.539> very<00:00:21.539> similar<00:00:23.900> but

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
model right here is very similar but

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.349 
model right here is very similar but
instead<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.320> having<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.340> day<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.880> week<00:00:27.029> at

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
instead of having the day of the week at

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.870 
instead of having the day of the week at
the<00:00:27.599> 6<00:00:27.869> o'clock<00:00:28.019> position<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.890> has<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.609> date

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
the 6 o'clock position it has the date

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:40.600 
the 6 o'clock position it has the date
and<00:00:32.750> let<00:00:33.750> me<00:00:33.870> show<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> how<00:00:38.870> this<00:00:39.870> movement

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
and let me show you how this movement

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.240 
and let me show you how this movement
works<00:00:42.079> it's<00:00:43.079> actually<00:00:43.559> kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> cool<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
works it's actually kind of cool it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.569 
works it's actually kind of cool it
doesn't<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.379> ticking<00:00:46.379> motion<00:00:46.800> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
doesn't have the the ticking motion that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.939 
doesn't have the the ticking motion that
you<00:00:47.789> see<00:00:48.030> most<00:00:48.989> chronographs<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:52.500> actually

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you see most chronographs it actually

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
you see most chronographs it actually
has<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.730> smooth<00:00:54.480> sweeping<00:00:55.730> motion<00:00:56.730> around<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
has a smooth sweeping motion around the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.639 
has a smooth sweeping motion around the
dial<00:00:57.890> which<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.789> said<00:01:00.350> gives<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
dial which as I said gives you the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
dial which as I said gives you the
appearance<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.550> having<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.629> automatic<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
appearance of having an automatic or a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.929 
appearance of having an automatic or a
mechanical<00:01:05.400> watch<00:01:07.369> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.580> tell<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
mechanical watch you can tell the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
mechanical watch you can tell the
difference<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> three<00:01:09.990> o'clock<00:01:10.290> sub<00:01:10.650> dial

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
difference on the three o'clock sub dial

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.609 
difference on the three o'clock sub dial
how<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> hand<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.000> ticking<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:13.200> usually

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
how the hand is ticking that's usually

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.520 
how the hand is ticking that's usually
how<00:01:13.770> most<00:01:14.960> quartz<00:01:15.960> watches<00:01:16.229> look<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> that's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
how most quartz watches look so that's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.160 
how most quartz watches look so that's
that<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.280> really<00:01:20.850> cool<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:24.170> stop

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that it's really cool so you can stop

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.670 
that it's really cool so you can stop
and<00:01:25.439> reset<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:28.579> now<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.680> recalibrating

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and reset and now on to recalibrating

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.969 
and reset and now on to recalibrating

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
this Nautica has a screw down crown so I

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.560 
this Nautica has a screw down crown so I
have<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.770> unscrew<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.610> first

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
stop and move those hands out of the way

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:02.390 
stop and move those hands out of the way
right<00:01:54.610> let's<00:01:55.610> move<00:01:56.180> on

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.840 

right<00:02:03.000> there

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
right there

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.590 
right there
now<00:02:06.820> in<00:02:07.820> order<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.679> change<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.130> date<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.640> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
now in order to change the date on the

now in order to change the date on the
six<00:02:12.170> o'clock<00:02:12.320> subtile<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.670> go<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:15.320> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
six o'clock subtile I have to go to the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.690 
six o'clock subtile I have to go to the
first<00:02:15.709> click<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:18.820> rotate<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.850> crown

first click and then rotate the crown

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.280 
first click and then rotate the crown
you<00:02:22.700> can<00:02:22.880> hear<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.270> clicking

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.460 

and<00:02:29.409> I<00:02:29.980> can<00:02:30.190> choose<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:31.239> date

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.910 

now<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:39.300> difference<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.320> watch<00:02:40.650> is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
now the difference about this watch is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.650 
now the difference about this watch is
that<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.400> even<00:02:43.190> have<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.550> crown<00:02:45.060> screwed

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that I can even have the crown screwed

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.740 
that I can even have the crown screwed
in<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.160> be<00:02:47.160> able<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.400> calibrate<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
in and be able to calibrate the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.700 
in and be able to calibrate the
chronograph<00:02:49.490> first<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.670> all<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.780> press

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
chronograph first of all I have to press

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.100 
chronograph first of all I have to press
and<00:02:52.920> hold<00:02:53.160> both<00:02:54.170> pushers<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:56.240> then<00:02:57.240> both

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and hold both pushers and then both

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.340 
and hold both pushers and then both
hands<00:02:58.440> will<00:02:58.710> do<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.880> quick<00:03:00.300> sweep<00:03:00.690> all<00:03:00.960> around

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
hands will do a quick sweep all around

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:13.480 
hands will do a quick sweep all around
the<00:03:01.500> dial

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.750 

okay<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.560> now<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:16.310> recalibrate<00:03:18.550> then<00:03:19.550> I'm

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
okay and now I can recalibrate then I'm

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.020 
okay and now I can recalibrate then I'm
