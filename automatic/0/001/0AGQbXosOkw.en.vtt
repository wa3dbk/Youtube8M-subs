00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
other guys but I would show you a little

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.360 
other guys but I would show you a little
bit<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.850> concept<00:00:03.210> i've<00:00:03.389> been<00:00:03.510> working<00:00:03.840> on

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
bit of a concept i've been working on

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.710 
bit of a concept i've been working on
just<00:00:05.370> recorded<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.850> whole<00:00:06.029> tutorial<00:00:06.330> on<00:00:06.569> how<00:00:06.600> to

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
just recorded a whole tutorial on how to

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.230 
just recorded a whole tutorial on how to
do<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.109> thing<00:00:08.570> and<00:00:09.570> then<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.870> realized<00:00:10.710> I

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
do this thing and then I realized I

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.370 
do this thing and then I realized I
didn't<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.480> right<00:00:12.630> version<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.139> traps

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
didn't have the right version of traps

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.110 
didn't have the right version of traps
I'd<00:00:13.559> like<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> trial<00:00:14.130> version<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.910> whatever

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I'd like the trial version for whatever

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240 
I'd like the trial version for whatever
reason<00:00:15.480> running<00:00:15.750> instead<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.859> got<00:00:17.010> like<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
reason running instead so I got like the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760 
reason running instead so I got like the
first<00:00:17.400> 30<00:00:17.640> seconds<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.270> then<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.560> pooped<00:00:19.560> out

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
first 30 seconds and then it pooped out

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.359 
first 30 seconds and then it pooped out
so<00:00:20.189> we're<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.490> try<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.670> again<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
so we're going to try this again so I

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.529 
so we're going to try this again so I
don't<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> make<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.880> exact<00:00:24.240> same

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
don't want to make the exact same

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.929 
don't want to make the exact same
structure<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.350> i<00:00:25.410> think<00:00:25.710> i<00:00:25.830> have<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.789> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
structure but i think i have to just to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.960 
structure but i think i have to just to
make<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> bit<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:29.789> i

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
make it you know see them a bit and i

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.400 
make it you know see them a bit and i
think<00:00:30.210> i'll<00:00:30.300> be<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> exact<00:00:30.750> same<00:00:30.900> thing<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.349> i

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
think i'll be the exact same thing so i

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.900 
think i'll be the exact same thing so i
think<00:00:31.470> i'll<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> different<00:00:32.700> little

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
think i'll do when you different little

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.810 
think i'll do when you different little
out<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.390> same<00:00:33.780> house<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.820> different

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
out the same house for like a different

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.959 
out the same house for like a different
angle<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.480> guess<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.579> idea<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.879> you're

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
angle I guess so the idea is you're

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.400 
angle I guess so the idea is you're
going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> three<00:00:39.899> block<00:00:40.110> gap

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
going to want to have a three block gap

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.180 
going to want to have a three block gap
in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.129> little<00:00:41.370> will<00:00:41.969> fly<00:00:43.309> buzzing<00:00:44.309> around<00:00:44.340> me

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
in the little will fly buzzing around me

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.240 
in the little will fly buzzing around me
we're<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:50.070> is

want to get the you know normal things
in<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:22.729> you're<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> be

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

in like this then you're going to be
going<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:28.850> now<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.150> will

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
going with this here now what this will

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.760 
going with this here now what this will
do<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.479> it'll<00:01:30.750> make<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> almost<00:01:31.200> look<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
do is it'll make it almost look like the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.300 
do is it'll make it almost look like the
center<00:01:32.310> part<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.850> sinking<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
center part is sinking in to make it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.350 
center part is sinking in to make it
look<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.549> bit<00:01:35.579> more<00:01:35.939> uh<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:37.700> guess<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:39.000> very

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
look a bit more uh I guess not very

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.710 
look a bit more uh I guess not very
sturdy<00:01:40.140> anyway<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.970> must<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
sturdy anyway this must be like one of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.030 
sturdy anyway this must be like one of
the<00:01:42.810> more<00:01:42.930> basic<00:01:43.079> ones<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.740> we're<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the more basic ones so we're going to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.789 
the more basic ones so we're going to
want<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> nice<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.670> swap<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.530> only<00:01:46.710> going

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
want it nice and swap so it's only going

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.789 
want it nice and swap so it's only going
to<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.590> roof<00:01:49.590> or

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to go up to but then the roof or

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.700 
to go up to but then the roof or
whatever<00:01:50.040> because<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.610> kind<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> pointed

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
whatever because that's kind of pointed

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.469 
whatever because that's kind of pointed
it'll<00:01:52.710> actually<00:01:52.860> create<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> lot<00:01:53.640> more<00:01:53.850> area<00:01:54.299> on

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it'll actually create a lot more area on

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.109 
it'll actually create a lot more area on
the<00:01:54.630> inside<00:01:54.659> than<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.590> seem<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:57.090> know

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the inside than it would seem you know

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.880 
the inside than it would seem you know
it<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.509> go<00:01:57.659> into<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> hut<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.680> lot

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
it can go into the hut and it's a lot

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.120 
it can go into the hut and it's a lot
more<00:01:59.100> open<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.090> guess<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:01.950> you'd

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
more open I guess then what you'd

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.480 
more open I guess then what you'd

murloc<00:02:24.520> cuts<00:02:24.790> i<00:02:26.760> think<00:02:27.760> there<00:02:27.940> was<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.560> not<00:02:29.560> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
murloc cuts i think there was a not a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.620 
murloc cuts i think there was a not a
mod<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.220> i<00:02:30.310> think<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.580> was<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.760> custom<00:02:31.270> map<00:02:31.450> but

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
mod but i think it was a custom map but

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.900 
mod but i think it was a custom map but
i<00:02:31.660> like<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.840> play<00:02:32.290> as<00:02:32.350> them<00:02:32.650> where<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.640> had<00:02:33.880> to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
i like it play as them where you had to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.690 
i like it play as them where you had to
uh<00:02:34.240> i<00:02:34.860> think<00:02:35.860> they're<00:02:36.130> equivalent<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.580> like

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
uh i think they're equivalent of like

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.220 
uh i think they're equivalent of like
the<00:02:36.940> farms<00:02:37.390> was<00:02:38.670> summer<00:02:39.670> lock<00:02:39.970> hut<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.900> it's

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
the farms was summer lock hut and it's

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.520 
the farms was summer lock hut and it's
the<00:02:41.410> big<00:02:41.620> one<00:02:41.650> which<00:02:42.130> was<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.460> cheats<00:02:42.730> hut<00:02:42.970> and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
the big one which was the cheats hut and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.750 
the big one which was the cheats hut and
that<00:02:44.530> was<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.770> one<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.070> could<00:02:45.190> spawn<00:02:45.520> on

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
that was the one that you could spawn on

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.990 
that was the one that you could spawn on
the<00:02:45.880> night<00:02:46.030> stalkers<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.640> yeah<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.820> wasn't

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
the night stalkers and yeah that wasn't

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.810 
the night stalkers and yeah that wasn't
that<00:02:49.240> when<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.540> was<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.900> donna<00:02:50.890> but<00:02:51.730> i

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
that when that was the donna but i

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.160 
that when that was the donna but i
remember<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> cool<00:02:52.300> part<00:02:52.510> about<00:02:52.540> them<00:02:52.810> was<00:02:52.990> he

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
remember the cool part about them was he

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.840 
remember the cool part about them was he
could<00:02:53.350> only<00:02:53.440> build<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.890> water<00:02:55.230> was<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.850> thing

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
could only build on water was the thing

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.710 
could only build on water was the thing
with<00:02:58.030> them<00:02:58.240> like<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.600> couldn't<00:02:58.900> build<00:02:59.200> on

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
with them like you couldn't build on

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.980 
with them like you couldn't build on
land<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:02.020> had<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.410> build<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.830> water<00:03:03.100> I

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
land you had to build in the water I

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.960 
land you had to build in the water I
think<00:03:04.990> this<00:03:05.110> was<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> mod<00:03:05.590> bug<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:06.280> mean<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:06.850> know

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
think this was a mod bug I mean I know

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.520 
think this was a mod bug I mean I know
it<00:03:07.150> wasn't<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.480> fall<00:03:07.750> dress<00:03:07.990> but<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.230> think<00:03:08.440> it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
it wasn't it a fall dress but I think it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.850 
it wasn't it a fall dress but I think it
was<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.650> mod<00:03:09.010> not<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> custom<00:03:09.880> map<00:03:10.770> actually<00:03:11.770> I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
was a mod not a custom map actually I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.740 
was a mod not a custom map actually I
know<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.040> mean<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.400> think<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.670> was<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.790> map<00:03:13.060> for<00:03:13.510> it

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
know I mean I think it was a map for it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.540 
know I mean I think it was a map for it
where<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.170> played<00:03:14.380> as<00:03:14.560> them<00:03:14.770> almost<00:03:15.250> like<00:03:15.460> a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
where you played as them almost like a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.780 
where you played as them almost like a
campaign-style<00:03:16.000> thing<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.280> once<00:03:18.520> you<00:03:18.670> have

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
campaign-style thing is so once you have

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.850 
campaign-style thing is so once you have
that<00:03:18.820> done<00:03:19.290> there<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.380> go<00:03:20.530> there's<00:03:20.800> your

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
that done there you go there's your

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.830 
that done there you go there's your

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
will do is it'll create a lot more like

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.010 
will do is it'll create a lot more like
a<00:03:34.210> sleek<00:03:34.630> look<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.410> top<00:03:35.800> part<00:03:36.840> then<00:03:37.840> you're

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
a sleek look the top part then you're

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.300 
a sleek look the top part then you're
going<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.170> want<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.380> go<00:03:38.440> ahead<00:03:38.530> put<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:38.980> fence

there and your ghost own the whole

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.120 
there and your ghost own the whole
concept<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.870> these<00:03:44.020> guys<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.440> think<00:03:44.680> good<00:03:44.890> one

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
concept of these guys I think good one

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.030 
concept of these guys I think good one
would<00:03:45.340> look<00:03:45.459> here<00:03:45.700> with<00:03:45.850> these<00:03:45.970> they<00:03:46.209> have<00:03:46.450> a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
would look here with these they have a

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.370 
would look here with these they have a
glowstone<00:03:48.040> because<00:03:48.520> I<00:03:48.970> know<00:03:49.420> it's<00:03:49.660> purple<00:03:50.050> the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
glowstone because I know it's purple the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
glowstone because I know it's purple the
swamp<00:03:51.000> biomes<00:03:52.000> with<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:52.540> pack<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.930> purple<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
swamp biomes with this pack of purple it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.590 
swamp biomes with this pack of purple it
somehow<00:03:54.970> makes<00:03:55.360> some<00:03:55.600> solution<00:03:57.300> anyway<00:03:58.300> then

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
somehow makes some solution anyway then

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.980 
somehow makes some solution anyway then
to<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:58.990> thing<00:03:59.290> you'd<00:03:59.440> go<00:03:59.850> this<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:01.780> want

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
to this thing you'd go this you want

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
support it looks a bit better when

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.840 
support it looks a bit better when
you're<00:04:42.199> up<00:04:42.380> here<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:42.979> like<00:04:43.010> makes<00:04:43.370> more<00:04:43.610> sense

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
you're up here it like makes more sense

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.420 
you're up here it like makes more sense
to<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.449> mean<00:04:45.320> when<00:04:45.470> you're<00:04:45.590> like<00:04:45.740> far<00:04:46.100> away<00:04:46.130> and

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
to I mean when you're like far away and

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.340 
to I mean when you're like far away and
you<00:04:46.520> look<00:04:46.669> at<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:47.180> think<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:47.960> looks<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.229> bit

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
you look at it I think it looks a bit

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.580 
you look at it I think it looks a bit
better<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:50.300> like<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:51.080> know<00:04:51.229> when<00:04:51.380> you're<00:04:51.500> up

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
better but like you know when you're up

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.260 
better but like you know when you're up
close<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:52.040> looks<00:04:52.070> a<00:04:52.280> bit<00:04:52.400> awkward<00:04:52.550> some<00:04:52.970> are<00:04:53.090> we

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
close it looks a bit awkward some are we

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.450 
close it looks a bit awkward some are we
sure<00:04:54.370> anyway<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.430> finish<00:04:56.030> things<00:04:56.210> up<00:04:57.460> I'm

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
sure anyway to finish things up I'm

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.930 
sure anyway to finish things up I'm
going<00:04:58.639> to<00:04:58.729> go<00:04:58.910> ahead<00:04:58.940> throw<00:04:59.270> down<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.660> door

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.280 
throw down a little law bed local issues
yeah<00:05:06.800> it's<00:05:07.040> not<00:05:07.190> just<00:05:08.650> one<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.770> these<00:05:11.290> probably

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
yeah it's not just one of these probably

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.400 
yeah it's not just one of these probably
wouldn't<00:05:12.500> have<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.620> pope<00:05:12.800> case<00:05:13.100> maybe<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:14.030> this

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
wouldn't have a pope case maybe to this

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.529 
wouldn't have a pope case maybe to this
the<00:05:15.410> cool<00:05:15.560> part<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.830> this<00:05:15.979> actually<00:05:16.360> get<00:05:17.360> for

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
the cool part is this actually get for

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.700 
the cool part is this actually get for
unseeable<00:05:17.960> from<00:05:18.350> like<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.710> wall<00:05:20.470> then<00:05:21.470> like

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
unseeable from like the wall then like

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.920 
unseeable from like the wall then like
that<00:05:21.979> because<00:05:22.910> that<00:05:23.180> actually<00:05:23.300> it's<00:05:23.750> like<00:05:23.900> a

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
that because that actually it's like a

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.469 
that because that actually it's like a
different<00:05:24.080> look<00:05:24.440> than<00:05:24.500> that<00:05:25.150> one<00:05:26.150> thing<00:05:26.360> I've

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
different look than that one thing I've

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.770 
different look than that one thing I've
actually<00:05:26.660> was<00:05:27.110> thinking<00:05:27.139> of<00:05:27.740> doing<00:05:28.780> haven't

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
actually was thinking of doing haven't

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.590 
actually was thinking of doing haven't
checked<00:05:30.200> this<00:05:30.320> out<00:05:30.500> yet<00:05:30.710> but<00:05:30.770> I<00:05:31.010> was<00:05:31.160> thinking

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
checked this out yet but I was thinking

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.520 
checked this out yet but I was thinking
maybe<00:05:32.979> for<00:05:33.979> like<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.400> innermost<00:05:35.289> planks<00:05:36.289> we

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
maybe for like the innermost planks we

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.700 
maybe for like the innermost planks we
could<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.889> could<00:05:37.130> do<00:05:37.280> like<00:05:37.580> this<00:05:38.350> possibly<00:05:39.350> I

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
could I could do like this possibly I

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.350 
could I could do like this possibly I
don't<00:05:40.340> know<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.430> dad's<00:05:40.700> I<00:05:40.910> think<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.180> bit<00:05:41.330> more

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
don't know a dad's I think a bit more

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:49.480 
don't know a dad's I think a bit more
depth<00:05:41.810> in<00:05:42.160> here<00:05:43.720> or<00:05:44.720> maybe<00:05:45.110> up<00:05:45.470> here<00:05:48.099> like<00:05:49.099> you

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
depth in here or maybe up here like you

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.219 
depth in here or maybe up here like you
know<00:05:49.580> for<00:05:49.820> like<00:05:49.940> decoration<00:05:50.599> or<00:05:50.660> whatever<00:05:50.960> may

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
know for like decoration or whatever may

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:57.339 
know for like decoration or whatever may
be<00:05:51.289> up<00:05:51.530> here<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:56.120> then<00:05:56.389> keep<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:56.930> like<00:05:57.200> the

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
be up here and then keep this like the

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.700 
be up here and then keep this like the
dark<00:05:57.590> wood<00:05:57.650> not<00:05:58.250> really<00:05:58.490> sure<00:05:59.500> that<00:06:00.500> looks

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
dark wood not really sure that looks

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.960 
dark wood not really sure that looks
nice<00:06:00.919> I<00:06:01.160> guess<00:06:01.190> that's<00:06:01.970> some<00:06:02.240> more<00:06:02.419> variety<00:06:03.970> so

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
nice I guess that's some more variety so

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.260 
nice I guess that's some more variety so
