00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.299
 so hello everybody often asked 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.850
 and most recently for me it was 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.279
 question and secret how to create your 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 affiliate program on u tube which 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.529
 will take channel and pay money 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.380
 for advertising information was very 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:34.410
 difficult therefore I understand that a lot 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.600
 People have generally there who honestly 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.420
 I wondered what we try 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.550
 understand everything well, in fact, you can 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 select only two ways to create 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.840
 network first is creating your own 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.879
 network account cns official 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.969
 as if the application for the creation of medycyny 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.879
 via youtube applications for receipt 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.149
 idi content you can find here 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.550
 complete and accordingly there but how 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.100
 practice shows get it very 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.229
 everything is complicated youtube careful weeds out 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.510
 wanting to build their network and basically 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.850
 trust only corporations ie 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.490
 media networks create large companies 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.520
 having exclusive content and which 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.290
 want to protect him also important 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.229
 factor is your starting capital 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.509
 and here we are talking about a lot of money 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.549
 move more budget and more precisely 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.100
 Essentially a free way to create a network 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.619
 which you might be interested in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.439
 creation under networks or how else 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.509
 call the network itself and another company 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.229
 which can provide these services 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.310
 for example, the bentpixels brown band Seveso 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.420
 network volt rati and many others 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.180
 some links you can see in 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.520
 the description is well, but not exactly now 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.049
 Most of which I could collect as 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 rule such companies require 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.490
 number of views in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.560
 generally about 100 thousand per month 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.860
 my experience I will say that now 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.229
 Unclear reasons many of these media 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.840
 networks or rather almost everything in my 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.509
 whom I wrote answered me that not 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.450
 create the most creative at the moment but 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.450
 some just didn't even answer 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.580
 I also know that many of them themselves. 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.370
 are themselves above the Turks fullscreen a and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.040
 other larger companies that 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.030
 I also answered the same full screen 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.959
 which does not create night cooking itself 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.230
 note that this is really 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.319
 serious work even if you are well 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.230
 you can somehow create a media network she 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.819
 requires a lot of new effort yes and 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.239
 most likely just to make you her 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.459
 It does not work out what if you still 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.130
 desire did not disappear you want to try 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.560
 create your network then look in the description 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.650
 video links to media networks that you 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.549
 can help in this matter well all 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.549
 good luck everyone bye
