00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
original GameCube controller from when I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.149 
original GameCube controller from when I
was<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.009> kid<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:45.140> 2004-2005<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> as

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
was a kid really like 2004-2005 and as

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.649 
was a kid really like 2004-2005 and as
you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.360> wire<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:50.119> not<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.360> long

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you can see the wire is not that long

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.020 
you can see the wire is not that long
it's<00:01:52.170> only<00:01:52.560> around<00:01:55.369> that's<00:01:56.369> how<00:01:56.579> long<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
it's only around that's how long it is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's only around that's how long it is
really<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.509> not<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.930> long<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.880> know<00:01:59.969> I'm

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
really it's not that long and I know I'm

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.020 
really it's not that long and I know I'm
not<00:02:00.840> holding<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.860> upright<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.460> anything<00:02:02.820> but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
not holding it upright or anything but

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.060 
not holding it upright or anything but
as<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.899> wire<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.350> much<00:02:04.740> shorter

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
as you can see the wire is much shorter

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.850 
as you can see the wire is much shorter
than<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:06.329> wire<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> believe<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.649> 9

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
than this wire I believe this is like 9

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.040 
than this wire I believe this is like 9
feet<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.459> 10<00:02:09.060> feet<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.450> something<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
feet or 10 feet or something and this is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.950 
feet or 10 feet or something and this is
around<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.410> 3<00:02:10.679> feet<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:12.050> really<00:02:13.050> useful<00:02:13.530> for

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
around like 3 feet so really useful for

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.260 
around like 3 feet so really useful for
tournaments<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.590> stuff<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.460> it's

instead<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.280> glue<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:28.300> Nintendo<00:03:28.750> uses

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
instead of the glue that Nintendo uses

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.900 
instead of the glue that Nintendo uses
now<00:03:29.200> which<00:03:29.410> actually<00:03:29.560> ruins<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.370> box<00:03:30.580> when

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
when you get into the box it's just like

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.660 
when you get into the box it's just like
this<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.490> just<00:03:36.640> pull<00:03:36.850> this<00:03:37.000> out<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:38.670> in

it's showing right here the Wii so it is

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.600 
it's showing right here the Wii so it is
a<00:03:57.790> this<00:03:58.540> did<00:03:58.750> come<00:03:58.960> out<00:03:58.990> around<00:03:59.380> like<00:03:59.560> 2008<00:04:00.190> or

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
so so that is pretty much where all this

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.430 
so so that is pretty much where all this
why<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:06.790> says<00:04:07.210> the<00:04:07.450> Wii<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.960> it's<00:04:08.290> not

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
why this says the Wii and it's not

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.400 
why this says the Wii and it's not
talking<00:04:08.650> about<00:04:08.800> GameCube<00:04:09.400> really<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:11.050> yeah

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
that's pretty much it and that's the
