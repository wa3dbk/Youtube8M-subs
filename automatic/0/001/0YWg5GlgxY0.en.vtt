00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.580
 Halli hello hello here's with let's 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.529
 play world of tanks time and with one 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.790
 kind of him yes how many of you know 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.650
 just dfv 304 artisow my personal 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.029
 hate opponents almost because they 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.680
 somehow always get on me 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.869
 one to shoot and those were beside it 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.860
 all modules and they are just like that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.480
 nerves meet everywhere 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.670
 that's why I did not even think why 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.370
 Let's play it played by 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.040
 Nerd's card is mine and here with 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.610
 his six species can also fight 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.750
 what to do octane gasoline has on the status 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.520
 even a bit faster 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.240
 the enemy is just so annoying one man 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.060
 Already sees swinging 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.030
 speed and then it has indeed 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.450
 really still take in the angle pants 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.960
 that can be too crass times 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.100
 he will look what he is going to tear here 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.799
 will definitely be here now 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:15.069
 directly on the island on top or on 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:16.899
 the plateau lc is cleared away here 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:20.049
 but now there are the first opponents 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:25.450
 and here you will let off steam like that 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:27.009
 450 bit crazy this one 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.369
 Quick reload the easy with you 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.369
 brings 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:44.259
 he clearly has not got that close 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:45.729
 but the t 29 maybe can 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.860
 you can already see the angle of the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.990
 is just so blatant here so far 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:58.869
 have behaved a little bit up 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:02.830
 well know now a bit now 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.740
 behave it remains as annoying 10 9 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.560
 20 80 then suddenly I do not want to 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:14.830
 more so now but has to be slow 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.989
 Maybe now, yes 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.989
 He only does 128 damage 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.260
 As I said it is just such a 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.260
 grenade launcher ristic 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.910
 he stays on the t 29 and 480 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.110
 damage 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.120
 The squirrel has a hard time feeding itself 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.490
 but you can easily see them 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.900
 speed once you focus 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.209
 a kind that is like the theme here 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.650
 and then you have the card and 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:50.209
 Now let's have a look at 200 radl 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.209
 Stitches that just hurt again and again 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.750
 if somebody forgot biggest make it so 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.670
 Now I'll leave then yes 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.989
 make her go 90 hp and his what 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.010
 now the market armor and so on 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.840
 take quickly 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.220
 it's just easy or panzer stands 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.570
 also nice sideways look something 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.350
 now dammed damagingly 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:24.290
 441 harm 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.290
 it hurts 250 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.319
 even a gm fall he comes here now 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.650
 not behind the or no 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.360
 shoot into the stone and now move 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.450
 had so octane petrol it, why 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.450
 Not 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:53.300
 ride around the 55 easy easy nimble 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.900
 The tiger is now operating 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.100
 take grain 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:01.610
 I guess exactly otherwise and on the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:06.070
 25 in his place I would be the title 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.070
 should take better on it 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:18.519
 tiger gets now so full a 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.150
 Zoom in and it should work out 11 8 his 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.620
 his collar width 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:29.800
 there is still a bit something open at the front 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.540
 audi is also very well connected again 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.960
 good advice is dear on who wants first 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.960
 go 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:47.260
 122 44 greek hits 71 it is 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.360
 rather too unfortunately first I would have to 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.210
 revealing 11 to 10 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.330
 It then makes Bleidenstadt behind the house 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.870
 well thought but there was not 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.870
 or not yet 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.740
 look at it 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.780
 Now imagine that is higher 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.370
 that's what we called it 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.010
 Although not a long reach but she is 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.380
 just as mobile and so variable too 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.060
 That 's just great for 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.490
 the us players play this for me 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.950
 not now because I do not like it that way 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:35.770
 e 25 offers itself formally 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:38.410
 now about 153 harm 11 2 11 angels 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.850
 number first is now so 100 dead 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.560
 pips landes is behind and is combing now 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.750
 must expect an inhibition otherwise it will 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.560
 nothing to 152 takes him out and now 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.560
 comes the hunting panther 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.569
 look but the starts up 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.559
 in fact, he can defend him 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:09.629
 try the side just once a him 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:19.999
 to give in the side exactly perfect 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:19.999
 so yes only now shoots old class 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:26.069
 thank you and goodbye 606 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:31.469
 hurt with a bullet that from this 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:35.429
 arti therefore with a long since already 1737 hp 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:38.629
 or damage to quick shot from the 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:41.909
 hips but unfortunately not here 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:44.939
 take her out like that and now last but not 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:48.119
 least lives only the search for 22 44 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:49.889
 It's also good and takes him 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:53.579
 actually takes him out 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.990
 when strauss made new damage in 2152 

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:56.849
 brutally fast round 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.339
 i know why i like the fans as an opponent 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.079
 Do not like to be a team if you take me 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.489
 I hope you like it now 

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:04.939
 you see an article up again 

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:04.939
 next time
