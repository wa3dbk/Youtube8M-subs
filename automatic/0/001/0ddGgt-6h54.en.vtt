Rondinella<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.790> mula<00:01:17.420> nara<00:01:17.720> they're<00:01:18.350> like

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
Rondinella and mula nara they're like

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.010 
Rondinella and mula nara they're like
four<00:01:19.400> sisters<00:01:19.939> in<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.210> sense<00:01:20.479> they<00:01:20.689> ripe<00:01:20.869> at

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
four sisters in the sense they ripe at

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260 
four sisters in the sense they ripe at
the<00:01:21.110> same<00:01:21.290> time<00:01:21.590> they<00:01:22.460> complete<00:01:22.909> each<00:01:22.939> other

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the same time they complete each other

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.649 
the same time they complete each other
there<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:23.750> actually<00:01:24.110> blend<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:25.040> together<00:01:25.369> in<00:01:25.850> to

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
there I actually blend it together in to

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.270 
there I actually blend it together in to
make<00:01:26.810> our<00:01:26.990> own<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:27.439> about<00:01:27.650> which<00:01:27.860> other<00:01:28.010> wines

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
make our own and about which other wines

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.789 
make our own and about which other wines
everyone<00:01:29.210> has<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.510> specific<00:01:30.170> characteristic

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
everyone has a specific characteristic

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.520 
everyone has a specific characteristic
so<00:01:31.310> Corvina<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.119> also<00:01:32.600> Corvin<00:01:32.990> own<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.350> gives

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
so Corvina and also Corvin own and gives

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.390 
so Corvina and also Corvin own and gives
a<00:01:33.680> lot<00:01:33.799> of<00:01:33.920> body<00:01:34.390> Rondinella<00:01:35.390> color<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.470> more

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
a lot of body Rondinella color and more

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.179 
a lot of body Rondinella color and more
Inara<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:38.420> kind<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.750> softness<00:01:39.409> gentlest<00:01:39.979> to

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
Inara that kind of softness gentlest to

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.580 
Inara that kind of softness gentlest to
the<00:01:40.280> wines<00:01:40.479> so<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.540> use<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.930> same<00:01:42.110> grapes<00:01:42.409> to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
the wines so you use the same grapes to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.530 
the wines so you use the same grapes to
make<00:01:42.740> these<00:01:42.890> two<00:01:43.340> lines<00:01:43.580> but<00:01:44.119> how<00:01:44.299> would<00:01:44.450> you

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
make these two lines but how would you

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.969 
make these two lines but how would you
describe<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.049> difference<00:01:45.409> between<00:01:45.500> your

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
describe the difference between your

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.219 
describe the difference between your
regular<00:01:46.579> Amarone<00:01:47.060> clásico<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:47.900> your<00:01:48.020> single

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
regular Amarone clásico and your single

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.990 
regular Amarone clásico and your single
vineyard<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.040> main<00:01:49.250> difference<00:01:49.280> is<00:01:49.939> in

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
vineyard so the main difference is in

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.149 
vineyard so the main difference is in
the<00:01:50.479> vineyards<00:01:50.960> where<00:01:51.259> we<00:01:51.409> source<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.890> grapes

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
the vineyards where we source the grapes

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
about five hectares of land it's

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.110 
about five hectares of land it's
actually<00:02:24.530> south-west<00:02:25.530> exposed<00:02:26.400> which<00:02:26.820> means

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
actually south-west exposed which means

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.820 
actually south-west exposed which means
that<00:02:27.270> any<00:02:27.510> way<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> Sun<00:02:28.020> shines<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.500> day<00:02:28.620> long

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
that any way the Sun shines all day long

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.090 
that any way the Sun shines all day long
it's<00:02:29.790> exposed<00:02:30.420> towards<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.260> lake<00:02:31.530> towards

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
it's exposed towards the lake towards

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.380 
it's exposed towards the lake towards
the<00:02:32.160> lake<00:02:32.340> garda<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.000> has<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> great

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the lake garda so it has a great

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.110 
the lake garda so it has a great
influence<00:02:34.100> getting<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> breeze<00:02:35.520> coming<00:02:36.000> from

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
influence getting the breeze coming from

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.540 
influence getting the breeze coming from
from<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.720> lake<00:02:36.840> itself<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.530> soil<00:02:38.400> is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
from the lake itself and the soil is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.030 
from the lake itself and the soil is
very<00:02:38.610> chalky<00:02:39.120> which<00:02:39.750> means<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.800> water

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
very chalky which means that the water

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.310 
very chalky which means that the water
drains<00:02:41.550> very<00:02:42.060> well<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.480> doesn't<00:02:42.630> stock<00:02:43.050> in<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
drains very well it doesn't stock in the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.900 
drains very well it doesn't stock in the
vineyard<00:02:43.680> which<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.610> quite

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
vineyard which is the and that is quite

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.690 
vineyard which is the and that is quite
quite<00:02:45.240> important<00:02:45.750> for<00:02:46.050> for<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.380> vines<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.490> I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
quite important for for the vines and I

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.310 
quite important for for the vines and I
understand<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.330> very<00:02:48.510> steep<00:02:48.780> vineyard<00:02:49.140> as

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
well a terraced Reynard yeah it's very

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.480 
well a terraced Reynard yeah it's very
steep<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:51.780> actually<00:02:52.200> cultivated<00:02:53.070> with<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
steep it's actually cultivated with the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.270 
steep it's actually cultivated with the
