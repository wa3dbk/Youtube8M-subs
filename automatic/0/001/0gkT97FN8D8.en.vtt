00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 you are a woman you are young this strike 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.280
 I do not know what is due to attend all your qualities of being in your alma mater 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.360
 and being able to have ump estartega attend a post where it represents a lot 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.189
 better than the best would like to be in that place 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.210
 despite the fact that they lack new and thus stop or act 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.619
 by jenny go to alma mater and see them completely transformed as not 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.079
 it said 'rodrigo a while ago 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.609
 we had to these facilities and unhappy and for the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.469
 students because they have the privilege of being in one at a konerko university 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.460
 section II very high but also with first class facilities 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.240
 Second, well, well, let me tell you that I do feel in a great 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.470
 responsibility because being a woman and young 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.540
 we put together two aspects that are important and that we have not felt 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.900
 a little dribble 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.950
 uprooted from what is the political work and then to us we 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.020
 is giving us the opportunity we are looking for 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.930
 a lot because it also tells you that it was not easy to have the opportunity 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.040
 a lot and today what we have to do this 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.940
 that commitment and that responsibility to have her the opportunity to contend 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.300
 for a mayoralty and then having the mayor's office is not a reason for 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.100
 of some in some sense mario garcÃ­a the work that we are 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.380
 making the idea is that we work 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.000
 I am a woman who is trying hard for what, in the case of the municipality of Escobedo 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.730
 be a world-class municipality a municipality that has representativeness to 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.850
 state level and at the country level and that with that representativeness 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 represent the Escobedenses with dignity 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.570
 cohan the main aspect is that we are young that are women give them 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.290
 opportunities for women like there was at the time someone who did not 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.890
 us and what and why we are here today and give opportunity to the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.250
 young people as at the time there was someone who gives us an opportunity and that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.780
 we have to pay and I think the best way is to pay it is to pay it is to give 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.920
 comfort unite young people were already women we talked briefly 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.230
 p especially fighting to get to the position you're debating 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.470
 today jolie right exit and I went to alan jara to the pri 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.950
 15 months ago on the list and then I went to work and left the address 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.759

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.999
 Assistant to the legal director and is a graduate of law school 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.959

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.079
 with work 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.159
 the power to raise in that same one between year more the legal director of the art 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.429
 the municipal government 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.699
 the next three years I was again legal director by eta on his website 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.439
 five years of legal director of the municipality 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.659
 later it went up to be secret environmental entity in the same municipality after 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.659
 I went percent and deputy hours today currently put local with with 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.999
 license to run for mayor 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.709
 and good with a commitment to a purely municipal race 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.939
 was with the belief precisely of the institution that is the municipality with the 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.150
 work and the commitment with the people of Puebla that I felt part of 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.120
 of that effort transformation because escobedo is different than 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.129
