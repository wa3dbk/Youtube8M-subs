00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
thought I was going to do the same thing

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.760

them so dog gave me no warning and it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.649 
them so dog gave me no warning and it
would<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.310> seemed<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.729> dog<00:01:39.030> attacked<00:01:39.450> me

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
would have seemed like dog attacked me

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.660 
would have seemed like dog attacked me
for<00:01:39.840> no<00:01:39.900> reason<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> dog<00:01:41.130> had<00:01:41.340> every

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
for no reason but the dog had every

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
for no reason but the dog had every
reason<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> world<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.689> attack<00:01:43.079> me<00:01:43.290> he

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
reason in the world to attack me he

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.710 
reason in the world to attack me he
thought<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> same

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
thought that I was going to do the same

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
thought that I was going to do the same
thing<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> dog's<00:01:46.890> mind<00:01:47.220> he<00:01:47.700> probably

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
thing and in the dog's mind he probably

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.420 
thing and in the dog's mind he probably
thought<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.329> was<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.810> kill<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
thought I was there to kill because the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.950 
thought I was there to kill because the
last<00:01:50.610> guy<00:01:50.850> was<00:01:50.880> cutting<00:01:51.270> off<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> dogs<00:01:51.720> air

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
last guy was cutting off the dogs air

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.039 
last guy was cutting off the dogs air
supply<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:53.189> he<00:01:53.220> did<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.610> suppress<00:01:54.329> some

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
supply so all he did was suppress some

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
supply so all he did was suppress some
important<00:01:55.560> behaviors<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> didn't<00:01:56.939> deal

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
important behaviors but it didn't deal

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.359 
important behaviors but it didn't deal
with<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.420> underlying<00:01:57.740> problem<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:59.159> was

with the underlying problem which was

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.499 
with the underlying problem which was
dog<00:01:59.670> had<00:01:59.969> some<00:02:00.540> anger<00:02:00.840> issues<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.270> that's<00:02:03.270> why

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
dog had some anger issues and that's why

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.940 
dog had some anger issues and that's why
you<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:03.930> careful<00:02:04.200> when<00:02:04.770> you're<00:02:04.890> using

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you have to be careful when you're using

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
you have to be careful when you're using
negative<00:02:05.399> reinforcement<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
negative reinforcement because if you

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.779 
negative reinforcement because if you
think<00:02:06.780> you're<00:02:07.530> dealing<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.160> behavior<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
think you're dealing with the behavior a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.859 
think you're dealing with the behavior a
lot<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> times<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.509> just

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
lot of times you're just

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.750 
lot of times you're just
pressing<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.519> come<00:02:11.670> out

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
pressing it and it's going to come out

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.820 
pressing it and it's going to come out
with<00:02:11.940> other<00:02:12.000> places<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.349> dog<00:02:13.560> has<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
with other places so if a dog has a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.759 
with other places so if a dog has a
barking<00:02:14.370> problem<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.140> we<00:02:16.140> start<00:02:16.409> to<00:02:16.500> give<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
barking problem and we start to give the

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.710 
barking problem and we start to give the
dog<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.159> zap<00:02:17.489> with<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.000> electronic<00:02:18.510> collar

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
dog and zap with the electronic collar

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.130 
dog and zap with the electronic collar
every<00:02:19.049> time<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> dog<00:02:19.500> barks<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:21.000> may<00:02:21.299> stop<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
every time the dog barks it may stop the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.259 
every time the dog barks it may stop the
parking<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.099> behavior<00:02:23.580> may<00:02:23.760> resurface

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
parking but the behavior may resurface

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.740 
parking but the behavior may resurface
someplace<00:02:24.900> else<00:02:25.230> now<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.920> dog<00:02:26.250> has<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:27.690> you

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
someplace else now the dog has if you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.360 
someplace else now the dog has if you
haven't<00:02:27.900> dealt<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.379> underlying<00:02:28.650> reason

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
haven't dealt with the underlying reason

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.819 
haven't dealt with the underlying reason
okay<00:02:29.970> if<00:02:30.269> it's<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.720> vocal<00:02:31.140> behavior<00:02:31.560> it's<00:02:31.709> no

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
okay if it's just vocal behavior it's no

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.229 
okay if it's just vocal behavior it's no
big<00:02:32.010> deal<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.459> there's<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.670> reason<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
big deal but if there's a reason the

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.149 
big deal but if there's a reason the
dogs<00:02:33.420> barking<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:35.360> you're<00:02:36.360> suppressing<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
dogs barking and you're suppressing it

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.470 
dogs barking and you're suppressing it
so<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.250> behavior<00:02:38.610> maybe<00:02:38.730> come<00:02:38.970> off<00:02:39.120> somewhere

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
so the behavior maybe come off somewhere

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.420 
so the behavior maybe come off somewhere
else<00:02:39.690> dog<00:02:40.200> may<00:02:40.409> start<00:02:40.650> digging<00:02:41.010> me<00:02:41.159> start

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
else dog may start digging me start

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.250 
else dog may start digging me start
chewing<00:02:41.670> lot<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.660> times<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.959> see<00:02:43.140> in

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
chewing lot of times you see in

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.229 
chewing lot of times you see in
destructive<00:02:43.620> behavior<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.819> thing<00:02:45.030> we

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
destructive behavior so the thing we

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.970 
destructive behavior so the thing we
have<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.599> remember<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:46.230> understand<00:02:46.799> when

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
have to remember and understand when

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.860 
have to remember and understand when
we're<00:02:47.099> training<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.519> dog<00:02:47.549> is<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.480> we<00:02:48.569> have<00:02:48.720> to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
we're training a dog is that we have to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.229 
we're training a dog is that we have to
deal<00:02:48.900> with<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> underlying<00:02:49.849> problem<00:02:50.849> we

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
deal with the underlying problem we

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.690 
deal with the underlying problem we
can't<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:51.840> put<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> choke<00:02:52.560> collar<00:02:52.700> electronic

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
can't just put a choke collar electronic

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.240 
can't just put a choke collar electronic
collar<00:02:53.930> upon<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.109> prong<00:02:55.379> collar<00:02:55.709> on<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:55.980> and

collar upon a prong collar on it and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.640 
collar upon a prong collar on it and
just<00:02:56.280> correct<00:02:56.879> it<00:02:57.090> until<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> stops<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:58.530> have

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
just correct it until it stops we have

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.649 
just correct it until it stops we have
to<00:02:58.769> deal<00:02:58.920> with<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.129> underlying<00:02:59.280> problem<00:03:00.120> now

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
to deal with the underlying problem now

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.750 
to deal with the underlying problem now
at<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:00.989> point<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.440> may<00:03:01.590> be<00:03:01.650> thinking<00:03:01.920> this

at this point you may be thinking this

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.710 
at this point you may be thinking this
guy<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.000> one<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.540> those<00:03:03.659> left<00:03:04.379> wing<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:05.370> need

to<00:03:30.000> understand<00:03:30.419> before<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.709> use<00:03:31.919> punishment

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
to understand before you use punishment

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:33.770 
to understand before you use punishment
