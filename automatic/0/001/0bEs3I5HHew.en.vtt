instant<00:00:35.460> diamonds<00:00:35.820> actually<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> really

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
instant diamonds actually is a really

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.619 
instant diamonds actually is a really
really<00:00:36.899> nice<00:00:37.280> seed<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.430> general<00:00:38.790> has<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.239> think

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
really nice seed in general has I think

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.590 
really nice seed in general has I think
it<00:00:39.719> has<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.020> four<00:00:40.350> villages<00:00:41.390> villagers<00:00:42.390> know

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it has like four villages villagers know

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.490 
it has like four villages villagers know
MPC<00:00:43.290> villages<00:00:43.739> mmm<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:45.090> two<00:00:45.420> separate<00:00:45.989> jungle

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
MPC villages mmm has two separate jungle

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.029 
MPC villages mmm has two separate jungle
biomes<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:46.980> well<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.500> there<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.710> or

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
biomes as well and there you can see or

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.819 
biomes as well and there you can see or
buy<00:00:50.250> gas<00:00:50.489> six<00:00:51.090> diamonds<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.230> chest<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
buy gas six diamonds in one chest I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
buy gas six diamonds in one chest I
think<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:53.309> quite<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> lot<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.149> honest

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
think that's quite a lot to be honest

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
think that's quite a lot to be honest
six<00:00:55.140> diamonds<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:55.920> off<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> bat

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
six diamonds you know right off the bat

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
six diamonds you know right off the bat
I<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.270> literally<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> take<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.379> like

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I think like literally it take you like

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860 
I think like literally it take you like
a<00:00:58.530> minute<00:00:58.920> till<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.340> sprint<00:00:59.730> there<00:00:59.910> from<00:01:00.719> where

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
a minute till to sprint there from where

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
a minute till to sprint there from where
you<00:01:00.960> spawned<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.559> yeah<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.670> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you spawned and yeah I really think it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.870 
you spawned and yeah I really think it
is<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> worth<00:01:03.629> worthwhile<00:01:04.379> seed<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.640> honest

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
is a worth worthwhile seed to be honest

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.149 
is a worth worthwhile seed to be honest
I'd<00:01:05.970> probably<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> seed<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.320> let's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I'd probably use the seed as my let's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.600 
I'd probably use the seed as my let's
play<00:01:08.220> seed<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.090> wasn't<00:01:09.299> already<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.320> know

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
play seed if I wasn't already you know

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.390 
play seed if I wasn't already you know
but<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.330> let's<00:01:12.510> play<00:01:12.720> already<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.830> yeah
