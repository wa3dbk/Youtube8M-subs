 we are responsible for those who tamed this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.910
 the phrase is the best fit to the topic 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.849
 of our plot because you have an animal 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.830
 very simple but it is important that he was behind and 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.110
 proper care statistics everyone 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.360
 third pets observed itching and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.340
 allergic reactions how to help 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.869
 will tell our expert in recent years 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 pet court problem 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 acquired satisfied and significant scale 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.560
 daily veterinary clinic 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.269
 pet owners turn on 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.279
 cause itching with half 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.500
 holders presupposes that its 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.989
 pet food allergy 2 smelter 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.660
 scales categorically denies this 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.210
 opportunity let's see why 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.239
 the animal can itch the most important 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.370
 the reason is a reaction to saliva blog second 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.890
 the reason is the presence of ticks which 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 parasitic inside the skin is the third option 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.610
 is it the presence of a bacterial or 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.190
 fungal inflammation on the skin in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.170
 most cases, bacteria and fungi are not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 is the root cause of the disease but 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 may complicate it for the next 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.729
 option is a reaction to substances 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.290
 environment reaction to food and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.780
 endocrine diseases 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.420
 today we will talk about you 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.880
 allergies the most common type of allergy 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.530
 reaction to the scene unit at the same time during 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.540
 animal inspection 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.540
 no parasites on it, you can not 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.299
 detect but enough 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.670
 single bite 1 bad separation rides 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.740
 so that the sound is constant when 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.409
 this is for some of the allergic reaction 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.939
 develop others do not it depends on 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.310
 like your own immune system 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.280
 animal 2 by prevalence 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.640
 causes of allergies is a reaction to substances 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.649
 environment such as pollen 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.020
 house dust human epidermis first 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.000
 signs of this type of allergy manifest 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.970
 quite young animals 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.010
 age from 10 months to 3 years 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 it is the most difficult type and allergies 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.730
 diagnostic and therapeutic point of view 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.770
 because in order for an animal 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.050
 cure must be completely eliminated 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.730
 his contact with allergens in practice 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.620
 it is not possible 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.630
 so animals are forced to life 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.240
 be on treatment the third and the most 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.979
 rare type of allergy this reaction to food 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.260
 among pet owners 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450
 there is an erroneous opinion that if 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.790
 the animal consumes the same 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.590
 time he for a long time then 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.810
 it can not cause allergic 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.520
 reactions this is wrong because for 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 development of allergy requires quite 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.620
 for a long time how to put eat 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.660
 diagnosis is made by the exclusion method for 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.660
 order to differentiate one reason 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.300
 another is required on average from 3 to 12 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.850
 weeks sometimes diagnostics are delayed 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.950
 stupid year so owners with studied 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.990
 and pets should be patient and 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.700
 wait for a lie to make a diagnosis and 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.010
 cure his animal for 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.990
 one or two days to start should 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.450
 eliminate the most common cause 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.040
 parasitic allergies and make sure 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.620
 the absence of bacterial and fungus 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.570
 skin inflammation for this animal 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.090
 processed from god several times with 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.040
 intervals of two or three weeks birch blocks 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.190
 skin scraping to eliminate 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.050
 the presence of intradermal mites and are selected 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.730
 samples for bacteriological in 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.920
 environmental research 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.010
 when exclusion parasitic causes 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.650
 go to the diagnosis of the reaction to food 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.570
 for this you can use special 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.120
 hypoallergenic feed or cook 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.430
 animal and mind themselves in the diet should 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.530
 present only one type of protein and 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.870
 one kind of carbohydrate draw your attention 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.970
 on the fact that the protein should be the one that 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.840
 animal for life and consumes no 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.569
 once 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.370
 the duration of the diet is from 8 to 12 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.680
 weeks at the same time during this period is very 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.810
 it is important to comply with all doctor's instructions and 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.690
 do not give the animal any other food 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.819
 if the time was excluded and the Smith diet 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.830
 passed then conducts provocation gives 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.870
 the animal that feed that used to 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.299
 this and tear for two weeks 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.620
 back then diagnosis is allergic to 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.459
 components thousands considered 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.410
 confirmed 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.420
 if on the same diet itching does not 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.700
 returns means the diagnosis was 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.310
 set incorrectly when excluded 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.440
 parasitic causes and reactions printed 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.420
 there is only one option with reactions 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.390
 environmental substances unfortunately 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.250
 this kind of allergy does not respond to treatment and 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.450
 control symptoms will have to 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.000
 life on using the application 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.410
 anti-inflammatory substances often on 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.150
 background itching and damaged skin 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.859
 bacterial or fungal is added 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.989
 infection that is necessary 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.860
 to control 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.050
 antibacterial and 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.599
 antifungal substances 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.729
