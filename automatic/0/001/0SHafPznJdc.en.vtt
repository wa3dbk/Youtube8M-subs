 to the Bastille a brigand so I'm going 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:30.430
 converted into scout and so we have a 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.700
 Cossack and a Mongolian warrior and 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.359
 Mongolians and the kozak cosatu that I love 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:42.400

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.420
 Gallic 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.359
 so here is the free flow 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.590
 maintain that way that I have not hurt so 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.900
 it's 25 horses and all in all 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.510
 counting two Maasai warriors did 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.230
 61 gaye here is 61 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.909
 plus there are about sixty 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.629
 of Roman there so it's 120 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:09.540
 characters that's huge i find is 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.049
 still at a friend's house there are still 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.879
 Egyptians there are others to me I 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.640
 not counted northerners say it's all 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.560
 I think we are in total agreement 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.349
 total of all the characters the hobbit 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.799
 we have to have 200 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.720
 huge 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.900
 it was also a lot of time that 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.959
 collection is here so that's it for 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.549
 this video I hope you go 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.230
 also watch my video for vermis 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.590
 view so it's gameplay on the soup 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.410
 cube 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.750
 I think I see it is very calm 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.690
 on it and so call the score 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:54.890
 final I had it was a little late 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.890
 but if we come back right away 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:23.660
 so I did it quietly a 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:29.250
 fire he for 29 dead 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.060
 not 23 dead here in nine bowling 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.180
 for 23 dead 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.039
 and that gave me a total of 249 points 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.039
 so that's so it's a good part g 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.270
 I hope you take the time to 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.280
 watch the gameplay from before the video there 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.850
