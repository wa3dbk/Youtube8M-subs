00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:13.030
 Apparently Chiwa to everyone over tonight 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:19.220
 This time, TV dvd can watch while traveling in the school can be seen in 3 minutes 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:25.699
 Easy Way Nissan Mazda Daihatsu Hen Part 1 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.010
 May I introduce the construction method with the leader option navigation of Mazda Daihatsu 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.360
 I will 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:37.360
 As this time is a lot of manufacturers of legal navigation 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:42.070
 As the details are applied to my site in the application vehicle types and so on 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:46.930
 I hope you can see from the overview below the video 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:52.420
 Then we will introduce you to the construction method . 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.850
 First of all , remove the suitable navigation body 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.199
 Behind the navigation 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.270
 Look for this 20-pin coupler as there is an identical 20-pin coupler 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:10.170
 You will receive 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:13.250
 And although I think what this or wiring to the coupler of the 20 pin is connected 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.150
 All you need is this defeat 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.900
 It is this wiring 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.730
 This defeat 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.760
 2 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.409
 Takoyaki like this 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.619
 I will pull it out on the pointed leaf island 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.819
 Yes my video about how to wear the system 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.140
 Since I am terminal crimping strangely so described in more detail 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:39.340
 It would be nice if you could see it from the link on the top left 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.350
 Well then 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.770
 First remove the first block Second lock this or pro just have a recess in the middle 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.280
 I feel that I will give you a needle here 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.010
 The second block can be started 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:02.549
 Then the second block is the terminal where the confession is below 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:06.750
 If you pull out the wire with a feeling that I will raise the needle in this direction and pull it out, the wire will come off 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:10.270
 You regard is here of genuine wiring 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.500
 Have insulation cured with vinyl tape etc. firmly 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.500
 As sin of vehicle 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.810
 Fix it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.340
 And 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:24.100
 Crimped in advance to this removed part 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.780
 Terminal defeated ma 9 series defeated 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.680
 Insert this wire 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.610
 This video shows how to make this wiring 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:40.280
 Since we are allowed to details described in the terminal crimping year 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:43.230
 It would be nice if you could see it from the link on the top left 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.430
 That 's the boy here 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.620
 I 'm sorry I'm sorry I've inserted the grass here 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.350
 a 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.100
 Please insert it in this direction 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:00.080
 [musics] 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:07.660
 Much less will be multiplied by the first block in Yoisho 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:11.520
 Also , after having this coupler attached to the navigation system, the end of this wiring 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:17.670
 The construction is complete if you can earth 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:21.480
 I'd like something to go wrong or explain this car type 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:27.330
 Video comments section if you have any requests etc. 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:32.730
 Also, it would be helpful if you could contact my site, twitter etc. 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:36.780
 Then thank you for seeing to the last minute 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.640
 It would be nice if we could see you in the next video 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.640
 Then excuse me 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.699
