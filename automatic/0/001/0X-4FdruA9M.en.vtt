00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.080
 warfare myth number one may circumvent the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.480
 robot turret thanks to the smoke generator this 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.189
 robot turret that is practically blind 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.779
 he never sees us 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.990
 it was bocelli robotic tower therefore a 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.880
 bit of respect to use see in 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.820
 the turret that does not see us but turret 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.739
 what are you doing here in the middle of the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.000
 smoke and does not see us but sensory 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.160
 middle age sparaci a good tower between the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.730

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.989
 number two 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.510
 the luca question can kill a friend 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.880
 while this is entering the goliath 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 stupid the button enters the second da 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.390
 button and shinji you get this joke 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.290

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.840
 great parody however we shoot three 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.360
 tisi blows easy hard bones pump the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.189
 our friend capparella who does not die e 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.320
 I want to emphasize that the health of the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.570
 minimum it was evening was at the minimum health 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.210
 it is the meaty minimal health indeed among the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.909
 menstruation enters and secure montanile 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.329

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.130
 square enemy of a riot scooter 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.290
 equipped with shock placement 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.780
 so again this time it touched me 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.170
 life to a minimum let's say it because of 33 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.530
 sincere and honest for the opposition is 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.810
 shaken by boys or amadeus chigago 1 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.399
 lard lampshades equal with ford 14 yes 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.070
 can destroy a world wurth with a 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.329
 missile attack this very a 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.329
 myth to water 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:22.019
 where the Arabic highside song 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.910
 alarming the flame does not challenge my breast 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.580
 explodes the world explodes as well a 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.989
 warbirds twist scene catches him right 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:36.959
 on the fly and our board is more alive 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.420
 number 5 you can destroy an oasis with 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.709
 the m1 that for those who do not play call of duty 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.489
 the m1 is the classic laverone laser 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.650
 one is the violent one that also 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.500
 a reach apparently of 68 thousand 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.260
 kilometers apart powerful fire 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.329
 so I hit it let's do a 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.900
 another a string of markers not even we were 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.190
 in a mlg and escapes behind the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.810
 hurdles let's not resume 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.780
 on the other side because the barriers 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.849
 they are indestructible every farewell ce 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.630
 I had done it after 15 minutes 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.090
 so here you are you can destroy a 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.859
 goliath with the tactical knife these 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.680
 things you are that always returns the limits 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.810
 it destroys itself with everything now 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.690
 let's try with the pincushion with 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.150
 boxcutter because if we look at 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.380
 we shoot him in the kid's balls 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.810
 there is not even there tomorrow then 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.850
 it would seem immortal but no 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.290
 magic to hit him who was born 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.660
 it hurts those who know that written by 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.470
 brick to why a robot that 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.829
 it works on blood is good for yes 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.980
 confuses but is collapsing number 7 yes

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.510
 violation of enemy and active systems 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.419
 if he is a little confused because in this 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.980
 new call of duty the mp system calls 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.340
 violated the systems the less you have to write to me 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.549
 the lovers of not being able to understand it 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.829
 what are you reading ok 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:10.970

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:14.700

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.320
 and only once the 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.000
 violation of enemy systems will be possible 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.000
 call the DNA bombs 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:37.669
