00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.149
 hello guys how are you welcome to the 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.370
 third episode of rock to lori and 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:07.930
 We start directly looking for a 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.019
 new game touches us against this 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.989
 team that has mc will get from 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.119
 carroll decency and well then in the 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.800
 first minutes of the game and I'm going to 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.160
 make a quick goal a wall there 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.380
 carroll and this green that gets 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.780
 plug it without much problem the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.600
 19 minute took me a ball here by 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.580
 luck with dad the cross and hit it to the 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.739
 stick a very hard shot that could have 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.469
 it was a great goal and so we go to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.510
 rest without much more occasion and good 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.489
 the truth that the guy played pretty 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.769
 well here 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.629
 in the 55th minute I'm going to clear with the 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.729
 just janitor I meet with carroll 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.609
 that good simply gives it to the chest 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:51.010
 and to enter pound you did not see much in 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.899
 this match simply the best that 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.199
 did it was that vaseline attempt to 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.979
 doorman who does not enter and well then 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.539
 match lost 0-2 and good here already in 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.150
 this team you have seen that in the 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.580
 right end we have akrÃ³n him 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.380
 player that we pushed in the previous 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.930
 episode for 150 coins and we what 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.380
 We have started a new game this 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.270
 uncle has andean gabi and rossi up and 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.100
 well then bra and in the first 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.500
 minutes shoots with the left handed that 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.810
 shortcut his bearing or here they had good and 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.810
 good a mixture of a bad defense of mine 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.820
 and the goalkeeper who is also none 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.440
 wonder why he did a pretty shot 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.300
 loose but my goalkeeper could not stop it 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.740
 here he takes it I think in the 59th minute and 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.500
 has the second part the snag of 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.900
 crossed to the pole and the rejection also 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.550
 goes outside and well the truth is that 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.979
 having opportunities but I did not get 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.810
 fit no goal and in the end there 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.850
 ibra with a cow tail gets between 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.030
 the two defenses and for inside with the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.840
 left we go to the extension in this 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 intense match and hard rival 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.550
 had also very good level and again 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.009
 my goalkeeper returns to do a crap there 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.110
 tremendous tries to leave that ball but not 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.990
 there is way and it ends up entering 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.720
 but good and brad you know that is 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.910
 always there surrendering be as is the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.590
 team he is always good and gets 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.770
 tie the game to go to the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.020
 penalties and well surely this has 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.060
 been one of the worst round of penalties 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.280
 or more intense and longer than there 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.680
 done in any of the feef as you see 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.630
 there are seven penalties already thrown in there 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.080
 at the end he stops me for this one 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.930
 with blue and then stopped him 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.660
 next and we continue throwing penaltis 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.670
 putting both together until good 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.010
 there comes a time when a shot with 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.990
 larsson I stop and well although I think 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.270
 that was not wrong thrown I was going up 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.680
 tight but hey he stopped me and the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.610
 penalties prayer the lottery besides 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.250
 you know that I am not an expert in 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.990
 that area so nothing 14 goals with pound 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.400
 as you have seen before and we are going to look 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.040
 the next game to see if we can 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.620
 get out of this pothole we get a 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.300
 German team mixes silver and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.520
 bronze it looked like it did not have a great 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.070
 team and good first match first goal 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.300
 of the minute 5 match with ibra goal 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.160
 head you know that I'm not much of 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.720
 central but good in this case the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.750
 true that it centers a little by central and 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.250
 came in the bm t a goal manages to tie the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.890
 party but here now for speed 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.630
 well the defense was not exactly 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.760
 the fastest and I put it there for 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.730
 above the Vaseline goalkeeper 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.489
 ibra tail of cow sleeve of espn and for 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.920
 in with quality those movements and 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.200
 wta the master one hundred percent me 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.390
 get there is a goal with this slide 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.010
 the truth that my defense was quite 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.409
 poor also but good we arrived towards 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.360
 the second part with that blue 3-2 and pick up 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.489
 a ball out of the area hits it and good 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.470
 it's not a very powerful vision but what 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.190
 enough to plug into 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.959
 goalkeeper fontena and a good goal role and 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.959
 trackback for ibra that good 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.769
 just plug it in at 90 minutes and 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.450
 there we go with a 52 of this match 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.370
 18 goals with pounds and the truth that 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.720
 continues to maintain the level as I say 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.579
 although the team is not good although 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.370
 do not play ibra it seems that it is always 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.530
 there standing out and nothing guys this is the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.829
 third episode thank you very much for watching 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.530

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.860
