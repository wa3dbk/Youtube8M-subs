00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello to all I propose to you 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.980
 today we are art what I have 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.960
 made for halloween so it's a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.190
 enarque which is composed of small 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.450
 pumpkins and small black cats 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.130
 so I propose you in a first 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.549
 time to discover the material I have 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.549
 in use 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 for this is the chosen che a varnish of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.250
 base which is a little cream for 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.390
 to bring out the decor I'm going 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.090
 then put a drop of paint 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 orange acrylic on a stand and like 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.000
 always I will prepare my brush 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 that is, I will clean it up 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.839
 slamming the brush on the wall of my 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.110
 pot and then I will remove 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.280
 the excess water on a kleenex I 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.360
 take a drop of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 acrylic painting I'm going 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.290
 to work next for well damaged my 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 paint brush and I'm going to start 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.239
 by realizing my pumpkin so I'm going 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.859
 make two curves on each side of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.250
 my fingernail and I will then fill 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.289
 inside once my first 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.229
 layer and dry I will see apply a 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.250
 second for more consistency 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.110
 as you can see I do not have 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.220
 made a rounded up all I 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.690
 really made a little hollow for 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.320
 give way to small shocks we go 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.320
 then realize 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.070
 I now take a drop of 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.690
 black acrylic paint and the same 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.610
 way i'm going to work it with a 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.340
 brush to start realizing the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.230
 cat I start by making two 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.480
 little paws that are going to be a little 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.190
 little curved on both sides of the small 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.810
 hollow that I left at the top of the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.810
 pumpkin and I'm going to fill them 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.390
 I will now place the head so 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.070
 really stick to the paws I'm going 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.270
 make a first court for months 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.600
 do a little bit how a balloon 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.640
 rugby 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.650
 so I will first draw the outline 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.980
 and then I'll fill the inside all 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.980
 in black 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.610
 a realized time the cat's ears 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.680
 so I 'm going to actually make two 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:11.030
 small triangles a little rounded of 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:12.350
 on both sides of the circle I then 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.050
 taken again acrylic paint 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.630
 orange to make the cat's hat 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.220
 so there as for the pumpkin I 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.840
 laid two layers to have a 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.120
 optimal coverage I then impose a 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.620
 green varnish drop on a support is 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.540
 with the help of a fine brush I'm going 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.730
 so realize the stem of my pumpkin 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.760
 is so a little greenery for that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.770
 the cat's hat is more realistic I 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.200
 then take a very green blue polish 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.730
 clear to realize the cat's eyes to 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.920
 using a second tools realizes 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.550
 then the cat's muzzle using a 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.020
 light pink acrylic paint with 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.550
 very diluted white acrylic paint 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.160
 I will make the cat's whiskers 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.020
 touching my paintbrush and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.210
 other muzzle I will then created 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.860
 the clear oranje to perform 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.860
 characteristic streaks of the pumpkin 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.970
 I then realize the eyes the nose and the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.200
 mouth of my pumpkin with the help of 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.270
 white acrylic paint and my 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.940
 fine brush so both eyes are two 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.830
 triangles the nose is a triangle but 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.360
 inverted so the tip down and 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.120
 so for the mouth and really realize 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.560
 a zigzag in a triangle and almost the same 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.910
 at the bottom but otherwise you can fill the 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.110
 down is not very serious if it makes a 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.640
 kind of half bush once the eyes 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.170
 are dry I'm going to make two 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.730
 any peas using the paint 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.730
 black acrylic to realize the eyes 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.500
 of the cat to finish this deco I 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.520
 realized the foliage of the pumpkin there 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.980
 that I still had room 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.000
 so I realized loops and 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.000
 lines a little rounded 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.320
 then to finish this decoration I pose 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.760
 a good layer of top coat for more 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.570
 of brilliance and especially to hold 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.570
 acrylic painting 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.100
 you can find all the material 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.140
 that I used for this video on the 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.700
 site hellemmes cosmetics dot fr I 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.960
