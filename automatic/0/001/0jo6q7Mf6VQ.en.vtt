00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
continue to add more eyeliner and make

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.790 
continue to add more eyeliner and make
your<00:05:56.180> line<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.389> little<00:05:56.690> bit<00:05:56.810> thicker<00:05:57.139> but<00:05:57.530> don't

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
your line a little bit thicker but don't

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.659 
your line a little bit thicker but don't
make<00:05:58.039> it<00:05:58.100> very<00:05:59.090> thick<00:05:59.539> I<00:05:59.840> decided<00:06:00.680> again<00:06:01.130> to<00:06:01.490> go

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
make it very thick I decided again to go

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.600 
make it very thick I decided again to go
back<00:06:01.970> to<00:06:02.210> my<00:06:02.419> wing<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:03.080> make<00:06:03.979> it<00:06:04.130> a<00:06:04.190> little<00:06:04.370> bit

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
back to my wing and make it a little bit

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.909 
back to my wing and make it a little bit
thicker<00:06:04.820> just<00:06:05.210> because<00:06:05.570> since<00:06:06.169> I<00:06:06.320> had<00:06:06.530> a<00:06:06.560> thick

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
thicker just because since I had a thick

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.390 
thicker just because since I had a thick
line<00:06:07.130> on<00:06:07.940> my<00:06:08.150> lid<00:06:08.419> I<00:06:08.630> felt<00:06:09.169> like<00:06:09.350> the<00:06:09.590> tail<00:06:10.160> was

line on my lid I felt like the tail was

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.040

a<00:06:10.430> little<00:06:10.789> too<00:06:10.970> small<00:06:11.240> so<00:06:11.449> you<00:06:11.510> guys<00:06:11.720> can<00:06:11.930> go

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050
