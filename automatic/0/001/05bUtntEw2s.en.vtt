00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 Amen 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.290
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.080
 video today we want to tell you our 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.050
 experience paying with the mobile we have 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.720
 used the vodafone smart system 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.090
 pass implemented by the operator makes 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.610
 a few months and the truth is that it has 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.619
 liked quite before following or of 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.869
 start better said we want to make it clear 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.559
 that vodafone smart pass is a system of 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.260
 payment 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.350
 attached to the mobile but in this first 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.960
 phase does not use nfc technology that's 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.450
 good and it's bad is bad because it needs 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.220
 an additional element but it's good 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.829
 because it is compatible with both mobile 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.610
 Android as with the iphone 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.410
 regardless of whether they have a system 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.079
 nfc as we say in this first phase 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.969
 besides, it is not necessary for us to be 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.100
 customers of the operator we what 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.320
 we have used for example in with another 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.950
 operator and we can use the system 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.539
 of vodafone smart pass that has been 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.420
 implemented thanks to an agreement with 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.640
 view on this phone on this iphone 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.590
 we have the card that is put in the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.830
 back in this case we have 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.930
 put on top of a sleeve so that it does not 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.080
 on the phone and as we see we have the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.200
 payment system by contact the logo 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.230
 visa and the vodafone logo 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.360
 that system that is very simple like 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.280
 as you are going to see in this video we have 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.270
 used to buy in a 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.630
 supermarket as it is for example 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.540
 Carrefour 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.190
 in this case you see the ticket here 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.680
 normal and current ticket of an amount 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.740
 normal we wanted to do it in a 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.490
 big supermarket since always 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.410
 this type of use this type of payments as 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 it's better for people who are very wikis 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.650
 that we think can only be used 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.540
 in certain shops it's not like that there's more 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.960
 of 300,000 points where we can do 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.690
 use of this system in a second phase 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.000
 as we say we can use the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.460
 nfc system that have implemented 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.649
 mobiles like this sony xperia z1 compact 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.390
 but for the moment we're going to need 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.400
 this card that obviously the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.620
 we can remove and we can put it in 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.569
 our android mobile if we go to the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.150
 application we see how it 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.249
 can use we have the movements 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.200
 we can send money to other users 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.780
 of vodafone smart pass and we have 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.569
 details of our card in the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.159
 movements if we press we see in the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.310
 last seven days updates the 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:38.030
 application and shows us the last payment 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.609
 the amount the date and the status of the payment 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.139
 we have done how this card is used 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.730
 so we have to recharge it is a 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:48.049
 recharge card that we can use from 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.139
 free of charge during the period 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.849
 promotional of the system and that after 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.959
 will have some costs that we advise 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.219
 that you look on the web of course 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.870
 during this first promotional period 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.510
 they give us ten euros when 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.519
 we do the first recharge the use is very 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.110
 simple if we go back we can 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.410
 send money 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.090
 we can go to the use guide if not 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.000
 we know how it is used but it is 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.830
 tremendously simple and also in the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.570
 low you can change the pin 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.790
 of the application will ask us for a pin 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.500
 when we make a payment of more than 20 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.300
 euros for those less for more 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.490
 comfort simply by passing the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.700
 phone as you see in the video by 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.280
 in front of the dataphone makes us effective 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.350
 that payment that is made at the time the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.810
 truth is that it is very comfortable has 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.600
 very liked and we are looking forward to 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.520
 follow the implementation with others 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.280
 means as we say above all as the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.070
 nfc that will no longer be necessary 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.989
 carry this type of card but go 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.090
 that as we say we bring it here in the 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.070
 Holster does not bother at all and does not 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.670
 the most uncomfortable phone does not 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.500
 less safe and nothing if you are interested in 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.390
 mobile payment system we invite you to 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.910
 that you see the link in the description 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.040
 of the video where we explain in detail 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.510
 Everything you need to know about Vodafone 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.510
 smart past a greeting
