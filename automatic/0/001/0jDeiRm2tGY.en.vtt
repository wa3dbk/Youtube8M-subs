and be controlled by domain controller

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.720 
and be controlled by domain controller
and<00:00:38.390> then<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> Windows<00:00:39.840> domain<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:41.520> group

one<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> had<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.710> could<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.399> could

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
one if you had one you could you could

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.690 
one if you had one you could you could
boot<00:01:47.700> from<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.320> on<00:01:49.320> Windows<00:01:49.860> 8<00:01:50.040> straight<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
boot from it on Windows 8 straight to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.520 
boot from it on Windows 8 straight to
the<00:01:50.759> VHD<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.570> worked<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.869> Windows<00:01:52.079> 7<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.380> it's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the VHD it worked in Windows 7 but it's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.359 
the VHD it worked in Windows 7 but it's
a<00:01:52.590> lot<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:53.909> better<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.540> Windows<00:01:54.869> 8<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
a lot it's a lot better on Windows 8 and

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.920 
a lot it's a lot better on Windows 8 and
you<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> dual<00:01:56.850> boot<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.270> much<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you have to dual boot as much it's you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.600 
you have to dual boot as much it's you
can<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.170> boot<00:01:58.350> straight<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> virtual

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
can just boot straight to the virtual

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.050 
can just boot straight to the virtual
hard<00:01:59.729> drive<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> another<00:02:02.070> thing<00:02:02.189> Windows

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
hard drive and so another thing Windows

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.390 
hard drive and so another thing Windows
8<00:02:03.210> has<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.810> Windows<00:02:04.079> 7<00:02:04.380> doesn't<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
8 has that Windows 7 doesn't and

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.990 
8 has that Windows 7 doesn't and
is<00:02:05.730> client<00:02:06.120> hyper-v<00:02:06.980> sore<00:02:07.980> like<00:02:08.160> XP<00:02:08.520> mode<00:02:08.700> back

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
is client hyper-v sore like XP mode back

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.150 
is client hyper-v sore like XP mode back
in<00:02:09.149> Windows<00:02:10.140> 7<00:02:10.410> using<00:02:10.590> Windows<00:02:11.009> virtual<00:02:11.160> pc

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
in Windows 7 using Windows virtual pc

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.400 
in Windows 7 using Windows virtual pc
hyper-v<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> lot<00:02:14.700> better<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.230> run

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
hyper-v is a lot better and you can run

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.710 
hyper-v is a lot better and you can run
any<00:02:16.560> 32<00:02:17.160> 64<00:02:17.460> bit<00:02:17.670> version<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.000> Windows<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
any 32 64 bit version of Windows and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.500 
any 32 64 bit version of Windows and
then<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.250> probably<00:02:20.430> run<00:02:20.640> Linux<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.330> as

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
then you can probably run Linux on it as

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.420 
then you can probably run Linux on it as
well<00:02:21.690> because<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.230> any<00:02:22.650> VM<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.280> you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
well because it's just any VM that you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.680 
well because it's just any VM that you
want<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.670> run<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.850> our<00:02:24.000> wall<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.390> probably

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
want to run on our wall is probably

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.710 
want to run on our wall is probably
going<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.900> work<00:02:25.050> there<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.450> that's<00:02:27.450> installed

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
going to work there and that's installed

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.650 
going to work there and that's installed
by<00:02:27.900> default<00:02:27.960> look<00:02:28.650> hyper-v<00:02:29.490> know<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.600> to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
by default look hyper-v know so to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.880 
by default look hyper-v know so to
enable<00:02:31.200> these<00:02:31.290> sorts<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.560> things<00:02:31.650> you're

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
enable these sorts of things you're

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
enable these sorts of things you're
probably<00:02:31.950> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.490> get<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> add<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
probably going to have to get to add to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.790 
probably going to have to get to add to
remove<00:02:33.120> programs<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.960> was<00:02:34.200> typing<00:02:34.440> add<00:02:34.560> remove

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
remove programs I was typing add remove

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.330 
remove programs I was typing add remove
go<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.220> sayings<00:02:35.700> I'd<00:02:36.390> remove<00:02:36.660> programs<00:02:37.340> it's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
go to sayings I'd remove programs it's

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.790 
go to sayings I'd remove programs it's
probably<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> Windows<00:02:39.120> Features<00:02:39.300> yeah<00:02:40.230> I'm

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
probably in a Windows Features yeah I'm

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.170 
probably in a Windows Features yeah I'm
gonna<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.220> I'm<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.370> guessing<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:41.850> but

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
gonna just I'm just guessing here but

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.640 
gonna just I'm just guessing here but
I'm<00:02:42.270> guessing<00:02:42.450> high<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.080> hyper-v<00:02:43.500> is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
I'm guessing high and hyper-v is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.560 
I'm guessing high and hyper-v is
probably<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.070> hyper-v<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.360> neighbor

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
probably in a hyper-v so to a neighbor

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.449 
probably in a hyper-v so to a neighbor
hyper-v<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:45.990> have<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.290> take<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.860> then

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
hyper-v you have to take that and then

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.640 
hyper-v you have to take that and then
you<00:02:47.520> have<00:02:47.640> your<00:02:47.700> hyper-v<00:02:48.000> tools<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.650> play

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
you have your hyper-v tools to play

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.180 
you have your hyper-v tools to play
around<00:02:49.860> with<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.070> one<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:51.890> another<00:02:52.890> thing

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
around with that one and another thing

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.820 
around with that one and another thing
is<00:02:53.910> Remote<00:02:54.240> Desktop<00:02:54.270> host<00:02:54.840> that's<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.740> other

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
is Remote Desktop host that's the other

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.470 
is Remote Desktop host that's the other
thing<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.280> pro<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.970> you're<00:02:57.209> not<00:02:57.300> going<00:02:57.420> to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
thing in pro and you're not going to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.570 
thing in pro and you're not going to
have<00:02:57.570> any<00:02:57.810> others<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.350> from<00:02:59.160> all<00:02:59.250> version<00:02:59.520> of
