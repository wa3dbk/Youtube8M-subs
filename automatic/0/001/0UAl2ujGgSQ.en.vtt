as<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.880> can<00:03:26.000> see<00:03:26.150> there<00:03:26.980> another<00:03:27.980> important

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
as you can see there another important

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.400 
as you can see there another important
thing<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.610> think<00:03:28.790> about<00:03:28.850> is<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.870> spin

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
thing to think about is the the spin

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.350 
thing to think about is the the spin
cycle<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.769> it<00:03:30.890> does<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.910> going<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.120> spin

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
cycle that it does it's going to spin

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.400 
cycle that it does it's going to spin
you<00:03:32.450> don't<00:03:32.570> want<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.810> spin<00:03:33.019> too<00:03:33.230> much

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
you don't want it to spin too much

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.660 
you don't want it to spin too much
because<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.739> want<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.920> look<00:03:34.130> after<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.459> boost

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
because you want to look after the boost

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.880 
because you want to look after the boost
so<00:03:35.120> I'm<00:03:35.239> just<00:03:35.420> going<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.630> go<00:03:35.750> on<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.500> lowest

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
so I'm just going to go on the lowest

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.040 
so I'm just going to go on the lowest
spin<00:03:37.250> setting<00:03:37.550> here<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.690> reason<00:03:38.959> for

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
spin setting here and the reason for

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.330 
spin setting here and the reason for
that<00:03:39.110> is<00:03:39.350> it's<00:03:39.650> not<00:03:39.739> going<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.100> spin<00:03:40.250> around

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
that is it's not going to spin around

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.500 
that is it's not going to spin around
too<00:03:40.550> much<00:03:40.700> it's<00:03:40.880> not<00:03:41.000> going<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.180> attack<00:03:41.390> the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
too much it's not going to attack the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.630 
too much it's not going to attack the
boots<00:03:41.690> too<00:03:41.870> much<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.350> we'll<00:03:43.190> just<00:03:43.310> let<00:03:43.489> them

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
boots too much and we'll just let them

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.550 
boots too much and we'll just let them
dry<00:03:43.880> out<00:03:43.910> naturally<00:03:44.540> afterwards<00:03:45.050> so<00:03:45.350> that's<00:03:45.500> a

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
dry out naturally afterwards so that's a

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.750 
dry out naturally afterwards so that's a
really<00:03:45.769> important<00:03:46.070> thing<00:03:46.100> make<00:03:46.430> sure<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.670> let

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
really important thing make sure you let

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.729 
really important thing make sure you let
them<00:03:46.910> dry<00:03:47.090> out<00:03:47.120> naturally<00:03:47.660> afterwards<00:03:48.049> okay

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
them dry out naturally afterwards okay

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.890 
them dry out naturally afterwards okay
so<00:03:48.799> I'm<00:03:49.190> happy<00:03:49.459> on<00:03:49.489> my<00:03:49.910> temperature<00:03:50.570> I'm<00:03:50.720> happy

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
so I'm happy on my temperature I'm happy

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.050 
so I'm happy on my temperature I'm happy
on<00:03:51.080> my<00:03:51.110> spins<00:03:51.560> I'm<00:03:52.459> now<00:03:52.580> going<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.850> go<00:03:52.940> ahead

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
on my spins I'm now going to go ahead

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.729 
on my spins I'm now going to go ahead
and<00:03:53.450> put<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.920> parcel<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.010> as<00:03:55.160> such<00:03:55.510> alright

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
and put the parcel in as such alright

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.080 
and put the parcel in as such alright
other<00:03:57.739> thing<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.280> am<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:58.430> gonna<00:03:58.730> put<00:03:58.910> in<00:03:59.000> a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
other thing is I am just gonna put in a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.360 
other thing is I am just gonna put in a
splash<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.510> detergent<00:03:59.989> just<00:04:00.860> thinking<00:04:01.190> like

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
splash of detergent just thinking like

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.630 
splash of detergent just thinking like
maybe<00:04:01.700> like<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:02.000> teaspoonful<00:04:03.459> nothing<00:04:04.459> too

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
maybe like a teaspoonful nothing too

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.210 
maybe like a teaspoonful nothing too
crazy<00:04:05.290> but<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.350> do<00:04:06.470> what<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:06.709> put<00:04:06.860> in<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.070> little

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
crazy but I do what I put in a little

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.210 
crazy but I do what I put in a little
bit<00:04:07.459> just<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.850> look<00:04:08.090> after<00:04:08.269> them<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:09.590> right

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
bit just to look after them and right

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.050 
bit just to look after them and right
that's<00:04:10.400> it

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.840 

and<00:04:14.060> then<00:04:14.510> we<00:04:14.599> just<00:04:14.750> hit<00:04:14.900> go<00:04:15.639> I'm<00:04:16.639> going<00:04:16.820> to

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
and then we just hit go I'm going to

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.490 
and then we just hit go I'm going to
find<00:04:17.060> out<00:04:17.180> in<00:04:17.329> 33<00:04:17.750> minutes<00:04:17.780> how<00:04:18.169> these<00:04:18.320> are

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
find out in 33 minutes how these are

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.229 
find out in 33 minutes how these are
looking<00:04:18.739> we<00:04:19.639> probably<00:04:19.910> do<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.090> little

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
looking we probably do a little

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.379 
looking we probably do a little
time-lapse<00:04:20.780> speed<00:04:21.019> this<00:04:21.139> up<00:04:21.290> for<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:22.389> let

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
time-lapse speed this up for you and let

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.280 
time-lapse speed this up for you and let
me<00:04:23.450> take<00:04:23.600> them<00:04:23.660> out<00:04:23.750> at<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.900> end<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.169> me

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
me take them out at the end of me

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.870 
me take them out at the end of me
finding<00:04:24.950> out<00:04:25.070> what's<00:04:25.310> happened<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.700> super

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
finding out what's happened to the super

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
finding out what's happened to the super
flies<00:04:26.030> we're<00:04:26.240> pretty<00:04:26.360> confident<00:04:26.690> they're

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
flies we're pretty confident they're

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:59.160 
flies we're pretty confident they're
going<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.080> be<00:04:27.139> in<00:04:27.230> good<00:04:27.350> shape

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.570

[Music]
all<00:05:06.580> right<00:05:06.759> moment<00:05:06.999> of<00:05:07.179> truth<00:05:07.240> let's<00:05:07.959> have<00:05:08.110> a

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
all right moment of truth let's have a

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.959 
all right moment of truth let's have a
look<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:08.439> see<00:05:08.559> what<00:05:08.679> happened<00:05:08.770> if<00:05:09.699> you<00:05:09.849> may

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
look and see what happened if you may

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.850 
look and see what happened if you may
noticed<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.990> one<00:05:11.139> of<00:05:11.259> the<00:05:11.319> booths<00:05:11.469> actually

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
noticed that one of the booths actually

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.909 
noticed that one of the booths actually
managed<00:05:12.099> to<00:05:12.159> pop<00:05:12.459> out<00:05:12.669> of<00:05:12.849> the<00:05:13.029> pillowcase

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
managed to pop out of the pillowcase

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.070 
managed to pop out of the pillowcase
we'll<00:05:14.919> see<00:05:15.099> if<00:05:15.369> the<00:05:15.729> come<00:05:16.330> fiber<00:05:16.659> is<00:05:16.809> still<00:05:16.990> in

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
we'll see if the come fiber is still in

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.290 
we'll see if the come fiber is still in
one<00:05:17.110> piece<00:05:17.379> and<00:05:17.789> have<00:05:18.789> a<00:05:18.819> look<00:05:18.939> until<00:05:19.179> the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
one piece and have a look until the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:29.600 
one piece and have a look until the
boots<00:05:19.509> are<00:05:19.599> looking<00:05:19.809> like<00:05:23.219> tells<00:05:24.219> pretty<00:05:24.459> well

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.239 

so<00:05:30.610> we've<00:05:30.849> got<00:05:30.999> one<00:05:31.240> food<00:05:31.649> still<00:05:32.649> in<00:05:33.069> the

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:33.249 
so we've got one food still in the

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.429 
so we've got one food still in the
pillowcase<00:05:33.490> my<00:05:34.419> suggestion<00:05:34.869> when<00:05:35.110> you<00:05:35.289> do

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
pillowcase my suggestion when you do

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.469 
pillowcase my suggestion when you do
this<00:05:35.619> if<00:05:36.429> these<00:05:36.639> boots<00:05:36.849> are<00:05:36.999> in<00:05:37.089> one<00:05:37.179> piece<00:05:37.330> and

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
this if these boots are in one piece and

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.509 
this if these boots are in one piece and
it<00:05:37.569> is<00:05:37.659> with<00:05:37.809> thee<00:05:37.959> then<00:05:38.559> is<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:39.189> take<00:05:39.429> your

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:39.519 
it is with thee then is to take your

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.459 
it is with thee then is to take your
pillowcase<00:05:40.389> and<00:05:40.629> just<00:05:40.809> tie<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.019> knot<00:05:41.229> in<00:05:41.289> it

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
pillowcase and just tie a knot in it

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.019 
pillowcase and just tie a knot in it
before<00:05:41.979> you<00:05:42.219> put<00:05:42.369> it<00:05:42.459> in<00:05:42.519> the<00:05:42.610> machine

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.029 
before you put it in the machine

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.139 
before you put it in the machine
yeah<00:05:43.919> that<00:05:44.919> way<00:05:45.039> you're<00:05:45.249> not<00:05:45.279> gonna<00:05:45.550> have<00:05:46.119> your

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
yeah that way you're not gonna have your

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
boots fall out as we did all right so

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
let's take a look at the one that still

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.580 
let's take a look at the one that still
in<00:05:50.949> them

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.260 

it's<00:05:56.590> looking<00:05:56.800> pretty<00:05:56.890> shiny<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:58.120> that's

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
it's looking pretty shiny and that's

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.610 
it's looking pretty shiny and that's
good<00:05:58.420> isn't<00:05:58.570> it

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
good isn't it

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.320 
good isn't it
I'm<00:05:59.920> not<00:06:00.100> really<00:06:00.280> seeing<00:06:00.460> any<00:06:00.670> kinda<00:06:01.180> major

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
I'm not really seeing any kinda major

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.820 
I'm not really seeing any kinda major
issues<00:06:01.600> another<00:06:02.080> thing<00:06:02.320> I<00:06:02.410> might<00:06:02.590> consider

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
issues another thing I might consider

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.500 
issues another thing I might consider
suggesting<00:06:03.340> is<00:06:03.430> perhaps<00:06:03.580> probably<00:06:04.210> tie<00:06:04.360> your

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
suggesting is perhaps probably tie your

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.050 
suggesting is perhaps probably tie your
laces<00:06:04.540> when<00:06:05.380> you<00:06:05.470> do<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:05.710> until<00:06:06.610> I<00:06:06.790> haven't

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
laces when you do it until I haven't

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.580 
laces when you do it until I haven't
