00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.610 
I don't think they're gonna do crystal
variants<00:02:00.100> oh<00:02:00.660> that's<00:02:01.660> all<00:02:01.840> right<00:02:01.870> except<00:02:02.440> for

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
variants oh that's all right except for

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.680 
variants oh that's all right except for
maybe<00:02:02.770> Sorcerer's<00:02:03.550> Apprentice<00:02:03.820> Mickey<00:02:04.540> which

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
maybe Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey which

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.900 
maybe Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey which
was<00:02:04.870> pretty<00:02:05.680> much<00:02:05.920> promise<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.550> us<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
was pretty much promise to us in the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.210 
was pretty much promise to us in the
first<00:02:07.270> is<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.660> Infinity<00:02:08.050> game<00:02:08.230> we<00:02:08.710> might<00:02:09.040> get

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
first is the Infinity game we might get

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.280 
first is the Infinity game we might get
to<00:02:09.399> see<00:02:09.430> him<00:02:09.790> so<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.330> think<00:02:10.479> that's<00:02:10.810> kind<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.170> a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
to see him so I think that's kind of a

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.570 
to see him so I think that's kind of a
cool<00:02:11.470> but<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.970> other<00:02:13.210> one's<00:02:14.220> gonna<00:02:15.220> see<00:02:15.430> any

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
cool but the other one's gonna see any

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.370 
cool but the other one's gonna see any
crystals<00:02:16.060> that's<00:02:16.510> all<00:02:16.690> right<00:02:16.720> i<00:02:16.930> mean<00:02:17.020> as<00:02:17.260> long

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
crystals that's all right i mean as long

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.140 
crystals that's all right i mean as long
as<00:02:17.560> they're<00:02:17.710> giving<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.040> more<00:02:18.280> characters<00:02:18.910> do

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
as they're giving you more characters do

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.480 
as they're giving you more characters do
you<00:02:19.240> really<00:02:19.570> need<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.990> extra<00:02:20.350> just<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.250> same

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
you really need the extra just the same

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.690 
you really need the extra just the same
guy<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.120> crystal<00:02:22.600> like<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.320> really<00:02:23.700> counting

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
guy but crystal like it really counting

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.050 
guy but crystal like it really counting
so<00:02:24.910> characters<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:26.020> time<00:02:26.340> less<00:02:27.340> crystal

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
so characters this time less crystal

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.330 
so characters this time less crystal
variants<00:02:28.570> which<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.440> kind<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.800> cool<00:02:29.860> i<00:02:30.100> think
