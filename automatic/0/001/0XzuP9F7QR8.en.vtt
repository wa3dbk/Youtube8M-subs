00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.289
 when they did this 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.760
 Belarus well and outside

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.600
 country accounts completely of this card 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.480
 Stations when from stapler staples 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.960

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.700
 this film his gas pipes as it were 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.000
 insulated against corrosion 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.080
