00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
see and I wanted you to be able to see

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.790 
see and I wanted you to be able to see
them<00:00:35.730> side<00:00:35.940> by<00:00:35.969> side<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:37.140> basically<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
them side by side it's basically the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.910 
them side by side it's basically the
same<00:00:38.040> figure<00:00:38.960> now<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> doesn't<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> cute

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
same figure now it doesn't have the cute

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.600 
same figure now it doesn't have the cute
little<00:00:41.100> cheek<00:00:41.730> spots<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.829> business<00:00:43.829> Kitty<00:00:44.070> but

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
little cheek spots on business Kitty but

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
little cheek spots on business Kitty but
I<00:00:44.640> guess<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:45.539> put<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
I guess that's because they put the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.619 
I guess that's because they put the
glasses<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.550> other<00:00:47.789> than<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.600> looks

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
glasses on but other than that it looks

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.459 
glasses on but other than that it looks
pretty<00:00:49.050> much<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> same<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.250> me<00:00:50.750> I<00:00:51.750> think<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
pretty much the same to me I think it is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.069 
pretty much the same to me I think it is
super<00:00:52.680> cute<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.570> another<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
super cute and this is another one that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.170 
super cute and this is another one that
I'll<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.770> an<00:00:55.860> updated<00:00:56.309> comparison<00:00:57.059> on

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
I'll have to do an updated comparison on

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.139 
I'll have to do an updated comparison on
later<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.829> because<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> summer

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
