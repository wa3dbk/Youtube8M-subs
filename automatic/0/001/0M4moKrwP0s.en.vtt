00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
anything on the droid razr m also

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.570 
anything on the droid razr m also
playing<00:02:18.630> games<00:02:18.960> was<00:02:19.200> really<00:02:19.530> nice<00:02:19.740> i<00:02:20.070> as<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
playing games was really nice i as you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.580 
playing games was really nice i as you
can<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.820> here<00:02:21.150> playing<00:02:21.690> Temple<00:02:22.140> Run<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.500> they

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
can see here playing Temple Run and they

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.460 
can see here playing Temple Run and they
ran<00:02:22.770> smoothly<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.580> nicely<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:25.290> only

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
ran smoothly and nicely the only

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.430 
ran smoothly and nicely the only
downside<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:27.480> display<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.260> not

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
downside is that the display is not

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.700 
downside is that the display is not
quite<00:02:28.830> HD<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.780> quite<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.410> there<00:02:31.440> with

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
quite HD so it's not quite up there with

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.960 
quite HD so it's not quite up there with
the<00:02:31.740> quality<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.160> other<00:02:32.370> phones<00:02:32.640> like<00:02:32.850> the

the quality of other phones like the
