00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello friends with you now he and 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.800
 this is the 47th edition of the master category for all 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 tanks heading in which i get a mark 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.080
 klassnost master on technique name 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 which you specify in the comments 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.470
 I remind you that in the description of this video 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.330
 There is a list of tanks that have already been 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.099
 received mark of class master 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.349
 so before you attach your 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.800
 candidate please take a look at this 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.200
 list 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.329
 Today we will talk about the tank which 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 There have not been any videos on the channel 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.890
 here's a fan namely about the German panther 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 which in our game is average 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.899
 the tank of the seventh level is a st-scale not 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.730
 quite ordinary barn on me like any 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.890
 another German tank but at the same time 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.949
 possesses very high for this level 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.539
 breakthrough and small one-time damage 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.910
 Some players even think that 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.640
 panther is fri-shka and partly they are right 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.579
 but still it's average so with which we 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 now take a closer look 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.630
 first let's take a look at the dynamics 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.790
 This German has the largest mass and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.900
 practically the most powerful engine among 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.210
 all classmates 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.400
 forty-five odd tons and 700 horse 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.799
 forces accordingly in the end we get 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 power density of almost 15 half 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.520
 horsepower per ton 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.830
 which means that for such a barn tank 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.689
 possesses quite good dynamics that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.909
 have back to defend the base or 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.850
 change direction will not make any 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.740
 labor and now let's talk about 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.630
 booking not for medium tank with 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.180
 this size is very important 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.770
 the regret option panther armor is not 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.689
 will allow you to confidently tank even 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.850
 classmates but here are the tanks of the fifth and 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.479
 level six will experience problems 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.490
 with breaking through 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.040
 if you hide the lower armor sheet and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.530
 you will turn the housing vld 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.570
 has a reservation of 85 millimeters under 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.189
 good slope so when successful 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.790
 setting the body you may well 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.910
 repel shells from some tanks 7 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.220
 and if very lucky it is from 8, but 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.500
 the sides of this German are weak upper part 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.210
 50 millimeters lower which is hidden 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.190
 behind the caterpillars 40 millimeters 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.679
 so you can only tank overboard 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.500
 tank fifth and sixth level 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.240
 should think before you do in 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.280
 there are blocks under the tower 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.500
 ammunition which is often criticized 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.170
 that's why I do not advise to tank on 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.540
 panther board in the forehead of the tower in our 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.820
 cats 120 millimeters with little or no 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.980
 tilt it breaks through quite easily a 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.660
 here is a mask I often saves sometimes 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.000
 even from tanks of level 8 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.010
 In general, the reservation is generally better 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.320
 expect once again not to be substituted 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.540
 let heavy tanks tank for you 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.850
 but still do not forget that sometimes 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.100
 exactly you need to take damage instead 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.600
 Shot Allies if glasses allow 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.800
 whose strength we have by the way 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.750
 quite a lot of 1300 units but now 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.120
 it's time to talk about our weapon 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.130
 medium tank as I said a little earlier 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.080
 she is tall enough for 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.000
 this level breaking one hundred and ninety 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.190
 eight millimeters armor-piercing projectile 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.070
 and two hundred forty four subcaliber a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.500
 one-time damage is 135 units 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.910
 precision instruments excellent spread on 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.980
 100 meters 032 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.000
 and time information is 2 point three 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.100
 tenths of a second 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.930
 although it is quite comfortable but 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.910
 after stopping and turning the tower 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.730
 have to come down long enough 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.100
 due to not the best stabilization with 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.380
 dispenser tool recharges for 4 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.510
 seconds it allows you to constantly keep 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.850
 on the rink of any opponent and without 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.310
 repair kit it is unlikely he will have left you 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.470
 vertical alignment angles are very good 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.120
 guns down 8 degrees a 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.130
 rises to 18 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.980
 in general, for the medium tank of the seventh 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.110
 level this gun is just fine high 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.850
 breaking through a quick recharge and very 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.070
 good vertical angles that 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.230
 still needed but because of its huge 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.690
 sizes not so good mobility 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.340
 like for example t-43 or comet on 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.350
 panther unfortunately not always possible 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.959
 play actively as usual average 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.340
 tanker so often especially if you 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.349
 are in the middle 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.300
 at the bottom of the list you have to play the role 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.400
 sort of frivolous and support allies 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.069
 from the middle and long distance 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.319
 but sometimes even in this barn you can 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.420
 play actively the safest it 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.940
 it turns out when you are in the top 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.920
 such conditions can be both skipped and 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.660
 push the direction the main thing is not 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.299
 acting alone enlist 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.709
 Allied support 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.800
 conclusion you need to remember about the review 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.570
 our medium tank is 380 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.790
 meters is a very good indicator for 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.560
 seventh level with illuminated optics 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.400
 you can quite effectively highlight 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.979
 opponents 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.669
 however due to its large size and bad 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.479
 masking 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.520
 this occupation is quite unsafe and so with 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.560
 tank we met and now the most 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.110
 time to talk about getting a master 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.600
 it took me to earn money 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.729
 spend 31 bout and it was pretty 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.220
 many fights in 1 degree where literally 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.320
 a little bit lacked to master get 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.039
 it succeeded only when I brought 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.020
 out of battle about 1250 net experience not 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.270
 I will say that I suffered because tanchik 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.190
 really very nice thanks 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.320
 excellent gun panther being in 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.850
 the middle or bottom of the list can be very 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.340
 not bad at this 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.110
 earning experience for the master while being 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.360
 in the top as I said you can quite 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.430
 not bad to play actively and earn 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.770
 experience not only causing damage but also 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.900
 colors for the allies in this battle on 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.000
 the sacred valley I was in the middle 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.099
 list but nevertheless decided to act 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.050
 quite active and at the very beginning 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.599
 I went to highlight the direction where 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.860
 usually heavy tanks of course 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.080
 shoot with strands 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.220
 this is not the best idea but if their 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.050
 constantly highlight 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.210
 and watch out for when they're shooting 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.849
 then you can go and make a couple of your 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.220
 shots then you can wait when 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.260
 allied tanks will go to attack to go round 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.660
 opponents from the rear and their impunity 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.160
 shoot but remember if there is a fight 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.500
 artillery she will surely be 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.780
 shoot it on you will not forget it 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.460
 then revenge and of course never 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.440
 we must not forget that opponents can 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.360
 grab the base always try to 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.270
 time to come back for protection and yes 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.460
 be with you master on this on 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.380
 today everyone thanks for your attention with 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.560
 you were tiberian subscribe to 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.540
 the channel is fan and do not forget to look 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.950
 on my channel there are also many different 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.950
 masters to new meetings
