00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.690
 I came to ride over mine 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.450
 daughter my daughter leighton has 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.680
 Start all over a long time ago and 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.520
 I wanted to know what my 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.800
 daughter that fourfold 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.540
 the main difference is that the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.489
 adult much rationally oriented 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.960
 conduct that is they rather think 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.290
 about what they do 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.000
 say in his child come sit down 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.920
 Now galloping around the wrong evaluation 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.350
 and jump on make the missing but 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480
 the adult already wonders why 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.989
 I have to do it how do I do that 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.489
 yes and also thinks about what can be done 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.350
 the job is going on behind it 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.530
 allowed professional life that is failing 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:11.289
 family and thus are attendance first 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.119
 many more fears than small 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.530
 endangered and I have eaten 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.960
 that really worked out 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.220
 in the very slow started and 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 keep on going with me 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.160
 horses busy and sometime 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.160
 the fear away 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.550
 Of course, first of all, I'm lost 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.460
 the theory-minded as driving a 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.410
 horse as factually a horse and have 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
 then made a base pass yes and 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.950
 then I'm at the cash register on the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.900
 small monti we from the further location 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.600
 tense 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.210
 Of course, the long mediates first 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.360
 not just a bit of security 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.830
 a bit more but a little bit more 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.540
 the rider is completely on himself 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.540
 Focus on his interest 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.670
 are actually present relatively 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.150
 fast here with us a riding gear 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.550
 Of course, every ground unevenness comes out 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.800
 mediates again another 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.390
 motion pattern and thus also a 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.940
 Another move robes is mine 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 balancing my watch is when I am 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.150
 I can also sit a horse 100% 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.910
 switch off there is the everyday life then 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.290
 I can really change one hour 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.820
 Hide and then when I leave the field 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.820
 It was usually better off 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.110
 The horses are also very important 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.690
 animals 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.100
 that must be like animals if 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.320
 then you walk through the area or something 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.970
 you fall down there you lose too 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.250
 quickly the desire and courage again 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.930
 not going to be the whole environment 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.290
 People do not have to be 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.700
 The facility is beautiful that you look 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.170
 because it can feel good that you also after 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.510
 maybe stay seated by the horse 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.430
 can drink and coffee or even 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.990
 you just say the sociable 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:06.600
 Being together is also very important 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:09.030
 you have to be careful that you are with many 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.709
 different people has to do 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.280
 you always call yourself an adult 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.510
 I have to make an effort for one night 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.790
 to improve 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.720
 because there are often asked question since 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.530
 you never have it yourself 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.140
 thought 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.370
 and you have to go there once 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.020
 answer to the next lesson 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.330
 and then at the morning 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.239
 tweet about it think how can 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.590
 I will explain this topic to you now 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.590
 and why is
