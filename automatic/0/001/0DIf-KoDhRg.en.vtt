00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.170
 i 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 hello good friends in this video I'm going 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.000
 to teach some tricks that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.080
 probably had not found in the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.390
 7x and and good 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.990
 The first one that I am going to teach you is in 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.540
 the settings and sound section 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.730
 in which is voice and is down here and it 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.940
 We give in response and vibration vibration 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.840
 for the subject of received 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.130
 here we can catch how it vibrates to access it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.260
 they listen 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.920
 long short fiction 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.589
 starting in tic tac lives 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.960
 but what he calls crypto decisions 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.980
 you can create your own vibration and it's 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.980
 playing here for example 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.890
 and well let's play 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.990
 Carmen 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.660
 and as you see here it is and we can 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.210
 save with the name we want for 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.860
 example I'm going to save is there here are 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.860
 those that we have created I have created 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.409
 and well you are going to create him that already 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.469
 has a time limit 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.409
 I'm going to do the first one the second 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:47.350
 what to teach is on screen and good 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.170
 something that could do is this turn on 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.060
 the screen that you see is not here and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.189
 well, we activate it and touch it 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.649
 quickly twice the center of the 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.329
 screen to turn it on will turn off 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.340
 when I double tap the bar 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.189
 status or in the diversity of the screen 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.509
 Starting the jee and blocking 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.219
 screen 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.910
 this means that we played twice the 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.980
 bar here and that's what the phone 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.819
 we give here because it is a little stronger 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.850
 here in the middle and as you see has been learned 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.570
 we can leave and 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.570
 as you see 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.490
 they have to be a little bit stronger and 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:32.010
 when they reach this point, it turns on 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.010
 the blue identification button 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.560
 good the last trick to decide what 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.510
 what we can do is enunciation of 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.480
 developer 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.480
 and here I recommend you do not do much 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.730
 and good out can be something for you 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.790
 give the cell phone that is the scale of 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.769
 screen animation that makes 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.920
 this animation takes longer in tickets 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.769
 example I will give in 10 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.330
 and they come as ventura as 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.280
 by default one comes 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.290
 how good to achieve forgiveness not very 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.710
 well I have put it in two which is a 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.540
 little slower but neither goes nor so 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.710
 slow nor so fast 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.520
 and good as you can see 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.520
 it's the only one 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.050
 another thing that he wants to tell you is that 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.210
 these topics that we can find here 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.120
 and I found a place where you can download 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.970
 more topics for example here is there 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.720
 ironman obviously started I know it seems 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.580
 As the 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.560
 more more more crazy light and obviously nobody 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.510
 it's called seve because there's no view 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.510
 previous but good we apply it 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.860
 we wait for him to load and as you see it is 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.800
 different 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.200
 download to try nothing else and good 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.550
 here as all applications have 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.210
 an icon 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.880
 and well there's a background and these are 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.980
 themes and good there's another video where they 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.180
 I will show all the links in fact here 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.069
 I have them in a note 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.259
 and good will we pass on another video 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.100
 and the last thing I want to mention in this 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:22.410
 video is that probably if it arrives 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.670
 android 4.4 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.220
 cat 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.220
 I say it because I found 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.740
 in a forum creating insurance is found 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.169
 the page you're going to pass in which 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.319
 the gio saco and the third generation of 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.939
 these and it comes in a cell phone with 512 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.220
 megas de ram 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:49.210
 obviously good screen 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.690
 and they came out with android 4.4 kitkat this 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.970
 maybe it might come kitkat for 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.610
 these cell phones later and good 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.470
 let 's hope so and until next time 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.060
 I hope you liked it like 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.060
 subscribe goodbye
