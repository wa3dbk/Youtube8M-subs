00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello it's loÃ¯c gardening this 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.540
 video is part of the series a kitchen garden 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.970
 to change the world 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.800
 in the previous video we saw 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.179
 why we must promote 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.950
 biodiversity 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.039
 despite the fact that it can go 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.720
 against our kitchen garden project 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.490
 this video I would like to explain to you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.920
 through the example of slugs 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.699
 why we must stop fighting 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.710
 the soup predators a consequence 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.410
 of command you will favor the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.230
 biodiversity and you will accept 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.170
 pests the holy slug a little 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 the public enemy number one of the gardener 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.010
 only very few gardeners the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.440
 really know the slugs are a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 little like digestive cells of the soil 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 their mission is to degrade the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.649
 organic matter that is not yet 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.899
 water compounds like leaves 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
 freshly fallen to the ground he stands 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.070
 finds that she also likes plants from 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.320
 the cruciferous family like the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.850
 cabbage and radishes it's true that at the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.050
 out of the winter when they do not have 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.969
 great thing to put in their mouths 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.189
 they can do big damage in 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.060
 our young fresh salad plants 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.950
 stung death the presence of slugs is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.720
 an indicator on the ability to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.490
 digestion of our soil 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.610
 the more they are - the capacity 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.380
 to digest soil is good we saw in 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.600
 previous videos that we had 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.790
 always made sure that our soil 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.320
 are covered this coverage to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170
 several a role to play in particular 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.250
 that of feeding the soil 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.650
 for this it is necessary that this cover 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.450
 be digested 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.700
 there are a lot of different actors who 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.610
 participate in this digestion and slugs 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.990
 and sowbugs a myriad of micro 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.180
 organisms and mushrooms these 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.420
 mushrooms are a bit the first 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.250
 link in the chain of digestion 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.840
 all these actors work together 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.579
 to digest the hand of matter 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.110
 organic soil surface 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.390
 if one of the populations of all these 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.640
 actors are in imbalance 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.540
 can for example end up with a 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.150
 overpopulation dimas 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.150
 and that for example because the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.090
 mushrooms are missing from our soil so 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.280
 in addition you put to eliminate the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.350
 slugs but you aggravate even more 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.130
 the difficulty the soil has in digesting the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.040
 organic material 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.110
 instead of eliminating these slugs it would be 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.430
 much more profitable to favor the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.670
 mushroom development by 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.710
 example I agree with you that 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.050
 it's not easy to know all the 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.200
 interactions between all these actors of the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.090
 vegetable garden I actually believe that we do not have 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.850
 need to know all that just 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.910
 to tell yourself that nature is efficient and 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.190
 that she knows how to establish balances if 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.070
 we make sure we do not see 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.100
 pests as enemies and that 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.700
 we accept them if we stop the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.030
 practice of the liter against nature is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.500
 well done it will be able to balance 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.360
 remember that we are part of 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.310
 of nature 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.660
 but do not believe for what we are going 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.930
 however, to sit idly by 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.550
 in front of the slugs stop fighting 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.550
 against does not mean that we are not going 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.620
 do nothing if the video you liked 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.620
 click on the thumbs up that's me 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.690
 allows progress to follow the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.760
 series a vegetable garden to change the world 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.980
 receive new videos by email 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.989
 as well as the beginner's garden kit 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.360
 you just have to click on the button 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.989
 in front of me in the videos 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.190
 following 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.190
 we will talk about weeds
