interestingly enough here's a drill that
went<00:00:13.910> away<00:00:14.000> for<00:00:14.509> a<00:00:14.539> long<00:00:15.139> time<00:00:15.410> when<00:00:15.559> we<00:00:15.650> were

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
went away for a long time when we were

went away for a long time when we were
all<00:00:15.830> trying<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.099> emphasize<00:00:16.610> a<00:00:16.640> deep<00:00:16.970> catch<00:00:17.240> now

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
all trying to emphasize a deep catch now

all trying to emphasize a deep catch now
that<00:00:18.170> we're<00:00:18.259> back<00:00:18.410> to<00:00:18.560> a<00:00:18.590> more<00:00:18.860> of<00:00:18.919> a<00:00:19.009> shallow

that we're back to a more of a shallow
pool<00:00:19.700> this<00:00:19.910> has<00:00:20.060> become<00:00:20.210> a<00:00:20.390> really<00:00:21.050> good<00:00:21.200> drill

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
pool this has become a really good drill

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.510 
pool this has become a really good drill
to<00:00:21.500> show<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.660> proper<00:00:24.230> technique<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:24.860> and

to show the the proper technique and and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.540 
to show the the proper technique and and
well<00:00:26.329> actually<00:00:26.599> a<00:00:27.169> higher<00:00:27.739> entry<00:00:28.250> a<00:00:28.279> higher

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
when I was up when I was a swimmer too

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.810 
when I was up when I was a swimmer too
much<00:00:43.579> more<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:44.050> hard<00:00:45.050> high<00:00:45.350> set<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:46.100> then<00:00:46.670> a

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
much more of a hard high set and then a

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.240 
much more of a hard high set and then a

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
stroke and really it's it all fits in to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.729 
stroke and really it's it all fits in to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
teach a good really good rotation and we

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.289 
teach a good really good rotation and we
want<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.979> little<00:01:10.070> bit<00:01:10.189> more<00:01:10.250> depth<00:01:10.640> because<00:01:11.210> the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
want a little bit more depth because the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.399 
want a little bit more depth because the
deal<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:11.630> when<00:01:11.780> you're<00:01:11.899> when<00:01:12.170> you're<00:01:12.290> young

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
deal is when you're when you're young

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.959 
deal is when you're when you're young
with<00:01:12.590> summer<00:01:12.799> in<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.189> you're<00:01:13.340> the

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
with summer in you and you're the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.670 
with summer in you and you're the
foundational<00:01:14.570> stages

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
foundational stages

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.039 
foundational stages
you'd<00:01:16.010> rather<00:01:16.250> be<00:01:16.729> holding<00:01:17.240> more<00:01:17.450> water<00:01:17.720> doing

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
you'd rather be holding more water doing

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.580 
you'd rather be holding more water doing
things<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.549> overemphasize<00:01:20.170> movements<00:01:21.170> that

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
things that overemphasize movements that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.410 
things that overemphasize movements that
later<00:01:21.920> in<00:01:22.190> your<00:01:22.310> career<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.909> can<00:01:23.060> slow<00:01:23.390> down

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
later in your career you can slow down

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.450 
later in your career you can slow down
and<00:01:23.900> you<00:01:23.990> can<00:01:24.140> kind<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.409> kind<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:24.950> kind<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.280> make

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
and you can kind of kind of kind of make

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.280 
and you can kind of kind of kind of make
a<00:01:25.610> little<00:01:25.880> simpler<00:01:26.240> motion<00:01:26.510> so<00:01:26.659> if<00:01:27.020> you're<00:01:27.200> in

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
a little simpler motion so if you're in

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.780 
a little simpler motion so if you're in
Asia<00:01:27.440> where<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.770> may<00:01:27.890> be<00:01:27.920> going<00:01:28.070> here<00:01:28.670> and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
Asia where you may be going here and

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.520 
Asia where you may be going here and
here<00:01:29.270> when<00:01:29.540> you're<00:01:29.659> swimming<00:01:29.840> not<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.320> bad

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
here when you're swimming not a bad

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.719 
here when you're swimming not a bad
thing<00:01:30.770> your<00:01:31.100> hands<00:01:31.310> gonna<00:01:31.490> be<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.610> little

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
thing your hands gonna be a little

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.210 
thing your hands gonna be a little
deeper<00:01:32.119> okay<00:01:32.630> as<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.560> move<00:01:33.770> toward<00:01:34.040> higher

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
deeper okay as you move toward higher

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.050 
deeper okay as you move toward higher
levels<00:01:34.960> all<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:35.990> fine<00:01:36.590> things<00:01:36.860> matter<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.490> I

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
levels all the fine things matter and I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.880 
levels all the fine things matter and I
got<00:01:38.540> like<00:01:38.690> Nick<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:38.900> now<00:01:39.140> strong<00:01:39.530> enough<00:01:39.560> to

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
got like Nick is now strong enough to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.260 
got like Nick is now strong enough to
hold<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.490> water<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.820> those<00:01:41.000> kind<00:01:41.240> of

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
hold the water in those kind of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.359 
hold the water in those kind of
positions<00:01:41.470> okay<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:42.860> it's<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.010> big<00:01:43.189> difference

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
positions okay so it's a big difference

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.149 
positions okay so it's a big difference
in<00:01:43.760> so<00:01:43.939> as<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.390> young<00:01:44.720> swimmers<00:01:44.990> hear<00:01:45.950> about

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
in so as as young swimmers hear about

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.910 
in so as as young swimmers hear about
this<00:01:46.490> flatter<00:01:46.909> strokes<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.780> more<00:01:48.110> drag<00:01:48.470> less

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
this flatter strokes the more drag less

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.219 
this flatter strokes the more drag less
lift<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.549> their<00:01:49.670> strokes<00:01:50.000> that<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:50.990> don't

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
lift and their strokes that you don't

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.530 
lift and their strokes that you don't
want<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.439> get<00:01:51.790> mistakenly<00:01:52.790> drawn<00:01:53.150> in<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:53.450> as
