00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.559

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.410

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:37.340
 death match we are not four yet a 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.340
 64 65 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.890
 it's true that my account is not for me 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:53.350

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.270
 and where I've come, it's him 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.600
 do not click on me to start doing more 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.199
 because we are many, even though 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.330
 I can hide and you look like that you have to 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.790
 use their tactic the even 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.060
 always and that's why he won in the 10 most 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.830
 I counted, you do not stand still and you leave 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.110
 that others go and if you see that they are going to 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.420
 per click you run away but not in principle 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.880
 you have to let the others fight and 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.190
 then when the last one is already 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.080
 damaged the entire super fight goes like him 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.050

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.340

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:36.580
