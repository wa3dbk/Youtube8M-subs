00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.049 
days
unlike<00:00:12.900> ten<00:00:13.380> years<00:00:13.620> ago<00:00:13.769> when<00:00:14.340> manufacturers

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
unlike ten years ago when manufacturers

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.550 
unlike ten years ago when manufacturers
produced<00:00:15.480> women's<00:00:15.870> skis<00:00:16.139> which<00:00:16.410> were

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
produced women's skis which were

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560 
produced women's skis which were
basically<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.100> men's<00:00:17.550> skis<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.390> with

basically just men's skis but with

female graphics on today women's skis
really<00:00:21.630> truly<00:00:22.050> are<00:00:22.289> built<00:00:22.590> different<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
really truly are built different and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.300 
really truly are built different and
they<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.550> help<00:00:24.090> women<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.050> ski<00:00:25.289> better<00:00:25.529> because

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
they do help women to ski better because

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.650 
they do help women to ski better because
there's<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.519> certain<00:00:27.090> amount<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.420> number<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
there's a certain amount of number of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.720 
there's a certain amount of number of
differences<00:00:28.109> between<00:00:28.439> women<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.980> men<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.429> I'm

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
differences between women and men as I'm

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.099 
differences between women and men as I'm
sure<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.029> know<00:00:30.150> let's<00:00:30.720> kind<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.929> talk<00:00:31.080> about

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
sure you know let's kind of talk about

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.620 
sure you know let's kind of talk about
those<00:00:31.529> there<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:32.520> four<00:00:32.759> basic<00:00:32.940> differences

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
those there are four basic differences

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.090 
those there are four basic differences
between<00:00:33.690> women's<00:00:34.350> skis<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.710> men's<00:00:34.890> knees

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
between women's skis and men's knees

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.990 
between women's skis and men's knees
they're<00:00:35.910> lighter<00:00:36.559> they're<00:00:37.559> softer<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
they're lighter they're softer the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.479 
they're lighter they're softer the
balance<00:00:39.420> point<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.020> moved<00:00:40.290> forward<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.309> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
balance point is moved forward and of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.650 
balance point is moved forward and of
course<00:00:41.700> there<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.180> prettier<00:00:42.540> graphics

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
course there have prettier graphics

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.420 
course there have prettier graphics
alright<00:00:43.469> let's<00:00:43.680> talk<00:00:43.800> about<00:00:43.860> each<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
alright let's talk about each one of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.850 
alright let's talk about each one of
those<00:00:44.840> women<00:00:45.840> skis<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.289> built<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.649> lighter

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
those women skis are built with lighter

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.560 
those women skis are built with lighter
materials<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.700> generally<00:00:48.149> women<00:00:48.300> are

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
materials because generally women are

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.330 
materials because generally women are
lighter<00:00:48.870> than<00:00:49.079> men<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.950> don't<00:00:50.129> want<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
lighter than men and they don't want to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.459 
lighter than men and they don't want to
have<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.520> push<00:00:50.700> around<00:00:50.969> 1520<00:00:51.750> pounds<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.199> ski

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
have to push around 1520 pounds of ski

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
have to push around 1520 pounds of ski
they're<00:00:53.309> also<00:00:53.699> made<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.329> softer<00:00:54.840> because

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
they're also made to be softer because

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.010 
they're also made to be softer because
women<00:00:56.250> again<00:00:56.489> are<00:00:56.640> lighter<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.539> they<00:00:57.780> need

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
women again are lighter and so they need

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.810 
women again are lighter and so they need
to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.230> able<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.559> flex<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.010> ski<00:00:59.219> completely

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to be able to flex the ski completely

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.990 
to be able to flex the ski completely
and<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> ski<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.989> made<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.410> 170<00:01:02.219> 180<00:01:02.609> pound

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and if the ski is made for 170 180 pound

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
and if the ski is made for 170 180 pound
man<00:01:03.300> average<00:01:03.840> weight<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.290> man<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.070> put

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
man average weight for a man and you put

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.429 
man average weight for a man and you put
120<00:01:05.820> pound<00:01:06.030> woman<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> they're<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.200> going

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
120 pound woman on it they're not going

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.630 
120 pound woman on it they're not going
to<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.590> able<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> speed<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.400> flex

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to be able to get the speed of flex

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
to be able to get the speed of flex
properly<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> ski<00:01:09.750> doesn't<00:01:10.049> flex

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
properly and if the ski doesn't flex

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.990 
properly and if the ski doesn't flex
this<00:01:10.770> he's<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> turn<00:01:11.580> quite<00:01:11.880> as

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this he's not going to turn quite as

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.570 
this he's not going to turn quite as
well<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> third<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> probably<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> biggest

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
well the third and probably the biggest

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.060 
well the third and probably the biggest
difference<00:01:14.970> though<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.320> mounting<00:01:16.740> point

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
difference though is the mounting point

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.240 
difference though is the mounting point
of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.580> ski<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> actually<00:01:18.780> moved

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
of the ski is actually moved

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.590 
of the ski is actually moved
approximately<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.520> inch<00:01:20.729> further<00:01:21.060> forward

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
approximately one inch further forward

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.649 
approximately one inch further forward
and<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.229> reason<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.659> men

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and the reason for that is this men

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
and the reason for that is this men
typically<00:01:25.320> carry<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.159> our<00:01:26.310> weight<00:01:26.520> in

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
typically carry most of our weight in

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.300 
typically carry most of our weight in
our<00:01:27.030> upper<00:01:27.360> body<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.750> our<00:01:27.900> shoulders<00:01:28.350> women

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
our upper body and our shoulders women

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
our upper body and our shoulders women
on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> other<00:01:29.579> hand<00:01:29.939> carry<00:01:30.600> most<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.020> their

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
on the other hand carry most of their

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
on the other hand carry most of their
weight<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.560> their<00:01:31.770> rear<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.280> their<00:01:33.030> thighs

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
weight in their rear and their thighs

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.230 
weight in their rear and their thighs
and<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> does<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> puts

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and what that does is is that it puts

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.260 
and what that does is is that it puts
men<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.590> more<00:01:37.770> forward<00:01:38.369> position<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.119> terms

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
men in a more forward position in terms

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.999 
men in a more forward position in terms
of<00:01:39.450> their<00:01:39.600> weight<00:01:39.780> naturally<00:01:40.079> we're<00:01:40.680> women

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
of their weight naturally we're women

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:41.960 
of their weight naturally we're women
because<00:01:41.310> they're<00:01:41.460> carrying<00:01:41.700> their<00:01:41.850> weight

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
because they're carrying their weight

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
because they're carrying their weight
behind<00:01:42.210> them<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:43.290> much<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:43.680> difficult

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
behind them have much more difficult

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.130 
behind them have much more difficult

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.700 
weight forward and she would say I am I
am<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.570> she<00:01:54.600> wasn't<00:01:55.049> getting<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> skis<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710

am but she wasn't getting the skis to
respond<00:01:56.070> properly<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.180> she

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
respond properly and that's because she

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.930 
respond properly and that's because she
was<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> pair<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> men's

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
was on a pair of men's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.360 
was on a pair of men's
nowadays<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:00.320> what<00:02:00.440> women<00:02:00.710> have<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.980> do<00:02:01.160> is

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
nowadays and so what women have to do is

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.590 
nowadays and so what women have to do is
they<00:02:01.490> literally<00:02:01.790> have<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.180> get<00:02:02.300> their<00:02:02.450> weight

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
they literally have to get their weight

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.840 
they literally have to get their weight
forward<00:02:03.050> just<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.800> be<00:02:03.920> balanced<00:02:04.400> on<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.640> ski

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
forward just to be balanced on the ski

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.340 
forward just to be balanced on the ski
and<00:02:05.060> then<00:02:05.150> being<00:02:05.390> able<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.570> push<00:02:05.810> forward<00:02:06.110> from

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
and then being able to push forward from

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.169 
and then being able to push forward from
there<00:02:06.590> becomes<00:02:07.220> very<00:02:07.460> difficult

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
there becomes very difficult

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.749 
there becomes very difficult
so<00:02:08.509> now<00:02:08.720> women's<00:02:09.140> skis<00:02:09.350> are<00:02:09.530> built<00:02:09.770> by<00:02:10.310> moving

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
so now women's skis are built by moving

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.840 
so now women's skis are built by moving
the<00:02:11.540> binding<00:02:11.990> an<00:02:12.140> inch<00:02:12.380> forward<00:02:12.680> gives<00:02:13.430> them<00:02:13.670> a

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the binding an inch forward gives them a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.850 
the binding an inch forward gives them a
perfect<00:02:14.180> balance<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.870> skis<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.470> normal

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
perfect balance on the skis in a normal

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.040 
perfect balance on the skis in a normal
position<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.880> now<00:02:16.910> when<00:02:17.600> they<00:02:17.720> bend<00:02:17.900> their

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
position so now when they bend their

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.090 
position so now when they bend their
knees<00:02:18.230> forward<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.710> put<00:02:18.830> their<00:02:18.980> weight

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
knees forward and put their weight

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.770 
knees forward and put their weight
forward<00:02:19.460> they're<00:02:19.820> actually<00:02:20.270> able<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.510> engage

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
forward they're actually able to engage

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.590 
forward they're actually able to engage
the<00:02:21.230> ski<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.620> make<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.280> go<00:02:22.400> around<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:23.240> women's

skis<00:02:23.810> do<00:02:24.110> make<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.440> much<00:02:24.650> easier<00:02:24.680> for<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.760> woman

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
skis do make it much easier for a woman
