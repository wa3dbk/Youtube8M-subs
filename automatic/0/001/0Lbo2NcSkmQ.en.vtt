00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.160
 after the playstation 3 presents 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.990
 we all actually only had one 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 waiting for that microsoft finally 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.870
 move on and now they have 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 announced that they will announce it 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.220
 be the new xbox and that too almost 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.320
 on your birthday right on the 21st 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.300
 may one day for my birthday 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740
 time has come 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.510
 they have not announced yet 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.189
 that they show the new xbox but it 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.560
 is basically as safe as it is 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.780
 at sony it 's just one of them 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.969
 xbox media briefing the speech that finds 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
 in redmond city ​​so to speak in the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.079
 near or even in the headquarter of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.989
 microsoft and yes I will personally 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.920
 also have the honor to be on the spot 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.780
 it was already at the playstation 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.160
 so that you not only really have a reason 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.960
 before she knew that she would be the one now 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.640
 announced on the event but that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.379
 also much that was previously rumored 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.940
 gave what should now be in hartmann 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.770
 the same confirmed afterwards 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.329
 what does it look like with the xbox 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 is there already a lot of rumors in there 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 will be and what she will look like yes 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.390
 So are correspondingly optimistic 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.460
 actually like sony 's on the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.020
 dishes are also what's up and there 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.659
 It is already very much in advance 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.369
 So what the architecture is concerned 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.390
 just assume that as with the ps4 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.990
 just a pc architecture with an x86 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.970
 processor is used so you have to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.950
 Watch if you only have four gigabytes 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.900
 memory or eight as in the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.759
 psp of the hindering details is exciting 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.530
 also what i do with the controller because 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.360
 the 360 ​​controller is with many people 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 very popular but there are also 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.780
 of course speculation that I'm doing it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.369
 change that maybe there too 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.729
 Anything touch happen 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.439
 is where touch is yes at microsoft 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.670
 rather so that you are infected so 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.590
 right with the whole body 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 and that's where we go 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.990
 from that at the new xbox kinect in the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.430
 already out of the box will be included 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.140
 just an advanced version where you 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 maybe even at home 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.079
 living room does not have to vacate all around 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.700
 but what I also with small 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.009
 Living room somehow tolerates and what 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.270
 maybe a bit more precise and 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 then, of course, for weeks 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
 speculation about the big topic namely 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.909
 always online so that at the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.020
 new xbox a permanent 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.220
 Internet connection needs microsoft has 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.880
 conspicuously in advance of this 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.770
 rumors 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.060
 denied and that's why I can 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.370
 already imagine that there is something to it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.080
 but I want to say that the next one 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.130
 big storm in the internet there 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.630
 is preprogrammed 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.070
 I'm also thinking in Germany right now 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.450
 because we are already on the dsl 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.920
 Throttle upset that fits at all 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.210
 somehow not together somehow 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.860
 they did not talk that way 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.630
 I have the feeling that it fits 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.780
 really not together the german is 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.210
 yes he is always considered particularly critical 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.880
 I think that's a good thing and I think so 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.800
 it's really about the principle 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.090
 So whether in practice because there is 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.920
 People who say that is in practice 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.820
 not so bad is the problem 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.610
 but always online 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.300
 especially in Germany, it is so if you 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.760
 Look at what's up with yours too 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.980
 for example, was or as with simcity 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.630
 always when such a peg at the horizon 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.130
 then is the German stop 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.709
 especially critical and expresses itself 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.850
 same time very negative okay that is 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.840
 quite possibly this event too 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.120
 with a bit of mixed feelings 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.709
 contrary yes so basically I'm glad 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.020
 me of course always totally new 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.430
 Consoles and still can not 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.780
 rightly believe that they do that 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.840
 maybe they will do it too 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.010
 You are welcome to do user but in europe 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.930
 go watch as I said still a 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.970
 a little different but otherwise happy 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.269
 I'm really into it, I believe that 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.100
 the technology npd ps4 is very much in the center 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.049
 First I will go too 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.580
 from that to see the console itself 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.260
 will be 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.000
 but it is technically playing 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.320
 probably then on the e3 couple 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.480
 Weeks later really go around 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.610
 but of course I would be happy 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.019
 if you are the big microsoft brands 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.160
 halo forza if he is a bit 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.180
 what will be seen 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.820
 I can also imagine very well 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.010
 that the other party leads 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.080
 franchise where now the announcement the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.549
 Next should be the keyword 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.290
 call of duty that showed something 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.700
 becomes 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.860
 Of course we will stop you there as well 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.560
 the current one 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.560
 In any case, I am too
