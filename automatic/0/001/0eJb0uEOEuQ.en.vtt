00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 Y 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.690
 very good to all people that such as 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.759
 you and welcome to this new video 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.610
 33 I think that the third or fourth 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.789
 I upload consecutive and good this different 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.980
 because it is 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.630
 a game in a new game mode of 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.169
 overcoming the air dominance person 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.460
 the new dlc the game on the map good 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.380
 the map and amet and on the map I do not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.480
 agreement but that 's pretty enough 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.949
 pretty good and especially this way that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.980
 is the one that I liked most of all and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.100
 they know that with each lesson he took a mode 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.780
 again again either scavenger in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.870
 the previous one here 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.050
 take the flag and air determination 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.309
 good many many many of ways of 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
 game the different essec have 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.589
 out that if they follow the saga the saga 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 battlefield will already know more or less than 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.850
 I speak and this module for me has been 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.720
 the best of all those who have taken the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.869
 if you like it in air vehicles 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.330
 if you like the realization that I've done 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.340
 says in this type of vehicle in this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.130
 battlefield room to me it seems 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.360
 as realistic as the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.360
 10 helicopters 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.060
 variability with them is excellent and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.190
 this game mode is kind of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.920
 aerial conquest vale is a conquest 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.550
 where you can only take a jet with 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.890
 flanker and face controlled and this 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.350
 the other team, as you can see in 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.750
 screen at the same time we have to go 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.850
 taking the flags the three flags 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.550
 what's around the map and what are 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.020
 signaled apart from with abc well with 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.570
 the balloon since we had now to the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.630
 right 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.580
 if you know how to handle the jet this is your game 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.770
 because the truth is that that's a lot 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.950
 of points with the jet and you pass it pump 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.240
 and they do not prove it patrol because if one 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.760
 of the first to get down there is no 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.710
 they had all my friends still come 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.020
 ambassador but if you can patrol it 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.150
 this has to be freaky and if not what 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.920
 you play in patrol and you are bad then I 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.990
 also better because the jet will go up 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.940
 then to a new one at a devilish pace 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.890
 that although I did not kill anyone you go with 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.940
 to collect flags even if you know how to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.010
 the right joystick from left to 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.400
 right and go taking flags then you 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.040
 is giving 250 points for neutralization and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.290
 I caught flag I think they are 250 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.700
 approximately they know that I 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.379
 I still do not see 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.260
 not my site very well in this way the 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.750
 lose eyes 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.599
 and well I have also played to take the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.790
 flag and such but not much because the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.860
 truth is that this way I fell in love from 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.920
 the first moment I saw him from 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.629
 that I knew it was going to be and it's from this 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.440
 game mode would be that this was going to be 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.090
 my game mode and one thing motivated 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.829
 top right inside the cabin 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.750
 and someone who can see on the screen 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.069
 Like some little things marked some numbers 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.620
 that most do not know what 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.810
 it means worth it because there are two numbers 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.180
 superiors marked with a square 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.950
 they are inside a square the number 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.849
 upper right that is inside the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.420
 square never never should never get over 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.489
 the 700 in this game mode because it's worth 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.730
 is the number that is inside the 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.190
 right square that specifies the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.389
 height at which you are if the 700 passes 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.599
 feet you'll run aground the typical one when 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.489
 you get the plane up there, it's worth it 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.300
 it is stagnant and costs a lot 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.220
 a lot going out 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.310
 here we find it from the 700 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.260
 feet not like in firestone today get that 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.150
 we found it from 2024 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.299
 to me good 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.769
 It gives me a little bit the same but even I 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.810
 It seems fine because in this game mode 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.189
 Interestingly , it is the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.739
 agent is the agent with the 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.290
 jets and go for the flag and not that it's 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.510
 in the very very high part of the map 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.790
 with the part so low at ground level 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.489
 so that no one will want it 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.340
 interesting after the air battle so 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.519
 it's how I would define it as the club 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.109
 quarters but aerial and already because I do not 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.569
 I have in PC because I started it has to be 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.730
 even more frightening because if it's double 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.180
 of Ecuador is therefore imagine you 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.780
 we have here 16 against 16 32 between 72 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.590
 I started would have to be amazing good 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.560
 good and how I got 250 points for the 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.419
 flag and 150 to neutralize the other 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.000
 I charged another jet and for what they give me 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.160
 100 more points plus the incapable e 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.400
 incapacitate the vehicle that good are 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.940
 another 200 150 points that the truth is 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.920
 that you climb very fast the jet 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.560
 and the points for minutes inside the jet 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.800
 that comes in handy to enter 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.259
 the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.710
 keys of battle of the battle fidel 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.509
 it's pretty pretty good and good 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.220
 to say more or less what I wear I think 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.620
 that I take inside the jet to do 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.750
 all this a little easier 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.490
 I carry if I'm not mistaken I've been in 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.150
 mechanics and engineers this so that it 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.940
 fast jet repair when you get to 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.500
 the bullets and then I also have me served 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.030
 to two as I was followed by an adjuster 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.940
 heat as you may be seeing now in 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.750
 screen and then finally I have the 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.400
 good flares what can change there 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.500
 more or less would be the flares by 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.960
 inhibitor according to taste you can change 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.569
 the flares by the ine door then 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.219
 you can also put mt of tools 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.800
 of this one so that you get repaired on the 10th 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:36.319
 fast you can put then 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.289
 the aerial radar or stealth the truth is that 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:41.000
 stealth I do not find grace in the 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.949
 damn thank you for you is never ever 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.530
 It has never helped me since the game but 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.030
 well there are people who wear it and he was going to 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.760
 to do it, it's me who has not 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.610
 used now 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.210
 people 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.189
 most experienced butterfield say yo 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.530
 that what led to the beginning 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.599
 aerial radar but say that here it did not work 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:05.219
 a lot because you see them clearly what 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:06.340
 then I changed to mechanical and then 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.830
 nothing 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.870
 me being points and the truth is that the 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.490
 three things that I've done have made me 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.580
 served pretty pretty well I've 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.800
 I really enjoyed the past 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.930
 this dlc is highly recommended in 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.490
 general in general at a glance is 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.840
 It is advisable to do an analysis 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.069
 deeper within a few days 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.039
 sitting in each of the modes each 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:33.560
 one of the maps because I think this 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.240
 from the sms to the small one as well as 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.800
 I did not like the others so much 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.229
 they have been quite pretty 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.330
 well they have been like the ones of the s 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:44.039
 normal dlc start battlefield 3 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.310
 but this is the one that has most 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.660
 liked even more than 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.800
 what 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.740
 maps default to 33 and by a 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.690
 thing I just ask you one thing to say 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.100
 when I understand it and I 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.100
 I bought is basically by the most 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.260
 large and by air vehicles as 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.850
 the helicopter that is one of the big 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.640
 things that the difference that they 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:10.250
 difference from their great compete the 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.370
 competitors today as I am today in 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.110
 competitors like but it's useful and it gives me 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.460
 the 14 of the good is not a competitor 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.780
 because he brings in the company but hey 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.270
 You do not understand 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.889
 and good basically that of vehicles 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.800
 aerial vehicles was what called me 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:27.750
 quite the attention of this game and what 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.120
 only one that he asked for the next saga of 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.610
 battlefield was an aerial mode with jets 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.130
 helicopters and we already have it or not 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.000
 I have nothing to complain about 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.610
 this new dlc 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.920
 have been able to continue improving the 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.800
 saga and without any that is highly 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.960
 advisable to pay 15 euros for it and if 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.580
 you have the prize so much better 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.170
 well, nothing, we'll see each other next 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.170
 video until next time
