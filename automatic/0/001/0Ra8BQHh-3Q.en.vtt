some typical features that you find in
most<00:01:32.999> kitchen<00:01:33.420> cabinets<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.380> example<00:01:35.039> we

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
most kitchen cabinets for example we

have a distance of 24 front to back

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
have a distance of 24 front to back
which<00:01:38.459> is<00:01:38.609> standard<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.179> thirty<00:01:39.420> four<00:01:39.719> and<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.539 
which is standard in thirty four and a
half<00:01:40.109> so<00:01:40.649> then<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.859> add<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> inch<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.399> a<00:01:41.490> half

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
half so then we add the inch and a half

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.179 
half so then we add the inch and a half
kitchen<00:01:42.030> counter<00:01:42.359> top<00:01:42.389> we<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.869> 36<00:01:43.469> that's<00:01:43.979> a

kitchen counter top we have 36 that's a
normal<00:01:44.549> height<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.029> that<00:01:45.270> enables<00:01:45.749> us<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> put

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
normal height and that enables us to put

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.169 
normal height and that enables us to put
the<00:01:46.380> range<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.950> dishwashers<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.909> forth

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
the range and dishwashers and so forth

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.699 
the range and dishwashers and so forth
under<00:01:48.450> these<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> appropriate<00:01:49.409> places

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
under these in the appropriate places

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.219 
under these in the appropriate places
there's<00:01:50.579> also<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.179> projection<00:01:51.959> on<00:01:52.049> this

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
there's also a little projection on this

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.109 
there's also a little projection on this
edge<00:01:52.499> so<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.039> we<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.490> another<00:01:53.700> cabinet

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
edge so that we put another cabinet

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.480 
edge so that we put another cabinet
side-by-side<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.170> joins<00:01:55.709> perfectly<00:01:56.279> at<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
side-by-side it joins perfectly at the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
side-by-side it joins perfectly at the
face<00:01:56.670> frame<00:01:57.060> even<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.349> sides<00:01:58.590> can't

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
face frame even if the the sides can't

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.289 
face frame even if the the sides can't
interfere<00:01:59.159> with<00:01:59.459> each<00:01:59.579> other<00:01:59.789> even<00:01:59.999> if<00:02:00.179> the

interfere with each other even if the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.730 
interfere with each other even if the
wall<00:02:00.509> wanders<00:02:00.959> off<00:02:01.139> and<00:02:01.349> that's<00:02:01.499> a<00:02:01.590> very

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
wall wanders off and that's a very

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.349 
wall wanders off and that's a very
important<00:02:02.279> I<00:02:02.340> think<00:02:02.429> as<00:02:02.670> far<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.969> design

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
important I think as far as a design

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.599 
important I think as far as a design

where<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> imagine<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.569> would<00:02:15.750> go<00:02:15.960> as<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.770> can

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
where I imagine this would go as you can

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.070 
where I imagine this would go as you can
see<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.250> has<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> Naylor<00:02:18.180> Strip<00:02:18.480> up<00:02:18.660> at<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> top

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
see it has a Naylor Strip up at the top

see it has a Naylor Strip up at the top
the<00:02:19.260> entire<00:02:19.530> cabinet<00:02:20.040> will<00:02:20.250> hang<00:02:20.520> from<00:02:20.819> that

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the entire cabinet will hang from that

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.000 
the entire cabinet will hang from that
it's<00:02:21.630> really<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.080> suitable<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.620> sit<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:22.860> the

above eye-level I know a lot of our
members<00:02:33.510> are<00:02:33.810> probably<00:02:34.709> wondering<00:02:35.040> where<00:02:35.160> to

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
members are probably wondering where to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.670 
members are probably wondering where to
start<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.900> it's<00:02:36.900> always<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> little<00:02:37.200> difficult

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
start and it's always a little difficult

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.290 
start and it's always a little difficult
to<00:02:37.709> do<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.459> thing<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.120> need

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
to do that but the thing that you need

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.420 
to do that but the thing that you need
to<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.870> measure<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.709> area<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.040> want<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to do is to measure the area you want to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.699 
to do is to measure the area you want to
build<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.820> cabinet<00:02:42.239> in<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.870> aside<00:02:43.500> from<00:02:43.560> that

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
build a cabinet in but aside from that

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.699 
build a cabinet in but aside from that
you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.069> go<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.340> home<00:02:44.580> center<00:02:44.940> or<00:02:45.180> a

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
you can go to a home center or a

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.720 
you can go to a home center or a
neighbor's<00:02:46.709> kitchen<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.310> matter<00:02:47.489> look

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
neighbor's kitchen for that matter look

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.880 
neighbor's kitchen for that matter look
at<00:02:47.790> your<00:02:47.970> own<00:02:48.060> present<00:02:48.510> kitchen<00:02:48.870> look<00:02:49.709> how<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
at your own present kitchen look how the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.520 
at your own present kitchen look how the
cabinets<00:02:50.370> are<00:02:50.730> built<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.780> decide<00:02:51.959> though

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
cabinets are built and and decide though

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.780 
cabinets are built and and decide though
you<00:02:52.800> know<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> features<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.550> want<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
you know the features that you want to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120 
you know the features that you want to
put<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.660> go<00:02:54.900> from<00:02:55.050> there<00:02:55.260> yeah<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.010> think

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
put in and go from there yeah I think

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.920 
put in and go from there yeah I think
not<00:02:56.519> only<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.970> as<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.360> look<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:57.660> different

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
not only that as you look at different

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.320 
not only that as you look at different
people's<00:02:58.760> interpretation<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.940> design

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
people's interpretation and design

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.580 
people's interpretation and design
you'll<00:03:00.570> see<00:03:00.750> they<00:03:00.870> use<00:03:01.050> materials

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
you'll see they use materials

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
you'll see they use materials
differently<00:03:02.100> they<00:03:02.519> make<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.910> best<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.300> it

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
differently they make the best of it

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.110 
differently they make the best of it
they<00:03:03.600> did<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.110> Select<00:03:04.560> joinery<00:03:05.040> for<00:03:05.220> purposes

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
they did the Select joinery for purposes

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.449 
they did the Select joinery for purposes
and<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.810> that's<00:03:07.380> always<00:03:07.620> interesting<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.250> see

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
and and that's always interesting to see

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.460 
and and that's always interesting to see
because<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.820> think<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.090> learn<00:03:09.269> from<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
because I think you learn from that the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.080 
because I think you learn from that the
other<00:03:10.590> thing<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:10.980> when<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.519> start<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.820> plan

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
other thing is when you start to plan

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.490 
other thing is when you start to plan
your<00:03:12.269> work<00:03:12.420> try<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.750> make<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.080> best<00:03:13.290> use<00:03:13.380> of

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
your work try to make the best use of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.710 
your work try to make the best use of
your<00:03:13.709> sheet<00:03:14.040> stock<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.400> lot<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.850> times<00:03:15.060> somebody

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
your sheet stock a lot of times somebody

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.229 
your sheet stock a lot of times somebody
says<00:03:15.840> well<00:03:16.019> make<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.290> 26<00:03:16.800> deep<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.310> plywood<00:03:18.000> is

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
says well make it 26 deep and plywood is

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.150 
says well make it 26 deep and plywood is
48<00:03:18.810> wide<00:03:19.019> you're<00:03:19.230> only<00:03:19.350> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> get<00:03:19.650> one<00:03:19.890> cut

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
48 wide you're only going to get one cut

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.690 
48 wide you're only going to get one cut
out<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.489> it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
out of it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.150 
out of it
so<00:03:20.940> always<00:03:21.450> think<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.989> terms<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> material

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
so always think in terms of the material

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.039 
so always think in terms of the material
typically<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:24.030> 8<00:03:24.209> feet<00:03:24.239> long<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:24.930> can

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
typically it's 8 feet long but you can

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.810 
typically it's 8 feet long but you can
get<00:03:25.170> 10s<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.590> 12s<00:03:25.799> on<00:03:26.070> special<00:03:26.459> order<00:03:26.700> and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
get 10s and 12s on special order and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.490 
get 10s and 12s on special order and
that<00:03:26.880> may<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.120> beneficial<00:03:27.630> too<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:27.989> think

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that may be beneficial too I think

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.990 
that may be beneficial too I think
well<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> end<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.280> all<00:03:29.400> comes<00:03:29.640> down<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.970> a

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
well in the end it all comes down to a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000 
well in the end it all comes down to a
drawing<00:03:30.329> if<00:03:30.750> go<00:03:30.959> ahead<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.200> essentials<00:03:31.769> let's

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
drawing if go ahead of essentials let's

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.820 
drawing if go ahead of essentials let's
go<00:03:32.130> take<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> look<00:03:32.579> at<00:03:32.670> one
