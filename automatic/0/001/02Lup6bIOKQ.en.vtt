00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
this is Frank Romano for what they think

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.280 
this is Frank Romano for what they think
calm<00:00:10.420> welcome<00:00:11.200> back<00:00:11.350> to<00:00:11.470> another<00:00:11.680> episode

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.320 

recently<00:00:17.290> someone<00:00:17.560> sent<00:00:17.980> me<00:00:18.040> a<00:00:18.160> book<00:00:18.520> done

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
recently someone sent me a book done

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
recently someone sent me a book done
with<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.690> device<00:00:20.140> called<00:00:20.530> the<00:00:21.310> moon<00:00:21.610> jet<00:00:22.350> loom

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
with a device called the moon jet loom

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.260 
with a device called the moon jet loom
jet<00:00:23.710> so<00:00:24.250> I<00:00:24.279> immediately<00:00:24.460> went<00:00:24.910> to<00:00:25.029> their

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
jet so I immediately went to their

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.390 
jet so I immediately went to their
website<00:00:25.510> and<00:00:25.990> downloaded<00:00:26.590> all<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.740> material

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
website and downloaded all the material

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.429 
website and downloaded all the material
and<00:00:27.730> discovered<00:00:28.510> that<00:00:28.630> it<00:00:28.779> is<00:00:28.810> a<00:00:28.930> digital

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
and discovered that it is a digital

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.960 
and discovered that it is a digital
device<00:00:29.770> that<00:00:30.490> doesn't<00:00:31.029> use<00:00:31.920> essentially

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
device that doesn't use essentially

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.240 
device that doesn't use essentially
toner<00:00:33.970> or<00:00:34.270> ink<00:00:34.330> jet<00:00:34.810> it<00:00:35.320> is<00:00:35.500> a<00:00:35.530> process<00:00:35.860> with<00:00:36.220> a

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
toner or ink jet it is a process with a

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.300 
toner or ink jet it is a process with a
color<00:00:36.579> is<00:00:36.820> built<00:00:37.420> into<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.900> material<00:00:38.470> now<00:00:39.160> it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
color is built into the material now it

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.190 
color is built into the material now it
does<00:00:39.460> require<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.850> water<00:00:40.240> line<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.810> it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
does require a water line and it

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.010 
does require a water line and it
mentions<00:00:42.070> in<00:00:42.250> their<00:00:42.430> datasheet<00:00:43.060> that<00:00:43.870> it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
mentions in their datasheet that it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.630 
mentions in their datasheet that it
removes<00:00:44.290> all<00:00:44.620> waste<00:00:44.890> products<00:00:45.370> that<00:00:45.550> are

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
removes all waste products that are

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.280 
removes all waste products that are
harmful<00:00:45.970> to<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.329> environment<00:00:46.450> and<00:00:46.960> only

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
harmful to the environment and only

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.520 
harmful to the environment and only
water<00:00:47.560> goes<00:00:47.800> out

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.649 

which<00:00:53.039> would<00:00:53.219> tell<00:00:53.429> me<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.909> the<00:00:54.059> material<00:00:54.539> is

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
which would tell me that the material is

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.959 
which would tell me that the material is
somewhat<00:00:55.019> like<00:00:55.230> silver<00:00:55.800> halide<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
somewhat like silver halide in that it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
somewhat like silver halide in that it
must<00:00:57.149> contain<00:00:57.539> some<00:00:57.899> kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> material<00:00:58.589> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
must contain some kind of material of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.939 
must contain some kind of material of
particles<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.479> in<00:01:01.260> any<00:01:01.440> case<00:01:01.739> that's

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
particles like that in any case that's

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.990 
particles like that in any case that's
besides<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> point

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
besides the point

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
besides the point
the<00:01:03.449> real<00:01:03.659> point<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the real point is that this is the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.859 
the real point is that this is the
highest<00:01:05.430> quality<00:01:05.759> printing<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.720> ever

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
highest quality printing I have ever

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.289 
highest quality printing I have ever
seen<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.979> talking<00:01:08.399> about<00:01:08.520> photographic

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
seen we're talking about photographic

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.260 
seen we're talking about photographic
quality<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:10.070> now<00:01:11.070> how<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.490> they<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.759> that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
quality here now how do they do that

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.320 
quality here now how do they do that
well<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.259> because<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.770> RGB<00:01:14.330> they're

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
well they do it because it's RGB they're

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.679 
well they do it because it's RGB they're
not<00:01:15.509> limited<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.380> gamut<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.890> CMYK<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.060> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
not limited to the gamut of CMYK and so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.330 
not limited to the gamut of CMYK and so
as<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> result<00:01:19.110> they're<00:01:19.530> getting<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.130> we

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
as a result they're getting what we

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.730 
as a result they're getting what we
would<00:01:20.520> call<00:01:20.729> photographic<00:01:21.600> quality<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.289> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
would call photographic quality and you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
would call photographic quality and you
put<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.159> quality<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.940> book<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.420> this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
put that quality into a book like this

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.380 
put that quality into a book like this
a<00:01:25.100> memento<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.340> memory<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> particular

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
a memento a memory of a particular

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.169 
a memento a memory of a particular
occasion<00:01:27.899> like<00:01:28.679> a<00:01:28.740> wedding<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.819> wedding

remember this is the kind of thing they
really<00:01:43.410> want<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.520> photo<00:01:44.940> book<00:01:45.360> they

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
really want this is the photo book they

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.720 
really want this is the photo book they
used<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> past<00:01:46.650> where<00:01:47.580> the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
used to have in the past where the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.120 
used to have in the past where the
photography<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.510> mounted<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.620> bound

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
photography was mounted and and bound

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
photography was mounted and and bound
into<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.520> book<00:01:50.730> in<00:01:50.880> some<00:01:51.120> way<00:01:51.320> now<00:01:52.320> not<00:01:52.680> only

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
into a book in some way now not only

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.190 
into a book in some way now not only
does<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> technology<00:01:53.460> handle<00:01:54.240> photographs

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
does the technology handle photographs

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.650 
does the technology handle photographs
it<00:01:55.350> also<00:01:55.560> handles<00:01:56.040> vector<00:01:56.340> art<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.030> again

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
it also handles vector art and again

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.570 
it also handles vector art and again
because<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> RGB<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:59.070> gamut<00:01:59.460> is

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
because of the RGB the gamut is

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.390 
because of the RGB the gamut is
unbelievable<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.200> handles<00:02:01.710> Pantone<00:02:02.100> colors

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
unbelievable and handles Pantone colors

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.750 
unbelievable and handles Pantone colors
extremely<00:02:03.240> well<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:05.400> look<00:02:05.430> at<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
extremely well now as we look at the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.330 
extremely well now as we look at the
evolution<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.600> toner-based<00:02:07.200> technology<00:02:08.160> an

inkjet based technology at least with

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.320 
inkjet based technology at least with
the<00:02:10.649> inkjet<00:02:11.010> you're<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.880> see<00:02:12.060> light
