00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
good on heat obviously you can see heat

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.040 
good on heat obviously you can see heat
efficiency<00:05:26.180> would<00:05:26.300> be<00:05:26.449> better<00:05:26.599> if<00:05:26.689> I<00:05:26.840> had<00:05:26.930> the

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
efficiency would be better if I had the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.179 
efficiency would be better if I had the
2x<00:05:27.349> bonuses<00:05:27.860> but<00:05:28.699> I<00:05:29.379> like<00:05:30.379> this<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.740> like<00:05:30.770> the

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:31.189 
2x bonuses but I like this I like the

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.909 
2x bonuses but I like this I like the
speed<00:05:31.909> I<00:05:32.240> like<00:05:32.569> the<00:05:32.719> maneuverability<00:05:33.590> it's<00:05:33.800> a

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
speed I like the maneuverability it's a

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.290 
speed I like the maneuverability it's a
very<00:05:34.129> spawn<00:05:34.430> civ<00:05:34.639> it's<00:05:34.819> only<00:05:35.030> going<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.180> get

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
very spawn civ it's only going to get

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.990 
very spawn civ it's only going to get
better<00:05:35.449> with<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.080> double<00:05:36.740> X<00:05:38.590> hmm<00:05:40.000> that's

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
better with the double X hmm that's

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.140 
better with the double X hmm that's
quite<00:05:41.509> surprising<00:05:41.689> I've<00:05:42.379> always<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:43.279> don't

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
quite surprising I've always I don't

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.179 
quite surprising I've always I don't
just<00:05:44.270> sort<00:05:44.479> of<00:05:44.569> disdain<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:45.319> dragon<00:05:45.770> but

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:46.189 
just sort of disdain the dragon but

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.159 
just sort of disdain the dragon but
maybe<00:05:47.180> there's<00:05:47.360> something<00:05:47.569> here<00:05:47.960> I'm<00:05:48.050> going

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
maybe there's something here I'm going

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.170 
maybe there's something here I'm going
to<00:05:48.259> definitely<00:05:48.439> investigate<00:05:49.009> for<00:05:49.909> all<00:05:49.969> of<00:05:50.060> you

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
dragon founds out there you're probably

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.559 
dragon founds out there you're probably
like<00:05:51.860> yeah<00:05:52.039> I<00:05:52.069> told<00:05:52.370> you<00:05:52.520> Phil<00:05:52.699> I<00:05:52.879> told<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.360> I

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
like yeah I told you Phil I told you I

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.920 
like yeah I told you Phil I told you I
told<00:05:53.810> you<00:05:54.139> you'd<00:05:54.229> like<00:05:54.289> it<00:05:54.639> it<00:05:55.639> does<00:05:55.879> go<00:05:56.090> 81<00:05:56.479> kph

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
told you you'd like it it does go 81 kph

told you you'd like it it does go 81 kph
obviously<00:05:57.409> speed<00:05:57.680> tweak<00:05:57.889> it's<00:05:58.069> going<00:05:58.250> to<00:05:58.310> go

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
obviously speed tweak it's going to go

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.850 
obviously speed tweak it's going to go
faster<00:05:58.879> around<00:05:59.300> what<00:05:59.479> ten<00:05:59.659> percent<00:06:00.110> so<00:06:00.800> you

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
faster around what ten percent so you

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.269 
faster around what ten percent so you
know<00:06:01.009> pushing<00:06:01.279> you<00:06:01.909> know<00:06:02.000> upper<00:06:02.270> 80s<00:06:02.629> but<00:06:03.379> 406

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
know pushing you know upper 80s but 406
