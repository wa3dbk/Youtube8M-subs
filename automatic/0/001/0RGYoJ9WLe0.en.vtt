first I have the amount I have America

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
first I have the amount I have America
lined<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.440> then<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:50.219> these<00:00:50.640> two<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.660> two

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
lined up then the these two the two

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.799 
lined up then the these two the two
pieces<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.230> Asia<00:00:52.640> needs<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.090> there<00:00:54.329> but

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
pieces of Asia needs to go up there but

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.540 
pieces of Asia needs to go up there but
as<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.590> they're<00:00:55.829> backwards<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.370> what

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
as you can see they're backwards so what

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
as you can see they're backwards so what
you<00:00:56.699> would<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:58.590> would<00:00:58.620> bring<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you would do is you would bring that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.119 
you would do is you would bring that
down<00:00:59.239> flip<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.390> over<00:01:00.539> when<00:01:01.379> you're<00:01:01.559> back<00:01:01.829> up

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
down flip it over when you're back up

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.070 
down flip it over when you're back up
now<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> mess<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.270> America<00:01:03.780> though<00:01:03.899> but

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
now you mess up America though but

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.179 
now you mess up America though but
that's<00:01:04.199> okay<00:01:04.530> because<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.129> just

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that's okay because now you can just

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.910 
that's okay because now you can just
bring<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> down<00:01:06.260> bring<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.740> bring<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
bring it down bring that and bring it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.700 
bring it down bring that and bring it
back<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.290> two<00:01:10.290> America

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
back up and now we have two America

place now as you can see the other one

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
place now as you can see the other one
this<00:01:15.630> polar<00:01:15.960> cap<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.040> whole

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
this polar cap right here this whole

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.590 
this polar cap right here this whole
piece<00:01:17.430> has<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.759> right<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.509> we're

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
piece has to be right there so we're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.460 
piece has to be right there so we're
going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.780> bring<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:18.990> down<00:01:19.580> move<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> over

and<00:02:11.660> double<00:02:12.019> twisty<00:02:12.379> either<00:02:12.590> way<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.160> then

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and double twisty either way and then

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.970 
and double twisty either way and then
bring<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.550> back<00:02:13.610> down<00:02:14.200> now<00:02:15.200> we<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
bring it back down now we have the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.119 
bring it back down now we have the
northern<00:02:16.340> hemisphere<00:02:16.459> complete<00:02:17.269> again<00:02:17.540> and

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
northern hemisphere complete again and

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.290 
northern hemisphere complete again and
also<00:02:19.129> have<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.370> polar<00:02:19.580> caps<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.180> right

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
also have the polar caps and the right

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.390 
also have the polar caps and the right
and<00:02:20.590> some<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.709> them<00:02:21.830> are<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.069> right<00:02:22.190> places

is line it up like that and we have one
two<00:02:28.569> piece<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.870> place<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.379> have<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
two piece in that place so we have the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.839 
two piece in that place so we have the
Western<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.290> eastern<00:02:33.860> hemisphere<00:02:34.040> done<00:02:34.580> in

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
Western the eastern hemisphere done in

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.640 
Western the eastern hemisphere done in
the<00:02:35.420> northern<00:02:35.750> hemisphere<00:02:35.840> done<00:02:36.290> we're<00:02:36.620> just

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
the northern hemisphere done we're just

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.820 
the northern hemisphere done we're just
missing<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.370> two<00:02:37.519> pieces<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:38.830> southeast

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
missing the two pieces of the southeast

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.100 
missing the two pieces of the southeast
hemisphere<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.209> why<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.390> wanna<00:02:41.599> do<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.780> on<00:02:41.989> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.270 
last part just turn it and we have the
southern<00:03:02.329> hemisphere<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.950> northern
