 I greet all lovers of knitting 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.980
 In this video, I'll tell you how to tie a pattern. 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.120
 crochet 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:16.560
 how to cut the edge for stitching 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:21.800
 the items in this video also have a schema for 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.800
 which you can tie this pattern 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.620
 knitting a chain of air loops 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:41.290
 number of sample loops 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:46.570
 do not count knit first row 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 nakid on the hook and fourth loop 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:57.949
 Once-two-three-four we tie a column with 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:01:02.860
 one off is now in oblige one 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:05.990
 air loop do hooks on the hook 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.340
 skip one loop at the base and 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:22.659
 further knit 6 columns with one 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:22.659
 nakida six loops on the base 1 2 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.310
 you rome 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.799
 four 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.970
 five 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.600
 6 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.550
 Now we knit one air loop 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.490
 hook hook 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:05.510
 skip the loop at the base 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:08.860
 we tie the next column again 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.240
 skipping knotting the air loop 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.990
 hook up 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.570
 skip the loop and in the next 6 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:26.590
 loops knit 6 columns 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.590
 1 2 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.320
 3 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.620
 four 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.470
 five 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:59.480
 6 on the drawing is repeated knit 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.170
 the elements end the series as follows 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.209
 after cut 6 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.640
 posts 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.870
 tying air loop nakid 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:20.450
 hook skipping 1 loop 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:23.019
 we tie the next row one row 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.019
 knitted 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:32.329
 the row is knitted now we knock the following 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:36.799
 we knit a row of the last loop 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:39.590
 air loop unfold knitting in 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:44.000
 tying the first loop without a column 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:51.530
 nakida now column without nakida 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:04:01.449
 knit in the arch and then knit 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:12.129
 5 air loops 1 2 3 4 5 now 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:16.609
 we knit a single crochet in the arch 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:18.889
 once again knit a column without nakida in 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.690
 the loop that we have formed 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:27.110
 a column of the previous row now 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.750
 provyazyvaem column without sc in couple 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:40.250
 and then drawing repeats 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:44.300
 knit 5 air loops 1 2 3 4 5 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.630
 and repeat the vyvyazyvanie following 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.630
 element 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:03.240
 so knit until the end of the series row knit 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:08.760
 tying the last loop knit in 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:12.480
 crochet the column without crochet and knit 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.750
 single crochet last loop 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.750
 row 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:25.610
 we tie the next row 2 air 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.419
 loops 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:32.699
 unfold knitting 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:38.339
 in the first loop we tie a column with 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:42.139
 one nakida cape air loop on 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:48.860
 hook and now big archok 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.860
 we tie up 6 posts with one double cap 1 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.249
 2 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.770
 3 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.890
 four 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.730
 five 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.730
 [music] 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:27.690
 6 tying up one air loop do 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:35.100
 crochet hook in the middle 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:42.060
 single crochet 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:44.180
 and then a couple also knit 6 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.180
 posts 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:56.210
 1 2 3 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.710
 four 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.380
 five 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:13.920
 6 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:18.570
 and repeat knitting a number of elements 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.400
 knitted further drawing repeated in 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:25.100
 this row will need to cut 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:31.530
 arches and in the next tie arches 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:35.940
 single crochet pattern 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:38.580
 The neckline can now be tied around the edge to 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:43.440
 determine how the edge will look like 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:46.260
 the finished product sample is ready now 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:49.410
 it is easier to calculate the initial 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:53.100
 the number of loops to determine but we number 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:57.980
 hook correctly cut the edge for 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:08:02.760
 stapling parts and experimenting 

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:06.560
 tying the finishing edge of the ways 

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:11.840
 finishing edge there are so many 

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.840
 knit with pleasure until new meetings
