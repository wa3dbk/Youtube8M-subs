00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
of these one of the reasons why I do

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.760 
of these one of the reasons why I do
really<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.369> track<00:01:24.140> although<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.409> did

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
really like this track although I did

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.230 
really like this track although I did
not<00:01:25.890> intend<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.640> sort<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> racing

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
not intend it for this sort of racing

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
not intend it for this sort of racing
but<00:01:27.479> from<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.680> somewhat<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
but from this you can somewhat get a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.760 
but from this you can somewhat get a
perspective<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> expect<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:31.110> everyone

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
perspective what to expect if everyone

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.830 
perspective what to expect if everyone

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
on in the lobby is in the same mindset

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.179 
on in the lobby is in the same mindset
of<00:01:34.020> being<00:01:34.049> patient<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.860> wanted<00:01:35.130> to

of being patient and really wanted to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.010 
of being patient and really wanted to
understand<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.700> car<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.750> gets<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> little

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
understand the car and it gets a little

understand the car and it gets a little
bumper<00:01:37.439> grindy<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.490> can't<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.180> some

so<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.590> try<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.979> yourself

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
so you could try out for yourself

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.859 
so you could try out for yourself
see<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.090> now<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.299> example<00:01:51.360> these<00:01:51.750> guys

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
see right now for example these guys

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.139 
see right now for example these guys
taken<00:01:52.170> inside<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.310> either<00:01:53.610> want<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.939> end<00:01:54.090> up

lot of speeds around corner because of

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.240 
lot of speeds around corner because of
his<00:02:54.060> turning<00:02:54.329> circle<00:02:54.690> however<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:56.010> more

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
his turning circle however you is more

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.099 
his turning circle however you is more
of<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.430> rolling<00:02:56.909> in<00:02:57.150> motion<00:02:57.540> when<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.930> take

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
of a rolling in motion when you take

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.050 
of a rolling in motion when you take
these<00:02:58.230> corners<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.099> give<00:02:59.310> gas<00:02:59.549> as<00:02:59.879> you

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
these corners if you give gas as you

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.369 
these corners if you give gas as you
taking<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.540> corny<00:03:00.810> gonna<00:03:00.959> get<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.200> may<00:03:01.290> go

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
taking a corny gonna get that may go

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.500 
taking a corny gonna get that may go
understeer<00:03:01.890> but<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:02.879> you<00:03:02.970> let<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> car<00:03:03.329> roll

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
understeer but if you let the car roll

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.470 
understeer but if you let the car roll
in<00:03:03.829> then<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:05.069> can<00:03:05.340> generate<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.299> power

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
in then you can generate the power

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.839 
in then you can generate the power
quickly<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.140> way<00:03:07.319> however<00:03:07.950> during<00:03:08.640> that

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
quickly that way however during that

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.190 
quickly that way however during that
process<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.299> Kareem<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.810> gonna<00:03:09.989> take

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
process the Kareem is gonna take

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.110 
process the Kareem is gonna take
advantage<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:10.890> because<00:03:11.159> all<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.849> gotta<00:03:12.000> do

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
advantage of it because all you gotta do

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.190 
advantage of it because all you gotta do
with<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.269> Kareem<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.599> break<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.109> then

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
with the Kareem is break and then

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.650 
with the Kareem is break and then
electrically<00:03:14.040> turn<00:03:14.280> as<00:03:14.549> your<00:03:15.120> morale<00:03:15.329> in<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
electrically turn as your morale in and

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.150 
electrically turn as your morale in and
you<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:15.840> instantly<00:03:16.260> shoo<00:03:16.560> out<00:03:16.680> these<00:03:16.829> corners

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
you can instantly shoo out these corners

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.349 
you can instantly shoo out these corners
because<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> power<00:03:17.639> generated<00:03:18.180> for<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
because the power generated for the

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.360 
because the power generated for the
curve<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.660> absolutely<00:03:19.200> insane<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:20.040> put<00:03:20.220> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
curve is absolutely insane you put you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.800 
curve is absolutely insane you put you
mostly<00:03:20.940> generating<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.299> power<00:03:21.510> through<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
mostly generating a power through the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.259 
mostly generating a power through the
front<00:03:22.049> wheels<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.620> car<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.819> sticks

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
front wheels of that car and it sticks

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.839 
front wheels of that car and it sticks
really<00:03:24.569> well<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.410> with<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.739> car<00:03:25.980> although<00:03:26.519> is

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
really well so with this car although is

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.220 
really well so with this car although is
quite<00:03:27.030> efficient<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.540> can<00:03:27.629> maneuver<00:03:27.870> really

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
quite efficient you can maneuver really

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.500 
quite efficient you can maneuver really
well<00:03:28.379> under<00:03:28.680> these<00:03:28.739> conditions<00:03:29.329> you're<00:03:30.329> kind

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
well under these conditions you're kind

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.390 
well under these conditions you're kind
of<00:03:30.540> having<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.930> deal<00:03:31.139> with<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:32.250> lack<00:03:32.370> of

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
of having to deal with the lack of

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.849 
of having to deal with the lack of
performance<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:34.230> know<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.500> doesn't<00:03:34.680> have

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
performance you know it doesn't have

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.080 
performance you know it doesn't have
quick<00:03:35.129> traction<00:03:35.489> like<00:03:35.579> I<00:03:35.669> said<00:03:35.819> when<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.030> go

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
quick traction like I said when you go

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.479 
quick traction like I said when you go
an<00:03:36.150> uphill<00:03:36.419> and<00:03:36.540> downhill<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:37.470> extremely<00:03:38.310> slow

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
an uphill and downhill is extremely slow

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.509 
an uphill and downhill is extremely slow
and<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.930> just<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.799> can<00:03:40.919> just<00:03:40.949> listen<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
and it's just you can just listen to the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.220 
and it's just you can just listen to the
Sun<00:03:41.730> for<00:03:41.910> car<00:03:42.120> paying<00:03:42.389> attention<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.900> how<00:03:43.049> much

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
Sun for car paying attention to how much

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.170 
Sun for car paying attention to how much
power<00:03:44.129> is<00:03:44.340> actually<00:03:44.609> generating<00:03:45.060> this

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
power is actually generating this

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.059 
power is actually generating this
there's<00:03:45.449> not<00:03:45.569> much<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.560> know<00:03:46.590> he's<00:03:46.889> just

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
there's not much you know he's just

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.890 
there's not much you know he's just
having<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.370> deal<00:03:47.519> with<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:47.790> he's<00:03:48.209> quite<00:03:48.510> slow

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
having to deal with it he's quite slow

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.309 
having to deal with it he's quite slow
on<00:03:49.560> these<00:03:50.069> terrains<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.669> over<00:03:50.849> 100<00:03:51.169> 8.4<00:03:52.169> is

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
on these terrains and over 100 8.4 is

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.559 
on these terrains and over 100 8.4 is
what<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.500> managed<00:03:52.919> on<00:03:53.129> this<00:03:53.280> track<00:03:53.609> as<00:03:53.849> opposed

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
what I managed on this track as opposed

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.960 
what I managed on this track as opposed
to<00:03:54.690> now<00:03:54.930> we<00:03:55.500> move<00:03:55.709> on<00:03:55.919> to<00:03:55.949> the<00:03:56.220> kuruma<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.730> see

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
to now we move on to the kuruma you see

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.449 
to now we move on to the kuruma you see
a<00:03:57.000> huge<00:03:57.540> difference<00:03:57.810> simply<00:03:58.769> because<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.220> his

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
a huge difference simply because of his

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.970 
a huge difference simply because of his
traction<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.209> also<00:04:00.930> its<00:04:01.109> brakes<00:04:01.410> helping<00:04:01.859> out

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
traction and also its brakes helping out

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.589 
traction and also its brakes helping out
as<00:04:02.129> well<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.579> Kareem<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:02.940> brakes<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.480> should

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
as well the Kareem is brakes that should

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.140 
as well the Kareem is brakes that should
be<00:04:03.660> really<00:04:03.870> awesome<00:04:04.079> on<00:04:04.620> these<00:04:05.459> terrains<00:04:05.819> you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
be really awesome on these terrains you

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.839 
be really awesome on these terrains you
know<00:04:06.269> if<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.599> brake<00:04:06.959> early<00:04:07.169> and<00:04:07.769> then<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.730> let

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
know if you brake early and then you let

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.369 
know if you brake early and then you let
the<00:04:08.940> car<00:04:09.150> roll<00:04:09.449> in<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.930> turning<00:04:10.230> circle

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
the car roll in the turning circle

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.990 
the car roll in the turning circle
activates<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.250> can<00:04:11.370> generate<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.790> power

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
activates and you can generate the power

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.640 
activates and you can generate the power
quickly<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:13.079> when<00:04:13.169> you<00:04:13.230> generate<00:04:13.379> that<00:04:13.590> power

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
quickly and when you generate that power

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.710 
quickly and when you generate that power
the<00:04:14.010> acceleration<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.699> car<00:04:14.849> you<00:04:14.940> shoot<00:04:15.419> so<00:04:15.690> I

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
the acceleration of car you shoot so I

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.680 
the acceleration of car you shoot so I

version<00:04:21.100> by<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.459> way<00:04:21.700> but<00:04:22.180> from<00:04:22.330> normal<00:04:22.600> one

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
version by the way but from normal one

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.300 
version by the way but from normal one
and<00:04:22.960> even<00:04:23.170> the<00:04:23.260> armoured<00:04:23.590> version<00:04:23.740> just<00:04:24.160> goes

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and even the armoured version just goes

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.250 
and even the armoured version just goes
flying<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:25.180> I'm<00:04:25.270> kind<00:04:25.480> of<00:04:25.540> chasing<00:04:25.870> Murph

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
flying so I'm kind of chasing Murph

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.860 
flying so I'm kind of chasing Murph
right<00:04:26.530> now<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.980> he's<00:04:27.820> in<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.300> believe<00:04:28.570> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
right now and he's in the I believe the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.840 
right now and he's in the I believe the
normal<00:04:29.470> version<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:30.070> think<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.760> the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
normal version I think that the

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.070 
normal version I think that the
difference<00:04:31.120> obviously<00:04:31.390> between<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.780> two<00:04:31.930> is

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
difference obviously between the two is

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.530 
difference obviously between the two is
that<00:04:32.260> this<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.800> obviously<00:04:33.070> heavier<00:04:33.400> but<00:04:34.390> this

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
that this is obviously heavier but this

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.600 
that this is obviously heavier but this
one<00:04:34.690> just<00:04:34.870> wants<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.140> stick<00:04:35.410> more<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.220> if

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
one just wants to stick more so if

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.460 
one just wants to stick more so if
you're<00:04:36.730> given<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.030> lot<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.270> bumps<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:38.290> better

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
you're given a lot of bumps you better

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.690 
you're given a lot of bumps you better
off<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.740> this<00:04:38.860> however<00:04:39.040> you<00:04:39.370> have<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.520> deal

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
off of this however you have to deal

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.620 
off of this however you have to deal
with<00:04:39.730> understeer

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
with understeer

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.540 
with understeer
due<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.840> its<00:04:41.080> weight<00:04:41.290> so<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:42.100> having<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.370> break

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
due to its weight so you having to break

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.400 
due to its weight so you having to break
early<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:43.480> when<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.720> break<00:04:43.870> in<00:04:44.050> early<00:04:44.290> you're

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
early so when you break in early you're

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.650 
early so when you break in early you're
having<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.680> deal<00:04:44.860> with<00:04:45.040> that<00:04:45.280> time<00:04:46.000> loss<00:04:46.270> I

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
having to deal with that time loss I

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.690 
having to deal with that time loss I
suppose<00:04:47.290> where<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.980> normal<00:04:48.250> career<00:04:48.430> mode

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
suppose where the normal career mode

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.450 
suppose where the normal career mode
sort<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:48.970> just<00:04:49.210> gonna<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:50.440> know<00:04:50.560> Bennett<00:04:51.070> sort

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
sort of just gonna you know Bennett sort

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.730 
sort of just gonna you know Bennett sort
of<00:04:51.520> take<00:04:51.670> advantage<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:52.450> its<00:04:52.740> maneuvering

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
of take advantage of its maneuvering

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.280 
of take advantage of its maneuvering
over<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.220> armoured<00:04:54.940> version<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.450> sort<00:04:56.230> of

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
over the armoured version and sort of

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.530 
over the armoured version and sort of
just<00:04:56.530> take<00:04:56.680> off<00:04:56.860> every<00:04:57.160> corner<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.390> it's

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
just take off every corner and so it's

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.270 
just take off every corner and so it's
nice<00:04:58.660> little<00:04:58.900> balance<00:04:59.200> it<00:04:59.530> really<00:04:59.830> depends<00:05:00.220> on

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
nice little balance it really depends on

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.040 
nice little balance it really depends on
the<00:05:00.340> driving<00:05:00.640> style<00:05:00.730> what<00:05:01.540> you<00:05:01.660> guys<00:05:01.750> like

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
the driving style what you guys like

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.750 
the driving style what you guys like
making<00:05:02.590> have<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:03.010> choose<00:05:03.190> between<00:05:03.310> number<00:05:03.730> one

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
making have to choose between number one

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.930 
making have to choose between number one
or<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.260> armored<00:05:06.190> one<00:05:06.340> but<00:05:06.520> number<00:05:06.700> one's

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
or the the armored one but number one's

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.040 
or the the armored one but number one's
got<00:05:07.120> more<00:05:07.240> freedom<00:05:07.480> you<00:05:07.690> can<00:05:07.810> do<00:05:07.900> a<00:05:07.930> lot<00:05:08.020> more

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
got more freedom you can do a lot more

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.600 
got more freedom you can do a lot more
movement<00:05:08.530> look<00:05:08.680> at<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.830> difference<00:05:09.220> now<00:05:09.370> one

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
movement look at the difference now one

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.520 
movement look at the difference now one
away<00:05:09.820> pointing<00:05:10.120> forward<00:05:10.390> Sultan<00:05:10.780> 104<00:05:11.320> point

four<00:05:11.710> three<00:05:11.920> two<00:05:12.220> with<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.060> armored<00:05:13.450> one<00:05:13.660> now

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
four three two with the armored one now

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.170 
four three two with the armored one now
that's<00:05:14.170> a<00:05:14.260> huge<00:05:14.760> difference<00:05:15.760> then<00:05:15.970> there<00:05:16.090> are

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
that's a huge difference then there are

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.960 
that's a huge difference then there are
exactly<00:05:16.450> four<00:05:16.840> seconds<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.310> see<00:05:18.460> him<00:05:18.700> I

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
exactly four seconds and you see him I

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.690 
exactly four seconds and you see him I
was<00:05:19.930> getting<00:05:20.080> consistently<00:05:20.800> 104<00:05:21.310> is<00:05:21.430> with<00:05:21.610> the

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
was getting consistently 104 is with the

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.250 
was getting consistently 104 is with the
number<00:05:21.940> one<00:05:22.090> here<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.900> this<00:05:22.990> particular

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
number one here and this particular

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.310 
number one here and this particular
attempt<00:05:24.450> it<00:05:25.450> was<00:05:25.600> just<00:05:25.810> one<00:05:25.900> of<00:05:25.930> those<00:05:26.080> things

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
attempt it was just one of those things

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.710 
attempt it was just one of those things
was<00:05:26.530> extremely<00:05:27.160> easy<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.640> maneuver<00:05:28.030> on<00:05:28.210> this

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
was extremely easy to maneuver on this

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.320 
was extremely easy to maneuver on this
condition<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.230> just<00:05:29.440> wants<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:29.710> stick<00:05:29.980> and<00:05:30.370> if

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
condition it just wants to stick and if

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.630 
condition it just wants to stick and if
you<00:05:31.419> brake<00:05:31.710> if<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.830> get<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:33.010> braking<00:05:33.340> points

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
you brake if you get the braking points

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.220 
you brake if you get the braking points
right<00:05:33.850> and<00:05:34.270> brake<00:05:34.450> early<00:05:34.630> and<00:05:34.900> let<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.050> car

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
right and brake early and let the car

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.380 
right and brake early and let the car
roll<00:05:35.470> in<00:05:35.680> get<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.490> next<00:05:36.760> apex<00:05:37.030> corner<00:05:37.300> and

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
roll in get the next apex corner and

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.350 
roll in get the next apex corner and
going<00:05:37.660> and<00:05:37.950> it's<00:05:38.950> just<00:05:39.220> being<00:05:39.730> patient<00:05:39.940> before

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
going and it's just being patient before

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.720 
going and it's just being patient before
the<00:05:40.480> bumps<00:05:41.320> are<00:05:41.470> jumpsuit<00:05:41.950> but<00:05:42.100> do<00:05:42.250> occur<00:05:42.550> you
