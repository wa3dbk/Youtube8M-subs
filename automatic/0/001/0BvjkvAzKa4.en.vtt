00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi guys and guys I hope you know 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.330
 find very well are welcome to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 flag the corner of the fifth form where 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.230
 we remember things and in this video 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.059
 we'll talk about this wants to know what 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.059
 This is because we are with video 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.359
 you will see the other day I had to go to a cafe 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.699
 internet because I had problems with my 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.699
 computer I'm leaving you do not understand me 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.079
 when suddenly I came across this 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.720
 that apparently still here the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.339
 they sell immediate day they came to my mind 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.550
 horrible memories so let's start 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.890
 talk about this extinct device in the year 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.930
 19 before Christ and had flat shape 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.180
 framed as the ass of its creator 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.189
 bill gates and it served only to generate 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.769
 problems first you had to take away the 

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:58.720
 sure moving this fall this button is 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.640
 ready because if not the computer does not 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.040
 he identified so that he took it away like this 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.079
 when you put it in, it made this sound and 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.240
 then I told you that it was not formatted 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:09.009
 so I was asking you if I wanted to give 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.840
 way to if you give it not, then do not 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.450
 you could use but if you gave him that if 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.970
 There were two possibilities the first non 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.680
 you can complete the format the most 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.320
 common and that you could very much there is a 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.630
 second the disc is protected against 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.080
 writing this was the answer that you 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.060
 I left 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.500
 more fucked up because you went to the store to 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.990
 make the claim and there magically 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.750
 it worked so you take it to your house 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.360
 you put it in your disk drive but now you 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.300
 the civilian jumped a detected a 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.280
 impossible to clean trojan that you want 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.500
 do something to the answer that you were 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.500
 because the result was always the same 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.200
 suppose I was lucky and elvis that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.299
 was ready to be used we started the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.119
 transfer of a file to the super 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.280
 Slow speed of 4 countries per second 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.720
 while you record 20 minutes copying one 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.270
 image if you realize that the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.950
 bisquet was already full so another advantage 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.939
 that they had the floppy disks is that only 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.220
 had 1.35 mb of space for 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.050
 store what you want so if 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.880
 I liked the games you could only 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.650
 save crappy games that sometimes 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.380
 we have to split into several floppies 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.540
 you are more images than currently not 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.670
 will exist the ideas the memories usb or 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.590
 the portable hard drives here that 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.840
 we would like to install some program or 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.989
 we play the conversion to avoid 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.140
 to delhomme and I would need 627 floppies 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.459
 for 935 construction to install 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.209
 the world of warcraft would need 5,590 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.870
 for the last fifa about nine thousand 333 and 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.910
 the worst and most likely you say that 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.930
 9330 you would miss an error and you would have to 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.670
 start over 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.440
 fortunately in today's physical 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.829
 who is out of work asking 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.829
 alms 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.760
 but do not worry if you already this 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.070
 it has floppies and they do not know what to do with 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.110
 they have downloaded a top 3 of how 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.190
 use a diskette currently number 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.190
 1 as a throwing weapon 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.440
 rather neck can be split with them 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.580
 the professors delivering jobs in 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.800
 them at work written thank you 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.170
 young but how am I supposed to revise 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.870
 this and no computer will not receive 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.820
 fraud excuse me I did it is what 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.590

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.240

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.640
 then you saying that I am a 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.560
 damn poor shit that I did not say 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.270
 that now then is discriminating me 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.310
 because my computer does not have internet 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.930
