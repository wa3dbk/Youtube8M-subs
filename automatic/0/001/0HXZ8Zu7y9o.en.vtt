00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.159
 of the raw sugar an interesting one 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.600
 variant includes the addition of chile 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.040
 serrano 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.140
 here our chile will be a 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.229
 medium fleshy green pepper 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.939
 spiciness in case it is cut a 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.710
 pieces are added directly 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.750
 to the dressing now sandra with the hands 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.619

 be careful not to use 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.689
 immediately just these strawberries but 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.759
 adding fresh halves of it is 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.000
 very important to reach two different ones 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.439
 texture in the dish a softer and a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.049
 more crunchy 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:18.180
 then let the strawberries rest for a 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.110
 now it must resume the taste of the innse 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.049

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:41.280
 minutes after which we add the others 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.970
 fresh strawberries relief that we are with a 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.970
 poet and who has it 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.670
 I call it complains 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.730
 and we skip for another 2 e 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.819
 taking the crunch we want 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.890
 we want to add our rules 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.830
 also of the chile serrano at this time 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.830
 because it 's a spicy minard 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.080
 at the fruit 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.069

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.610
 tortilla we made 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.610
 previously 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.660
 let's put it again 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.000
 a mint hill 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.450
