one of the things I like to do with all
of<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.650> character<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.070> make<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
of my character is just make it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.660 
of my character is just make it
transparent<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> freeze<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.340> while<00:01:38.549> I'm

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
transparent and freeze it while I'm

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.789 
transparent and freeze it while I'm
working<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.560> change

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
working with it I'm just going to change

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.980 
working with it I'm just going to change
the<00:01:40.950> geometry<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.950> I'm<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
the geometry here and I'm going to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.210 
the geometry here and I'm going to
freeze<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> character<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:50.100> is

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
freeze the character so that it is

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
freeze the character so that it is
frozen<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.210> can't<00:01:51.450> accidentally<00:01:51.960> select

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
frozen and I can't accidentally select

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
frozen and I can't accidentally select
it<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.280> first<00:01:53.549> I'm<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
it but first I'm going to go to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.469 
it but first I'm going to go to
properties<00:01:54.350> I'm<00:01:55.350> gonna<00:01:55.500> say<00:01:55.710> see-through<00:01:56.479> so

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
properties I'm gonna say see-through so

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.999 
properties I'm gonna say see-through so
the<00:01:57.689> whole<00:01:57.810> character<00:01:58.079> become<00:01:58.439> see-through

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the whole character become see-through

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.190 
the whole character become see-through
and<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:00.509> about<00:02:00.630> freezing

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and then I'm going to go about freezing

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.740 
and then I'm going to go about freezing
the<00:02:01.290> character<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> character<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.479> frozen

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the character so the character is frozen

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.719 
the character so the character is frozen
I<00:02:03.930> can't<00:02:03.960> accidentally<00:02:04.649> pick<00:02:04.829> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.340 

I'm<00:02:09.729> gonna<00:02:09.820> get<00:02:10.030> rid<00:02:10.180> of<00:02:10.210> my<00:02:10.420> tape<00:02:11.110> measure

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
I'm gonna get rid of my tape measure

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.960 
I'm gonna get rid of my tape measure
here<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:11.920> use<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.400> show<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> hundred

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
here that I use just to show the hundred

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.580 
here that I use just to show the hundred
units<00:02:13.240> high<00:02:13.390> cuz<00:02:13.810> we<00:02:13.930> don't<00:02:14.050> need<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.380> anymore

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
units high cuz we don't need it anymore

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.330 
units high cuz we don't need it anymore
I<00:02:16.380> start<00:02:17.380> all<00:02:17.470> my<00:02:17.500> rigging<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> left

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
I start all my rigging in the left

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.410 
I start all my rigging in the left
viewport<00:02:20.490> create<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.580> spinal<00:02:21.940> column<00:02:22.150> so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
viewport create the spinal column so

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.970 
viewport create the spinal column so
that<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.570> know<00:02:22.750> you're<00:02:22.980> developing

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
that you know you're developing

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.100 
that you know you're developing
everything<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.580> centerline<00:02:25.110> another

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
everything on the centerline another

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.600 
everything on the centerline another
good<00:02:26.440> thing<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.650> make<00:02:26.890> note<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.130> when<00:02:27.460> you're

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
good thing to make note of when you're

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.830 
good thing to make note of when you're
actually<00:02:27.760> building<00:02:28.210> two<00:02:28.270> meshes<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.780> it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
actually building two meshes that it

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.410 
actually building two meshes that it
should<00:02:28.960> be<00:02:29.050> standing<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.680> zero<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.420> centered

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
should be standing on zero and centered

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.410 
should be standing on zero and centered
out<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:31.720> zero<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:33.580> way<00:02:33.790> everything<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.240> know

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
out in zero this way everything you know

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.300 
out in zero this way everything you know
you<00:02:34.480> create<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.650> mirror<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.190> other

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
you create you can mirror to the other

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.950 
you create you can mirror to the other
side<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.820> know<00:02:36.880> exactly<00:02:37.000> where<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.750> should<00:02:37.780> be

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
side and know exactly where it should be

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.780 
side and know exactly where it should be
on<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.320> other<00:02:38.410> side<00:02:38.530> based<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.220> numerical

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
on the other side based on numerical

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.290 
on the other side based on numerical
values<00:02:41.070> just<00:02:42.070> turn<00:02:42.370> off<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.550> grid

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.449 

for<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.360> spinal<00:02:46.630> column<00:02:47.280> we're<00:02:48.280> going<00:02:48.400> to

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
for the spinal column we're going to

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.070 
for the spinal column we're going to
look<00:02:48.550> at<00:02:48.670> his<00:02:48.790> waist<00:02:49.000> somewhere<00:02:49.420> around<00:02:49.510> here

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
look at his waist somewhere around here

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.110 
look at his waist somewhere around here
and<00:02:50.290> that'll<00:02:50.890> be<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> center<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> mass<00:02:51.670> center

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
and that'll be the center of mass center

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.330 
and that'll be the center of mass center
of<00:02:52.240> gravity<00:02:52.600> for<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:52.840> character<00:02:53.340> we're

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
of gravity for this character we're

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.220 
of gravity for this character we're
gonna<00:02:54.459> start<00:02:54.670> with<00:02:54.790> one<00:02:55.000> bone<00:02:55.209> going<00:02:55.600> down<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
gonna start with one bone going down and

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.100 
gonna start with one bone going down and
three<00:02:57.130> or<00:02:57.220> four<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.610> up<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.180> then<00:02:58.810> one<00:02:59.020> on

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
three or four going up and then one on

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.990 
three or four going up and then one on
the<00:02:59.200> neck<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.530> one<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.830> head<00:03:00.010> let<00:03:00.820> me<00:03:00.910> go

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
the neck and one of the head let me go

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.840 
the neck and one of the head let me go
to<00:03:01.060> create<00:03:01.480> system<00:03:02.260> bones<00:03:03.220> where<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:03.610> find

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
to create system bones where you find

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.210 
to create system bones where you find
the<00:03:03.940> bones<00:03:04.500> what<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.530> find<00:03:05.890> is<00:03:06.040> with<00:03:06.190> a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
the bones what I find is with a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.480 
the bones what I find is with a
character<00:03:06.640> at<00:03:07.470> 100<00:03:08.470> units<00:03:08.770> high<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:08.980> actually

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
character at 100 units high you actually

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.400 
character at 100 units high you actually
have<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.700> change<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:10.269> size<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.900> bones<00:03:11.140> down

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
have to change the size of bones down

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.870 
have to change the size of bones down
quite<00:03:11.709> small<00:03:12.040> or<00:03:12.220> else<00:03:12.400> they'll<00:03:12.610> come<00:03:12.790> out

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
quite small or else they'll come out

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.170 
quite small or else they'll come out
very<00:03:13.060> large<00:03:13.420> at<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.260> default<00:03:14.890> size

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.580 

that's<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.300> size<00:03:22.510> 10<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.050> can<00:03:23.170> see<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.500> it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
that's a size 10 you can see that it

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.430 
that's a size 10 you can see that it
creates<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.950> bone<00:03:24.130> far<00:03:24.550> too<00:03:24.700> large<00:03:25.260> I'm<00:03:26.260> going

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
creates a bone far too large I'm going

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.230 
creates a bone far too large I'm going
to<00:03:26.500> start<00:03:26.680> with<00:03:26.800> one<00:03:26.980> around<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.370> value<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.880> 4

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
to start with one around a value of 4

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.640 
to start with one around a value of 4
and<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:31.510> can<00:03:31.540> see<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:31.930> creates<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.290> bone<00:03:32.470> that's

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
and you can see it creates a bone that's

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.220 
and you can see it creates a bone that's
a<00:03:32.710> little<00:03:32.860> better<00:03:33.160> size<00:03:33.490> or<00:03:34.480> one<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.810> size<00:03:35.050> of

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
a little better size or one of a size of

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.420 
a little better size or one of a size of
2<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:38.230> can<00:03:38.380> see<00:03:38.530> again<00:03:38.830> it's<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.100> bit<00:03:39.280> better

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
2 you can see again it's a bit better

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.700 
2 you can see again it's a bit better
size<00:03:39.730> again<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:42.930> always<00:03:43.930> start<00:03:44.230> with<00:03:44.290> one<00:03:44.470> bone

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
size again I always start with one bone

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.680 
size again I always start with one bone
going<00:03:45.040> down<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.270> going<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.600> be

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
going down and that is going to be

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.330 
going down and that is going to be
basically<00:03:46.960> the<00:03:47.230> hip<00:03:47.440> bone<00:03:47.650> this<00:03:47.860> way<00:03:48.040> we<00:03:48.190> can

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
basically the hip bone this way we can

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.250 
basically the hip bone this way we can
swing<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.760> hips<00:03:48.910> without<00:03:49.180> having<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.840> deal

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
swing the hips without having to deal

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.290 
swing the hips without having to deal
with<00:03:52.200> swinging<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.800> upper<00:03:54.010> body<00:03:55.110> for<00:03:56.110> the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
with swinging the the upper body for the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.900 
with swinging the the upper body for the
upper<00:03:58.300> spine<00:03:58.600> in<00:03:59.010> this<00:04:00.010> case<00:04:00.310> I'm<00:04:00.580> only<00:04:00.730> going

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
upper spine in this case I'm only going

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.940 
upper spine in this case I'm only going
to<00:04:00.970> use<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.570> three<00:04:02.500> bone<00:04:02.680> setup<00:04:04.440> up<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.800> base

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
to use a three bone setup up to the base

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.130 
to use a three bone setup up to the base
of<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.160> neck<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:10.120> like<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.420> separate<00:04:10.900> all

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
of the neck and I like to separate all

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.810 
of the neck and I like to separate all
of<00:04:11.170> my<00:04:11.380> parts<00:04:11.800> so<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:12.040> can<00:04:12.250> easily<00:04:12.640> break

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
of my parts so that I can easily break

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.550 
of my parts so that I can easily break
the<00:04:12.970> character<00:04:13.360> up<00:04:13.510> into<00:04:13.690> pieces<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:14.350> also
