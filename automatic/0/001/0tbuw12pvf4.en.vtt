00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.290
 hello to all of you guys I came back there 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.610
 I wanted to thank the members 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.189
 we are almost sv650 really many are 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.650
 went up a lot and so I wanted to thank 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.500
 doing a tutorial first I do 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.880
 running this game enough 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.160
 nice not at all difficult then 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.340
 let's say simple you can do is 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.160
 breakdowns and 12 your relatives let us tell you 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.660
 you'll be amazed enough first thing 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.579
 we ask the spectator to stop in 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.410
 any point by sliding the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.960
 papers I don't have a viewer I stop for 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.110
 example here now I call you say you did 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.880
 a choice that is not a random choice 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.160
 because actually I already knew e 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.090
 always a magician who shaq and carto you 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.730
 in fact you would have chosen I had made one 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.790
 prediction here and I had left it in the 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.020
 box of papers where it is written 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.670
 you chose the 4 of spades sorry who 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.180
 with the technical problem 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.369
 you chose the ace of excused spades 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.960
 if you see this the ace symbol 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.119
 not only a phenomenon of scoring however you have 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
 chosen the ace of spades 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.210
 ok let's check if it really is 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.229
 so here is a card, the card to me 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.189
 stopped the viewer 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.320
 and it is the black ace of spades now 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.330
 if I stop playing here it would be a 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.220
 rather trivial game 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.619
 that's why I chose to do another 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.470
 petition with the only black card written 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.850
 in a bunch of red cards I don't know if yes 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.600
 reads but I assure you that if you wrote 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.600
 so the only black card in a bunch of 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.150
 red cards let's check if 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.610
 really so we take the deck there 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.460
 we spread and we can all notice 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.860
 red cards red red all red 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.320
 red cards except actually 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.799
 a single black card that is just the ace 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.689
 of spades 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.299
 so we are doing a double 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.710
 really coincidence if we can tell 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.220
 inc 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.960
 ok now I want to explain this 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.610
 day here are the tutorials of this 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.170
 game that I think is really a lot 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.810
 beautiful and above all if not always 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.340
 requires some manual skills 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.050
 I chose to make tutorials the costs 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.570
 games because everyone can 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.520
 be able to carry out the first foresight 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.430
 that you need to have a first one 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.840
 apprehension up here with written la 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.800
 card that you want to choose the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.390
 viewer 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.460
 I chose the ace of spades so for 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.920
 make the game even more say 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.780
 nice I made sure it was the only one 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.880
 black card in a red card deck e 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.890
 I wrote this last prediction in 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.320
 low in such a way that I can explain 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.600
 first the note so as to leave 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.740
 only the first prediction is visible e 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.020
 fold again 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.580
 then insert it or inside the box 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.280
 I have below 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.870
 or maybe even in your pocket if you want no later 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.860
 the second court is clearly that of 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.570
 select all the cards in the deck 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.730
 except once you have chosen your choice 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.030
 that is black what you have to do is take 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.620
 the black card and leave it so first 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.430
 position you take it put it in 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.680
 first position 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.400
 Now go take a sledgehammer riffs folder 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.370
 this way the viewer can stop you 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.720
 any point such as here 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.190
 take and leave down at this point 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.320
 they seem to have chosen a card that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.860
 they want but actually when they tell you 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.810
 stop 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.730
 put down the first part of the deck e 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.310
 cover in such a way that the first paper 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.520
 salasso is here at this point is a lot 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.650
 important a break a little break 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.450
 that makes the viewer lose the sense 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.760
 that here is played for example 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.500
 Started talking that you know 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.940
 already the card chosen since you are gods 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.560
 magician in such a way that 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.150
 viewer no longer mind that his 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.500
 paper is this even if you don't notice 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.420
 link from the beginning but always better to do 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.190
 so you tell him precisely a small one 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.750
 pause talk a bit that's a lot 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.430
 important presentation inside 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.770
 of a game because you can make a 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.270
 really amazing simple game 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.280
 then go to read the 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.700
 first forecast you chose the ace of 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.430
 spades 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.180
 let's see it's actually right there 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.799
 and let 's say the black ace of it e 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.870
 at a later time, let them read 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.259
 the other prediction and you will show that 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.060
 remaining part of the deck is red 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.490
 now leave me in description on 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.280
 next tutorial you also want to 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.030
 a bloom of a cut of a 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.030
 mix what you want and me 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.020
 I will try to satisfy you all bye and 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.020
 thanks again for the members
