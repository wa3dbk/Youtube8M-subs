00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello greetings to all of us here we are 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.420
 new with new material this treats them 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.779
 about an application for users 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.020
 that have windows phone devices 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 an application which will allow you 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.689
 customize your home screen if 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.789
 you're tired of always seeing the same 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.840
 because normally if there are 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.750
 of the operating system windows phone 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.500
 we can only change the background of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 color no no not so much the images if in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.820
 some time you're bored to see the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.440
 same with this application can 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.119
 customize it there are some issues that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.839
 they come by default for example 

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:56.610
 Fantasy nature use the application 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.530
 also as the marketplace as 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.909
 Internet explores also come by 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 defect but we can also put the 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.850
 funds of each application 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.399
 choosing what of our gallery 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.219
 images the image that we want 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:18.119
 that application that is called skinner is 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:22.530
 available in the marketplace simply 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.150
 let's look for the application once 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.180
 that we downloaded 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:34.140
 remember that it is organized in a 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 Alphabetical and we want you to be 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.359
 we open it 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.729
 and it will show us an interface the 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.039
 really very nice to look at and how 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.179
 you can see time I'm there you are images 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.799
 of football for example you configured it already 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.479
 there are some that for example 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.030
 applications like the marketplace like 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.759
 we have said alarm the internet phone 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.600
 try what it brings and by default they have 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.880
 double image 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.069
 if you wait a few seconds you will see 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.500
 the effect that changes every certain 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.860
 seconds 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.990
 the truth is very interesting these these 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.640
 issues it brings by default as we have 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.140
 said earlier what has 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.330
 nature 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.240
 they say 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.760
 and those of fantasy but we can create 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.910
 us our skin or our theme 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.290
 just pension putting us in this 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.610
 part where he says create skin 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.540
 we play to begin 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.300
 and we get to select the image 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.750
 but we can select how you can see 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.700
 from our photo album 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.620
 I choose the image that you want or 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.140
 the album they want inside the soul 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.680
 can choose the image they want 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.390
 put as I'm going to put this to quote 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.390
 an example I'm going to put this caravel 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.519
 simply she has chosen in the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.310
 image 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.939
 we go in ok and we go to the next 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.939
 He passed 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.490
 gives us the option to choose two photos 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.770
 remember that we can also do 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.690
 from the camera album if they want 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.690
 put a more personal image 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.750
 can not also take it from facebook or 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.730
 cover of your facebook of any 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.730
 site once you have chosen 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.469
 we just click, remember, ok, there's 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.500
 to choose 12 images the first one 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:36.139
 we have done and the second is this and already 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 begins to create what the skin or the 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:42.799
 custom skin to put it on 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.230
 the home screen of our windows 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.730
 phone in this case I am using an htc 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.379
 with windows phone 7.5 mango we have not 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.889
 updated at the moment you see that they can already 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.060
 see what it is already is that neither has applied 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.340
 time here 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.319
 has already been applied with those two images 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.240
 the first image that you can see that is 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.800
 this one and the other one is that of the hip 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.800
 the very interesting truth 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.910
 Well that way you will have 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:21.320
 start screens 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:24.950
 and already customized with the images that 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.080
 we have chosen previously to choose 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.600
 also fantasy but I have put 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.290
 the example for you to see how it 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.560
 can create a skin or a theme starting 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.390
 of our images we can already 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.480
 example if we click we can go to 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.870

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.720
