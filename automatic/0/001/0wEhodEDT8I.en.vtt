these<00:00:02.429> are<00:00:02.610> some<00:00:02.879> tiny<00:00:03.360> teleporter<00:00:04.080> ports

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
these are some tiny teleporter ports

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.110 
these are some tiny teleporter ports
which<00:00:05.310> are<00:00:05.430> used<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.910> make<00:00:06.089> flying<00:00:06.390> fountains

the small hole is for exhaust the larger
for<00:00:19.050> charging<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:21.510> composition<00:00:22.850> which<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
for charging the composition which is

spin-stabilized<00:00:31.560> fella<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.480> has<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> fly

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
spin-stabilized fella so one has to fly

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.590 
spin-stabilized fella so one has to fly
it<00:00:34.700> with<00:00:35.700> his<00:00:35.850> own<00:00:36.120> hand<00:00:37.040> giving<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> spin

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it with his own hand giving it a spin

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
it with his own hand giving it a spin
with<00:00:39.989> his<00:00:40.170> finger<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:41.360> this<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:45.860> as<00:00:47.059> it<00:00:48.059> can

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
with his finger like this way as it can

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.600 
with his finger like this way as it can
first<00:00:48.690> aid<00:00:49.129> in<00:00:50.129> sky

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.600 

let's<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.390> action<00:00:57.680> first<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
let's see it in action first the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.440 
let's see it in action first the
roundest

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
roundest

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.850 
roundest
and<00:01:00.770> then<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.489> here
