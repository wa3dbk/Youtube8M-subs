so Kyra's home is out there somewhere

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.770 
so Kyra's home is out there somewhere
right<00:02:45.569> could<00:02:46.569> be<00:02:48.180> we'll<00:02:49.180> never<00:02:49.329> know<00:02:49.599> by

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
right could be we'll never know by

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.890 
right could be we'll never know by
staying<00:02:50.079> here<00:02:50.909> but<00:02:51.909> how<00:02:52.180> far<00:02:52.450> could<00:02:52.629> a<00:02:52.659> raft

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
staying here but how far could a raft

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.530 
staying here but how far could a raft
take<00:02:53.109> us<00:02:53.489> who<00:02:54.489> knows<00:02:56.219> if<00:02:57.219> we<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:57.579> to<00:02:57.760> we'll

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
take us who knows if we have to we'll

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.429 
take us who knows if we have to we'll
think<00:02:58.659> of<00:02:58.780> something<00:02:59.079> else

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
think of something else

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.500 
think of something else
so<00:03:00.189> suppose<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.450> get<00:03:01.599> to<00:03:01.810> another<00:03:02.049> world

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
so suppose you get to another world

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.589 
so suppose you get to another world
what<00:03:04.510> would<00:03:04.629> you<00:03:04.780> do<00:03:04.959> there<00:03:06.389> hmm

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
what would you do there hmm

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.849 
what would you do there hmm
well<00:03:09.379> I<00:03:09.670> haven't<00:03:10.670> really<00:03:11.150> thought<00:03:11.180> about<00:03:11.390> it

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
well I haven't really thought about it

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.819 
well I haven't really thought about it
it's<00:03:12.859> just<00:03:13.189> I've<00:03:13.999> always<00:03:14.209> wondered<00:03:15.200> why<00:03:15.560> we're

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
it's just I've always wondered why we're

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.459 
it's just I've always wondered why we're
here<00:03:16.219> on<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.730> island

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:17.469 
here on this island

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.489 
here on this island
if<00:03:18.469> there<00:03:18.920> are<00:03:19.069> any<00:03:19.280> other<00:03:19.459> worlds<00:03:19.819> out<00:03:19.969> there

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:20.499 
if there are any other worlds out there

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.300 
if there are any other worlds out there
why<00:03:21.499> did<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:21.889> end<00:03:22.069> up<00:03:22.219> on<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:22.549> one<00:03:22.819> and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
why did we end up on this one and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.920 
why did we end up on this one and
suppose<00:03:25.310> there<00:03:25.489> are<00:03:25.549> other<00:03:25.760> worlds<00:03:28.629> then<00:03:29.629> ours

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
suppose there are other worlds then ours

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.839 
suppose there are other worlds then ours
is<00:03:30.049> just<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.409> little<00:03:30.739> piece<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.010> something<00:03:31.579> much

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
is just a little piece of something much

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.210 
is just a little piece of something much
greater

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
greater

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.750 
greater
so<00:03:35.320> we<00:03:36.320> could<00:03:36.530> have<00:03:36.620> just<00:03:36.650> as<00:03:37.040> easily<00:03:37.070> ended<00:03:37.640> up

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
so we could have just as easily ended up

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.380 
so we could have just as easily ended up
somewhere<00:03:38.000> else<00:03:38.300> right<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:39.100> don't<00:03:40.100> know

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
somewhere else right I don't know

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.710 
somewhere else right I don't know
exactly<00:03:42.730> that's<00:03:43.730> why<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.210> need<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.390> go<00:03:44.600> out

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
exactly that's why we need to go out

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.280 
exactly that's why we need to go out
there<00:03:44.990> and<00:03:45.140> find<00:03:45.440> out

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
there and find out

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.310 
there and find out
just<00:03:48.290> sitting<00:03:48.620> here<00:03:48.650> won't<00:03:48.950> change<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.340> thing

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
just sitting here won't change a thing

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.050 
just sitting here won't change a thing
it's<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.440> same<00:03:51.710> old<00:03:51.920> stuff<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:54.260> let's<00:03:54.470> go
