hang<00:02:53.100> out<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:53.520> not<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.940> scores<00:02:54.470> so

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
hang out but it's not for the scores so

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.100 
hang out but it's not for the scores so
once<00:02:55.710> again<00:02:55.860> Alex<00:02:56.550> Blackwell<00:02:57.150> able<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.960> get<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
once again Alex Blackwell able to get a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.210 
once again Alex Blackwell able to get a
great<00:02:58.350> job<00:02:58.620> done<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.010> captain's<00:02:59.430> curse<00:02:59.930> and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
great job done in captain's curse and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.190 
great job done in captain's curse and
the<00:03:02.220> score<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.490> just<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.850> 19<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.390> again<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.900> think

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the score is just a 19 and again I think

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.120 
the score is just a 19 and again I think
because<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.560> lacked<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:04.890> wow<00:03:05.100> factor

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
because it lacked that wow factor

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.730 
because it lacked that wow factor
certainly<00:03:05.970> had<00:03:06.090> flow<00:03:06.360> in<00:03:06.570> momentum<00:03:06.840> Alex
