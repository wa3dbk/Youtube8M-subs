video and today I'm going to show you
this<00:00:10.250> little<00:00:10.309> contraption<00:00:10.850> I<00:00:11.180> made<00:00:11.389> that

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
this little contraption I made that

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.690 
this little contraption I made that
could<00:00:12.200> be<00:00:12.290> useful<00:00:12.440> i<00:00:12.740> can<00:00:12.889> invent<00:00:13.400> your<00:00:13.580> map

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
could be useful i can invent your map

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.269 
could be useful i can invent your map
with<00:00:13.850> something<00:00:14.060> like<00:00:14.240> that<00:00:14.590> it<00:00:15.590> uses<00:00:15.830> mainly

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
with something like that it uses mainly

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.970 
with something like that it uses mainly
the<00:00:16.580> pistons<00:00:17.029> and<00:00:17.270> redstone<00:00:17.599> and<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.830> Pistons

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
the pistons and redstone and the Pistons

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.350 
the pistons and redstone and the Pistons
are<00:00:19.369> from<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.180> 1.7<00:00:21.140> beta<00:00:21.410> update<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:22.360> first

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
are from the 1.7 beta update and first

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.609 
are from the 1.7 beta update and first
I'll<00:00:23.510> show<00:00:23.539> you<00:00:23.690> how<00:00:23.869> it<00:00:23.960> works<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.350> then<00:00:24.440> I'll

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
I'll show you how it works and then I'll

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.200 
I'll show you how it works and then I'll
show<00:00:24.650> you<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.430> behind-the-scenes<00:00:26.029> stuff

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
show you the behind-the-scenes stuff

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.740 
show you the behind-the-scenes stuff
with<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.420> whetstone<00:00:27.369> so<00:00:28.369> over<00:00:29.330> here<00:00:29.359> could<00:00:29.720> be

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
with a whetstone so over here could be

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.320 
with a whetstone so over here could be
like<00:00:29.960> at<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:30.170> end<00:00:30.199> of<00:00:30.470> another<00:00:30.680> trap<00:00:31.010> or<00:00:31.330> yeah

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
like at the end of another trap or yeah

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.710 
like at the end of another trap or yeah
and<00:00:33.489> so<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:34.550> can't<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.000> store<00:00:35.210> then<00:00:35.629> you

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
and so you can't to the store then you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.000 
and so you can't to the store then you
flip<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.960> switch<00:00:36.170> which<00:00:36.379> opens<00:00:36.710> up<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.860> door

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
flip the switch which opens up the door

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.240 
flip the switch which opens up the door
and<00:00:37.190> then<00:00:38.149> you<00:00:38.239> see<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:38.870> blocks<00:00:39.140> it's<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.070> lot

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
and then you see the blocks it's a lot

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.130 
and then you see the blocks it's a lot
of<00:00:40.370> surrounding<00:00:40.760> them<00:00:40.880> and<00:00:41.059> it<00:00:41.930> was<00:00:42.050> you

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
of surrounding them and it was you

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.420 
of surrounding them and it was you
secondly<00:00:42.559> we<00:00:42.680> tracked<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.160> then<00:00:43.250> come<00:00:43.399> back

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
secondly we tracked and then come back

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.729 
secondly we tracked and then come back
out<00:00:43.750> so<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.930> hard<00:00:45.079> part<00:00:45.260> about<00:00:45.290> this<00:00:45.559> is

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
out so the hard part about this is

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.740 
out so the hard part about this is
timing<00:00:46.130> it<00:00:46.309> perfectly<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:46.850> we<00:00:47.210> can<00:00:47.390> hop<00:00:47.570> onto

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
timing it perfectly so we can hop onto

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.030 
timing it perfectly so we can hop onto
that<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.110> then<00:00:48.320> hop<00:00:48.500> front<00:00:48.680> of<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.829> block

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
that and then hop front of the block

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.010 
that and then hop front of the block
that<00:00:49.219> doesn't<00:00:49.520> retract<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.090> then<00:00:50.780> do<00:00:50.870> that

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
that doesn't retract and then do that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.100 
that doesn't retract and then do that
again<00:00:51.230> for<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.440> next<00:00:51.530> two<00:00:51.829> blocks<00:00:52.420> so<00:00:53.420> it's

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
again for the next two blocks so it's

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.440 
again for the next two blocks so it's
pretty<00:00:54.320> simple<00:00:54.530> but<00:00:54.940> other<00:00:55.940> whetstone<00:00:56.270> wire

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
pretty simple but other whetstone wire

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.630 
pretty simple but other whetstone wire
room<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:56.719> pretty<00:00:56.809> hard<00:00:57.160> but<00:00:58.160> it's<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.399> simple

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
room is pretty hard but it's a simple

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.459 
room is pretty hard but it's a simple
contraption<00:00:59.210> pretty<00:00:59.510> easy<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.809> do<00:00:59.989> when<00:01:00.350> you

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
contraption pretty easy to do when you

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.709 
contraption pretty easy to do when you
run<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.920> time<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.250> right<00:01:01.329> but<00:01:02.329> I<00:01:02.360> think<00:01:02.600> going

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
run to time it right but I think going

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.770 
run to time it right but I think going
to<00:01:02.780> be<00:01:02.840> pretty<00:01:02.989> good<00:01:03.110> in<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.770> adventure<00:01:04.550> map<00:01:04.780> so

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
to be pretty good in a adventure map so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.510 
to be pretty good in a adventure map so
when<00:01:06.410> I<00:01:06.470> flip<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.680> switch<00:01:06.860> again<00:01:07.070> at<00:01:07.250> all<00:01:07.340> bits

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
when I flip the switch again at all bits

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.920 
when I flip the switch again at all bits
come<00:01:07.640> back<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.240> going<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.600> be<00:01:08.690> the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
come back and this is going to be the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.499 
come back and this is going to be the
whetstone<00:01:09.259> portion<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.920> this<00:01:10.039> video<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.209> as

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
whetstone portion of this video so as

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.940 
whetstone portion of this video so as
you<00:01:11.630> can<00:01:11.690> see<00:01:11.869> what<00:01:11.959> here<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.560> block<00:01:12.800> with

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
you can see what here is the block with

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.859 
you can see what here is the block with
a<00:01:12.979> switch<00:01:13.250> on<00:01:13.429> it<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.209> when<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.420> activate<00:01:14.780> the

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
a switch on it so when you activate the

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.949 
a switch on it so when you activate the
switch<00:01:14.959> it<00:01:15.740> sends<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.340> current<00:01:16.750> from<00:01:17.750> there

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:17.959 
switch it sends a current from there

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.410 
switch it sends a current from there
down<00:01:18.319> and<00:01:18.679> then<00:01:19.399> spreads<00:01:19.759> both<00:01:20.060> directions

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
down and then spreads both directions

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.559 
down and then spreads both directions
first<00:01:21.289> I'll<00:01:21.500> show<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:21.709> this<00:01:21.740> direction<00:01:22.569> it's

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
first I'll show you this direction it's

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.930 
first I'll show you this direction it's
what<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.080> current<00:01:24.259> goes<00:01:24.470> down<00:01:24.709> to<00:01:24.860> here<00:01:25.069> hits

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
what the current goes down to here hits

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.839 
what the current goes down to here hits
this<00:01:26.149> repeater<00:01:26.509> which<00:01:26.810> causes<00:01:27.349> it<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.610> go<00:01:28.610> all

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:28.849 
this repeater which causes it to go all

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:31.359 
this repeater which causes it to go all
the<00:01:28.880> way<00:01:29.000> around<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.720> clock<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:30.860> guess<00:01:31.190> it's

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
the way around this clock I guess it's

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.309 
the way around this clock I guess it's
called<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.670> camera<00:01:31.940> it<00:01:32.720> calls<00:01:32.959> it<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.200> go

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
called the camera it calls it to go

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.529 
called the camera it calls it to go
around<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.729> every<00:01:34.729> few<00:01:34.910> seconds<00:01:35.270> which

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
around this every few seconds which

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.180 
around this every few seconds which
these<00:01:36.289> which<00:01:36.800> disables<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.520> arm<00:01:39.190> whetstone

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
these which disables the arm whetstone

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.870 
these which disables the arm whetstone
torches<00:01:40.700> which<00:01:41.420> causes<00:01:41.899> these<00:01:42.580> Pistons<00:01:43.580> to

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
torches which causes these Pistons to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.779 
torches which causes these Pistons to
attract<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.599> since<00:01:44.869> icky<00:01:45.530> sticky<00:01:46.250> pistons

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
attract and since icky sticky pistons

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.550 
attract and since icky sticky pistons
they<00:01:47.390> take<00:01:47.569> the<00:01:47.720> block<00:01:47.899> on<00:01:47.929> top<00:01:48.080> of<00:01:48.319> them<00:01:48.410> with

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
they take the block on top of them with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.339 
they take the block on top of them with
them<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:50.000> every<00:01:50.390> few<00:01:50.569> seconds<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:50.959> does<00:01:51.140> that

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
them so every few seconds it does that

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:52.960 
them so every few seconds it does that
and<00:01:51.590> then<00:01:51.679> it<00:01:51.920> keeps<00:01:52.280> on<00:01:52.459> switching<00:01:52.819> between

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
and then it keeps on switching between

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.389 
and then it keeps on switching between
activated<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.110> deactivated<00:01:54.220> so<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.280> goes

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
activated and deactivated so it goes

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.580 
activated and deactivated so it goes
back<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.789> forth<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.289> from<00:01:57.289> this<00:01:57.440> direction

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
back and forth and from this direction

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.770 
back and forth and from this direction
that<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.429> just<00:01:58.640> showed<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.849> that<00:01:59.000> way<00:01:59.179> this

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
that I just showed you that way this

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.249 
that I just showed you that way this
direction<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.410> splits<00:02:00.950> again<00:02:01.190> arm<00:02:02.259> it

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
direction it splits again arm it

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.660 
direction it splits again arm it
activates<00:02:03.709> this<00:02:03.890> block<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.489> direction

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
activates this block in this direction

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.449 
activates this block in this direction
which<00:02:05.390> deactivates<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:06.259> torch<00:02:06.530> which

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
which deactivates this torch which

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.339 
which deactivates this torch which
causes<00:02:07.849> this<00:02:08.090> piston<00:02:08.450> right<00:02:08.569> here<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.899> attract

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
causes this piston right here to attract

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.860 
causes this piston right here to attract
and<00:02:09.880> because<00:02:10.880> it's<00:02:11.120> attached<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.420> disclose

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
and because it's attached to disclose

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.890 
and because it's attached to disclose
stone<00:02:12.050> block<00:02:12.489> when<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.700> isn't<00:02:13.879> retracted<00:02:14.689> it

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
stone block when it isn't retracted it

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.569 
stone block when it isn't retracted it
disables<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.590> current<00:02:15.950> from<00:02:16.069> being<00:02:16.250> sent

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
disables the current from being sent

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:17.280 
disables the current from being sent
through

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
through

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.500 
through
to<00:02:17.439> this<00:02:17.560> clock<00:02:17.829> but<00:02:18.549> when<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.790> does<00:02:19.030> become<00:02:19.360> we

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
to this clock but when it does become we

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.619 
to this clock but when it does become we
track<00:02:19.719> it<00:02:19.750> oops<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.980> allows<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.730> current<00:02:22.480> to

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
track it oops it allows the current to

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.119 
track it oops it allows the current to
go<00:02:22.750> all<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.049> way<00:02:23.079> around<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.799> so<00:02:24.099> I

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
go all the way around this and so I

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.229 
go all the way around this and so I
showed<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.519> before<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:26.230> direction<00:02:27.030> due<00:02:28.030> to

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
showed you before this direction due to

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.839 
showed you before this direction due to
the<00:02:28.450> appears<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.200> determine<00:02:29.769> correctly<00:02:30.129> to

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
the appears I determine correctly to

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.199 
the appears I determine correctly to
cause<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.870> after<00:02:32.859> a<00:02:32.890> few<00:02:33.099> seconds<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.579> the

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
cause this after a few seconds of the

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.509 
cause this after a few seconds of the
current<00:02:34.780> being<00:02:34.959> sent<00:02:35.230> from<00:02:35.290> up<00:02:35.470> there<00:02:35.709> down

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
current being sent from up there down

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.599 
current being sent from up there down
into<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.970> clock<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:38.620> causes<00:02:38.829> this<00:02:39.159> thing<00:02:39.400> to

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
into the clock it causes this thing to

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.360 
into the clock it causes this thing to
extend<00:02:40.299> disabling<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.260> current<00:02:41.650> form<00:02:42.129> going

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
extend disabling the current form going

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.089 
extend disabling the current form going
from<00:02:42.670> up<00:02:42.819> fair<00:02:43.060> into<00:02:43.930> their<00:02:44.079> clock<00:02:44.290> because<00:02:44.950> if

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
from up fair into their clock because if

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.129 
from up fair into their clock because if
I<00:02:45.189> don't<00:02:45.250> disable<00:02:45.579> it<00:02:45.819> then<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.629> keeps<00:02:46.840> on

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
I don't disable it then it keeps on

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.830 
I don't disable it then it keeps on
filling<00:02:47.769> up<00:02:47.920> this<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:49.000> whetstone<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.569> then

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
filling up this the whetstone and then

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.830 
filling up this the whetstone and then
it<00:02:50.170> will<00:02:50.439> only<00:02:50.680> get<00:02:51.040> stuck<00:02:51.430> at<00:02:51.659> retracted<00:02:52.659> it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
it will only get stuck at retracted it

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.280 
it will only get stuck at retracted it
won't<00:02:53.049> it<00:02:53.769> won't<00:02:53.829> extend<00:02:54.609> or<00:02:54.970> retract<00:02:55.659> ever

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
won't it won't extend or retract ever

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.830 
won't it won't extend or retract ever
again<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.859> just<00:02:56.889> stays<00:02:57.189> how<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:58.629> that

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
again it just stays how it is so that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.059 
again it just stays how it is so that
was<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:58.989> whetstone<00:02:59.349> portion<00:02:59.769> of<00:02:59.919> this

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
was a whetstone portion of this

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.890 
was a whetstone portion of this
