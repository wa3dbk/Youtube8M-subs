00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.270
 the canal parkstraÃŸe and schlossallee 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.130
 I am the niki of niki speed channel 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.320
 and today I'm on the subject of no 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.120
 circus a simple simple nail 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.750
 tutorial and I wish you a lot 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.189
 have fun now I have one more 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.900
 little tip for you that you will 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 now also in the video see 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.529
 the first thing I did was that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.900
 I took the movie and mine 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.519
 has taped fingernails when he has to 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.769
 For example, shaky hands would have 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.270
 I recommend if you are not left 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 says and you can do that awesome you can 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.809
 Of course this step as I leave 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.149
 you did that later you can 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.440
 then just paint as you please 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.390
 and of course you do not need a tesafilm 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.620
 which I also made with tesa film 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.420
 I have this in my skin 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
 sometimes so denied 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.760
 so it is not quite so dad yes with it 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 it did not quite stick to it then became 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.180
 I do not ask that my fingernails 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.440
 suddenly look so fat it is true 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 I tried several colors 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.239
 try and show you 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 So I can not expect so thick 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.150
 fingernails around and yes that only served 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.070
 for showing that to me 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.590
 look different colors and you can 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.979
 of course pick your color like you 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.619
 want 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.390
 there is no limit and me 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.159
 I would be very interested in what you am 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.080
 most beautiful finds or what you now to 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.909
 example on your nails trick writes 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.030
 me a comment and I wish 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.470
 Have fun with the video now 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.000
 so did the first time I'm namely 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.799
 I use a nail polish from annie 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.590
 you can, for example, any 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.720
 hue emig had a bright tone 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.960
 taken and I have my whole 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.670
 lacquered fingernails then I take 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.780
 now esa as I said earlier 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.159
 have now synonymous first mine 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.170
 I have the hand surface first 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.780
 pressed it is not quite as firm more 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.909
 sits and yes then I have such a 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.640
 Triangle with the theater movie made like 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.009
 can recognize here and this triangle 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.479
 I have filled out with one now 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.479
 pink nail polish 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.110
 let everything dry well 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.180
 so then we can do it again abmachung 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.010
 and really great 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.530
 for all the shaky so now namely 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.860
 A glittering nail polish is around the edge 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.610
 thus making six 3 kg closes 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.610
 plentiful 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.060
 Mr. finished so looks the first 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.060
 nail design 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.300
 Now I will show you the same 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.200
 nail design with a white nail polish 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.130
 and i like it will just be over the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.140
 bright just over it 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.110
 when I dropped something of that 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.459
 needle point and have that but then 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.900
 later with nail polish remover 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.900
 taken away from the table 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.620
 If I'm with Mahler 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.110
 we are done so should look the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.000
 Variant with the white nail polish 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.260
 front on the tips I think 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.849
 actually very nice you can do it 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.269
 Of course, the other way around 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.269
 that the pink is white and yes that is 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.400
 white pink is now comes the third 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.329
 I have chosen one for myself 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.329
 light blue tone decided 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.290
 and yes it is already easy 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.870
 built so especially in the white do 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.940
 Of course, even under the front one is 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.340
 then to the fingernail tips too 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.060
 So you should stop that 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.060
 then avoid it 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.699
 as I said I just wanted to show you 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.010
 that you just totally different too 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.490
 can create decidedly different 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.490
 to dye 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.080
 It will be ready next year 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.060
 so I hope you liked the video 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.520
 you can always write to me what you are on 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.950
 best found which color or which 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.840
 combination you may on your 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.850
 nails wildly and if they still are 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.310
 would like to see more videos then clicks 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.950

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.750

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.230
