00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the correct order so for my stories are

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
the correct order so for my stories are
in<00:00:33.329> twenty<00:00:33.570> 16<00:00:33.690> 3<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.530> because<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.800> these

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
in twenty 16 3 this is because of these

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.200 
in twenty 16 3 this is because of these
things<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> rely<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.610> his<00:00:35.700> ability<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
things going to rely on his ability to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.580 
things going to rely on his ability to
do<00:00:36.329> most<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> his<00:00:36.690> damage<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.079> lane<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
do most of his damage in lane and so you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.510 
do most of his damage in lane and so you
need<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.829> make<00:00:37.920> sure<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
need to make sure that you have the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.010 
need to make sure that you have the
money<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.570> run<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> mana

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
money to do that if you run out of mana

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.479 
money to do that if you run out of mana
in<00:00:40.260> lane<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:40.890> easy<00:00:41.040> feeling<00:00:41.370> we

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
in lane it's really easy feeling we

this<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.739> do<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:58.830> huge<00:02:59.130> amount<00:02:59.190> of

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
this is going to do a huge amount of

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.710 
this is going to do a huge amount of
damage<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.670> them<00:02:59.970> while<00:03:00.120> they're<00:03:00.239> chasing<00:03:00.600> you

and by the time your ultimate sup you

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.110 
and by the time your ultimate sup you
can<00:03:02.130> probably<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.459> turn<00:03:02.640> around<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.910> kill

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
can probably just turn around and kill

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.460 
can probably just turn around and kill
them<00:03:03.269> anyway<00:03:03.330> remember<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.080> why<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.260> can

them anyway remember that why you can
use<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.739> kite<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.160> much<00:03:05.370> more<00:03:05.580> effective

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
use is to kite it's much more effective

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.520 
use is to kite it's much more effective
if<00:03:06.060> used<00:03:06.120> altima<00:03:06.569> across<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.019> entire<00:03:07.319> enemy
