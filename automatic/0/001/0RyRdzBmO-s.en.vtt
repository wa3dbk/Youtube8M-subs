00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
them all together just sounds amazing

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
them all together just sounds amazing
when<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.900> take<00:01:22.140> part<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.860> sub-genre

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
when like we take part in a sub-genre

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.780 
when like we take part in a sub-genre
and<00:01:24.680> because<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> something<00:01:26.250> oh<00:01:26.400> there's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and because it's a something oh there's

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.730 
and because it's a something oh there's
that<00:01:26.850> sense<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> lack<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> validation<00:01:28.619> in

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
that sense of a lack of validation in

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.380 
that sense of a lack of validation in
the<00:01:28.829> real<00:01:29.100> world<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.909> i<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.060> when<00:01:30.360> we

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the real world so i think when we

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.300 
the real world so i think when we
introduce<00:01:31.110> real<00:01:31.409> instruments<00:01:31.950> into<00:01:32.100> our

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
introduce real instruments into our

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.940 
introduce real instruments into our
music<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.180> tells<00:01:33.600> everyone<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
music it tells everyone it's just the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130 
music it tells everyone it's just the
same<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.549> you're<00:01:35.759> doing<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> me<00:01:36.930> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
same as what you're doing so to me this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.539 
same as what you're doing so to me this
gives<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> sense<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.829> validation<00:01:38.040> for

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
gives that sense of validation for

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
gives that sense of validation for
myself<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.600> i'm<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.960> doing<00:01:40.140> something

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that's real and that can be compared and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
that's real and that can be compared and
