just a nice simple shape
like<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:29.580> there<00:03:30.580> we<00:03:30.700> move<00:03:30.879> on<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.330> legs

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
like that there we move on to the legs

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.589 
like that there we move on to the legs
they<00:03:32.019> do<00:03:32.110> some<00:03:32.860> don't<00:03:33.519> quite<00:03:33.910> straight<00:03:34.330> lines

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
they do some don't quite straight lines

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.000 
they do some don't quite straight lines
because<00:03:34.900> obviously<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.530> legs<00:03:35.709> on<00:03:35.830> time

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
because obviously the legs on time

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.229 
because obviously the legs on time
restraint<00:03:36.280> choice<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.670> could<00:03:36.790> sort<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.030> come

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
restraint choice you could sort of come

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.880 
restraint choice you could sort of come
in<00:03:37.360> sort<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.690> arca<00:03:38.110> doubt<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.319> little<00:03:38.769> bit

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
in sort of arca doubt a little bit

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.520 
in sort of arca doubt a little bit
towards<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.250> bottom<00:03:39.459> like<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
towards the bottom like that and the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.250 
towards the bottom like that and the
back<00:03:41.650> one<00:03:41.860> can<00:03:42.129> be<00:03:42.310> slightly<00:03:42.700> straighter<00:03:43.260> so

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
back one can be slightly straighter so

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.860 
back one can be slightly straighter so
they<00:03:44.349> come<00:03:44.560> down<00:03:44.739> like<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.450> do<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.599> line

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
they come down like that and do a line

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.479 
they come down like that and do a line
roughly<00:03:47.170> sort<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.950> middle<00:03:48.280> just

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
roughly sort of in the middle just

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.500 
roughly sort of in the middle just
slightly<00:03:48.940> cups<00:03:49.269> over<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:50.799> come<00:03:50.980> down<00:03:51.510> and

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
slightly cups over you come down and

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.820 
slightly cups over you come down and
then<00:03:52.720> we<00:03:52.870> join<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.230> bottom<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.620> trousers

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
then we join the bottom and the trousers

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.460 
then we join the bottom and the trousers
up<00:03:54.190> like<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:57.720> we've<00:03:58.720> got<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.110> basal

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
up like that and we've got the basal

up like that and we've got the basal
body<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.610> length<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.420> little<00:04:02.019> line<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.319> the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
body and length a little line in the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.690 
body and length a little line in the
middle<00:04:02.680> there<00:04:02.950> for<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.160> crease<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
middle there for a crease in the

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.650 
middle there for a crease in the
trousers<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:05.530> shoes<00:04:05.769> are<00:04:05.980> easy<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:07.150> we<00:04:07.510> are

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
trousers the shoes are easy so we are

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.080 
trousers the shoes are easy so we are
going<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.930> do<00:04:08.170> him<00:04:08.500> with<00:04:09.280> foot<00:04:09.579> coming<00:04:09.940> out

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
going to do him with foot coming out

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.949 
going to do him with foot coming out
here<00:04:12.599> like<00:04:13.599> that<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:15.030> one<00:04:16.030> moment<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:16.600> just<00:04:16.810> do

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
here like that and one moment so just do

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.590 
here like that and one moment so just do
a<00:04:16.989> basic<00:04:17.260> shape<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.859> begin<00:04:17.950> with<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.760> then<00:04:19.419> we

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
a basic shape to begin with and then we

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.659 
a basic shape to begin with and then we
shall<00:04:19.780> fill<00:04:20.019> it<00:04:20.139> in<00:04:20.289> once<00:04:21.100> we've<00:04:21.340> got<00:04:21.519> the

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
shall fill it in once we've got the

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.779 
shall fill it in once we've got the
shape<00:04:21.880> roughly<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.450> we<00:04:22.570> want<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:24.370> if<00:04:24.700> you

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
shape roughly that we want and if you

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.279 
shape roughly that we want and if you
just<00:04:24.910> come<00:04:25.090> around<00:04:25.210> of<00:04:25.419> tiny<00:04:25.870> bit<00:04:26.020> underneath

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
just come around of tiny bit underneath

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.840 
just come around of tiny bit underneath
that'll<00:04:26.919> be<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.130> sole<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.610> shoes<00:04:29.850> and

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
that'll be the sole of the shoes and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.830 
that'll be the sole of the shoes and
that's<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.960> outline<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.440> shoes<00:04:32.650> done<00:04:33.300> now<00:04:34.300> we

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
that's the outline the shoes done now we

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.629 
that's the outline the shoes done now we
just<00:04:35.020> do<00:04:35.139> a<00:04:35.169> little<00:04:35.380> bit<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.800> line<00:04:36.100> come<00:04:36.370> across

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
just do a little bit a line come across

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.390 
just do a little bit a line come across
here<00:04:36.880> for<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.630> front<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.320> same<00:04:39.039> on<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.280> other

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
here for the front and same on the other

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.890 
here for the front and same on the other
foot<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:40.440> then<00:04:41.440> just<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.310> few<00:04:42.570> little<00:04:43.570> curved

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
foot and then just a few little curved

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.689 
foot and then just a few little curved
lines<00:04:44.229> to<00:04:45.099> represent<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.789> laces

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.579 

they're<00:04:52.699> just<00:04:52.969> too<00:04:53.089> dark<00:04:53.300> for<00:04:53.389> that<00:04:53.659> up<00:04:53.779> and

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:54.589 
they're just too dark for that up and

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:57.969 
they're just too dark for that up and
we've<00:04:54.889> got<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.189> shoes<00:04:55.659> for<00:04:56.659> the<00:04:56.749> arms<00:04:57.139> which

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
we've got the shoes for the arms which

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.379 
we've got the shoes for the arms which
we<00:04:58.129> haven't<00:04:58.399> missed<00:04:58.489> off<00:04:58.699> them<00:04:58.909> forgotten

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
we haven't missed off them forgotten

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.359 
we haven't missed off them forgotten
them<00:04:59.509> we<00:05:00.259> do<00:05:00.409> them<00:05:00.559> coming<00:05:00.889> along<00:05:01.069> from<00:05:01.279> the

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:01.369 
them we do them coming along from the

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:02.769 
them we do them coming along from the
top<00:05:01.580> we're<00:05:01.999> going<00:05:02.089> to<00:05:02.149> do<00:05:02.269> a<00:05:02.300> MIDI<00:05:02.509> sort<00:05:02.719> of

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:02.779 
top we're going to do a MIDI sort of

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.029 
top we're going to do a MIDI sort of
hands<00:05:03.080> on<00:05:03.139> his<00:05:03.289> hip<00:05:03.469> so<00:05:03.619> we're<00:05:03.739> going<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:03.889> come

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
hands on his hip so we're going to come

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.879 
hands on his hip so we're going to come
out<00:05:04.539> and<00:05:05.539> we're<00:05:05.749> gonna<00:05:05.839> come<00:05:06.019> back<00:05:06.050> in<00:05:06.229> and

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
out and we're gonna come back in and

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:07.989 
out and we're gonna come back in and
we're<00:05:07.039> gonna<00:05:07.159> do<00:05:07.249> the<00:05:07.339> same<00:05:07.489> analysis

00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:07.999 
we're gonna do the same analysis

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:09.639 
we're gonna do the same analysis
basically<00:05:08.330> you'd<00:05:08.419> want<00:05:08.599> to<00:05:08.629> triangle<00:05:09.259> off<00:05:09.439> the

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:09.649 
basically you'd want to triangle off the

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:13.089 
basically you'd want to triangle off the
side<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:09.889> his<00:05:10.009> body<00:05:10.809> on<00:05:11.809> each<00:05:12.050> side<00:05:12.319> just<00:05:12.619> two

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
side of his body on each side just two

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.790 
side of his body on each side just two
triangles<00:05:13.669> like<00:05:13.849> that<00:05:14.089> then<00:05:14.869> you<00:05:15.379> just<00:05:15.409> small

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
triangles like that then you just small

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.659 
triangles like that then you just small
a<00:05:15.830> triangle<00:05:16.659> slightly<00:05:17.919> lie<00:05:19.809> that<00:05:21.580> you've<00:05:22.580> got

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
a triangle slightly lie that you've got

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.839 
a triangle slightly lie that you've got
the<00:05:22.759> two<00:05:22.789> triangles<00:05:23.149> there<00:05:23.629> and<00:05:24.579> all<00:05:25.579> we<00:05:25.699> do

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
the two triangles there and all we do

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.729 
the two triangles there and all we do
now<00:05:26.029> is<00:05:26.059> so<00:05:26.719> that<00:05:26.839> they'd<00:05:26.959> look<00:05:27.169> quite<00:05:27.499> so

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:27.739 
now is so that they'd look quite so

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:31.659 
now is so that they'd look quite so
angular<00:05:27.949> he's<00:05:28.669> just<00:05:28.969> round<00:05:29.539> off<00:05:30.369> those<00:05:31.369> elbows

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
angular he's just round off those elbows

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.969 
angular he's just round off those elbows
would<00:05:32.089> be<00:05:32.269> and<00:05:32.569> just<00:05:33.110> on<00:05:33.259> the<00:05:33.379> inside<00:05:33.709> just

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
would be and just on the inside just

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.600 
would be and just on the inside just
round<00:05:34.279> those<00:05:34.519> slightly<00:05:34.909> as<00:05:35.119> well<00:05:35.329> and<00:05:36.610> then

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
round those slightly as well and then

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.329 
round those slightly as well and then
all<00:05:37.729> that's<00:05:37.909> left<00:05:38.029> to<00:05:38.269> do<00:05:38.479> for<00:05:39.319> the<00:05:39.499> man<00:05:39.649> is<00:05:39.979> his

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:40.339 
all that's left to do for the man is his

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.389 
all that's left to do for the man is his
hands<00:05:40.610> so<00:05:41.289> you'll<00:05:42.289> only<00:05:42.379> see<00:05:42.679> part<00:05:42.949> of<00:05:43.219> his

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399 
hands so you'll only see part of his

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:45.309 
hands so you'll only see part of his
hand<00:05:43.669> because<00:05:43.939> it's<00:05:44.209> behind<00:05:44.569> his<00:05:44.689> back<00:05:44.899> so<00:05:45.259> you

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
hand because it's behind his back so you

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.669 
hand because it's behind his back so you
come<00:05:45.559> up<00:05:45.669> from<00:05:46.669> here<00:05:47.139> and<00:05:48.139> you're<00:05:48.409> just<00:05:48.529> going

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:48.679 
come up from here and you're just going

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:51.219 
come up from here and you're just going
to<00:05:48.709> come<00:05:48.889> basically<00:05:49.579> round<00:05:50.059> and<00:05:50.869> it's<00:05:51.079> going

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
to come basically round and it's going

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.199 
to come basically round and it's going
to<00:05:51.319> represent<00:05:51.469> the<00:05:51.889> edge<00:05:52.009> of<00:05:52.129> his<00:05:52.219> hand<00:05:52.489> but

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:53.209 
to represent the edge of his hand but

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:54.279 
to represent the edge of his hand but
obviously<00:05:53.629> there's<00:05:53.839> going<00:05:53.929> to<00:05:53.989> be<00:05:54.050> two

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
obviously there's going to be two

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:55.929 
obviously there's going to be two
fingers<00:05:54.739> you<00:05:54.769> can<00:05:55.009> see<00:05:55.219> you<00:05:55.279> could<00:05:55.610> just<00:05:55.819> do<00:05:55.909> a

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 
fingers you can see you could just do a

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.569 
fingers you can see you could just do a
line<00:05:56.179> in<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.449> middle<00:05:56.569> and<00:05:57.499> there<00:05:58.339> you<00:05:58.429> go

00:05:58.569 --> 00:05:58.579 
line in the middle and there you go

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:01.239 
line in the middle and there you go
there's<00:05:58.969> the<00:05:59.029> two<00:05:59.269> fingers<00:05:59.659> just<00:05:59.889> like<00:06:00.889> that

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:01.249 
there's the two fingers just like that

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:03.999 
there's the two fingers just like that
and<00:06:02.240> on<00:06:02.779> this<00:06:02.929> side<00:06:03.139> you<00:06:03.439> again<00:06:03.800> you're<00:06:03.919> only

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
and on this side you again you're only

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.109
