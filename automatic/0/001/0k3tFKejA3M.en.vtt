to the shaft ok and what we want that in
the<00:01:06.850> club<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.149> vertical<00:01:07.509> at<00:01:07.600> twelve<00:01:07.810> o'clock

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
the club is vertical at twelve o'clock

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.219 
the club is vertical at twelve o'clock
the<00:01:09.910> arm<00:01:10.060> should<00:01:10.240> be<00:01:10.360> in<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.539> L<00:01:10.660> position<00:01:11.110> to

risk cocked and the T in the end of the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.820 
risk cocked and the T in the end of the
shaft<00:01:13.570> should<00:01:13.810> be<00:01:13.930> pointing<00:01:14.259> at<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> tea<00:01:14.590> about

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
shaft should be pointing at a tea about

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.760 
shaft should be pointing at a tea about
three<00:01:15.100> feet<00:01:15.280> behind<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.759> ball<00:01:15.910> on<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.240> tee<00:01:16.770> so

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
three feet behind the ball on a tee so

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.130 
three feet behind the ball on a tee so
here<00:01:18.190> is<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.459> question<00:01:18.660> where<00:01:19.660> would<00:01:19.899> we<00:01:20.110> put

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
here is the question where would we put

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.990 
here is the question where would we put
the<00:01:20.470> tea<00:01:20.649> in<00:01:20.709> the<00:01:20.890> ground<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.280> relationship<00:01:21.880> to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
the tea in the ground a relationship to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.480 
the tea in the ground a relationship to
the<00:01:22.090> ball<00:01:22.270> for<00:01:22.509> PPG<00:01:22.840> s<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.890> seems<00:01:24.190> like<00:01:24.340> it

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
the ball for PPG s it seems like it

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.980 
the ball for PPG s it seems like it
should<00:01:24.640> be<00:01:24.759> about<00:01:24.880> two<00:01:25.179> feet<00:01:25.390> behind<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.840> ball

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
should be about two feet behind the ball

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.510 
should be about two feet behind the ball
but<00:01:26.259> halfway<00:01:26.410> between<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.950> toe<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.429> the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
but halfway between the toe and the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.120 
but halfway between the toe and the
target<00:01:27.880> line<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.410> think<00:01:29.410> this<00:01:29.590> would<00:01:29.770> be<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.920> good

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
target line I think this would be a good

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.710 
target line I think this would be a good
tip<00:01:30.340> for<00:01:30.369> us<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.729> check<00:01:30.910> out<00:01:31.090> shaft<00:01:31.390> alignment

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
tip for us to check out shaft alignment

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.680 
tip for us to check out shaft alignment
pretty<00:01:32.289> easily<00:01:32.849> ok<00:01:33.849> he<00:01:33.910> even<00:01:34.179> sent<00:01:34.360> me<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.509> link

pretty easily ok he even sent me a link

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.839 
pretty easily ok he even sent me a link
to<00:01:34.750> go<00:01:34.929> look<00:01:35.140> at<00:01:35.289> it<00:01:35.319> and<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.530> did<00:01:35.740> look<00:01:35.890> at<00:01:36.069> it<00:01:36.220> ok

set up i'm going to set up my arrows
here<00:01:42.270> ok<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.509> I'm<00:01:44.229> going<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.440> say<00:01:44.649> that<00:01:44.890> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
here ok and I'm going to say that that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.389 
here ok and I'm going to say that that
I'm<00:01:47.649> going<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.920> swing<00:01:48.160> this<00:01:48.190> way<00:01:50.099> this<00:01:51.099> way<00:01:51.340> so

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
I'm going to swing this way this way so

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.430 
I'm going to swing this way this way so
this<00:01:51.759> one's<00:01:51.940> going<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.179> be<00:01:52.240> at<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:53.229> one's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
this one's going to be at the this one's

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.080 
this one's going to be at the this one's
going<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.679> be<00:01:53.740> at<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.009> target<00:01:54.369> line<00:01:54.520> because

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
going to be at the target line because

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.190 
going to be at the target line because
we're<00:01:55.240> talking<00:01:55.479> about<00:01:55.569> in<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.869> back<00:01:56.050> swing

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
we're talking about in the back swing

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.589 
we're talking about in the back swing
here<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.759> should<00:01:57.940> be<00:01:57.970> pretty<00:01:58.060> close<00:01:58.420> to

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
here so that should be pretty close to

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.249 
here so that should be pretty close to
the<00:01:58.690> target<00:01:58.869> line

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
question the question from Ken king is

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.520 
question the question from Ken king is
where<00:03:00.690> would<00:03:00.840> appoint<00:03:01.079> for<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.379> peak

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
where would appoint for the peak

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.050 
where would appoint for the peak
performance<00:03:01.980> wing<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:02.310> he<00:03:02.370> was<00:03:02.519> thinking<00:03:02.849> and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
performance wing and he was thinking and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.420 
performance wing and he was thinking and
I<00:03:03.750> think<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.230> he<00:03:04.319> says<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.980> would<00:03:05.129> point

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
I think and he says it would point

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.740 
I think and he says it would point
between<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:08.760> seems<00:03:09.000> would<00:03:09.120> likely<00:03:09.299> be<00:03:09.540> about

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
between it seems would likely be about

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.449 
between it seems would likely be about
two<00:03:09.930> feet<00:03:10.109> behind<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.650> ball<00:03:10.799> but<00:03:11.280> halfway

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
two feet behind the ball but halfway

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.699 
two feet behind the ball but halfway
between<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.060> target<00:03:12.269> lines<00:03:12.599> so<00:03:13.319> he's<00:03:13.500> saying

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
between the target lines so he's saying

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.530 
between the target lines so he's saying
he<00:03:14.099> saying<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.579> tea<00:03:14.790> should<00:03:15.030> be<00:03:15.060> pointing

diagonal inclined plane the elbow to the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
hands and the club will be slightly

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.030 
hands and the club will be slightly
inside<00:03:50.459> but<00:03:51.120> when<00:03:51.359> i<00:03:51.389> get<00:03:51.510> up<00:03:51.660> here<00:03:51.989> if<00:03:52.319> i<00:03:52.980> get

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
inside but when i get up here if i get

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.990 
inside but when i get up here if i get
to<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.370> position<00:03:53.519> right<00:03:53.940> there<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.790> teacher

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
to that position right there the teacher

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.030 
to that position right there the teacher
basically<00:03:57.450> be<00:03:57.540> pointing<00:03:57.900> pretty<00:03:58.769> much<00:03:58.889> at<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
basically be pointing pretty much at the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.190 
basically be pointing pretty much at the
tow<00:03:59.280> line<00:04:00.260> because<00:04:01.260> it's<00:04:01.410> vertical<00:04:02.690> see<00:04:03.690> that

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.199 

straight<00:04:07.200> up<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:07.470> down<00:04:07.500> now<00:04:08.430> if<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.880> get<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.180> a

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
straight up and down now if I get to a

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.820 
straight up and down now if I get to a
perfect<00:04:09.630> three<00:04:09.840> quarters<00:04:10.200> in<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.500> I've<00:04:10.590> done

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
perfect three quarters in and I've done

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.500 
perfect three quarters in and I've done
and<00:04:11.010> I've<00:04:11.100> got<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> little<00:04:11.490> here<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.030> it's

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
and I've got a little here and it's

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.730 
and I've got a little here and it's
still<00:04:12.630> pointing<00:04:12.959> up<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:13.170> down<00:04:13.319> now<00:04:13.530> it'll

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
still pointing up and down now it'll

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.759 
still pointing up and down now it'll
probably<00:04:13.950> be<00:04:14.130> pointing<00:04:14.490> right<00:04:14.940> about<00:04:15.180> there

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
probably be pointing right about there

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.590 
probably be pointing right about there
because<00:04:16.769> that's<00:04:16.890> where<00:04:17.040> as<00:04:17.489> I've<00:04:18.269> always<00:04:18.450> said

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
because that's where as I've always said

at about your ankles okay but at this

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
I'm standing getting up the tree and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.040 
I'm standing getting up the tree and
I've<00:04:32.460> set<00:04:32.669> my<00:04:32.820> England<00:04:33.180> notice<00:04:33.419> my<00:04:33.540> left<00:04:33.750> vs.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.350 
I've set my England notice my left vs.
and<00:04:34.200> cup<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.530> sits<00:04:34.830> flat<00:04:35.040> as<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.669> always<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:36.000> up

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
and cup it sits flat as it always is up

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.820 
and cup it sits flat as it always is up
here<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.500> Club<00:04:38.690> will<00:04:39.690> be<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:40.080> little<00:04:40.470> bit<00:04:40.590> here

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
here that Club will be a little bit here

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.620 
here that Club will be a little bit here
at<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.070> top<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.430> backswing<00:04:41.820> but<00:04:42.270> exactly

at the top of the backswing but exactly

at the top of the backswing but exactly
at<00:04:42.930> this<00:04:43.080> point<00:04:43.380> it's<00:04:43.890> going<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.190> probably<00:04:44.340> be

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
at this point it's going to probably be

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.430 
at this point it's going to probably be
pretty<00:04:44.760> close<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.210> tow<00:04:45.450> line<00:04:45.660> or<00:04:45.930> maybe

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
pretty close to the tow line or maybe

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.170 
pretty close to the tow line or maybe
just<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.770> slightly<00:04:47.040> inside<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.640> it<00:04:47.730> but<00:04:48.090> it

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
just a slightly inside of it but it

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.220 
just a slightly inside of it but it
won't<00:04:48.330> be<00:04:48.390> pointing<00:04:48.750> out<00:04:48.840> there<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.140> it's

won't be pointing out there and it's

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.900 
won't be pointing out there and it's
certainly<00:04:49.350> not<00:04:49.530> pointing<00:04:49.950> over<00:04:50.010> there<00:04:50.280> now

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
certainly not pointing over there now

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.550 
certainly not pointing over there now
there<00:04:51.060> isn't<00:04:51.150> some<00:04:51.450> people<00:04:51.780> over<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.530> years

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.140 
swing and we swing we got a limited turn

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
and use our arms to get our speed so I'm

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.100 
and use our arms to get our speed so I'm
going<00:07:09.270> to<00:07:09.330> rock<00:07:09.450> on<00:07:09.600> the<00:07:09.630> end<00:07:09.810> of<00:07:09.870> a<00:07:09.960> string

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
going to rock on the end of a string

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.050 
going to rock on the end of a string
well<00:07:10.680> this<00:07:10.830> is<00:07:10.860> the<00:07:11.010> rock<00:07:11.250> this<00:07:11.490> is<00:07:11.670> the<00:07:11.790> string

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
well this is the rock this is the string

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.060 
well this is the rock this is the string
and<00:07:12.180> the<00:07:12.630> string<00:07:12.870> never<00:07:13.140> swings<00:07:13.440> any<00:07:13.590> faster

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
and the string never swings any faster

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.260 
and the string never swings any faster
and<00:07:14.100> more<00:07:14.340> consistently<00:07:14.880> then<00:07:15.030> when<00:07:15.150> it's

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
and more consistently then when it's

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.910 
and more consistently then when it's
straight<00:07:15.540> up<00:07:15.570> and<00:07:15.900> down<00:07:15.960> and<00:07:16.260> that's<00:07:16.620> what<00:07:16.830> we

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:16.920 
straight up and down and that's what we

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.770 
straight up and down and that's what we
are<00:07:17.040> in<00:07:17.220> the<00:07:17.310> mitt<00:07:17.460> and<00:07:17.490> up<00:07:17.670> Catrin<00:07:18.030> come<00:07:18.600> back

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.600 
are in the mitt and up Catrin come back
down<00:07:18.960> impact<00:07:19.410> and<00:07:19.800> then<00:07:19.980> intermittent<00:07:20.460> up<00:07:20.520> the

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
down impact and then intermittent up the

down impact and then intermittent up the
tree<00:07:20.760> on<00:07:20.880> that<00:07:21.030> side<00:07:21.270> so<00:07:21.750> we're<00:07:21.930> we're

tree on that side so we're we're

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.870 
tree on that side so we're we're

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:29.790 
our bodies designed the swing because I

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.700 
our bodies designed the swing because I

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
arms only swing in front of our body so

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.410
