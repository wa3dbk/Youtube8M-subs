actually<00:03:08.530> stretches<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.160> picture<00:03:09.549> this<00:03:09.760> is

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
actually stretches the picture this is

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.490 
actually stretches the picture this is
procedure<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.480> didn't<00:03:11.049> do<00:03:11.109> this<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.290> other

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
procedure I didn't do this on other

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.990 
procedure I didn't do this on other
items<00:03:11.620> but<00:03:11.829> some<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.250> would<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:12.609> stretch<00:03:12.879> to

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000

items but some it would just stretch to
try<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.180> fill<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.420> gap<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.230> guess<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.680> stood

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
try to fill the gap so I guess I stood

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.229 
try to fill the gap so I guess I stood
with<00:03:14.920> their<00:03:15.040> website<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.609> then<00:03:15.700> finally<00:03:16.150> this

first thing I liked about this TV was

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.589 
first thing I liked about this TV was
the<00:03:30.400> price<00:03:30.639> its<00:03:30.970> what<00:03:31.120> originally<00:03:31.329> attracted

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
the price its what originally attracted

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.309 
the price its what originally attracted
me<00:03:32.169> to<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.440> $400<00:03:33.370> for<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.639> 4k<00:03:34.090> TV<00:03:34.239> couldn't<00:03:35.169> pass

me to it $400 for a 4k TV couldn't pass
it<00:03:35.530> up<00:03:35.650> now<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:36.280> price<00:03:36.489> has<00:03:36.639> gone<00:03:36.700> back<00:03:36.970> up<00:03:37.180> on

it up now the price has gone back up on
Amazon<00:03:37.480> leads<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.989> about<00:03:38.169> $600<00:03:38.889> I<00:03:39.010> think<00:03:39.220> right

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
Amazon leads to about $600 I think right

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.339 
Amazon leads to about $600 I think right
now<00:03:39.430> which<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.030> still<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:40.419> good<00:03:40.569> price<00:03:40.780> for<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.989> 4k

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
now which is still a good price for a 4k

screws<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.979> mounted<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.610> into<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.000> arm<00:04:25.630> of

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
screws that mounted it into the arm of

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.450 
screws that mounted it into the arm of
the<00:04:26.440> TV<00:04:26.830> were

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
the TV were

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.980 
the TV were
actually<00:04:27.729> just<00:04:27.880> screwing<00:04:28.240> into<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.479> plastic

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
actually just screwing into the plastic

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.840 
actually just screwing into the plastic
it<00:04:29.080> wasn't<00:04:29.319> like<00:04:29.440> threaded<00:04:29.860> holes<00:04:30.100> for<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> bowl

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
it wasn't like threaded holes for a bowl

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.550 
it wasn't like threaded holes for a bowl
I<00:04:30.880> lost<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.539> video<00:04:31.660> for<00:04:31.960> this<00:04:32.020> part<00:04:32.289> for<00:04:32.410> some

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
I lost the video for this part for some

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.140 
I lost the video for this part for some
reason<00:04:32.919> but<00:04:33.100> one<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.669> other<00:04:33.789> things<00:04:34.000> I

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
reason but one of the other things I

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.779 
reason but one of the other things I
didn't<00:04:34.479> like<00:04:34.509> was<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.500> port<00:04:35.949> placement<00:04:36.729> I

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
didn't like was the port placement I

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.279 
didn't like was the port placement I
liked<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.090> ports<00:04:37.389> but<00:04:37.569> you<00:04:37.900> can<00:04:38.020> see<00:04:38.110> by<00:04:38.229> this

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
liked the ports but you can see by this

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.839 
liked the ports but you can see by this
picture<00:04:38.500> right<00:04:38.740> here<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:39.009> HDMI<00:04:39.490> port<00:04:39.729> was

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
picture right here this HDMI port was

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.550 
picture right here this HDMI port was
not<00:04:39.970> put<00:04:40.210> in<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.330> good<00:04:40.449> spot<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.020> cable<00:04:41.349> had<00:04:41.470> to

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
not put in a good spot the cable had to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.439 
not put in a good spot the cable had to
be<00:04:41.650> pushed<00:04:41.889> out<00:04:42.069> because<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.520> body<00:04:42.729> of<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.060> TV

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
be pushed out because the body of the TV

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.210 
be pushed out because the body of the TV
and<00:04:43.630> therefore<00:04:44.319> it<00:04:44.410> was<00:04:44.500> putting<00:04:44.710> pressure<00:04:44.919> on

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
and therefore it was putting pressure on

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.650 
and therefore it was putting pressure on
the<00:04:45.340> port<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.699> can<00:04:45.789> kind<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:45.970> see<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.180> bending

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
the port you can kind of see it bending

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.089 
the port you can kind of see it bending
out<00:04:46.810> away<00:04:47.050> from<00:04:47.259> the<00:04:47.410> last<00:04:47.590> thing<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.889> didn't

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
out away from the last thing I didn't

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.499 
out away from the last thing I didn't
like<00:04:48.130> which<00:04:48.400> was<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.610> major<00:04:48.789> reason<00:04:49.000> I<00:04:49.330> sent

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
like which was the major reason I sent

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.629 
like which was the major reason I sent
it<00:04:49.660> back<00:04:49.810> was<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.590> 30<00:04:50.770> Hertz<00:04:51.009> refresh<00:04:51.400> rate

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
it back was the 30 Hertz refresh rate

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.309 
it back was the 30 Hertz refresh rate
people<00:04:52.210> would<00:04:52.360> sometimes<00:04:52.569> say<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:53.080> can<00:04:53.199> get

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
people would sometimes say you can get

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.629 
people would sometimes say you can get
away<00:04:53.440> with<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.740> other<00:04:53.860> people<00:04:54.069> say<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.310> can

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
some people say he's great for gaming

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.029 
some people say he's great for gaming
other<00:04:56.110> people<00:04:56.319> would<00:04:56.410> say<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.590> wasn't<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:57.009> I

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
other people would say it wasn't so I

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.070 
other people would say it wasn't so I
just<00:04:57.280> had<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.490> try<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:57.699> for<00:04:57.849> myself<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.870> 30

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
just had to try it for myself the 30

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.689 
just had to try it for myself the 30
person<00:04:59.380> is<00:04:59.440> really<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.680> killer<00:04:59.979> for<00:05:00.220> me<00:05:00.250> like<00:05:00.610> I

person is really a killer for me like I

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.159 
person is really a killer for me like I
said<00:05:00.910> at<00:05:01.120> some<00:05:01.330> points<00:05:01.599> it<00:05:01.660> just<00:05:01.690> felt<00:05:01.990> like<00:05:02.020> my

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
said at some points it just felt like my

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.900 
said at some points it just felt like my
mouse<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.560> moving<00:05:02.740> slow<00:05:03.070> or<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.370> don't<00:05:03.490> see<00:05:03.789> it

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
mouse is moving slow or you don't see it

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.460 
mouse is moving slow or you don't see it
you<00:05:04.360> know<00:05:04.449> when<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.660> turn<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.020> tails<00:05:05.259> on

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
you know when you turn on the tails on

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.600 
you know when you turn on the tails on
your<00:05:05.590> mouse<00:05:05.710> if<00:05:05.889> you<00:05:05.949> ever<00:05:06.039> done<00:05:06.280> map<00:05:06.430> and

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
your mouse if you ever done map and

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.680 
your mouse if you ever done map and
almost<00:05:06.820> like<00:05:06.880> they<00:05:07.000> were<00:05:07.180> multiple<00:05:07.570> and

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
almost like they were multiple and

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.960 
almost like they were multiple and
following<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.590> then<00:05:09.070> gaming<00:05:09.460> on<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.610> huge

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
following it and then gaming on a huge

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.420 
following it and then gaming on a huge
gamer<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.800> just<00:05:11.919> couldn't<00:05:12.280> get<00:05:12.340> away

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
gamer and it I just couldn't get away

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.830 
gamer and it I just couldn't get away
with<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.729> in<00:05:12.789> most<00:05:12.940> games<00:05:13.120> like<00:05:13.389> I<00:05:13.449> said<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.660> lot

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
with it in most games like I said a lot

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.060 
with it in most games like I said a lot
of<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.960> time<00:05:14.169> it<00:05:14.320> was<00:05:14.410> almost<00:05:14.560> like<00:05:14.740> your<00:05:14.919> eyes

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
of the time it was almost like your eyes

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.460 
of the time it was almost like your eyes
were<00:05:15.729> asleep<00:05:16.120> you'd<00:05:16.360> you'd<00:05:16.840> stop<00:05:17.080> moving<00:05:17.380> in

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
were asleep you'd you'd stop moving in

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
were asleep you'd you'd stop moving in
the<00:05:17.530> game<00:05:17.680> everything<00:05:17.979> would<00:05:18.190> look<00:05:18.310> really

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
the game everything would look really

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.980 
the game everything would look really
good<00:05:18.699> and<00:05:18.970> clear<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.419> as<00:05:19.539> soon<00:05:19.720> as<00:05:19.810> hard<00:05:19.960> to

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
good and clear and as soon as hard to

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.240 
good and clear and as soon as hard to
move<00:05:20.199> you<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.409> almost<00:05:20.650> rub<00:05:20.919> your<00:05:21.099> eyes

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
move you and almost rub your eyes

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.610 
move you and almost rub your eyes
thinking<00:05:21.759> was<00:05:21.849> a<00:05:21.880> little<00:05:22.030> bit<00:05:22.120> blurry<00:05:22.449> cuz<00:05:23.349> it

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
thinking was a little bit blurry cuz it

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.689 
thinking was a little bit blurry cuz it
just<00:05:23.830> kind<00:05:24.009> of<00:05:24.039> it's<00:05:24.190> just<00:05:24.250> on<00:05:24.610> that

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
just kind of it's just on that

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.450 
just kind of it's just on that
borderline<00:05:25.470> as<00:05:26.470> you<00:05:26.620> know<00:05:26.710> 30<00:05:27.009> Hertz<00:05:27.250> means

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
borderline as you know 30 Hertz means

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.309 
borderline as you know 30 Hertz means
you<00:05:27.699> get<00:05:27.819> about<00:05:28.090> 30<00:05:28.389> frames<00:05:28.539> per<00:05:28.750> second<00:05:29.199> and

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
you get about 30 frames per second and

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.110 
you get about 30 frames per second and
Mac<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:29.830> really<00:05:30.039> caps<00:05:30.400> it<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.669> lot<00:05:30.819> of<00:05:30.849> games

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
Mac so it really caps it a lot of games

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.149 
Mac so it really caps it a lot of games
run<00:05:31.360> at<00:05:31.509> 60<00:05:31.930> or<00:05:32.080> in<00:05:32.229> that<00:05:32.349> range<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:33.039> about

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
run at 60 or in that range so it's about

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.010 
run at 60 or in that range so it's about
half<00:05:33.460> of<00:05:33.610> what<00:05:33.729> you're<00:05:33.849> probably<00:05:34.090> used<00:05:34.389> to<00:05:34.509> at

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
half of what you're probably used to at

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.510 
half of what you're probably used to at
current<00:05:35.440> I<00:05:35.500> would<00:05:35.620> have<00:05:35.740> to<00:05:35.860> say<00:05:36.009> I<00:05:36.039> would<00:05:36.250> not
