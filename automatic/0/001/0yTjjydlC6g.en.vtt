00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.520
 how you welcome my fan i'm going to you 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.040
 today show you how to do this nail art 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.520
 on your nails it is very bad 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.650
 easy 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.450
 it is actually cherry blossom cherry 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.600
 wash and is a little inspired 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.830
 by the arizona iced tea bottles if you like 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.420
 better i mean 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.070
 or just about it it is there they came 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.869
 with that cherry blossom 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.519
 very nice it is really very bad 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.019
 easy I'll just go step by step 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.789
 see how you are doing so look quickly 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.830
 first my nails varnished my light and 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.939
 almost color this piece of sugar apple from 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.560
 barry m 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.960
 let it dry well and drank 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.310
 furthermore I then use a black one 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.340
 nail polish must be well pigmented 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.510
 are you hit me I twigs draw 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.010
 apply some of the nail polish 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.290
 aluminium foil 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.840
 then bank a thin brush and that 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.760
 I briefly dip in the nail polish 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 and then you can start drawing the twigs i 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.810
 varies a bit I start one time 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.580
 left starts right the other time 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.770
 it's nice if you alternate a bit 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.460
 makes some other branches 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.460
 make something fun of it 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.369
 try to get some distance between branches 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.890
 because the must have such a sentence or 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.729
 flowers when it is quickly full 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.659
 of course it also takes a moment on the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.280
 other nails here even faster 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.080
 and then it's time for me 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 use a pink nail polish this some 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.940
 models own in the color pink of honor and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.340
 I'm going to all dots about 3 or 4 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.159
 dots per brother and I do that with 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.049
 a daughter then with the small side 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.789
 it might be a bit so try 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.789
 the dot strategic places 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.640
 the milk I take a slightly darker pink 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.600
 love this to cure dragonfruit too 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.610
 barry m 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.260
 and with that I take a heart in the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.280
 put dots and this for it actually 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.280
 the heart of flowers 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.220
 it doesn't all have to be very precise 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:54.160
 but care a bit that in the middle of 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.960
 the other dots are as always 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.880
 I still have some top coat over this 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.880
 my favorite sally people instagram 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.150

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.460

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.380

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.820
