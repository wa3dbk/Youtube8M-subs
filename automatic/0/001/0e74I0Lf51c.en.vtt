00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.720 
ability than he does but he is posed
abilities<00:02:22.950> actually<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> little<00:02:23.340> bit<00:02:23.580> more

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
abilities actually a little bit more

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.690 
abilities actually a little bit more
hindered<00:02:24.210> but<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.500> said<00:02:25.530> he's<00:02:26.310> still<00:02:26.550> an

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
hindered but like I said he's still an

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.190 
hindered but like I said he's still an
awesome<00:02:26.850> figure<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.480> still<00:02:27.750> got<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.110> get

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
awesome figure and you still got to get

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.290 
awesome figure and you still got to get
him<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.460> we'll<00:02:29.880> get<00:02:29.970> on<00:02:30.120> those

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
him so now we'll get on those

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.150 
him so now we'll get on those
accessories<00:02:30.750> here's<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> quiver<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
accessories here's the quiver in the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.340 
accessories here's the quiver in the
arrow<00:02:32.630> arrow<00:02:33.630> does<00:02:34.110> pull<00:02:34.410> out<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:37.050> bent

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
arrow arrow does pull out but it is bent

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
arrow arrow does pull out but it is bent
from<00:02:37.910> packaging<00:02:38.910> which<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> shame<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:40.370> it's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
from packaging which is a shame but it's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.420 
from packaging which is a shame but it's
nothing<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.540> expected<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:44.160> soft

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
nothing to not be expected the soft

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.210 
nothing to not be expected the soft
plastic<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.440> fit<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.010> there

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
plastic so you just fit that in there

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.000 
plastic so you just fit that in there
and<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.910> does<00:02:48.090> have<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.300> magnet<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.740> that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
and then it does have a magnet so that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.690 
and then it does have a magnet so that
can<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.370> tab<00:02:50.610> right<00:02:50.910> onto<00:02:51.270> his<00:02:51.390> back<00:02:51.660> and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
can just tab right onto his back and

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.160 
can just tab right onto his back and
that's<00:02:53.700> usually<00:02:53.970> where<00:02:54.240> i<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.720> stored<00:02:54.990> i

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
that's usually where i have it stored i

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.330 
that's usually where i have it stored i
think<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.470> looks<00:02:55.650> really<00:02:55.920> neat<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:59.220> then

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
think that looks really neat and then

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.640 
think that looks really neat and then
his<00:02:59.550> bow<00:02:59.850> and<00:02:59.880> they<00:03:00.300> do<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.660> Holden<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.530> if

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
his bow and they do have Holden so if

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.090 
his bow and they do have Holden so if
you<00:03:01.740> do<00:03:01.890> want<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.900> put<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> string<00:03:04.470> or<00:03:04.620> something

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
you do want to put a string or something

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.910 
you do want to put a string or something
in<00:03:05.220> there<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.520> probably<00:03:05.790> can<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:07.590> pull<00:03:07.800> it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
in there you probably can just pull it

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.140 
in there you probably can just pull it
back<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:09.890> pretend<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:10.950> be<00:03:11.040> firing<00:03:11.430> arrows<00:03:11.820> I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
back and pretend to be firing arrows I

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.590 
back and pretend to be firing arrows I
think<00:03:12.390> that's<00:03:12.540> really<00:03:12.750> cool<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.350> his<00:03:13.950> arrow

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
think that's really cool and his arrow

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.540 
think that's really cool and his arrow
does<00:03:15.600> have<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.870> little<00:03:18.380> nub<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.739> there<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.489> you

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
does have a little nub on there and you

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.620 
does have a little nub on there and you
can<00:03:20.700> fit<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.570> little<00:03:22.500> peg<00:03:22.770> hole<00:03:26.239> let's<00:03:27.239> tab

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
can fit that a little peg hole let's tab

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.949 
can fit that a little peg hole let's tab
that<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.050> like<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.600> can't<00:03:30.840> have

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
that in like that and you can't have

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:44.759 
that in like that and you can't have
them<00:03:31.080> hold<00:03:31.350> it

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.309 

again<00:03:45.769> it's<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:47.060> same<00:03:47.329> thing<00:03:47.689> with<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.019> lot<00:03:48.290> of

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
again it's the same thing with a lot of

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.740 
again it's the same thing with a lot of
the<00:03:48.469> figures<00:03:48.859> the<00:03:49.819> accessories<00:03:50.390> are<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.569> little

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
the figures the accessories are a little

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.490 
the figures the accessories are a little
too<00:03:51.079> small<00:03:51.500> for<00:03:51.799> their<00:03:51.920> hands<00:03:53.140> but<00:03:54.140> if<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.319> do

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
too small for their hands but if you do

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.580 
too small for their hands but if you do
turn<00:03:54.799> it<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.129> little<00:03:55.159> bit<00:03:55.579> he<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:56.000> hold<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:56.590> and

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
turn it a little bit he can hold it and

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.390 
turn it a little bit he can hold it and
it<00:03:57.709> stays<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.219> the<00:03:58.310> one<00:03:58.519> spot<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:59.120> doesn't

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
it stays in the one spot it doesn't

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.960 
it stays in the one spot it doesn't
rotate<00:04:01.400> out<00:04:01.879> or<00:04:02.090> anything<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.950> onto<00:04:07.579> his<00:04:07.730> mace

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
rotate out or anything so onto his mace

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.649 
rotate out or anything so onto his mace
uses<00:04:09.159> maces<00:04:10.159> big<00:04:10.370> weapon<00:04:10.819> in<00:04:10.939> this<00:04:11.090> thing<00:04:11.420> I

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
uses maces big weapon in this thing I

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.899 
uses maces big weapon in this thing I
thought<00:04:12.200> would<00:04:12.560> be<00:04:12.620> all<00:04:12.859> hard<00:04:13.099> plastic<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:13.819> of

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
thought would be all hard plastic but of

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.240 
thought would be all hard plastic but of
course<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:14.269> handle<00:04:14.689> down<00:04:14.870> here<00:04:15.170> is<00:04:15.349> soft

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
course this handle down here is soft

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.509 
course this handle down here is soft
plastic<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:18.079> any<00:04:18.410> home<00:04:18.650> place<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.160> can<00:04:19.310> see

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
plastic so any home place you can see

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.460 
plastic so any home place you can see
I'm<00:04:19.669> holding<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.389> it<00:04:20.479> is<00:04:20.599> bending<00:04:23.470> really

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
I'm holding it and it is bending really

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.279 
I'm holding it and it is bending really
have<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.740> hold<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:25.240> up<00:04:26.240> here<00:04:26.539> for<00:04:26.720> two<00:04:26.870> not<00:04:27.020> bend

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
have to hold it up here for two not bend

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.020 
have to hold it up here for two not bend
which<00:04:27.470> is<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> shame<00:04:27.770> because<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:30.380> think<00:04:30.680> that

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
which is a shame because I think that

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.950 
which is a shame because I think that
should<00:04:32.030> have<00:04:32.180> just<00:04:32.360> made<00:04:32.599> this<00:04:32.720> whole<00:04:32.780> thing

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
should have just made this whole thing

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:47.330 
should have just made this whole thing
all<00:04:33.380> hard<00:04:33.650> plastic

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.880 

so<00:04:48.340> there's<00:04:48.550> grown<00:04:48.880> all<00:04:49.150> armored<00:04:49.630> up<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:49.890> his

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
so there's grown all armored up and his

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.790 
so there's grown all armored up and his
mace<00:04:51.880> does<00:04:52.270> come<00:04:52.600> with<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.050> extending

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
mace does come with the extending

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.100 
mace does come with the extending
feature<00:04:54.070> that's<00:04:54.400> probably<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.850> main<00:04:55.110> magnet

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
feature that's probably the main magnet

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:04.110 
feature that's probably the main magnet
gimmick<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.680> them<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.460> just<00:05:02.610> pull<00:05:03.610> this<00:05:03.790> out

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
gimmick of them so just pull this out

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.220 
gimmick of them so just pull this out
and<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.790> magnet<00:05:07.270> is<00:05:07.450> located<00:05:08.170> right<00:05:08.440> here

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
and the magnet is located right here

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.290 
and the magnet is located right here
just<00:05:11.230> get<00:05:11.770> that<00:05:11.920> on<00:05:12.100> his<00:05:12.220> back<00:05:12.490> as<00:05:12.790> you<00:05:13.000> can<00:05:13.120> see

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
just get that on his back as you can see

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.860 
just get that on his back as you can see
it<00:05:13.630> extends<00:05:14.400> put<00:05:15.400> do<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:15.730> again<00:05:16.000> push<00:05:16.510> it<00:05:16.690> in

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
it extends put do it again push it in

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
the way the figure looks but he is

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.220 
the way the figure looks but he is
limited<00:06:31.770> with<00:06:32.040> some<00:06:32.340> pose<00:06:32.520> ability<00:06:33.030> his<00:06:33.600> legs

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
limited with some pose ability his legs

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.490 
limited with some pose ability his legs
are<00:06:34.410> a<00:06:34.470> little<00:06:34.530> limited<00:06:34.890> here<00:06:35.400> with<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:36.500> armor

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
are a little limited here with the armor

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.430 
are a little limited here with the armor
and<00:06:37.740> his<00:06:38.400> head<00:06:38.669> can't<00:06:39.540> row<00:06:39.780> takes<00:06:40.080> up<00:06:40.290> all<00:06:40.410> the

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
and his head can't row takes up all the

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.610 
and his head can't row takes up all the
hair<00:06:40.860> but<00:06:41.850> I<00:06:41.880> think<00:06:42.270> just<00:06:42.720> like<00:06:42.900> the<00:06:42.960> look<00:06:43.410> of

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
hair but I think just like the look of

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.430 
hair but I think just like the look of
the<00:06:43.800> figure<00:06:44.100> it<00:06:44.190> makes<00:06:44.460> up<00:06:44.700> for<00:06:44.729> those<00:06:45.440> tiny

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
the figure it makes up for those tiny

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.800 
the figure it makes up for those tiny
flaws<00:06:46.890> I<00:06:47.700> think<00:06:48.180> they<00:06:48.300> could<00:06:48.510> have<00:06:48.540> done<00:06:48.780> a

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
flaws I think they could have done a

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.400 
flaws I think they could have done a
little<00:06:48.990> bit<00:06:49.200> better<00:06:49.470> with<00:06:49.950> his<00:06:50.160> accessories<00:06:51.410> I

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410
