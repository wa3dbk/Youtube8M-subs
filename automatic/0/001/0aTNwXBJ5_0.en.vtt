00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.760
 attention drivers of sÃ£o paulo the traffic engineering company 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.150
 began to fine drivers today who do not respect the range and preference 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.610
 of pedestrians crossing streets and avenues in the center of the city 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.369
 pressure is already provided in the Brazilian traffic code does not give 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.859
 pedestrian preference is considered a very serious violation that can make the 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:22.539
 driver 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.769
 lose seven points in the wallet 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.000
 two whales of the strongest 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.310
 the pedestrian driver is not respected in the range 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.300
 never by some to others not 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.470
 already in the sense of crossing without getting wet 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.470
 at an undefined time because he has a cet agent 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.360
 would have respected 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.330
 worse still when the crossing has no traffic light 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.980
 the beautiful street the driver would have to pass 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 air for people to pass 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 but if my Metropolitan Civil Guard vehicle stops 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.820
 because bikers stocks lists in other cases 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.310
 the infraction will generate high fines 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.489
 one reais and fifty-three cents 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.450
 and seven points in the portfolio for three months I agreed to promote a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.970
 educational campaign, the agents will begin to investigate in this region what 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.200
 includes percent 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.760
 and the Paulista avenue 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.880
 154 agents that will be intensifying 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.430
 and are three more specific frameworks for 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.119
 to identify irregularities has many countries when the pedestrian 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.759
 joke in the band automatically if 11 dead 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.510
 the area between it pass 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.180
 should also be so 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.660
 but that's not why until everyone has this awareness is always good 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.660
 stress the prosecution cites before passing 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.330
 to encourage pedestrians to make a gesture of 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.300
 traffic lights make mime in the corners that aid the accifi 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.190
 the drivers 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.380
 They're collaborating, I think it's okay, right. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.939
 it is predicted that his chances also 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.439
 but you have to present 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.209
 have to have the preference even when there are no people the tv culture I'm already 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.749
 talking about proposals 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.549
 both had to give up to take the test 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.119
 even with supervision, the result was not positive 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.059
 do not hesitate to stop at the wing 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.989
 is there for the sea 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.479
 will be full 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:38.519
 for over a month he has too much to learn 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 in fact many tomorrow this year 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.699
 burnout area 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.869
 the staff is still used to it 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.469
 So one day you'll get used to it. 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.349
 it will take some colors 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.059
 according to fipe survey 90 03% of drivers still ignore the tracks 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.209
 last year half of life 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.269
 hit by run over 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.540
 but the driver is not the only villain has a pedestrian that does not take it is not 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.539
 sorry 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:21.909
 it's the usual 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.459
 you can not wait 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.149
 even with straw yes 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:29.149
 I'm tired, interrupting is worth it. 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:37.079

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.899
