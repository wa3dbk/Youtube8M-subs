horrible pieces of technology they're

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.280 
horrible pieces of technology they're
very<00:02:03.560> dangerous<00:02:04.330> they<00:02:05.330> give<00:02:05.540> off<00:02:05.570> terrible

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
very dangerous they give off terrible

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
illnesses and almost worst of all they

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.580 
illnesses and almost worst of all they
cost<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.860> fortune<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.670> run<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.380> a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
cost a fortune to run and so you have a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.590 
cost a fortune to run and so you have a
situation<00:02:16.070> where<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> very<00:02:16.880> poorest<00:02:17.239> people
