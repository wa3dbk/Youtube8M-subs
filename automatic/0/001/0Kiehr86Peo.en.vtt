here is to stick in the orange line half
of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.229> orange<00:01:55.530> line<00:01:55.619> which<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.210> cost

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of the orange line which is in the cost

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.920 
of the orange line which is in the cost
side<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.670> side<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.299> here

you know faster it's like 100 artifact

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.740 
you know faster it's like 100 artifact
one<00:02:32.620> plan<00:02:33.460> this<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.110> line<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:36.750> it's

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
one plan this of the line and it's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.060 
one plan this of the line and it's
basically<00:02:38.620> yeah<00:02:39.220> it's<00:02:39.459> good<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:40.530> be<00:02:41.530> alone
