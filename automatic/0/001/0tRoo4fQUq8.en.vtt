00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:04.529
 the agent all right I wanted to make a video about 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.630
 buy a buying tip 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.000
 You've had a burris for everyone thinking about winning. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.860
 netbook pointed the clubs here are many people who ask me who 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.249
 do not know the netbook 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.829
 it is a computer that is 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.990
 very similar to notebooks 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.679
 only it is smaller 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.529
 in itaara and less powerful and also does not have unlike dcv 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.599
 that almost all models bring 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.499
 but all of them at least 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.790
 is something you need to know if you want to buy a pc 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.740
 I first wanted to talk about what was going on here but I want a general notion 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.320
 that I think about it 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.490
 is that you should not invest too much has several netbook models in the 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.390
 Marketplace 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.460
 chemistry 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.280
 damiao 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.320
 different functions for you but I do not think they are worth much 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.519
 because they add many in price you end up not using one of the 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.260
 The main causes of counting were type that allows you to live 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.560
 the ANA 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.560
 until then the photos that on the outside over the keyboard 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.299
 and have for example a blog a haiti thing 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.350
 let's get lucky because the type thing you can use the computer 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.220
 it's straight from the screen clicking matching thing like that 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.439
 there are several things I find with it working many things in this one 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.439
 What does it take God and such? 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.580
 she is I think you do not need anything Said mind 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.400
 we want you to go with more into account than you find because a 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.420
 fast and give up 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.170
 disappeared is very similar usually so varies very little 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.720
 brand to brand 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.270
 a framework to worry about is that by any chance as far as I know the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.860
 what is it 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.460
 ap mates who invented the netbook think the epice was the first until 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.140
 where I know 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.120
 that this measure in which many of them 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.570
 I actually bought cheaper than they had 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.840
 I'm very satisfied 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.360
 but here are some tips from what I think you should note in the post 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.030
 elected 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.070
 first relative to the processor 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.429
 you will not find 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.379
 a very large difference between the assets that have the 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.310
 processing solos of the savers the team that is the model l 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.620
 330 I most recently dated 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.749
 That's another conversation, but I'll stay smart for a while. 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:22.639
 the most common models you will find now if you are 271 in almost 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.629
 50, there is basically the same processing capacity but there is a 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.089
 big difference between them I will not go into detail but most importantly 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.229
 the difference between them that you perceive 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.069
 is here 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.349
 is that consumption is different 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.109
 the index has gone from 51 and consumes much less than the mainz by 70% in May and 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.279
 mostly ii 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.590
 and not only that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.670
 the almost 70 orey group as it is one of the newer models are coming now 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.450
 on netbooks that have a six-cell battery instead of three 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.130
 I want you to come then Alex has a processor that consumes much less than 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.639
 it has one that does not exist a much bigger battery 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.769
 so far I just found the bet is on the table or 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.490
 in a dell brand appeal that comes with a processor 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.940
 it almost 50 th with a battle battery of the mx3 cells all models of 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.940
 450 netbook processor I've seen so far 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.679
 apple comes 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:20.329
 with the foot with a six-cell battery this the second time 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.130
 medicine 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.959
 a donation g 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.419
 11 hours of drums I know if it all comes out I already used it seriously already 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.209
 I managed to use it for 9 had 8 9 I think I had until life stories in a 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.100
 show battery 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.459
 a retaliation 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.629
 so this is good because it's a netbook 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.239
 his thing has to stop if you do not want to carry a charger load 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.330
 I'll leave with what you think 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.530
 - the emotion you use in addition to this is that we will expect nothing more 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.669
 then she seventy inattentiveness in the life of the drummer in him the singer in the duration of 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.770
 battery pack bringing English battery life 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.960
 which I think is important 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.079
 Another thing that I think is important is the size of the keyboard 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.579
 you have the very compact condition that is difficult to type 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.969
 so you have a great keyboard ex-model that I have here 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.139
 to see the measurements he is 92% the size of a normal keyboard 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.439
 I had until you get here bernardinho so this is it's a 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.289
 good advantage 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.759
 if you are going to spend on digital tv, you want something that is 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.479
 fish 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.840
 the term netbooks like how sentries are told it may be loose 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.969
 shake mind you buy 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:32.009
 and the last is the screen also it is worth noting a very low violation and 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:32.430
 more 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.460
 in general the natives are leaving is to her 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.670
 more recently have a good surprise to enter 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.300
 no detail relationships 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.300
 So that's it, people, I'm going to tell the advisors a little bit now. 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.970
 if you want to buy your fear that if you buy a rose with the son 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.249
 we rely on the movie part 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:55.069
 it is you will definitely want evil if you want very much 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.370
 it was a very good comment and 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.930
 Ricardo wants to copy paste that we use the 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.250
 because of crack provides firm prices 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.189
 usually the small buildings to apple 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.089
 so if you want you buy a rose with a yarn with the retractable cousin I 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:11.830
 I bought incentive 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.970
 is for now any tip for anyone who wants to watch the first against mpt is that 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.999
 many people 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.259
 Kind of easy to carry in the bag. 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.240
 not enough, but the most important question is that the 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.810
 lions are usually the receivers of these things wireless 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.330
 are fulfilled I have not told we're throwing stones and I was afraid 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.010
 of hitting a dam that opens a business so what I did artificial the 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.979
 sub-sector detector 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.650
 This time in Tokyo 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.650
 so netbook title lie on Twitter 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.130
 he has to get 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.590
 I put myself in the bag so and lastly my last tip also in 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.770
 relation to bags so it awaits ipsis verbis crime 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.099
 to my tip you buy a cap featured that the cheapest by chance 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.529
 people to stay in the fish gets thrown in here 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.419
 any advantage of this 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.169
 fm - you buy this think buying a purse in the peak production process 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.500
 This is just for play. 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.360
 it proves good if you have 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.960
 time you have the role of the shakhtar herivelto with the process to put 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.460
 a defeat shows to be protected and 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.740
 You do not have to have a scholarship on our planet. 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.779
 protection 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.969
 so that's it people I think this team is always committed 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.129
 I hope I have helped chow
