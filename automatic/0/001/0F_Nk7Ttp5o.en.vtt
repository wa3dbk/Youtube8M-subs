mainly got it cuz I didn't have a case

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
mainly got it cuz I didn't have a case
for<00:01:12.840> any<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.110> these<00:01:13.200> three<00:01:13.380> games<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.400> got

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
the cases so I'm like ah that sucks so

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.960 
the cases so I'm like ah that sucks so
this<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.080> convenient<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.820> if

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
this is really really convenient and if

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.480 
this is really really convenient and if
you<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.570> case<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.340> can

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
you don't like that case like you can

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.060 
you don't like that case like you can
replace<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.299> other<00:01:27.479> cases<00:01:27.890> some<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> them

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
replace it with other cases some of them

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.380 
replace it with other cases some of them
are<00:01:29.310> reversible

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
are reversible

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.160 
are reversible
this<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.170> isn't<00:01:32.540> because<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.020> can

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this one isn't because you can you can

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.420 
this one isn't because you can you can
tell<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.380> they're<00:01:34.500> reversible<00:01:34.890> because<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
tell if they're reversible because it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.630 
tell if they're reversible because it
was<00:01:35.549> shown<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.000> ten<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> 30s<00:01:36.650> card<00:01:37.650> case<00:01:37.920> 18

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
was shown in ten to the 30s card case 18

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480 
was shown in ten to the 30s card case 18
on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.240> spine<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.950> when<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> open<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.430> one

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
on the spine and when you open this one

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.100 
on the spine and when you open this one
it<00:01:41.759> doesn't<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.090> show<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.990> like

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it doesn't really show it and it's like

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
it doesn't really show it and it's like
really<00:01:43.710> meant<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> show<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.490> blood<00:01:44.970> game

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210

stays on the outs

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.119 
stays on the outs
I<00:02:14.040> mainly<00:02:15.040> because<00:02:15.659> it<00:02:16.659> says<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.560> card<00:02:17.920> case

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
I mainly because it says the card case

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.630 
I mainly because it says the card case
18<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:19.629> each<00:02:19.840> game<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.859> shows<00:02:21.310> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
18 and for each game it shows a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.080 
18 and for each game it shows a
different<00:02:21.969> item<00:02:22.319> but<00:02:23.319> still<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.969> recommend<00:02:24.969> you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
different item but still I recommend you

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.000 
different item but still I recommend you
keep<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.810> inside<00:02:25.959> then<00:02:26.799> use

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
keep this one on the inside then use

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.410 
keep this one on the inside then use
this<00:02:27.159> one<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.459> outside<00:02:27.579> I<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.359> will

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
this one on the outside I think it will

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.800 
this one on the outside I think it will
just<00:02:28.569> look<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.840> lot<00:02:29.019> cooler<00:02:30.239> all<00:02:31.239> right

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
gotta run

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:23.209 
gotta run
pretty<00:06:06.779> slow<00:06:10.999> come<00:06:11.999> on<00:06:12.239> come<00:06:12.989> on<00:06:21.949> okay<00:06:22.949> here<00:06:23.129> we

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
pretty slow come on come on okay here we

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.419 
pretty slow come on come on okay here we
go<00:06:23.659> we<00:06:24.659> can<00:06:24.689> get<00:06:24.959> a<00:06:24.989> preview<00:06:25.379> it's<00:06:26.069> probably

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:26.429 
go we can get a preview it's probably

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:38.790 
go we can get a preview it's probably
gonna<00:06:26.519> run<00:06:26.699> slow

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.650 

yeah<00:06:39.669> usually<00:06:40.060> runs<00:06:40.270> a<00:06:40.360> lot<00:06:40.539> faster<00:06:40.569> than<00:06:41.050> this

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
yeah usually runs a lot faster than this
