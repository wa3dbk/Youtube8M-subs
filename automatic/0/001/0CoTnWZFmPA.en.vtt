so again if so clearly about the energy

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
so again if so clearly about the energy
efficiency<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.390> see

such<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> good<00:02:35.440> quick<00:02:35.650> run<00:02:35.950> through<00:02:35.980> all<00:02:36.459> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
such a good quick run through all the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.900 
such a good quick run through all the
features<00:02:37.300> on<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.430> must<00:02:39.640> remember

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
features on that but you must remember

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.190 
features on that but you must remember
before<00:02:40.269> it's<00:02:40.600> more<00:02:40.750> than<00:02:40.840> any<00:02:40.959> washing

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
before it's more than any washing

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.410 
before it's more than any washing
machine<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.900> must<00:02:44.110> remove<00:02:44.290> transit<00:02:44.800> bulbs

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
machine you must remove transit bulbs

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.479 
machine you must remove transit bulbs
but<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.870> one<00:02:47.110> has<00:02:47.290> 5<00:02:47.560> grams<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.950> bolts

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
but this one has 5 grams of bolts

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.180 
but this one has 5 grams of bolts
so<00:02:48.819> there's<00:02:49.000> five<00:02:49.180> balls<00:02:49.450> at<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.660> back<00:02:49.930> as<00:02:50.860> it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
so there's five balls at the back as it

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.930 
so there's five balls at the back as it
needs<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.400> be<00:02:51.489> removed

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
needs to be removed

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.870 
needs to be removed
this<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.180> put<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.450> place<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.110> when<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
this is put in place so when the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.979 
this is put in place so when the
Washington's<00:02:54.880> in<00:02:55.000> transit<00:02:55.420> from<00:02:55.600> when<00:02:55.810> it's

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
Washington's in transit from when it's

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.530 
Washington's in transit from when it's
made<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.230> when<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.130> reaches<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.519> customer<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
made to when it reaches the customer the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.210 
made to when it reaches the customer the
drum<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:59.140> securely<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.709> place<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.130> doesn't

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
drum is securely in place it doesn't

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.800 
drum is securely in place it doesn't
wobble<00:03:00.459> about<00:03:00.790> breaking<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.390> internal

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
wobble about breaking the internal
