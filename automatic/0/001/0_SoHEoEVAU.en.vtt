00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
ready to go so looking at the map here

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.890 
ready to go so looking at the map here
we're<00:00:19.849> starting<00:00:20.240> out<00:00:20.329> where<00:00:20.480> all<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.660> blue

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
we're starting out where all the blue

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.409 
we're starting out where all the blue
bits<00:00:21.140> are<00:00:21.380> with<00:00:22.189> a<00:00:22.220> car<00:00:22.490> park<00:00:22.759> and<00:00:22.939> heading<00:00:23.269> up

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
bits are with a car park and heading up

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.999 
bits are with a car park and heading up
to<00:00:23.599> the<00:00:23.630> top<00:00:23.990> right<00:00:24.230> hand<00:00:24.409> side<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:24.919> that's

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
to the top right hand side and that's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.909 
to the top right hand side and that's
all<00:00:25.189> uphill<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.640> begin<00:00:25.909> with<00:00:29.529> so<00:00:30.529> this<00:00:30.679> ride<00:00:30.890> is

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
all uphill to begin with so this ride is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.099 
all uphill to begin with so this ride is
virtually<00:00:31.369> all<00:00:31.489> single<00:00:31.819> track<00:00:32.060> and<00:00:32.359> once

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:33.109 
virtually all single track and once

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.529 
virtually all single track and once
you're<00:00:33.199> at<00:00:33.289> the<00:00:33.350> car<00:00:33.530> park<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:34.250> is<00:00:34.399> a

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
you're at the car park and this is a

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.420 
you're at the car park and this is a
midweek<00:00:35.539> so<00:00:36.109> it<00:00:36.170> wasn't<00:00:36.350> too<00:00:36.410> busy<00:00:36.770> that's<00:00:37.190> the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
midweek so it wasn't too busy that's the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.490 
midweek so it wasn't too busy that's the
downhill<00:00:38.210> section<00:00:38.420> which<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:39.260> haven't<00:00:39.530> ridden

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
downhill section which I haven't ridden

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.069 
downhill section which I haven't ridden
so<00:00:42.500> basically<00:00:42.920> you're<00:00:43.070> falling<00:00:43.370> there<00:00:43.519> is<00:00:43.609> a

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
so basically you're falling there is a

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.259 
so basically you're falling there is a
scenic<00:00:45.079> road<00:00:45.289> going<00:00:45.859> parallel<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.640> single

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
scenic road going parallel to the single

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.529 
scenic road going parallel to the single
track<00:00:47.480> there<00:00:48.340> so<00:00:49.340> it<00:00:49.460> follows<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.390> road

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
track there so it follows the the road

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.299 
track there so it follows the the road
up<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.019> valley<00:00:53.589> so<00:00:54.589> the<00:00:54.710> single<00:00:54.980> track<00:00:55.160> goes

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
up the valley so the single track goes

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.970 
up the valley so the single track goes
up<00:00:55.489> through<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.730> forest<00:00:56.530> it's<00:00:57.530> all<00:00:57.649> properly

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
up through the forest it's all properly

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.979 
up through the forest it's all properly
designed<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:01.129> most<00:01:01.309> of<00:01:01.429> it's<00:01:01.519> rideable<00:01:01.820> I<00:01:02.089> had

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
designed and most of it's rideable I had

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:12.069 
designed and most of it's rideable I had
to<00:01:03.079> push<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.350> little<00:01:03.379> bit<00:01:03.679> of<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:03.859> now<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.010> again

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.959 

eventually<00:01:13.079> comes<00:01:13.289> out<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.310> joins<00:01:14.610> up

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
eventually comes out and it joins up

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:20.090 
eventually comes out and it joins up
with<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.360> sea<00:01:16.170> crowd<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.039> is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
with the sea crowd here and this is

go midweek because it's pretty quiet and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.729 
go midweek because it's pretty quiet and
there's<00:02:15.660> only<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.840> few<00:02:15.989> people<00:02:16.049> out<00:02:16.410> riding<00:02:18.739> and

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
look at them up here so we bit further

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.490 
look at them up here so we bit further
up<00:02:21.420> we'll<00:02:21.660> go<00:02:21.690> follow<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.079> top<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.380> red

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
up we'll go follow the top of the red

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.800 
up we'll go follow the top of the red
line<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> top<00:02:23.489> now<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:26.329> this<00:02:27.329> next<00:02:27.569> section

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
line to the top now so this next section

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.160 
line to the top now so this next section
is<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:29.160> where<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.519> zigzags<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:30.989> see

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
is a is where it zigzags and you can see

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.780 
is a is where it zigzags and you can see
as<00:02:31.319> I'm<00:02:31.470> shooting<00:02:31.829> up<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.100> quite<00:02:32.310> steep<00:02:32.579> here

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
as I'm shooting up it's quite steep here

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.240 
as I'm shooting up it's quite steep here
so<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.989> there's<00:02:34.440> more<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.859> switchback

like<00:04:47.699> twists<00:04:48.120> around<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:49.320> looks<00:04:49.470> quite<00:04:49.830> easy

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
like twists around it looks quite easy

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.159 
like twists around it looks quite easy
believe<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:50.970> film<00:04:51.300> list<00:04:51.509> it's<00:04:51.840> actually

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
believe on the film list it's actually

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.129 
believe on the film list it's actually
quite<00:04:52.350> difficult<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:54.210> turns<00:04:54.539> around<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:55.080> you

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
quite difficult it turns around so you

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.180 
quite difficult it turns around so you
do<00:04:55.380> need<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.590> have<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.770> bit<00:04:55.919> of<00:04:55.979> confidence

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
do need to have a bit of confidence

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.700 
do need to have a bit of confidence
about<00:04:56.400> doing<00:04:56.820> all<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.500> yeah<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.560> goes

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
about doing all this yeah it goes

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.560 
about doing all this yeah it goes
underneath<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.130> tube<00:04:59.789> there<00:05:00.060> that's<00:05:00.419> quite

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
underneath the tube there that's quite

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.700 
underneath the tube there that's quite
fun<00:05:02.630> film<00:05:03.630> makes<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:03.960> look<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.169> little<00:05:04.289> easier

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
fun film makes it look a little easier

fun film makes it look a little easier
nasty<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.340> because<00:05:05.699> it's<00:05:05.820> quite<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.030> tight<00:05:06.509> turn

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
nasty is because it's quite a tight turn

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.590 
nasty is because it's quite a tight turn
