00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.369
 take a long cut of 4.43 put there 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.580
 a 6-cylinder with over 300 horsepower and 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.310
 did not get a m3 e36 3 both 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.570
 but a 35 m2 that admit that the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.369
 resemblance is still a little bit 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.689
 striking and it is this observation that we 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.689
 did as part of our test 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.440
 first criterion of comparison 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.880
 dimensions the m 2 35 which is the l3 do 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 almost the same length at 3 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.550
 millimeter wide in width 1 77 for the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.440
 last year against 1 71 for 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.790
 the ancestor less than one can say it is 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.010
 even though we have cars in the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.650
 dimensions are very close alone 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.670
 true difference the kof 435 liters 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.800
 for the m3 e36 against 390 for the m 2 35 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.070
 on that side it is the m3 that 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.070
 prevail 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.310
 no 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.250
 the strongest group of the m200 35 which 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.060
 is not in his trunk but under the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.369

 ella lane 3.36 can not fight what 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.899
 amazes the most with the ap of 35 hoist the

 level of performance offered by 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.830
 this car which is certainly discreet 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.860
 but who still allows himself safety 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.319
 from 1000 meters standing start in 23.8
