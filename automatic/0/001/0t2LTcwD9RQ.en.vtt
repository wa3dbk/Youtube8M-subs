going to help me a line up my leg I'm
actually<00:00:31.500> start<00:00:31.800> building<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
actually start building here with the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.729 
actually start building here with the
foot<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.450> my<00:00:33.570> primary<00:00:34.020> method<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.469> actually

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
foot and my primary method is actually

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.250 
foot and my primary method is actually
building<00:00:35.100> out<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> stirrup<00:00:36.030> first<00:00:36.420> i'm<00:00:37.140> going

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
building out a stirrup first i'm going

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.750 
building out a stirrup first i'm going
to<00:00:37.350> select<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:38.040> edges<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> front

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to select these two edges on the front

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.260 
to select these two edges on the front
side<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:38.969> extrude<00:00:39.660> downwards<00:00:40.760> right<00:00:41.760> over

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
side and extrude downwards right over

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.400 
side and extrude downwards right over
the<00:00:42.450> first<00:00:43.070> ankle<00:00:44.510> let's<00:00:45.510> will<00:00:45.629> be<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> inside

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the first ankle let's will be the inside

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.590 
the first ankle let's will be the inside
ankle<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.820> based<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
ankle and as you see here based on the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.770 
ankle and as you see here based on the
bone<00:00:49.190> we<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> different

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
bone we actually have a different

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.990 
bone we actually have a different
position<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.649> ankle<00:00:52.829> between<00:00:53.430> inside<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
position of the ankle between inside and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.680 
position of the ankle between inside and
the<00:00:54.420> outside<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.829> medial<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.370> lateral<00:00:56.789> sides

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the outside the medial and lateral sides

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.220 
the outside the medial and lateral sides
of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.320> ankle<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> when<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> screw<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.629> these

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
of the ankle so when I screw down these

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.219 
of the ankle so when I screw down these
edges<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:02.760> new<00:01:03.090> faces<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> left

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
edges to make new faces for the left

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.840 
edges to make new faces for the left
side<00:01:04.470> notice<00:01:05.189> how<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> pull<00:01:05.729> them

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
side notice how I'm going to pull them

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
side notice how I'm going to pull them
down<00:01:05.880> further<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.590> meet<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
down further here to meet up with the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250 
down further here to meet up with the
fibula<00:01:08.520> which<00:01:08.549> ends<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.450> meeting<00:01:09.659> lower<00:01:09.960> down

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
fibula which ends up meeting lower down

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.140 
fibula which ends up meeting lower down
this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> configuration<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.880> should

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
this is a configuration that you should

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.010 
this is a configuration that you should
get<00:01:14.000> by<00:01:15.000> moving<00:01:15.240> these<00:01:15.360> vertices<00:01:15.630> Apple

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
get by moving these vertices Apple

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.390 
get by moving these vertices Apple
trying<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> make<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.590> rounded<00:01:17.040> cup

trying to make a little rounded cup

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.070 
trying to make a little rounded cup
shape<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.750> match<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.299> position<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.540> what

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
shape to match up the position with what

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
shape to match up the position with what
was<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.890> ankles<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.880> I'm

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
was going on with ankles then I'm

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
was going on with ankles then I'm
amazing<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.330> Penn<00:01:24.509> polygon<00:01:24.930> tools<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.350> see

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
amazing at Penn polygon tools you see

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.760 
amazing at Penn polygon tools you see
here<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.700> finish<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.840> off<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
here to really finish that off like I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.429 
here to really finish that off like I
said<00:01:28.829> making<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.490> stirrup<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> insert

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
said making a stirrup with the insert

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.260 
said making a stirrup with the insert
edge<00:01:31.650> loop<00:01:31.680> tool<00:01:31.950> I'll<00:01:32.369> insert<00:01:32.820> an<00:01:32.970> edge<00:01:33.090> loop

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
edge loop tool I'll insert an edge loop

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.410 
edge loop tool I'll insert an edge loop
and<00:01:33.479> scale<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.840> move<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> down<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> fits<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and scale it move it down so it fits the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.770 
and scale it move it down so it fits the
position<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.200> bottom<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> foot<00:01:38.780> just

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
position on the bottom of the foot just

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
position on the bottom of the foot just
make<00:01:39.930> sure<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.200> vertices<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:41.100> even<00:01:41.670> up

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
make sure my vertices here are even up

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.050 
make sure my vertices here are even up
with<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.329> bottom<00:01:42.689> edge<00:01:46.790> let's<00:01:47.790> use<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
with that bottom edge let's use the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.649 
with that bottom edge let's use the
insert<00:01:48.299> edge<00:01:48.479> loop<00:01:48.509> tool<00:01:48.659> again<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.560> this

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
insert edge loop tool again to do this

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.969 
insert edge loop tool again to do this
same<00:01:51.659> thing<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:51.960> before<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> things

I'm manipulating this section and as I

I'm manipulating this section and as I
pulled<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.769> stirrup<00:02:22.459> down<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.780> one<00:02:24.470> of

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
pulled this stirrup down and one of

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.839 
pulled this stirrup down and one of
things<00:02:24.590> i<00:02:24.769> like<00:02:24.980> about<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.340> stirrup<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.730> that

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
things i like about the stirrup is that

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.729 
things i like about the stirrup is that
it<00:02:25.940> gives<00:02:26.120> me<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.300> ability<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:27.080> then

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
it gives me the ability to then

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.550 
it gives me the ability to then
separately<00:02:28.670> extrude<00:02:29.150> out<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.629> face<00:02:29.989> later<00:02:30.319> on

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
separately extrude out a face later on

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.710 
separately extrude out a face later on
or<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.340> set<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.700> faces<00:02:31.819> later<00:02:32.120> on<00:02:32.299> to<00:02:32.450> fill<00:02:32.629> up

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
or a set of faces later on to fill up

or a set of faces later on to fill up
the<00:02:32.840> back<00:02:33.160> what<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.190> make<00:02:34.400> sure<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.670> I've<00:02:34.760> done

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the back what I make sure that I've done

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.759 
the back what I make sure that I've done
right<00:02:35.239> now<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.569> I'm<00:02:35.690> trying<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.080> match<00:02:36.260> up<00:02:36.530> to

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
right now is I'm trying to match up to

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.520 
right now is I'm trying to match up to
the<00:02:37.060> face<00:02:38.060> count<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.720> top<00:02:38.989> coming<00:02:39.410> down

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
the face count on the top coming down

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.080 
the face count on the top coming down
from<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.769> leg<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.220> what<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.459> have<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.760> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
from the leg with what I have on the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.089 
from the leg with what I have on the
bottom<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.930> will<00:02:42.140> hopefully<00:02:42.620> seem

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
bottom so that this will hopefully seem

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.699 
bottom so that this will hopefully seem
up<00:02:43.280> pretty<00:02:43.519> nicely<00:02:44.049> let's<00:02:45.049> just<00:02:45.140> move<00:02:45.530> that

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
up pretty nicely let's just move that

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.830 
up pretty nicely let's just move that
out<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.220> with<00:02:46.340> soften<00:02:46.700> normals<00:02:47.000> delete<00:02:47.690> my

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
out and with soften normals delete my

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.030 
out and with soften normals delete my
history<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.250> that's<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.579> first<00:02:49.880> step
