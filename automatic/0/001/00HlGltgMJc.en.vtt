00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
word before what it actually does but

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.310

we'll take a look at that first we're
going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> look<00:00:25.800> at<00:00:25.980> color<00:00:26.310> though

me delete this square here real quick
and<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:29.430> next<00:02:29.670> function<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.120> I'm<00:02:30.239> going<00:02:30.270> to

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
and the next function that I'm going to

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.580 
and the next function that I'm going to
demonstrate<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.680> blurring<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.459> object<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
demonstrate is blurring an object and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.290 
demonstrate is blurring an object and
blurring<00:02:34.590> comes<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.370> really<00:02:36.000> handy<00:02:36.830> actually

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
blurring comes in really handy actually

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.850 
blurring comes in really handy actually
for<00:02:39.300> drop<00:02:40.170> shadows<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.860> example<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.769> so<00:02:43.769> what

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
for drop shadows for example and so what

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.640 
for drop shadows for example and so what
I'm<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.130> do<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.459> I'm<00:02:44.670> going<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
I'm going to do it I'm going to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.090 
I'm going to do it I'm going to
duplicate<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.370> star<00:02:47.760> here<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:49.069> we'll<00:02:50.069> just

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
duplicate this star here and we'll just

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.759 
duplicate this star here and we'll just
use<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.459> simple<00:02:50.970> copy<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.569> paste<00:02:51.840> control<00:02:52.470> C

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
use a simple copy and paste control C

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.590 
use a simple copy and paste control C
control<00:02:53.069> V<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:54.830> so<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.250> star<00:02:56.850> on<00:02:57.269> top<00:02:57.540> of

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
control V and so I have a star on top of

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.740 
control V and so I have a star on top of
the<00:02:57.840> star<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:59.060> I'm<00:03:00.060> going<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.299> select<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
the star and I'm going to select the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.259 
the star and I'm going to select the
star<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> background<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.220> apply<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.850> black

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
star in the background and apply a black

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.259 
star in the background and apply a black
color<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.220> star<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:07.970> then<00:03:08.970> I'll<00:03:09.090> go

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
color to that star and then I'll go

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.380 
color to that star and then I'll go
ahead<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.630> shift<00:03:09.870> my<00:03:10.140> top<00:03:10.470> star<00:03:11.360> over<00:03:12.360> a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
ahead and shift my top star over a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.190 
ahead and shift my top star over a
little<00:03:12.989> bit<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:17.150> select<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:19.019> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
effect and that definitely comes in

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.059 
effect and that definitely comes in
handy<00:04:33.610> as<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.879> are<00:04:35.120> creating<00:04:36.050> your<00:04:36.259> your

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
changing the opacity of an object so

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.900 
changing the opacity of an object so
that's<00:06:42.980> it<00:06:43.160> for<00:06:43.370> our<00:06:43.430> lesson<00:06:44.150> on<00:06:45.910> changing

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
that's it for our lesson on changing

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.230 
that's it for our lesson on changing
color<00:06:47.240> blurring<00:06:48.230> and<00:06:48.760> changing<00:06:49.760> the<00:06:49.910> opacity

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240
