got some interesting information when it

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.550 
got some interesting information when it
comes<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.090> blob<00:00:03.510> out<00:00:03.810> in<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.049> ocean<00:00:04.200> and

and the raising of the water temperature

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.750 
and the raising of the water temperature
because<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> radiation<00:00:28.609> but<00:00:29.609> they're

the area of concern right down in here
now<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:10.470> said<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.040> picked<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> up

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
now they said that they picked this up

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
now they said that they picked this up
in<00:01:12.290> 2013<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.540> they're<00:01:15.540> saying<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.990> it's

in 2013 and they're saying that it's
continued<00:01:16.770> into<00:01:16.979> 2014<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.970> they're

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
continued into 2014 and they're

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.249 
continued into 2014 and they're
expecting<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:20.070> hopefully<00:01:20.610> stop<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.540> 2015

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
expecting it to hopefully stop in 2015

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.230 
expecting it to hopefully stop in 2015
if<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.770> doesn't<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.520> continues<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
if it doesn't if it continues for a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.770 
if it doesn't if it continues for a
third<00:01:24.509> year<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.930> row<00:01:26.360> they<00:01:27.360> admit<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
third year in a row they admit that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.210 
third year in a row they admit that
there's<00:01:28.229> some<00:01:28.380> kind<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> problem<00:01:29.009> here

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there's some kind of problem here

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.340 
there's some kind of problem here
they're<00:01:29.729> hoping<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:30.689> anomaly<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
they're hoping that it's an anomaly and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.899 
they're hoping that it's an anomaly and
that<00:01:31.470> it'll<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.799> away<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.880> can't

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
that it'll go away because they can't

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
that it'll go away because they can't
explain<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.560> least<00:01:34.740> they're<00:01:34.950> not

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
explain it or at least they're not

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.359 
explain it or at least they're not

part<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> study<00:01:39.750> says<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.590> found<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
part of the study says they found that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.999 
part of the study says they found that
this<00:01:41.520> blob<00:01:41.880> had<00:01:42.270> formed<00:01:42.750> due<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> lasting

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this blob had formed due to a lasting

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.389 
this blob had formed due to a lasting
high<00:01:44.670> pressure<00:01:45.180> ridge<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.470> has<00:01:46.680> maintained

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
high pressure ridge that has maintained

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
heat levels in the water they say

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
heat levels in the water they say
normally<00:01:50.640> there's<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> low<00:01:51.780> pressure<00:01:52.110> system

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
normally there's a low pressure system

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.069 
normally there's a low pressure system
that<00:01:52.649> helps<00:01:53.040> cool<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> ocean<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
that helps cool the ocean there and that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.069 
that helps cool the ocean there and that
that<00:01:55.979> has<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.310> taken<00:01:56.610> place<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.299> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that has not taken place and that this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.010 
that has not taken place and that this

Oregon Washington and also the side
effect<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.729> guess<00:02:09.119> they're<00:02:09.270> saying<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.569> was

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
effect I guess they're saying it was

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
effect I guess they're saying it was
pushing<00:02:09.959> up<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:12.120> jet<00:02:12.420> stream<00:02:12.720> there

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
pushing up the jet stream there

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130 
pushing up the jet stream there
and<00:02:13.739> also<00:02:14.370> calling<00:02:14.670> causing<00:02:15.420> more<00:02:15.659> moisture

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and also calling causing more moisture

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.300

warmer<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.140> when<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.739> happens<00:02:59.220> that<00:03:00.150> they

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
warmer and when that happens that they

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.649 
warmer and when that happens that they
say<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.890> life<00:03:02.159> that<00:03:02.849> thrives<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.540> the

cooler<00:03:03.870> temperatures<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.590> not<00:03:04.799> there<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.370> it

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
cooler temperatures is not there and it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.880 
cooler temperatures is not there and it
starts<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.420> break<00:03:06.629> down<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.049> ecosystem<00:03:07.739> and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
starts to break down the ecosystem and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.190 
starts to break down the ecosystem and
things<00:03:08.250> everything<00:03:08.670> starts<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.420> push<00:03:09.930> away

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
things everything starts to push away

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.149 
things everything starts to push away
from<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:11.099> warmer<00:03:11.519> water<00:03:13.010> that's<00:03:14.010> how

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
from it in that warmer water that's how

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.430 
from it in that warmer water that's how
they're<00:03:14.310> explaining<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.940> they<00:03:15.629> finish<00:03:16.079> by

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
they're explaining it they finish by

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.309 
they're explaining it they finish by
stating<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.730> tied<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.900> global

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
stating this is not tied to global

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.170 
stating this is not tied to global
warming<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.310> most<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> time<00:03:24.030> when

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
warming so you know most the time when

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.699 
warming so you know most the time when
you<00:03:24.239> see<00:03:24.389> these<00:03:24.540> studies<00:03:24.900> come<00:03:25.079> out<00:03:25.230> here<00:03:25.560> it's
