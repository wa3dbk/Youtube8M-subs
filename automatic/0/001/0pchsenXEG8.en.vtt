00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
tired of that sort of a thing so it

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.190 
tired of that sort of a thing so it
would<00:04:22.400> be<00:04:22.490> interesting<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.030> see<00:04:23.330> when<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.080> if

world of warcraft does eventually go

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.060 
world of warcraft does eventually go
free-to-play<00:04:26.180> i<00:04:26.390> expect

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
free-to-play i expect

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.070 
free-to-play i expect
to<00:04:27.130> happen<00:04:27.460> how<00:04:27.970> it's<00:04:28.180> going<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.390> happen<00:04:28.540> what

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
to happen how it's going to happen what

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.270 
to happen how it's going to happen what
their<00:04:29.260> pricing<00:04:29.590> all<00:04:29.710> is<00:04:29.830> going<00:04:29.950> to<00:04:29.980> be<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.100> don't

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
their pricing all is going to be I don't

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.280 
their pricing all is going to be I don't
know<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.240> I<00:04:31.450> guess<00:04:31.570> we'll<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:31.840> have<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.140> see

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
know so I guess we'll just have to see

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.630 
know so I guess we'll just have to see
and<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.590> looks<00:04:32.710> like<00:04:32.770> blizzard<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.280> waiting<00:04:33.550> to
