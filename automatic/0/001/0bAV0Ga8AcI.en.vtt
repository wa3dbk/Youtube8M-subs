 good afternoon today with us and to the snack 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.370
 the actor Dastin Shakirov has just 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.990
 there was a premiere of the film milk sour cream

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.320

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.360

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.600
 I said that I will fight for this role 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.120

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.739

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.570
 said we approved you and I was just 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.250
 glad that this picture you saw me 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.890
 an opportunity to prove himself 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 on the other hand try yourself 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.329
 as a well maybe it is loud 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.759
 said as an actor because u 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.400
 i don't have acting education i just 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.369
 lover i like this creativity 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 like to look for different images 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.030
 show yourself from all sides and not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.340
 really enjoyed being in the role of council and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 to show this shy 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:56.189
 shy you liked the movie the movie 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.530
 Overall a good 1 due to witnesses 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.329
 have seen before I honestly have this 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.170
 I see the version for the first time because 2011 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.050
 year we shot the television version she 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.650
 There was from 3 series there mounting was quite 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.640
 other and here everything is completely different and 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.310
 here we have already voiced the first 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.040
 champ we wrote clear sound there a little bit 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.280
 it was different 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.540
 were throwing funny things on the set 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.540
 curiosities frankly two have already passed 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.480
 years I don't remember funny things were mostly 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.260
 higher honoric as you probably heard 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.450
 the group froze there 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.129
 there were very difficult shooting and my shooting 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.420
 passed in the building halyk bank in the house fee 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.209
 in the yard grip 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.500
 In principle, there were no funny things. 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.080
 everything was fine well say a few words about 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.850
 film director 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.400
 director i can only say 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.660
 exceptionally good because 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.500
 this is the first director with whom I had to 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.870
 work 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.090
 I mean, the director who gave 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.490
 I just freedom 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.950
 she gave me a lack of freedom said here itself 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.950
 improvise shows do what are you 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.200
 can i just fix you 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.620
 there were no special instructions there 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.240
 I was given complete freedom and by this I just 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:34.600
 very glad that this is your eighth movie 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:40.540
 on it so count 7 in my 7 2001 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.760
 what else projects are you mine 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.730
 creativity began soon I finished 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.380
 music school in parallel when 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.000
 went to school at school music hour in 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.370
 University I worked as a model 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.300
 the agency just moonlighting was filmed in 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.550
 ad clips movie debut will go to 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.050
 series I had in 2010 in 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.910
 Jean's series 1010 series Zhanan 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.980
 after him 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.580
 series bolashak mandala 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.330
 series on films and you yourself 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.150
 positioning 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.640
 only as an actor you have no idea to shoot 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.350
 movie and if with even you were shooting into which 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.020
 I am thrown 7 or 5 paraphrasing again 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.870
 how will you go where should our 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.460
 Kazakh cinema I think that our 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.640
 Kazakh cinema should 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.770
 develop looking at our russian 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.040
 colleagues on hollywood colleagues 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.169
 he shouldn't just stand still for me 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.390
 it seems that you need to shoot more 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.000
 work for directors to work 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.800
 and the writers of his actors we will 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.680
 more take more and thus just 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.690
 we will gain experience and need to shoot 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.210
 different movies do not just shoot 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.220
 stories historical films yes how are we in 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.680
 particular shoot need to shoot and 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.130
 modern films action movies so let's say 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.110
 arthouse and but this over time i think everything 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.690
 the main thing is not to stand still and 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.740
 move in the right direction in 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:12.790
 right direction we are just now 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.910
 the film premiered a few of which 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:21.220
 sour cream and we call you to the cinema 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.849

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.539
