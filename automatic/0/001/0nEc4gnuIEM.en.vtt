ax case one of the most common problems
we<00:00:07.680> have<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.460> customers<00:00:09.059> telling<00:00:09.300> us<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
we have is customers telling us that the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.270 
we have is customers telling us that the
psu<00:00:10.590> they've<00:00:10.800> had<00:00:10.950> delivered<00:00:11.219> doesn't<00:00:11.910> work

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
psu they've had delivered doesn't work

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.829 
psu they've had delivered doesn't work
so<00:00:14.280> after<00:00:14.519> talking<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.420> them<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> little

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
so after talking to them for a little

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.349 
so after talking to them for a little
bit<00:00:16.020> longer<00:00:16.609> we<00:00:17.609> asked<00:00:17.880> them<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:18.330> they

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
bit longer we asked them what they

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.019 
bit longer we asked them what they
fitted<00:00:18.810> if<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:20.039> are<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> signs<00:00:20.460> what

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
fitted if to and what are the signs what

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.429 
fitted if to and what are the signs what
is<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> problem<00:00:23.689> many<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.840> them<00:00:24.990> then<00:00:25.199> just

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
is the problem many of them then just

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.490 
is the problem many of them then just
say<00:00:25.910> well<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.060> plugged<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.050> my<00:00:28.349> main

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
say well I plugged it in to my main

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.450 
say well I plugged it in to my main
socket<00:00:29.869> like<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.520> I've<00:00:32.520> turned<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> switch<00:00:33.300> on

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
socket like so I've turned the switch on

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.979 
socket like so I've turned the switch on
and<00:00:35.460> nothing<00:00:36.120> happens<00:00:38.059> well<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:40.350> won't<00:00:41.989> if

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and nothing happens well it won't if

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
and nothing happens well it won't if
you're<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.739> plug<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you're just going to plug it into the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.170 
you're just going to plug it into the
mains<00:00:44.610> expecting<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> Oh<00:00:46.730> light<00:00:47.730> happen

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180

the right position on the motherboard to
make<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> contact<00:01:26.070> between<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.640> main<00:01:26.970> board

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
make a contact between the main board

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.399 
make a contact between the main board
and<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.409> power<00:01:28.619> supply

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.510 

now<00:01:34.189> an<00:01:34.579> easy<00:01:35.119> way<00:01:35.299> of<00:01:35.450> doing<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:35.869> is<00:01:36.520> without

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
now an easy way of doing this is without

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.719 
now an easy way of doing this is without
even<00:01:38.119> putting<00:01:38.450> them<00:01:38.780> overboard<00:01:39.020> in<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.469> case

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
even putting them overboard in the case

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.559 
even putting them overboard in the case
installing<00:01:40.729> your<00:01:40.909> processor<00:01:41.780> memory<00:01:41.990> etc<00:01:42.590> etc

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
installing your processor memory etc etc

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.459 
installing your processor memory etc etc
simply<00:01:44.569> connect<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:46.119> 20<00:01:47.119> pin<00:01:47.299> main<00:01:47.539> block<00:01:47.840> to

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
simply connect the 20 pin main block to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.910 
simply connect the 20 pin main block to
hear<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:51.250> 4-pin<00:01:52.359> CPU<00:01:53.359> plop<00:01:53.630> 12<00:01:53.959> volt<00:01:54.200> blop<00:01:54.709> to

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
hear the 4-pin CPU plop 12 volt blop to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.730 
hear the 4-pin CPU plop 12 volt blop to
hear<00:01:56.170> get<00:01:57.170> yourself<00:01:57.469> a<00:01:57.619> little<00:01:57.709> screwdriver

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
hear get yourself a little screwdriver

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.109 
hear get yourself a little screwdriver
find<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.859> two<00:02:01.039> pins<00:02:02.140> that<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.500> on/off<00:02:04.250> power

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
find the two pins that the on/off power

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.839 
find the two pins that the on/off power
switch<00:02:05.509> would<00:02:05.689> connect<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.670> short<00:02:07.670> them

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
switch would connect to and short them

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.130 
switch would connect to and short them
out<00:02:09.129> then<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.310> power<00:02:10.519> supply<00:02:10.970> should<00:02:11.870> jump

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
out then the power supply should jump

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.520 
out then the power supply should jump
into<00:02:12.379> life<00:02:13.090> if<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.269> doesn't<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.379> can

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
into life if it doesn't then I can

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.100 
into life if it doesn't then I can
almost<00:02:15.680> guarantee<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:17.180> over<00:02:17.480> your<00:02:17.840> power

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
almost guarantee it's over your power

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.509 
almost guarantee it's over your power
supply<00:02:18.349> or<00:02:20.769> your<00:02:21.769> motherboard<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:24.370> hope<00:02:25.370> that

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
supply or your motherboard I hope that

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.620 
supply or your motherboard I hope that
helps<00:02:26.470> thank<00:02:27.470> you
