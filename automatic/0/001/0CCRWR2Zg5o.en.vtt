00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.190
 The Russian writer Dimitri Glukhovsky describes in his novel 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.449
 Metro 2033 a scenario in Moscow in the not too distant future 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.859
 the city became completely uninhabitable after a nuclear war 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.619
 All people who have come to terms with this hell have gotten into the subway 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.619
 They have fled and their lives are now under the ground 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.899
 But life in NATO is not completely harmless 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.289
 in the shafts lurking horrible mutants and crazy 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.000
 People 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.430
 The 20-year-old Artyom gets the job from his hometown son before one 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.130
 To defend previously unknown threats which are generally only the 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.260
 black men 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.810
 Thun now brings the game to the book with Metro 2033 for the Expo 30 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.240
 market 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.890
 In the nearly seven-hour campaign of the game you fight with Artiom 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.010
 through the subway network 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.690
 Complete tasks and deal with a variety of opponents 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.570
 Metro 2033 is against shooter 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.820
 the strong of the dense storey of the enthralling atmosphere and the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 Lives characters who are more likely to meet your way 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.800
 towards the beginning of the game you fight mainly against the standard 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.300
 Mutants do not pose a major threat to your initial complaints 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.460
 should represent 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.890
 but at the beginning the firefights are a rarity 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.140
 rather, the first with the morbid beauty and the eerie 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 Apparitions of the ailing Huber network made familiar 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.890
 the tasks must fulfill the action in very linear gameplay 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 Sinn Shooter typical Pierre simply failed 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.510
 At this point, for example, a start would have to collapse so that the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.510
 Mutants can no longer penetrate to a station 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.980
 just look for a bomb Â»that randomly and conveniently 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.980
 This place was forgotten and then it is time to run 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.970
 In some places, the game gives you the choice whether you prefer to think 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.150
 Action follows or simply unpacks the CNOOC and everything over the pile 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.799
 shoots 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.469
 In these bandits camp here it is necessary to liberate a companion of the 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.779
 Bad guys have been captured 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.659
 either could now slowly sneak around clearing all the lights 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.919
 and turn off the opponents in ambush 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 or her way as we here the rabiate tour 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.069
 but pay particular attention to being constantly in cover 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.070
 the Carrey "The adversary is not terrific 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.070
 but the guys meet pretty much 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.779
 as if the mutant and bandit threat were not big 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:50.550
 enough 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.050
 In the course of the game, Artiom also has to deal with fanatical supporters 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.759
 beating two camps 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.599
 on the one hand, there would be the Communists to the other, the examining one has seen 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.459
 yes, even a hundred years after the Second World War, the conflict gets under the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.099
 Russian he is the new explosive 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.780
 Artyom device, of course, exactly between the enemy lines mka 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:18.239
 every now and then if you have Torchio around here also the gun of a vehicle and 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.510
 the Nazis promote communists and well 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.669
 with big caliber is beyond 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.049
 these sections loosen the otherwise very tense mood of the game 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.049
 always excellent 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.810
 Again and again it takes the young hero on his way to other upper 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.540
 stations 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.709
 where people have settled 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.449
 Here you can increase your arsenal or meditate old stream 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.469
 or buy new gas masks filters 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.669
 that's worth it because the men of the ballet we get from the dealers 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.069
 usually more punch or nice extras like a flared up 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.899
 Scope 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:58.899
 Incidentally, the currency used in Metro 2033 is ammunition 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.809
 they are available in a high quality and simple design, the former 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.009
 much more value 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.349
 Therefore, always scour the environment or rattle after a fight 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.349
 defeated opponents are delivered 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.919
 but not always Artyom is under the Erdogan Verbeeks 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.949
 every now and then it goes to the surface in the middle of the 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.979
 post-apocalyptic Moscow 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.680
 and although the from Leverkusen also very consistent Kontny 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.400
 Outdoor missions unlike the metro levels strong lack of tension 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.749
 and be a bit monotonous Labbadia 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:38.699
 By the way, the excursion to the surface does not work without protective measures 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:39.979
 Not 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.610
 the wearing of a gas mask is the highest duty because of the contaminated air 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.940
 but watch out that the mutants or humans do not protect you 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.590
 destroy because then your trip to ruined Moscow to Villingen 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.590
 such load 7 seconds over 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.800
 Metro 2033 clearly lives from its enthralling atmosphere 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.220
 if you sneak around with the submachine gun created by NATO creaking 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.820
 only the light shines your hands to the surroundings and you everywhere the 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.220
 Cries of mutants hear 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.220
 and strokes your heart more than once 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.370
 the graphics are extremely well done especially the light and 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.259
 Particle effects make for a scary-beautiful atmosphere 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.220
 SID 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.500
 By the way, for the full enjoyment that should be with a decent sound 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.629
 System and play in the dark 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.999
 The background noise in the subway shafts is clear 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.279
 better limits Holtz 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.830
 Unfortunately the german voice does not keep this high level close 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.289
 Although the synchronization is quite neat but the Russian accent 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.289
 now often too much 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:54.889
 So we can recommend Metro 2033 to anyone who cares about the atmosphere 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.939
 dense and gripping later told with an unused 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:00.939
 the seminar is 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.039
 Merci
