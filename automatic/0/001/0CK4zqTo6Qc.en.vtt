the smart ebike research project is
really<00:00:07.440> about<00:00:07.680> looking<00:00:08.550> how<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:09.540> ii<00:00:09.750> bikes

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
really about looking how can ii bikes

have a go on the bikes and just to get
the<00:00:22.289> experience<00:00:22.739> the<00:00:23.669> e-bikes<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.060> pretty

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the experience the e-bikes are pretty

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.569 
the experience the e-bikes are pretty
much<00:00:24.779> like<00:00:25.050> an<00:00:25.199> ordinary<00:00:25.349> bike<00:00:25.829> you<00:00:26.309> have<00:00:26.429> to

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
much like an ordinary bike you have to

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.639 
much like an ordinary bike you have to
pedal<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.149> have<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.419> break<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.229> change<00:00:28.559> gears

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
pedal you have to break you change gears

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.529 
pedal you have to break you change gears
but<00:00:29.159> if<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> wish<00:00:29.639> you<00:00:29.669> can<00:00:30.059> switch<00:00:30.359> on

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
but if you wish you can switch on

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.509 
but if you wish you can switch on
assistance<00:00:31.169> so<00:00:31.619> there's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.919> battery<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.429> a

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
assistance so there's a battery and a

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.459 
assistance so there's a battery and a
motor<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.879> the<00:00:33.090> bike<00:00:33.269> and<00:00:33.539> when<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> go<00:00:34.260> uphill

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
motor on the bike and when you go uphill

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.069 
motor on the bike and when you go uphill
or<00:00:34.980> long<00:00:35.609> distances<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.420> against<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> wind

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
or long distances or against the wind

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.349 
or long distances or against the wind
you<00:00:37.289> can<00:00:37.469> switch<00:00:37.679> on<00:00:37.859> the<00:00:37.920> assistance<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
you can switch on the assistance and it

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.759 
you can switch on the assistance and it
becomes<00:00:39.539> much<00:00:39.839> easier<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.530> cycle<00:00:42.649> compared<00:00:43.649> to

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
becomes much easier to cycle compared to

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.919 
becomes much easier to cycle compared to
a<00:00:43.829> normal<00:00:43.949> a<00:00:44.190> bike<00:00:44.429> we've<00:00:44.999> got<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.239> extra<00:00:45.660> box

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
we can also tell the assistance levels

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.680 
we can also tell the assistance levels
that<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.589> writer<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> using<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> rider

on there at the moment but it's a
modular<00:02:38.650> system<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.460> you<00:02:39.760> can<00:02:39.940> plug<00:02:40.180> in

all<00:02:40.510> kinds<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:40.930> sensors<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.770> one<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.070> them

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
all kinds of sensors and one of them

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.790 
all kinds of sensors and one of them
could<00:02:42.520> be<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> microphone<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.320> everyone

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
could be a microphone so that everyone

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.180 
could be a microphone so that everyone
cycling<00:02:45.490> around<00:02:45.640> could<00:02:46.360> create<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.440> sound<00:02:47.800> map

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
cycling around could create a sound map

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.820

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
or noise map of frightened so you could

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.550 
or noise map of frightened so you could
see<00:02:51.070> which<00:02:51.430> roads<00:02:51.760> are<00:02:52.000> really<00:02:52.150> noisy<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.930> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
see which roads are really noisy and the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.410 
see which roads are really noisy and the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
same with the pollution sensing so you

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.120 
same with the pollution sensing so you
could<00:02:55.690> work<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:56.140> which<00:02:56.410> routes<00:02:56.740> are<00:02:56.980> more

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
could work out which routes are more

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.340 
could work out which routes are more
polluted<00:02:57.610> or<00:02:57.730> less<00:02:57.880> polluted<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.660> people

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
polluted or less polluted and people

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.410 
polluted or less polluted and people
might<00:02:59.560> choose<00:02:59.950> a<00:02:59.980> different<00:03:00.310> route<00:03:00.670> based<00:03:01.210> on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
might choose a different route based on

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.020 
might choose a different route based on

that data and again the ebike would then

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.330 
that data and again the ebike would then
give<00:03:04.300> them<00:03:04.540> extra<00:03:04.690> assistance<00:03:05.500> if<00:03:05.830> they<00:03:06.100> chose

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
give them extra assistance if they chose

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.340 
give them extra assistance if they chose
a<00:03:06.400> further<00:03:06.820> route<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.420> avoid<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.930> pollution
