00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.730
 the hill town 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.700
 all the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.940
 1 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.390
 I'm even going 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.299
 plus the purified 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.580
 hop they have a hover does it 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.930
 is that the drone has this ability 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.850
 muscle that helps to beat very 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.410
 quickly wings and therefore to reach 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.720
 small flowers on which there is no 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.970
 way of those to rest is the case 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.200
 especially the tomato flower the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.790
 end of the tomato which by the way is 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.690
 very few nectarifers to cash again 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.560
 less the bees and so suddenly when 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.880
 we grow greenhouse 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.230
 in particular we use a lot of 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.600
 drones and in particular the earth bound 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.340
 drones do not necessarily produce 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.620
 honey it produces a sweet substance 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.620
 which is used to feed the larvae 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.250
 like all the wild bees of a 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.559
 a kind of pseudo honey but not in 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.910
 amount as bees do and 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.680
 not at headquarters that key bees the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.120
 females bumblebee actually honda 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.179
 reason a transformation of the organ 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.519
 female genital with a dart yes the 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.989
 bumblebee pic end of the least it can sting 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.580
 because the drone is an animal that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.080
 is overly aggressive 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.970
 unlike the honeybee 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.290
 it is this aggression that allows 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.670
 the honeybee to exploit all 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.760
 the midst of being as productive in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.070
 honey the drone he makes it small 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.450
 companies usually the drones founded 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.100
 nest in ancient burrows 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.259
 of rodents in the soil so yield neither of 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.479
 low volumes that's roughly speaking 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.700
 size of a football at the most 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.439
 with less than a thousand individuals for 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.939
 the biggest for the biggest nest he 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.890
 there are three types of individuals in a 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.009
 annie there is a queen 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.790
 there are males at the time of need 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.790
 fertilize the queen 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.130
 so at the beginning of nest formation and 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.820
 there are workers like all 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.310
 pollinators 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.890
 the drone is a species in regression 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.299
 we have studies now that shows 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.860
 with global warming we are going 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.540
 have a mass disappearance to 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.710
 the 50 year scale of bumblebees in 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.710
 France and Europe
