00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
because that's what I almost did I was

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.780 
because that's what I almost did I was
like<00:02:37.140> what's<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.500> bullshit<00:02:37.980> till<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.520> figured

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
like what's this bullshit till I figured

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640 
like what's this bullshit till I figured
out<00:02:38.880> oh<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.480> press<00:02:39.750> them<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.020> those<00:02:40.200> holes<00:02:40.410> and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
out oh you press them in those holes and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.070 
out oh you press them in those holes and
it<00:02:40.740> covers<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.220> screw<00:02:41.640> holes<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.990> know

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
it covers up the screw holes so you know

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.180 
it covers up the screw holes so you know
if<00:02:43.140> you're<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.380> take<00:02:43.560> them<00:02:43.620> apart<00:02:43.770> and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
if you're going to take them apart and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
airplane mode he's very easy to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.070 
airplane mode he's very easy to
transform<00:03:08.850> really<00:03:09.180> pretty<00:03:09.510> much<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.930> like

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
transform really pretty much just like

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.720 
transform really pretty much just like
you<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.350> way<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.470> transform<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.130> g1<00:03:11.520> you

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
you the way you transform the g1 you

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.900 
you the way you transform the g1 you
know<00:03:11.880> because<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.720> tail<00:03:13.620> falls<00:03:13.950> down<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.520> and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
