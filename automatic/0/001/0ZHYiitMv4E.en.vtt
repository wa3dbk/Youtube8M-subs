this<00:00:14.490> 2001<00:00:15.269> GSXR<00:00:15.929> 750<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.919> ex<00:00:17.070> rate<00:00:17.249> of<00:00:17.339> self

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
this 2001 GSXR 750 the ex rate of self

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.120 
this 2001 GSXR 750 the ex rate of self
is<00:00:17.640> down<00:00:17.789> here<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.329> box<00:00:19.130> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
is down here it's this little box the

pulley that cables come out of which

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.559 
pulley that cables come out of which
then<00:00:22.439> pulls<00:00:22.650> your<00:00:22.829> secondary<00:00:23.249> throttle

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:23.569 
then pulls your secondary throttle

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:27.739 
then pulls your secondary throttle
butterflies<00:00:24.710> your<00:00:25.710> throttle<00:00:26.009> body<00:00:26.599> mine<00:00:27.599> were

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:27.749 
butterflies your throttle body mine were

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.349 
butterflies your throttle body mine were
playing<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.499> lot<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.460> people<00:00:29.759> get<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> code

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
playing up a lot of people get the code

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.150 
playing up a lot of people get the code
see<00:00:30.659> 28<00:00:31.079> nuts<00:00:31.380> usually<00:00:31.589> means<00:00:31.979> there's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
see 28 nuts usually means there's

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.110 
see 28 nuts usually means there's
something<00:00:32.309> wrong<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> unit<00:00:32.910> something

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
something wrong with the unit something

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.930 
something wrong with the unit something
with<00:00:33.420> adjustment<00:00:34.640> something<00:00:35.640> wrong<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
with adjustment something wrong with the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.050 
with adjustment something wrong with the
whole<00:00:36.090> thing<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.400> pulled<00:00:38.670> mine<00:00:38.790> out

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
whole thing so I pulled mine out

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.770 
whole thing so I pulled mine out
I<00:00:39.090> cleaned<00:00:39.450> all<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> contacts<00:00:40.050> inside<00:00:40.650> it

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
I cleaned all the contacts inside it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.360 
I cleaned all the contacts inside it
there's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> lot<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.050> grease<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.260> there<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.800> I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
there's a lot of grease in there and I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.950 
there's a lot of grease in there and I
rough<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.790> contacts<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.480> rebuilt<00:00:45.840> them

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
rough the contacts up and rebuilt them

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.320 
rough the contacts up and rebuilt them
back<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.430> electrical<00:00:47.790> components<00:00:48.240> I'm

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
back so the electrical components I'm

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.410 
back so the electrical components I'm
making<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.810> contacts<00:00:49.940> put<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.060> back<00:00:51.180> in

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
making good contacts put it back in

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.990 
making good contacts put it back in
retention<00:00:52.200> my<00:00:52.470> cables<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.370> cable<00:00:53.820> sleeve

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
retention my cables this cable sleeve

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360 
retention my cables this cable sleeve
you<00:00:54.210> tension<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.810> know<00:00:55.590> millimetre<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.220> no

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you tension to know millimetre so no

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.690 
you tension to know millimetre so no
play<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.810> second<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.620> attention<00:00:59.400> to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
play and this second one attention to

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.280 
play and this second one attention to
one<00:00:59.880> millimeter<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.660> tiny<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.200> of

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
one millimeter so it's got tiny bit of

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.849 
one millimeter so it's got tiny bit of
play<00:01:01.470> in<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.650> and<00:01:03.049> then<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.079> turned<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.679> on<00:01:04.710> in

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:04.859 
play in it and then I turned it on in

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:06.080 
play in it and then I turned it on in
here<00:01:04.890> I've<00:01:05.009> got<00:01:05.069> no<00:01:05.249> code<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.819> it<00:01:05.880> looks<00:01:06.030> like

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
here I've got no code so it looks like

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.099 
here I've got no code so it looks like
it's<00:01:06.329> fixed<00:01:06.719> I'll<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.590> show<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:09.109> they

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
it's fixed I'll just show you what they

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:11.179 
it's fixed I'll just show you what they
look<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.289> when<00:01:10.590> they're<00:01:10.679> should<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.009> working

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
look like when they're should be working

00:01:11.189 --> 00:02:06.890 
look like when they're should be working
properly

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.120 

so<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:07.990> can<00:02:08.170> see<00:02:08.320> they<00:02:08.470> open<00:02:08.710> and<00:02:08.800> close<00:02:08.979> it

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
so you can see they open and close it

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.760 
so you can see they open and close it
with<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.280> throttle<00:02:10.260> returning<00:02:11.260> back<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.440> that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
with the throttle returning back to that

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.450 
with the throttle returning back to that
point

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
point

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.850 
point
I<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:13.780> hopefully<00:02:14.080> that's<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> end<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.680> my

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
I know hopefully that's the end of my

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.310 
I know hopefully that's the end of my
Eric<00:02:15.010> heads<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:16.240> if<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.750> have<00:02:16.840> any<00:02:16.960> questions
