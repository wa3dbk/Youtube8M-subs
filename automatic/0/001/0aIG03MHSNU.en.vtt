00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.490
 llorens and 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.460
 since 2014 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.810
 rap changed my life 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.840
 how it sounds 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:20.610
 this is the union of two ncis and all 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.610
 the one who feels the feeling inside 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.630
 is a word is a feeling is what 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.600
 that we in ourselves carry inside 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.580
 when writing on a sheet of paper I 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.730
 I feel alive because I keep doing that 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.580
 that school is very rare 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.739
 to write rap anywhere I am that 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.080
 who does not like to play soccer that 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.570
 they prefer to listen to rap and one says in their 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.790
 I am the world that is criticized by the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.010
 rest do not think it does not hurt me too 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.200
 I feel like the words hit me 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.839
 heart I close my room and I write 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.480
 a song to vent, I write in 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.550
 line if I saw the leaves torn off in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 my room if it goes wrong 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 I repeat again because I want to do the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.390
 best song for you your love be pain 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.960
 as long as I can write because I want 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.060
 do rap until I die I felt alone in 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 this life because I thought that time 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.520
 everything would not last but if he himself 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.050
 same life because I thought all this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.430
 it would sound content 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.950
 failures to learn 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.820
 I do not leave it on a sheet of paper 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.190
 reverse 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.680
 that's my tattoo when I feel bad 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.080
 change my landscape from home to school 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.840
 I hear the rap of the school towards the house 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.840
 he listened to the rap the ranco not apart from me 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.810
 life and procedural mentality rap I can 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.050
 express princess all this rap rap 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.000
 point and apart end point is my rappel 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.800
 let me calm down every problem 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.720
 I'm left in weight with his lyric 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.670
 beautiful gemma on this topic and in millions 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.649
 more I can say that I love him so much how much 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.149
 calmer rap when it came to crying 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.280
 I'm shocked and he hears my torment 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.500
 it's more than a feeling will revive and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.360
 soul why I'm still moving with the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.670
 rap in the hand and in the head is what 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.560
 I have certainty my life no longer weighs 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.509
 lighter thanks to who you listen to the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.310
 who feels it unlike life does not 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.380
 there are words that lie to me many 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.360
 understand this to hell with the rest if 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.489
 what we do is different, but it is not 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.410
 I detest them for more reasons is my great 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.480
 part of confidence my big part of the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.250
 passed back life advances my art in 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.470
 uncensored writing plus cure in the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.340
 height the rami heals and madness and echo of 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.440
 the hard breaks this life 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 but it's not lost decidedly me 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.910
 support in rap during my fall was more 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.459
 fluid my melodic emotion my faithful 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.680
 song and fight in spirit and heart and 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.540
 the reason for being here exploiting verses 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.540
 they remove my thinking is when in them I am 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.700
 perverse thousand 95% story that I feel 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.769
 careful what live freely road 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.420
 slow I show what we beat the top 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.549
 that reached in texts my concept of 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.290
 rapping improvising the contexts that 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.860
 I can offer part of my 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.540
 lifetime 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.280
 just like jonah hex and singing harmonies to 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.380
 my dear is my legitimate friend in 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.720
 battles one hundred dark nights of day my 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.610
 company and free me from torture maybe 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.650
 do not feel what we feel when writing 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.960
 but I'm sure you can 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:13.160
 perceive I follow if I travel 2014 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.160
 the rap changed me
