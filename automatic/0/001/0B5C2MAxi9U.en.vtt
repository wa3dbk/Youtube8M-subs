00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello I have six goals and 72 we get 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.660
 found Thursday for a new video 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.580
 so as you can see more than 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 young 3 and xbox 360 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.440
 so I think it's a debate that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.250
 purse a lot of people one is 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.450
 maybe some people 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 are hesitant to buy one or the other 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.400
 console 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.779
 so here I am going to show you some 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.750
 points that may help you to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.470
 you decide 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.289
 so we're going to start so the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.359
 graphics so we see playstation 3 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.890
 xbox 360 so we see that the graphics 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.290
 are a lot more push on the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.020
 playstation 3 with the image only on xbox 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.230
 360 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.420
 so we see that the images are we see 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.829
 that colors are a lot more out 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.480
 the playstation 3 to all so now 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.600
 so another picture where this time we 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.940
 sees that the xbox 360 take it with 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.550
 a more impressive sharpness 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.559
 finally more impressive a summer 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 best were 11 or even 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.019
 so me really I think that everything 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.979
 depends on the game you can have or 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.490
 hdmi cable 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.920
 because we really see that it depends 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.380
 of the game everything to see for yourself 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.760
 so now we really have it at the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.479
 playstation 3 will stand out this is 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.130
 really a positive point compared 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.990
 compared to the much thing in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.670
 more than the xbox 360 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.830
 so I wanted it worth it more closely 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.380
 so if you want the video for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 look at it but I 'm just getting 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.820
 really marks a plus point for 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.820
 the playstation 3 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.240
 so now a big plus 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.280
 for the xbox 360 so the private jets 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.320
 so private jets it used to use 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.149
 a microphone and to be able to communicate with 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.530
 a person with one person 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.500
 without other passions our wives 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 and its souks it's a positive point by 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.840
 compared to ps3 where we have to write 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.369
 posts 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.350
 so now the group chat which 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.770
 group chat this also a positive point 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.229
 for the xbox because we can create a 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.340
 group and talk to the microphone what we 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.869
 also allows to invite people 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.680
 in a group all so it's really 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.720
 very convenient 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.750
 whether to communicate or for 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.370
 invitations so really two points 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.920
 positive 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.030
 this for the xbox after there as can 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.430
 see it so that's not a point 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.409
 possible negatives so that's true 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.879
 that with the stations 3 one must always 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.200
 write we can make curves we have 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.720
 always write what is a little 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.220
 drunk after a while and then I 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.690
 find that it would be better than one 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.690
 can communicate with a microphone 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:40.250
 so after that so what is for the cat 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.659
 so there we can we must have a camera 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.370
 in fact to make a kind of cat 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.760
 private and we can not go in a game 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.160
 video 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.260
 this is call of duty battlefield and I 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.829
 going on so we have to have a 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.079
 camera for not there with so we'll see 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:57.230
 so I'm going to show you from what 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.159
 camera this is so here is the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.680
 playstation eye 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.930
 this day as a bit dry of a 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.010
 small camera or do not approve the vesle 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.870
 so it really is one of the only 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.970
 ways to make a jump of 7 private but 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.069
 without being in a game so that I find 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.319
 nice a negative point is that there on this 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.829
 point really the xbox does not matter 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.299
 really but against another point 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.609
 negative at that moment so that's that 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.700
 yes of course the xbox must be paid 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.109
 the internet a big negative is 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.650
 frankly it's a point that 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:30.440
 devalues ​​a lot find the xbox and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.540
 while the playstation 3 the internet 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.579
 is free basso the xbox it is 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.440
 not really so I think it's a 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.120
 huge negative point that we have to pay 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.720
 to play on the internet 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.030
 so there a little price so there we go 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.269
 rather refer to the dollar where we see 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.049
 that it's really so 59 of the so 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.709
 $ 60 for a year of subscribing cabbage 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.660
 it's expensive 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:59.889
 so if we compare in euros so that makes 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.930
 it does it really makes a lot more 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.239
 more expensive in euros but I believe that if 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.160
 I'm wrong in euros it's 49 euros 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.959
 or 40 euros the year so that's when 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.340
 even dear knowing that now 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.169
 they have lowered prices so its 40 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.780
 euros and have it was much more 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.940
 dear so there to show you a little 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.250
 so really a group o negative is 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.660
 for the xbox 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.730
 it is on the internet paying by cons by 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.260
 against are for all that internet the 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.200
 xbox is a lot more complex 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.670
 so everything he is a group leader 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.390
 so I think it's a bit 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.590
 equality at the level of both so after I 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.900
 find it's your choice press to 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.760
 you to see if you are if you can 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.320
 pay a year or three months or a month of 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.610
 live subscription but have a lot 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.470
 more to be much more favored in 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.630
 in everything that is hunting or 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.540
 to simply not pay 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.190
 of internet for finally we can 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.070
 access the internet on the playstation 3 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.060
 but without paying and at that moment the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.220
 options are reduced 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.090
 so all of you to see anyway I 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.430
 I'll just show you some 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.260
 a few points because a lot of 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.570
 people are hesitant say yeah but 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.100
 the playstation 3 is better if he 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.070
 buy it the internet it's free 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.590
 and others say yeah maybe we 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.410
 must pay the live for the xbox 360 but 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.120
 we have some advantages so it's just 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.010
 a bit to show you quickly so 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.970
 I'm not really going I can go 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.040
 look very far but for you 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.520
 show some key points that pump 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.600
 head make you decided to buy the xbox 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.660
 360 the playstation 3 so it's up to you 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.620
 so thank you very much for having 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.150
 watch this video 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.480
 I hope you have learned some 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.480
 things in addition so after for this 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.170
 which concerns me especially in 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.370
 call of duty videos including call of duty 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.510
 so commented gameplay when you 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.880
 have seen it so it's mostly 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.570
 a little entertainment video if I 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.550
 can say that like that 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.460
 and therefore as I told you 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.250
 in my previous call of duty video 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.690
 so my page was done by a graphic designer 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.690
 so as I told you then 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.420
 So here is my on my channel 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.550
 logos were made or so that's it 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.470
 a little new on my channel and then 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.780
 so soon during the week 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.350

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.259
 and 2 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.280
