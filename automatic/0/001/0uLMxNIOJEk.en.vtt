00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:17.400
 and then everyone here speaks is bacuri 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.470
 They're bringing another video for you guys. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.539
 this time a short video fast video 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 as you are seeing up there is like 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.650
 find diamond in less than a minute 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.140
 You can see that I'm here in this view. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.660
 in the latest version of mini crash 1.4.2 and e 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.460
 This is due to a very legal cide that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.420
 I think you can find a diamond less 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.149
 one minute 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.059
 not only diamond but like coal iron 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.019
 pencil lazúli redstone among others 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.629
 ores 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.479
 you will see here a player create a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.839
 new world if there was a name 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:54.030
 any cyclical and is going to have to 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.129
 change survival mode game 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.559
 Creative hardcore will probably go 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.359
 leave the loco hardcore in survival 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.209
 because it is profitable you have all 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.909
 items we will let non-survival 

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:08.310
 or stay here more options in the world and I will 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.240
 put these where here for you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.020
 We are calling the CIS Magna Carta. 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.439
 people will have in the description and if you 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.310
 is the laziness of duty and copy 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.000
 id 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.090
 and here the video description is good if 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.350
 explain in ok just let it escape that the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.869
 picture was fast 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.450
 Ok, ready is busy here you are in 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.700
 create world and back and leave a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.560
 stop watch on the side to prove to 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.609
 You that I'm going to find diamond in less 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.920
 for a minute but I'm just going to start the 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.109
 stopwatch when you start walking because 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.340
 because online craft flooded so I go 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.659
 having to wait for him to carry the world 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.499
 here first 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.009
 Then the tyá, starting the stopwatch 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:59.600
 and it is quite easy that they can there otherwise 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:04.380
 from here on next chance chance mushroom 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:10.440
 Straight out here, can not find a baita 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.100
 big hole in the ground here in the big hole here 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.569
 floor 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.569
 bc shows if very strongly strong 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.290
 I took damage had manifested cattle 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.450
 You see it down here. 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.459
 here and you will see that you will have 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.120
 diamond down here 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.959
 and here are other ores here pencils 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.909
 lazuli coal redstone and others and others 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.879
 here has more than evaluated the theme 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:43.799
 good old are you here is this is a video 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.819
 very short - just to show you a 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.799
 It's really cool, I went to the world. 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.439
 for me to play here normally 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:57.120
 hence I found this hurricane to be quite legal 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:03:00.569
 This and I'm going to leave too and is the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.069

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.290
 and the die not what I think I'm going 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.109
 leave and the coordinates of that hurricane 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.359
