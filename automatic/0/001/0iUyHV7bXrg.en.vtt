we<00:00:00.960> basically<00:00:01.170> made<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:02.070> design<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.669> idea

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
we basically made this design this idea

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.700 
we basically made this design this idea
of<00:00:03.179> trying<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.689> use<00:00:03.929> an<00:00:04.230> electrostatic

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
of trying to use an electrostatic

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.519 
of trying to use an electrostatic
levitation<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.490> study<00:00:05.700> structure<00:00:06.240> first<00:00:07.140> not

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
levitation to study structure first not

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.560 
levitation to study structure first not
with<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:07.859> particular<00:00:08.820> electrostatic

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
with this particular electrostatic

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.030 
with this particular electrostatic
levitation<00:00:09.630> facility<00:00:10.530> but<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:10.769> one<00:00:10.950> that

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
levitation facility but with one that

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.980 
levitation facility but with one that
was<00:00:11.160> owned<00:00:11.280> by<00:00:11.309> NASA<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> came<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
was owned by NASA so I came up with the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.980 
was owned by NASA so I came up with the
idea<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.620> convinced<00:00:14.040> NASA<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.940> try<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.540> we

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
idea we convinced NASA to try it and we

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.870 
idea we convinced NASA to try it and we
went<00:00:16.170> together<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.890> synchrotron<00:00:17.310> where<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
went together to a synchrotron where you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.910 
went together to a synchrotron where you
have<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> very<00:00:18.390> very<00:00:18.570> bright<00:00:18.869> source<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.650> x-rays

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
have a very very bright source of x-rays

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.650 
have a very very bright source of x-rays
and<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.730> went<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> Advanced<00:00:21.510> Photon

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and we went to the Advanced Photon

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.160 
and we went to the Advanced Photon
Source<00:00:21.869> near<00:00:22.380> Chicago<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.660> with<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> design

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
Source near Chicago and with the design

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.140 
Source near Chicago and with the design
changes<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> had<00:00:26.189> incorporated<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.029> were

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
changes that I had incorporated we were

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.670 
changes that I had incorporated we were
able<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.480> look<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> structure<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
able to look at the structure of the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.410 
able to look at the structure of the
liquid<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.189> went<00:00:29.429> below<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> supercooled

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
liquid as it went below the supercooled

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240 
liquid as it went below the supercooled
state<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.500> thing<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.830> were<00:00:31.949> able<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
state so the first thing we were able to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.639 
state so the first thing we were able to
do<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> prove<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.329> hypothesis<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.469> had

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
do was to prove a hypothesis that had

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.459 
do was to prove a hypothesis that had
been<00:00:34.770> made<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.100> 1950s<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.750> explain<00:00:37.170> why

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
been made in the 1950s to explain why

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
been made in the 1950s to explain why
you<00:00:37.530> could<00:00:37.860> supercooled<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> liquid<00:00:38.730> metal<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you could supercooled a liquid metal it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.590 
you could supercooled a liquid metal it
goes<00:00:39.750> all<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.930> way<00:00:40.020> back<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.860> 1700s<00:00:41.600> when

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
goes all the way back to the 1700s when

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
goes all the way back to the 1700s when
Fahrenheit<00:00:43.170> first<00:00:43.469> observed<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:43.980> water

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
Fahrenheit first observed with water

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
Fahrenheit first observed with water
that<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> liquid<00:00:45.360> below<00:00:45.539> its

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that you can take a liquid below its

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.180 
that you can take a liquid below its
melting<00:00:45.840> temperature<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> saves<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
melting temperature and it saves a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.459 
melting temperature and it saves a
liquid<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:48.059> shouldn't<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.690> soon<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> cross

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
liquid it shouldn't as soon as you cross

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.389 
liquid it shouldn't as soon as you cross
the<00:00:49.649> melting<00:00:49.920> temperature<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.370> should

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the melting temperature it should

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.580 
the melting temperature it should
crystallize<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.930> barrier<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
crystallize but there's a barrier to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860 
crystallize but there's a barrier to
that<00:00:52.620> crystallization<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:54.120> allows<00:00:54.390> us<00:00:54.629> then

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that crystallization that allows us then

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.439 
that crystallization that allows us then
to<00:00:54.930> supercooled<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.789> fair<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> also

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to supercooled it what fair and I also

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.139 
to supercooled it what fair and I also
discovered<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.800> reduced<00:00:59.129> dirt<00:00:59.430> or

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
discovered was if you reduced dirt or

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.720 
discovered was if you reduced dirt or
some<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.020> sudden<00:01:01.320> shock<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.980> something

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
some kind of sudden shock or something

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.380 
some kind of sudden shock or something
like<00:01:02.850> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
like that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.119 
like that
that<00:01:03.960> will<00:01:04.199> cause<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.650> liquid<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
that will cause the liquid to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.100 
that will cause the liquid to
spontaneously<00:01:05.790> crystallize<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> limits

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
spontaneously crystallize so it limits

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380 
spontaneously crystallize so it limits
how<00:01:07.320> far<00:01:08.189> below<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> melting<00:01:08.729> temperature<00:01:08.909> we

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
how far below the melting temperature we

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
how far below the melting temperature we
can<00:01:09.540> take<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.900> these<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.189> highly

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
can take it these are very highly

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460 
can take it these are very highly
reactive<00:01:11.760> liquids<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:12.810> tend<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.170> made<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
reactive liquids they tend to be made of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.890 
reactive liquids they tend to be made of
metals<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.950> zirconium<00:01:14.820> which<00:01:15.060> reacts<00:01:15.720> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
metals like zirconium which reacts with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.560 
metals like zirconium which reacts with
with<00:01:16.439> virtually<00:01:16.979> everything<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.360> put

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
with virtually everything so if you put

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
with virtually everything so if you put
those<00:01:18.750> liquids<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.320> container<00:01:19.710> they<00:01:20.700> would

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
those liquids in a container they would

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.300 
those liquids in a container they would
react<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> container<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.159> they<00:01:23.159> would

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
react with the container and they would

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.550 
react with the container and they would
also<00:01:23.460> end<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.240> having<00:01:24.630> these<00:01:24.750> heterogeneities

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
also end up having these heterogeneities

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.920 
also end up having these heterogeneities
they're<00:01:26.100> called<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.390> dust<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
they're called like the the dust that

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510 
they're called like the the dust that
and<00:01:28.200> dirt<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> Fahrenheit<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.189> talking

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and dirt that Fahrenheit was talking

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.890 
and dirt that Fahrenheit was talking
about<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.240> causes<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.840> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
about and that causes them to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 
about and that causes them to
crystallize<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.710> nucleate<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> lowers<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
crystallize to nucleate so it lowers the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
crystallize to nucleate so it lowers the
nucleation<00:01:33.780> barrier<00:01:34.070> by<00:01:35.070> having<00:01:35.430> these

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
nucleation barrier by having these

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.120 
nucleation barrier by having these
particles<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.040> in

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
particles there so if we have them in

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.530 
particles there so if we have them in
touch<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.460> container<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.119> won't<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.420> able

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
touch with a container we won't be able

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.770 
touch with a container we won't be able
to<00:01:39.659> supercooled<00:01:40.140> them<00:01:41.240> nucleation<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.570> in

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

open up a bottle of beer and you pour it
into<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.770> glass<00:01:55.950> you'll<00:01:56.280> notice<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> there

is<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.520> more<00:01:59.820> carbon<00:02:00.090> dioxide

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
is that you have more carbon dioxide

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.149 
is that you have more carbon dioxide

and is in what's called equilibrium at
normal<00:02:06.579> atmosphere<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.780> dissolved

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
normal atmosphere so the dissolved

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.380 
normal atmosphere so the dissolved
carbon<00:02:08.560> dioxide<00:02:08.739> wants<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.700> come<00:02:09.849> out<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.209> the

way in which it comes out is it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.800 
way in which it comes out is it

that's<00:02:15.459> what<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.790> see<00:02:16.090> when<00:02:16.810> when<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.260> carbon

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
that's what you see when when the carbon

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.020 
that's what you see when when the carbon
dioxide<00:02:17.620> comes<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> surface<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:18.849> if<00:02:18.940> you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030

dioxide comes to the surface but if you
look<00:02:19.209> carefully<00:02:19.620> you'll<00:02:20.620> notice<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:21.130> very

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
look carefully you'll notice that very

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.830 
look carefully you'll notice that very
often<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.700> carbon<00:02:22.000> dioxide<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.510> coming<00:02:22.780> from

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
often the carbon dioxide is coming from

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.949 
often the carbon dioxide is coming from
particular<00:02:23.410> spots<00:02:23.709> on<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> beer<00:02:24.190> glass<00:02:24.459> and

particular spots on the beer glass and

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.059 
particular spots on the beer glass and
that's<00:02:25.959> an<00:02:26.110> example<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.560> heterogeneous

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
that's an example of heterogeneous

that's an example of heterogeneous

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
perhaps a bit of dirt or a bit of lint

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.150 
perhaps a bit of dirt or a bit of lint
or<00:02:31.780> maybe<00:02:31.930> there's<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.260> crack<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.769> small<00:02:32.950> crack

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
or maybe there's a crack a small crack

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.850 
or maybe there's a crack a small crack
in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> glass<00:02:33.569> any<00:02:34.569> of<00:02:34.780> those<00:02:34.930> things<00:02:35.290> allow

in the glass any of those things allow

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.830 
in the glass any of those things allow
nucleation<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.610> happen<00:02:36.910> more<00:02:37.060> easily<00:02:37.599> and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
nucleation to happen more easily and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.140 
nucleation to happen more easily and
that's<00:02:38.650> very<00:02:39.160> analogous<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.849> what<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.000> was

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
that's very analogous to what I was

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.370 
that's very analogous to what I was
saying<00:02:40.330> about<00:02:40.599> putting<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.900> liquid<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.290> a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
saying about putting a liquid in a

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.500 
saying about putting a liquid in a
container<00:02:41.799> is<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.190> same<00:02:42.430> idea<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.209> have

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
container is the same idea that you have

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.089 
container is the same idea that you have
imperfections<00:02:43.989> in<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.440> container<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:45.069> have

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
imperfections in the container you have

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.070 
imperfections in the container you have
dirt<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.760> that's<00:02:46.180> what<00:02:46.450> causes<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
dirt and that's what causes the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.680 
dirt and that's what causes the
preferential<00:02:47.860> nucleation<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:49.120> wasn't<00:02:49.510> until

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
preferential nucleation it wasn't until

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.600 
preferential nucleation it wasn't until
the<00:02:49.780> 1950s<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.830> was<00:02:50.920> ever<00:02:51.069> demonstrated

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
the 1950s that it was ever demonstrated

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.430 
the 1950s that it was ever demonstrated
you<00:02:51.700> could<00:02:51.819> supercool<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.480> liquid<00:02:52.959> metal<00:02:53.230> and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
you could supercool a liquid metal and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.770 
you could supercool a liquid metal and
the<00:02:54.160> reason<00:02:54.489> is<00:02:54.610> because<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.209> tendency

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the reason is because of the tendency

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.960 
the reason is because of the tendency
for<00:02:55.810> liquid<00:02:56.230> metals<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:57.130> react<00:02:57.459> with<00:02:57.730> things

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970

and what he argued was that what was

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
going on in metallic liquid was that you

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.300 
going on in metallic liquid was that you

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
sample in the position we want then what

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.869 
sample in the position we want then what
we<00:04:37.479> do<00:04:37.659> is<00:04:37.870> we<00:04:38.379> bring<00:04:38.620> in<00:04:38.889> another<00:04:39.550> laser

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
we do is we bring in another laser

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.179 
we do is we bring in another laser
that's<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.449> high-power<00:04:40.780> laser<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.889> we<00:04:41.919> melt

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
that's a high-power laser and we melt

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:43.800 
that's a high-power laser and we melt
the<00:04:42.340> sample<00:04:42.729> so<00:04:42.849> now<00:04:42.969> we<00:04:43.030> have<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.330> liquid

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the sample so now we have a liquid

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.689 
the sample so now we have a liquid
that's<00:04:44.229> suspended<00:04:44.740> between<00:04:45.099> these<00:04:45.460> plates

magnitude<00:05:21.360> so<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.449> becomes<00:05:22.719> much<00:05:22.990> much<00:05:23.259> more

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
magnitude so it becomes much much more

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.040 
magnitude so it becomes much much more
viscous<00:05:23.889> it<00:05:24.400> becomes<00:05:24.729> a<00:05:24.819> solid<00:05:25.060> so<00:05:25.690> as<00:05:25.810> you<00:05:25.930> go

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
viscous it becomes a solid so as you go

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.300 
viscous it becomes a solid so as you go
through<00:05:26.229> the<00:05:26.289> glass<00:05:26.379> transition<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:27.009> go<00:05:27.129> from

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
through the glass transition you go from

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.740 
through the glass transition you go from
something<00:05:27.550> that's<00:05:27.639> freely<00:05:28.029> flowing<00:05:28.419> like<00:05:28.719> a

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
something that's freely flowing like a

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.809 
something that's freely flowing like a
liquid<00:05:29.050> into<00:05:29.650> something<00:05:29.949> that's<00:05:30.099> rigid<00:05:30.310> like

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
liquid into something that's rigid like

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.709 
liquid into something that's rigid like
a<00:05:30.849> glass<00:05:31.560> liquid<00:05:32.560> metals<00:05:33.400> tend<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.419> want<00:05:34.599> to

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
a glass liquid metals tend to want to

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.119 
a glass liquid metals tend to want to
crystallize<00:05:35.139> much<00:05:35.469> more<00:05:35.710> readily<00:05:35.919> than

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
crystallize much more readily than

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.629 
crystallize much more readily than
silicate<00:05:36.759> liquids<00:05:38.009> so<00:05:39.009> even<00:05:39.279> though<00:05:39.370> we<00:05:39.490> can

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
silicate liquids so even though we can

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.189 
silicate liquids so even though we can
supercooled<00:05:40.210> for<00:05:40.539> quite<00:05:40.870> some<00:05:41.080> distance

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
supercooled for quite some distance

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.439 
supercooled for quite some distance
eventually<00:05:42.069> if<00:05:42.190> we<00:05:42.310> just<00:05:42.490> cool<00:05:42.669> slowly<00:05:43.060> in

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
eventually if we just cool slowly in

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.839 
eventually if we just cool slowly in
most<00:05:44.259> cases<00:05:44.529> it<00:05:44.860> will<00:05:44.949> turn<00:05:45.159> into<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.430> crystal

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
most cases it will turn into a crystal

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.749 
most cases it will turn into a crystal
now<00:05:46.689> what<00:05:46.900> has<00:05:46.990> changed<00:05:47.319> is<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.979> discovery<00:05:48.580> of

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
now what has changed is the discovery of

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.490 
now what has changed is the discovery of
a<00:05:48.849> new<00:05:48.879> class<00:05:49.300> of<00:05:49.509> metallic<00:05:49.930> glasses<00:05:50.139> which

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
a new class of metallic glasses which

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.159 
a new class of metallic glasses which
are<00:05:50.589> called<00:05:50.770> bulk<00:05:51.069> metallic<00:05:51.370> glasses<00:05:52.169> these

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
are called bulk metallic glasses these

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.200 
are called bulk metallic glasses these
are<00:05:53.439> glasses<00:05:53.680> that<00:05:53.979> are<00:05:54.460> made<00:05:54.580> of<00:05:54.699> metals<00:05:55.029> but

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
are glasses that are made of metals but

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.629 
are glasses that are made of metals but
they<00:05:55.629> actually<00:05:55.779> do<00:05:56.289> form<00:05:56.620> glasses<00:05:57.400> when<00:05:57.550> you

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
they actually do form glasses when you

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.149 
they actually do form glasses when you
cool<00:05:57.849> them<00:05:58.029> slowly<00:05:58.330> sometimes<00:05:59.259> as<00:05:59.500> slowly<00:05:59.800> as

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
cool them slowly sometimes as slowly as

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.689 
cool them slowly sometimes as slowly as
a<00:06:00.219> silicate<00:06:01.120> traditional<00:06:01.689> silicate<00:06:02.139> glass<00:06:02.699> we

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
a silicate traditional silicate glass we

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.610 
a silicate traditional silicate glass we
don't<00:06:03.879> know<00:06:04.000> why<00:06:04.240> these<00:06:04.300> materials<00:06:05.080> form

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
don't know why these materials form

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.189 
don't know why these materials form
glasses<00:06:06.159> so<00:06:06.310> easily<00:06:06.490> and<00:06:06.879> others<00:06:07.150> don't<00:06:07.449> there

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
glasses so easily and others don't there

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.629 
glasses so easily and others don't there
are<00:06:08.229> many<00:06:08.469> ideas<00:06:08.650> out<00:06:09.129> there<00:06:09.159> and<00:06:09.400> we're

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
are many ideas out there and we're

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.640 
are many ideas out there and we're
trying<00:06:09.669> to<00:06:10.000> test<00:06:10.180> some<00:06:10.389> of<00:06:10.509> those<00:06:10.689> but<00:06:11.469> one<00:06:11.620> of

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
trying to test some of those but one of

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.999 
trying to test some of those but one of
the<00:06:11.800> things<00:06:12.069> that<00:06:12.400> makes<00:06:12.969> these<00:06:13.180> glasses

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
the things that makes these glasses

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.500 
the things that makes these glasses
remarkably<00:06:15.539> similar<00:06:16.539> and<00:06:17.020> in

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
remarkably similar and in

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.150 
remarkably similar and in
having<00:06:17.810> in<00:06:17.930> common<00:06:18.380> with<00:06:18.500> silicate<00:06:18.890> glasses

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
having in common with silicate glasses

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.460 
having in common with silicate glasses
is<00:06:19.520> that<00:06:19.970> because<00:06:20.210> they<00:06:20.360> can<00:06:20.540> be<00:06:20.660> cooled<00:06:21.200> so

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
is that because they can be cooled so

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.580 
is that because they can be cooled so
slowly<00:06:21.770> they<00:06:22.400> also<00:06:22.760> can<00:06:23.000> be<00:06:23.150> molded<00:06:23.750> just<00:06:24.470> like

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
slowly they also can be molded just like

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.260 
slowly they also can be molded just like
a<00:06:24.620> silicate<00:06:25.040> glass<00:06:25.280> and<00:06:25.520> there<00:06:25.610> are<00:06:25.730> examples

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
a silicate glass and there are examples

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.490 
a silicate glass and there are examples
now<00:06:27.020> of<00:06:27.260> a<00:06:28.160> group<00:06:28.610> at<00:06:28.760> Yale<00:06:29.000> who<00:06:29.630> are<00:06:29.930> blowing

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500

metallic glass bottles we're building

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.380 
metallic glass bottles we're building
something<00:06:35.390> which<00:06:35.630> I<00:06:35.750> called<00:06:36.080> the<00:06:36.260> Nestle

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
something which I called the Nestle

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.910 
something which I called the Nestle
which<00:06:38.390> is<00:06:38.600> Neutron<00:06:39.080> electrostatic

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
which is Neutron electrostatic

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.150 
which is Neutron electrostatic

be<00:06:43.420> built<00:06:44.420> here<00:06:44.510> at<00:06:44.810> Washington<00:06:44.990> University

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
be built here at Washington University

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.000

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that's

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.400 
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that's
coming<00:06:57.590> online<00:06:57.740> now<00:06:59.020> so<00:07:00.020> we're<00:07:00.140> going<00:07:00.260> to<00:07:00.320> be

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
coming online now so we're going to be

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.950 
coming online now so we're going to be
building<00:07:00.770> that<00:07:00.980> instrument<00:07:01.430> to<00:07:01.520> go<00:07:01.670> there

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
building that instrument to go there

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.460 
building that instrument to go there
with<00:07:02.960> that<00:07:03.110> instrument<00:07:03.500> because<00:07:04.340> neutrons

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
with that instrument because neutrons

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.040 
with that instrument because neutrons
scatter<00:07:06.470> off<00:07:06.860> of<00:07:07.100> the<00:07:07.220> atoms<00:07:07.610> they<00:07:08.450> give<00:07:08.690> not

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
scatter off of the atoms they give not

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.720 
scatter off of the atoms they give not
only<00:07:09.080> diffraction<00:07:10.070> patterns<00:07:10.430> like<00:07:10.580> the

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.730 
only diffraction patterns like the

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.420 
only diffraction patterns like the
x-rays<00:07:11.150> do<00:07:11.420> but<00:07:12.140> they<00:07:12.260> interact<00:07:12.770> more<00:07:13.100> with

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
x-rays do but they interact more with

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.760 
x-rays do but they interact more with
the<00:07:14.240> atoms<00:07:14.840> and<00:07:15.020> we<00:07:15.140> can<00:07:15.290> measure<00:07:15.470> that<00:07:15.620> change

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
the atoms and we can measure that change

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.920 
the atoms and we can measure that change
in<00:07:16.100> energy<00:07:16.220> and<00:07:16.700> by<00:07:17.090> measuring<00:07:17.420> the<00:07:17.570> change<00:07:17.600> in

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
in energy and by measuring the change in

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.810 
in energy and by measuring the change in
energy<00:07:18.050> of<00:07:18.380> the<00:07:18.500> neutrons<00:07:18.860> that<00:07:19.010> are<00:07:19.160> hitting

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
energy of the neutrons that are hitting

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.880 
energy of the neutrons that are hitting
if<00:07:20.150> you<00:07:20.330> will<00:07:20.510> the<00:07:20.690> atoms<00:07:21.020> and<00:07:21.200> scattering<00:07:21.710> off

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
if you will the atoms and scattering off

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.700 
if you will the atoms and scattering off
we<00:07:22.820> can<00:07:23.060> tell<00:07:23.360> how<00:07:23.600> the<00:07:23.660> atoms<00:07:24.110> are<00:07:24.260> moving<00:07:24.410> in

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
we can tell how the atoms are moving in

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.010 
we can tell how the atoms are moving in
the<00:07:24.830> liquid<00:07:25.160> so<00:07:25.460> we'll<00:07:26.210> be<00:07:26.300> able<00:07:26.330> to<00:07:26.600> get<00:07:26.810> both

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
the liquid so we'll be able to get both

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.320 
the liquid so we'll be able to get both
structural<00:07:27.650> information<00:07:27.920> as<00:07:28.430> well<00:07:29.060> as

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
structural information as well as

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.390 
structural information as well as
dynamical<00:07:29.870> information<00:07:30.380> and<00:07:30.590> hopefully<00:07:30.890> be

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
dynamical information and hopefully be

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.630 
dynamical information and hopefully be
able<00:07:31.520> to<00:07:31.820> resolve<00:07:32.090> the<00:07:32.300> glass<00:07:32.480> transition
