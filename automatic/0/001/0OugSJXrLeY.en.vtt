making sure the I like to call it the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.150 
making sure the I like to call it the

tubes<00:02:30.519> really<00:02:31.330> provided<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.019> port<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
tubes really provided the port and

weight<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.190> then<00:03:06.549> we<00:03:06.700> put<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:06.970> washer<00:03:07.629> back

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
weight and then we put a washer back

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.869 
weight and then we put a washer back
here<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.769> just<00:03:08.950> helps<00:03:09.250> reinforce<00:03:09.459> the

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
here that just helps reinforce the

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.460 
here that just helps reinforce the
bottom<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.299> slot<00:03:10.540> there's<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.200> lot<00:03:11.349> of

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
bottom of the slot there's a lot of

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.900 
bottom of the slot there's a lot of
details<00:03:11.799> like<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.280> designing<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.670> frames

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
details like that in designing a frames

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.970 
details like that in designing a frames
where<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.480> shave<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.720> little<00:03:13.840> bit<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.560> it

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
where can you shave a little bit and it

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
where can you shave a little bit and it
may<00:03:15.069> not<00:03:15.190> make<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.549> much<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.730> difference

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
may not make that much of difference

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.789 
may not make that much of difference
overall<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.079> bike<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.410> if<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.590> could<00:03:17.680> do

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
overall on the bike but if you could do

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.199 
overall on the bike but if you could do
that<00:03:17.950> four<00:03:18.160> or<00:03:18.250> five<00:03:18.400> times<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.850> bike<00:03:19.000> and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
that four or five times and bike and

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.550 
that four or five times and bike and
you're<00:03:19.299> starting<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.630> get<00:03:19.989> some<00:03:20.170> weight<00:03:20.319> gains

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
you're starting to get some weight gains

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.720 
you're starting to get some weight gains
so<00:03:20.829> you're<00:03:21.010> always<00:03:21.130> looking<00:03:21.220> for<00:03:21.639> those

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
so you're always looking for those

so you're always looking for those
opportunities<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:22.540> did<00:03:22.989> my<00:03:23.260> best<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.590> never

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
have to put dents and stays and so we

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.410 
have to put dents and stays and so we
were<00:03:27.130> able<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.340> keep<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.639> full<00:03:27.819> diameter<00:03:27.970> this

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
were able to keep the full diameter this

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.210 
were able to keep the full diameter this

day coming up to the bottom bracket and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.650 
day coming up to the bottom bracket and
still<00:03:30.579> get<00:03:30.730> plenty<00:03:30.849> of<00:03:31.030> clearance<00:03:31.450> here

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
still get plenty of clearance here

positive control and it was pretty

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.690

long time catching up on what all the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
changes are and have been since you know

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.140 
changes are and have been since you know
15<00:03:59.950> 20<00:04:00.099> years<00:04:00.370> ago<00:04:00.430> when<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:00.819> was<00:04:00.940> last

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
15 20 years ago when I was last

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.110 
15 20 years ago when I was last
designing<00:04:01.690> mountain<00:04:02.410> bikes<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:03.310> lot<00:04:03.790> has

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
designing mountain bikes and a lot has

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.270 
designing mountain bikes and a lot has
changed<00:04:04.169> and<00:04:05.169> one<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.829> things<00:04:06.040> actually

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
changed and one of the things actually

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.159 
changed and one of the things actually
that's<00:04:06.609> that's<00:04:06.970> been<00:04:07.120> kind<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.419> fun<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.840> used

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
that's that's been kind of fun is used

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.440 
that's that's been kind of fun is used
to<00:04:08.319> have<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.739> just<00:04:09.579> imagine<00:04:10.000> things<00:04:10.209> in<00:04:10.359> my

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
to have to just imagine things in my

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.360 
to have to just imagine things in my
mind<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:10.989> tweak<00:04:11.200> them<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.620> refine<00:04:11.950> them<00:04:12.190> and

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
mind and tweak them and refine them and

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.479 
mind and tweak them and refine them and
put<00:04:13.359> pieces<00:04:13.540> together<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:14.260> design<00:04:15.130> a<00:04:15.160> frame

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
put pieces together and design a frame

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.610 
put pieces together and design a frame
you<00:04:15.849> know<00:04:15.940> using<00:04:16.150> spreadsheets<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.049> geometry

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
you know using spreadsheets and geometry

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.250 
you know using spreadsheets and geometry
and<00:04:17.769> trigonometry<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:19.510> now<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:19.810> get<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.079> do

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
and trigonometry and and now I get to do

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.629 
and trigonometry and and now I get to do
it<00:04:20.349> with<00:04:20.470> a<00:04:20.500> CAD<00:04:20.709> system

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
it with a CAD system

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.489 
it with a CAD system
model<00:04:21.939> it<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.120> three<00:04:22.389> dimensions<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.080> take<00:04:23.469> a

00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:23.499 
model it in three dimensions and take a

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:25.290 
model it in three dimensions and take a
look<00:04:23.710> at<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:23.919> from<00:04:24.069> any<00:04:24.189> angle<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.819> it's<00:04:25.150> a

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
look at it from any angle and it's a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.350 
look at it from any angle and it's a
much<00:04:25.509> faster<00:04:25.810> way<00:04:26.199> to<00:04:26.229> refine<00:04:26.979> designs<00:04:27.520> but

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
much faster way to refine designs but

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.700 
much faster way to refine designs but
it's<00:04:28.539> really<00:04:28.780> great<00:04:28.960> when<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.169> can<00:04:29.349> finally<00:04:29.530> get

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
it's really great when I can finally get

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.080 
it's really great when I can finally get
in<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.830> shop<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.189> get<00:04:30.279> my<00:04:30.370> hands<00:04:30.669> dirty<00:04:30.729> and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
in the shop and get my hands dirty and

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.510 
in the shop and get my hands dirty and
get<00:04:31.659> get<00:04:32.080> my<00:04:32.199> hands<00:04:32.439> on<00:04:32.529> some<00:04:32.590> tubes<00:04:32.979> and<00:04:33.219> and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
get get my hands on some tubes and and

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.570 
get get my hands on some tubes and and
actually<00:04:34.330> put<00:04:34.629> it<00:04:34.719> together<00:04:34.870> it's<00:04:35.439> got<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:36.340> head

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
actually put it together it's got a head

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.219 
actually put it together it's got a head
angle<00:04:36.729> on<00:04:36.999> it<00:04:37.029> like<00:04:37.330> we<00:04:37.360> used<00:04:37.689> to<00:04:37.749> do<00:04:37.870> back<00:04:38.050> in

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
angle on it like we used to do back in

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.260 
angle on it like we used to do back in
the<00:04:38.319> early<00:04:38.590> days<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.310> bent<00:04:39.520> seat<00:04:39.729> tube<00:04:39.969> and

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
the early days and a bent seat tube and

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.969 
the early days and a bent seat tube and
chain<00:04:40.629> stays<00:04:40.840> only<00:04:41.139> slightly<00:04:41.379> longer<00:04:41.710> than

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
chain stays only slightly longer than
