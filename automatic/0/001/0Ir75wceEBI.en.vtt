00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.690
 if they see that sign if it's botafoc it 's the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.260
 clearer explanation for this video 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 definitely 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.750
 it's already holidays or if I'm here in 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.340
 middle of the desert for some reason I 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.960
 I wonder why I'm in the middle of 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:13.060
 desert but good I found these 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:16.619
 tacos and they are not tacos are like docs of 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.619
 chihuahua cars 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.880
 the one that passed the troop 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.970
 everything is not fine yes yes because the other 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.970
 not good day 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.880
 we go by the car where the car is 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.950
 car where one of them is my car 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.280
 good because I'm going to have to carry the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.280
 other 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.210
 we are going to be good here 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.300
 throwing very good wine not in the one that you 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.940
 leave this wine to the eons it's also going 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.010
 to say some brand of some wine but 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.010
 as I do not consume ops net 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.440
 Being a star must be difficult because 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.330
 imagine being a giant ball that 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.610
 shines composed of carbon hydrogen and 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.650
 helium and be floating in space 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.690
 for millions of years and that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.490
 people only see your brightness and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.010
 maybe when you are seeing your brightness you 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.360
 you no longer exist because maybe the distance 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.070
 between the earth and the star 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.570
 be much longer than what the 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.930
 speed of light reaches in about 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.930
 how many years 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.690
 good evening let me introduce myself 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.690
 I'm a garnet mister
