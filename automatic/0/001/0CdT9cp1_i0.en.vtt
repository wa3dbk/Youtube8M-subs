00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
 the emperor's atleticanos d to depend on the words of hulk and marco 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.569
 Aurélio Cunha told that he exploded for sport or could roll 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.529
 rivalry is the best thing of soccer are breeding of validity 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.299
 who approached who has it is the conquest 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.030
 and seek the same things 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.190
 football soul demand that you can not confuse rivalry with 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.369
 hard enmity animosity would be aggressiveness 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.240
 if this does not happen it is demanded extremely beneficial 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.130
 the areva and remember the dca formalin here if there was the next beryl scene 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.330
 so you have to have your parameters with competing when using the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.730
 win to challenge 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.200
 this is quality after is not the open that is the physical confrontation for the bad 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.640
 This treatment is ignorance and I hope that we never 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.309
 country because we have important brands in Brazilian football. 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.390
 o são são paulo case of achievements best even is the athletic seeks all this 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.510
 pass the street 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.650
 until then the very situation of athletic growth 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.170
 the athletic is huge 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.880
 and can reach the level of searches and achievements of são paulo just do 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.340
 correct policies as you have done are paulo and athletic 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.230
 are the ones that popcorn in the modern world 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.570
 we think that someone will stop playing the final against the boca juniors bombonera 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.650
 with all the difference of Argentines and Brazilians a stadium 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.520
 even more closed fifi and warm local supporter than here 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.540
 If there is not a joke, Sao Paulo comes under pressure, I have one. 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.560
 very important commitment we have 37 more games to count on this by the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.880
 Brazilian and only a few 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.270
 by the liberators who is the next of Fluminense not past 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.250
 so it is obvious that the energies so concentrated for the next game of the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.240
 next time 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.600
 if that's the case everyone shocked 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.770
 holders and reserves my strong football that such win in the first division with 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.020
 the two clubs had whistled three plus two kilos the forecast is excellent I 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.280
 I think by state 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.950
 what is she is politically strong 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.469
 and have a football and I felt always had a competitive football 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:13.479
 now the ex-Sao-Pauline have become dominators to the gay port rio grande 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.729
 southern and minas gerais' are the other important points with only two 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.429
 clubs 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.389
 the south with the youth still as third force I think parana do 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:27.289
 much of the large inter stadiums large traditional clubs 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.979
 Coritiba was once the Brazilian athletic champion 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.959
 champion of liberators but what to do more than can think globalization 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.179
 It's football can be tomorrow. 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.589
 Paraná football is difficult the Brazilian duck 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:46.729
 and you survive current coalition with this level I think wonderful since 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.680
 curitiba and coming back to be the great curitiba that I know because I 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:51.799
 whatever 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.089
 I hope the parana does not fall 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:58.129
 I never saw the wrong as the clubs have already fallen and were the second and third 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.109
 divisions have strength and tradition to return to the first 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:02.149
 division
