00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.770
 speaks guys here and I'm effect today 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.900
 here on the adolfs channel participating in the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.090
 His nephew and I'm going to do this video 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.700
 a comparison between two attacker 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.619
 you attach two attachments and black ops two 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.260
 Which I think generates a lot of doubt. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.160
 between the players and these mind attacks 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.800
 are the select fire and the rapid fire good 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.920
 the seletti fai is released leads 14 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.410
 instruction machine gun and do not take the 10th 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.930
 assault or rage and if the tactic and does with 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.149
 that you can select your weapon goes 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.219
 be by bush that will be by bursts or 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.800
 and rapid fire is released on the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.710
 level 15 of up machine gun or 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.289
 level 3 of light machine ganz esse 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.610
 attachment increases the speed of the shot 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.710
 of your weapon 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.899
 good thing is remembering something that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.699
 Forget that these two attacks 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.859
 mind that these two annexes right 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.690
 he increased his weapon record 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.409
 many think that this happens only 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.990
 in rapid fire but in the same two attacks 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.990
 in these two annexes this happens 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.840
 Good, now I'll give you some tips 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.780
 situations you should or should not use 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.610
 these two attachments good the rapid fire in 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.009
 my opinion should be used on weapons 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 who only give a shot or in weapons that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.820
 Shot a little slower eg 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 guns 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.530
 the rapid fire in my opinion should not 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 be used on guns that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.450
 more than one shot for example at you with no 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.119
 which you will be accelerating shooting 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 every gust and will not make the weapon 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.500
 automatic and select headlight on my 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.869
 opinion should be used in weapons 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.060
 bursts in any of them 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.090
 and this is tactically will accelerate 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.920
 blasts making your weapon automatic and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.990
 One cool thing about select was in my 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.689
 It's a very cool opinion, you can 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.969
 use it in weapons that are automatic and 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.509
 you use the select would make you go 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.670
 make these weapons by bursts that in the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.530
 my opinion the select fire is fine 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.020
 best to use my opinion the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.420
 rapid fire is horrible in black ops 2 and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.190
 so it pays off a lot more is using 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.960
 o select fire 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.940
 good galera a video where it was that same 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.100
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.770
 small compared to what I did for 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.330
 donor blood video thank you 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.290

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.630
