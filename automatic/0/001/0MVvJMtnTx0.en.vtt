 andreas damm a former horse paddock 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.570
 your husband is transformed into a garden kingdom 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.880
 Peter makes sure that the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.480
 youngest family members in the garden 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.480
 feel good 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.300
 in the east of the Netherlands in the Gelderland 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.300
 lies the green heart of the kingdom 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.660
 in this gentle landscape on the edge 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:02.440
 of the small town of bremen centro peter 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.570
 ria was at home 37 years ago 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.409
 her husband of delft from here on 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.950
 land pulled 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.810
 the garden is only good for your life elixir 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.229
 that Peter is at work 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.360
 supports 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.130
 hello honey, what does it look like ? 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.909
 is very much the last thing 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.700
 14 days in the wind that 's unimaginable 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.330
 comes because it was dry I think or 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.140
 yes, I think so very much 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.259
 It's a bit leaky in it 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.509
 Suit that he is not so nice what 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:44.560
 Do not stay in it too long I work 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:45.429
 in the garden until then and jupp lets himself 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.740
 do not scare off 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.610
 But Peter is not the water in the pond 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.190
 clear enough 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.479
 He has been working on one for five years 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:00.070
 Improvement , however, was the experiment 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.950
 karst straw is some karst straw 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.899
 begins to rot and sunday 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.179
 a substance from which the growth of 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:12.040
 algae shirt I'm doing this year 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.299
 first time and I'm not dissatisfied 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.570
 but it should be clearer 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.640
 We work at least five hours 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.220
 fall in the summer every day in the beds 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.680
 at first grew vegetables here 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.470
 Ziergarten was not planned that way 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.690
 we used to be a horse meadow and 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.160
 a sheep pasture and a few trees and 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.840
 then i thought i was looking for that 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.450
 garden a small piece of the pasture 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.400
 that was a hobby but now it is 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.209
 The hobby ran out of oars and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.209
 my work has become 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.909
 Every shrub of every tree has rea itself 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.909
 selected and planted 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.680
 important to her is the contrast between 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:05.290
 lush and formal elements 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.420
 the overflowing beets are a beautiful 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.069
 Contrary to the strictly cut 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.569
 hedges 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.909
 They serve as a windbreak for the 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.549
 perennials which recovered after them 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.569
 can feel and whose 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.599
 color combinations of rea fine 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.280
 are thought through 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.079
 a garden design is going through first 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.549
 The selection of plants definitely determines 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.030
 then maybe after the colors too 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.700
 watch 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.040
 I have as the main starting point 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.840
 The painters palette taken around the colors 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.840
 through the garden to leave more 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.109
 for shades and their effect has ria 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.109
 a reliable sense 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.550
 many years ago she has been in delft 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.830
 learned china painting 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.440
 After your children were out of the house 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.260
 she started again with this art 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.260
 flowers also play a role here 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.379
 thinks about it I still believe in it all 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.150
 I still have that as a picture 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.160
 from my eyes that are at hand 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.620
 my grandfather's through the vegetable and 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.420
 The flower garden was running and we had one 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.150
 bouquet for grandma escape 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.660
 So that's something to my life 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.639
 belongs 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.780
 I can not imagine it without 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.780
 to live 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.330
 while ria has kept memories 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.260
 peter another task in 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.260
 attacked 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.130
 His two grandchildren are promoting today 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.800
 visit in the afternoon 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.720
 Peter and Ria find that the garden 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.300
 also be attractive for small guests 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.490
 So Peter wants them to do that 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.490
 stay still sweet from today on 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.290
 the children the apartment in utrecht in the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.490
 big city 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.060
 and of course that's not so easy 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.770
 play somewhere when he hung children 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.540
 from here and then come here 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.220
 Of course, that's great when you swing 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.570
 can 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.230
 that's why opera builds a swing for 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.230
 his grandchildren 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.790
 the time is pressing lars and nils 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.850
 soon before the door 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.340
 by then everything must be ready but 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.210
 Peter is optimist his good 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.730
 Preparation will pay off 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.890
 Back in Gelderland Peter Stamm has the 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.680
 Construction of the swing almost completed 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.990
 and that's good because he has his 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.419
 grandchildren especially the little lars 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.560
 Firmly promised that the swing at 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.710
 next visit we want to go 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:51.250
 see if I can be home 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:51.250
 everything went well with the train so great 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:03.610
 hello day to his grandparents are 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.740
 top are you coming to help me but first 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.750
 the swing makes the garden for lars 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.090
 really exciting and while his 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.400
 mother jan team the quieter sides of the 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:18.970
 Gartens will enjoy it for the junior 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:22.620
 lively legs up and off you go 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:27.130
 that makes it fun 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.990
 Ok Peter and Ria moved to Gelderland 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.780
 because your children grow up in the countryside 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.780
 should make a decision without regrets 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.550
 Even if we enjoy their children 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.200
 hear stories 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.360
 they decided to 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.280
 but to stay in the study of utrecht 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.380
 Next to that you will enjoy changing it if you are 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.540
 come back here and that gives us 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.310
 all here a very special feeling 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:56.800
 that is always a very nice moment 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.140
 close is like hostess even if 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.570
 strangers come to look at the garden 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:05.830
 they always marvel at the mass 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:08.020
 work that the garden requires we 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.060
 do not feel that as we work 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.440
 Men said if we feel that then 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.020
 Let's talk about whether we do not 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.910
 but should stop in the moments in 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.810
 whom we also eat with each other 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:23.080
 this is a cake or a child 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:25.060
 a warrior such enjoyable 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.100
 there are still moments and me 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.100
 think that's the beautiful thing about the garden
