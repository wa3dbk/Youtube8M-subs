00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.770
 guys all hello Swami channel than a plan 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.609
 VKontakte group Chapman made with you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.529
 a novel and this is another review on a mask on 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.380
 this time I will do a review on the mask 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.830
 dallas from payday 2 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.349
 but with alternate painting colors 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:39.719
 let's say decided to make an individual 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:42.120
 mask mask looks like this mask 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.839
 made according to the classic technique 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.670
 papier mache 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.100
 namely, it is made entirely of 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.289
 the masses that is made of the mass itself 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.039
 papier mache 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:56.039
 she is very strong but has 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.309
 easy move as elastic in order 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.559
 to be comfortable and worn on the face 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.779
 it is painted with acrylics in three 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.240
 layer because the mask did not seem 

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:09.890
 flat 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:14.159
 covered with extreme varnish she is not afraid 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.039
 peeling does not scratch keeps well 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.689
 inside it is also varnished 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:24.179
 also glue on the mesh 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.460
 apparently I searched even perfectly while 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.630
 still creates the appearance of white eyes 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.140
 like deadpool 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.770
 see it in the mask is glued wide 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.109
 gum and also fasteks fasteks here 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.570
 adjustable that is when you 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.579
 tighten the mask you can adjust 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.249
 them under your face 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.979
 to also be comfortable to wear 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.719
 face damn softener he needs one here 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.880
 because the mask is anatomically made 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.850
 under your face she is practically nowhere 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.679
 presses besides the nose area if suddenly 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.619
 someone having trouble wearing something 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.350
 softener helps to eliminate this 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.649
 poser mesh it keeps very 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.999
 firmly like the actual rezinochka itself 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.190
 now we are trying to measure 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:10.190
 brush strokes as she sits on our face 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.500
 snap potex 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.849
 and this is how the mask sits at 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.970
 let's see you on the face 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.970

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:56.700

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:59.430
