00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 stable cellular mistral a new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.609
 product that enters the market in others 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.750
 three exclusively to deal in c5n and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.899
 nicolÃ¡s magaldi good afternoon 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.899
 Welcome 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 it is a pleasure as always to present here 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.269
 in your news exclusively 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.619
 products know we knew the world of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.090
 the tablets always talk here and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890
 we say that this is the year in which 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.090
 they were going to exploit this type of products 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.800
 we know the world of smartphones 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 the smart cell phones but I bring 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 something very new is a balance on 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.210
 everything as a journalist that these 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.399
 you will believe because it is an application 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.880
 impressive I show it shows it 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.880
 obvious 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.190
 samsung galaxy and a little bit complex 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.899
 but not so well actually of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.979
 show that camera and they will see it 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.820
 you in detail what we have here 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.299
 we're 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.649
 here with you this works with 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.140
 Android operating system and if 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.519
 we compare the palm of my hand look more 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 or less I do not have such a big hand 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.649
 but it 's a tablet that has 5.3 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.059
 inches and it's a phone this too and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.979
 beyond to see if you put ourselves to 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.289
 think according to the famous palm that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.420
 it was used a lot because it brings a 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.789
 famous pencil and it's legs in tactile 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.030
 good look what he has here I take from 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.030
 Down here 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.290
 lapicito and this for what it is useful for me 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.990
 example we journalists are going to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.610
 some event we want to make some note 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.440
 distinctive about something we want to put together 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.930
 some drawing i draw i am lousy 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.340
 but we can do something to represent 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
 and to show people surely 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 there are many who know how to draw well 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.320
 what is interesting is this 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.479
 application that is called that memo that is 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 as a note practically one the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.200
 functions that this has can not be 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.110
 follow here 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.590
 with lyrics 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.750
 nor with 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.750
 or draw a house 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.240
 quite impressive actually me 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.859
 I can save it I can cancel 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.359
 just as I'm drawing by writing my 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.549
 name can make an annotation and 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.079
 achieve magnificent things like this by 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.090
 example the drawing that would not be 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.189
 nor crazy is actually a detail 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.019
 quite pretty good but they are some 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.970
 of the applications of the application 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.090
 Android is called that memo is like a 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.560
 that memory directly too 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.940
 annotations for example we do not do you're 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.430
 in the place transmitting live and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.440
 instead of the famous exact myth you have 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.200
 this then what's up maria belen this 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.060
 landmark pencil not only serves to make 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.220
 these drawings or to create annotations 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.930
 but inside for example google 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.510
 maps we are browsing a map 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.950
 What we can determine is to add 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.870
 our direct accessories for example 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.760
 we have an appointment in such and such direction 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.069
 and we can remember it here on the screen 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.810
 in this address I have an appointment today for 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.849
 example is the highlight with the milestone pencil 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.760
 and he indicated then what allows us 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.769
 make this stylus as it is known 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.090
 is to be able to detect beyond with the 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.159
 fingers can mark certain issues 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.010
 as news that can say what 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.540
 it's like a hybrid between a tablet and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.159
 a cell phone and you will tell me good for 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.019
 what's the use, because if I put it on 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.819
 as a phone now I'm going to put it in my 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.829
 face so you can see it in detail here in 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.810
 this profile is like a shoe phono is 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.670
 that a little big but reality is very 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.440
 interesting that with the screen that 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.730
 you have you can navigate very well by 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.420
 Internet can be consulted very well 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.420
 the webpages 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.000
 what's interesting here that I'm going 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.890
 to do now 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.790
 the demo we do it live should 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.170
 take a picture 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:31.609
 let's show the photo maria nativity scene as 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.680
 you see on the screen you are seeing me 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.900
 I can give you I can do not have a camera 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.220
 and I can highlight the I can save you if 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.720
 I want reality could have the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.129
 options to share it through the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.620
 social networks could be a lot of 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.389
 very very interesting things 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.549
 of the operating system of android that 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.409
 who knows for example this cell phone the 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.970
 samsung galaxy s2 is a little bit more 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.410
 little one looks like the younger brother or 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.400
 comparing it with a blackberry if it 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.870
 they want to see you here for 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.909
 the size and the difference that there is in the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.439
 home screen in their homes let's say 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.879
 it's a normal size it's not a size 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.610
 big what has this are five 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.500
 points three inches of screen is 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.040
 press as a recorder as a camcorder 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.450
 imagine yourself in the work of a journalist 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.790
 let's make a video that we sign 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.959
 they're going to give we're going to do it like that 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.250
 be a videoconference on Skype 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.970
 key example 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.350
 Maria Belen, I'm going to download the application if 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.350
 I'm not interviewing at this time 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.930
 very useful for my work extracted from the 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.970
 new product from the market that still 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.310
 is not in the market when it is presented 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.110
 this Saturday officially that's why 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.639
 we have first news every news 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.530
 before anyone else we have it 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.970
 this spectacular news pretty 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.800
 products that can be like this here 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.590
 we approach short the recording 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.430
 directly what I do is mark it 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.650
 here again 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.090
 I put reproduce as we are seeing 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.310
 the video of the recording we made 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.310
 to maria belÃ©n if you listen 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.340
 listening 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:03.650
 well there is moving the recording in 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.729
 high definition is to take and talk if what 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.280
 We can connect to any device 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.949
 in addition you can also be doing 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.060
 a live note in that art I tell a 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.189
 experience to talk about what 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.990
 You can get to do with this via Skype 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.819
 we at 15 sales we use a lot 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.870
 this kind of things coverage of a 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.520
 news that is happening on video 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.409
 indirectly I communicate on the day of 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.389
 tomorrow with the production I tell you by 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.729
 please from the c5n skype 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.439
 to me as a user, tomorrow I'm going to 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.419
 broadcast live with live images 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.310
 from this tablet or on a cell phone that 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.689
 and to the majority today you can do what 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.659
 is happening for example you are 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.120
 doing a story or are you having 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:40.729
 exactly us the factual 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.379
 launching and you can transmit it so that 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.849
 for example, during this time 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.000
 receiving some of the we could try 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.900
 somewhere and emit sound images 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.900
 to sing wines 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.599
 from an orality to highlight what 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.219
 interesting in this type of products is 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.289
 the number of people who can 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.870
 get to use because the idea of ââeverything 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.180
 this kind of thing or technology is 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.680
 for trying to pass the famous little piece of paper 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.020
 that we have the annotator the 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.639
 notebook to turn to this type of 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.949
 things 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.500
 the market considers that this is the most 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:20.330
 novel which would be acquired 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.469
 because there are many ideas for that 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.439
 person who is hesitating between a 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:26.180
 tablet and a cell phone is the product that 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.080
 is in the middle exactly this has 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.550
 the very large screen and with 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.949
 own applications of a tablet 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.240
 same as a tablet and technology 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.909
 from a cell phone on a smartphone that 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.710
 allows you to talk on the phone, for example 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:38.150
 send text messages all that yes 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.750
 You may find it a bit uncomfortable if you 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.250
 you're looking for a lot like a telephone but if you're 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:49.009
 a person an executive that all day 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:50.240
 He highlighted perfectly how much it costs not 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:51.349
 I have the official price that's why we 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.330
 encouraged to say how are the 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.830
 different telephone companies dresses 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.320
 that I agreed 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.000
 that the plan that is going to be the 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.320
 price that is going to have promises the week 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.270
 that comes if we touch on this topic again 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.410
 to say that official prices this 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.430
 what he wants is the advancement of five 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:11.650
 spectacular 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.650
 This can be downloaded in the backpack 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:27.890
 at this moment he feels that I appear 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:30.980
 I reviewed the new stuff 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:33.490
 temporality if it could be loaded on 4 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.490
 december 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.490
 now 

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.870
 it's very interesting how I turn them to 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.240
 reiterate to see you demand that now 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.490
 we configure everything 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.870
 this is ideal this type of products is 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.270
 a hybrid as it is known among a 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.710
 tablet and a smartphone by 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.740
 that if you are thinking about buying 

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.030
 a tablet or a cell phone this maybe 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.560
 It may be a good option for you 

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.550
 and next week I promise through 

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.250
 of the official prices so that 

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:15.090
 also obviously the pocket 

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.090
 thank you very much, reserve
