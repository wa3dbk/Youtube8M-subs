00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
as you can see and then once again I'm

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
as you can see and then once again I'm
gonna<00:01:40.380> take<00:01:40.590> another<00:01:40.920> piece<00:01:41.310> from<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> top<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
gonna take another piece from the top so

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480 
gonna take another piece from the top so
that<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:42.689> lays<00:01:43.259> flat<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.860> covers

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that way it really lays flat and covers

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910 
that way it really lays flat and covers
over<00:01:44.670> those<00:01:44.970> clip<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> tracks<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.259> then

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
over those clip and tracks and then

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.260 
over those clip and tracks and then
you're<00:01:47.070> pretty<00:01:47.310> much<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> continue

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you're pretty much going to continue

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
you're pretty much going to continue
this<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:49.140> until<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
this all the way until you get to the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.450 
this all the way until you get to the
base<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.549> head

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.080 

I<00:01:59.200> know<00:02:00.200> cornrowing<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.220> not<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.700> easiest

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
I know cornrowing is not the easiest

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.789 
I know cornrowing is not the easiest
thing<00:02:02.299> but<00:02:02.570> there<00:02:02.690> are<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.020> many<00:02:03.229> videos<00:02:03.470> on

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
thing but there are so many videos on

start<00:02:54.530> off<00:02:54.739> with<00:02:54.800> my<00:02:55.160> three<00:02:55.489> sections<00:02:56.060> this

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
start off with my three sections this

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.570 
start off with my three sections this
time<00:02:56.600> incorporating<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.530> little<00:02:57.800> bit<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
time incorporating a little bit of the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.920 
time incorporating a little bit of the
kinky<00:02:58.970> straight<00:02:59.360> um

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
kinky straight um

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.320 
kinky straight um
clippings<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.739> then<00:03:01.160> once<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.580> braid<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.120> few

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
clippings and then once I braid it a few

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.449 
clippings and then once I braid it a few
times<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.780> can<00:03:02.989> see<00:03:03.170> my<00:03:03.380> three<00:03:03.620> distinct<00:03:04.160> hair

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
times I can see my three distinct hair

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.610 
times I can see my three distinct hair
strands<00:03:04.790> I'm<00:03:05.000> going<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.450> then<00:03:05.720> begin<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.350> braid

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
strands I'm going to then begin to braid

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.440 
strands I'm going to then begin to braid
the<00:03:07.190> only<00:03:07.430> difference<00:03:07.820> this<00:03:08.000> time<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.299> that

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
the only difference this time is that

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.270 
the only difference this time is that
I'm<00:03:08.660> mostly<00:03:08.989> taking<00:03:09.440> hair<00:03:09.650> from<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.980> top<00:03:10.220> and

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
I'm mostly taking hair from the top and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.789 
I'm mostly taking hair from the top and
then<00:03:10.700> incorporating<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.959> because<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.500> want

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
then incorporating it in because I want

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.470 
then incorporating it in because I want
this<00:03:12.920> braid<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.280> be<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.850> little<00:03:14.030> bit<00:03:14.239> lower

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
this braid to be just a little bit lower

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.990 
this braid to be just a little bit lower
so<00:03:14.630> as<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.959> guys<00:03:15.170> see<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.709> keep<00:03:16.160> taking<00:03:16.370> pieces

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
so as you guys see I keep taking pieces

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.970

from<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.360> top<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.840> then<00:03:18.170> incorporating<00:03:18.799> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
from the top and then incorporating it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.130 
from the top and then incorporating it
into<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.579> braid<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.120> I'll<00:03:20.420> braid<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.840> about

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
into the braid and I'll braid it about

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.170 
into the braid and I'll braid it about
two<00:03:21.440> times<00:03:21.739> before<00:03:22.160> grabbing<00:03:22.400> another<00:03:22.790> piece

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
two times before grabbing another piece

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.150
