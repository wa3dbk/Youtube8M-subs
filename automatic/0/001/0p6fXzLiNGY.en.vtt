we're<00:00:48.120> red<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.200> block<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> one

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
we're red here this block and the one

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.889 
we're red here this block and the one
after<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:51.030> clear<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.510> why<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.809> have

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
after that it's clear that's why we have

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.869 
after that it's clear that's why we have
a<00:00:51.960> green<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> come<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.160> go
