00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
can't actually think of anything else so

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.720 
can't actually think of anything else so
let's<00:00:10.290> get<00:00:10.410> into<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.679> i'll<00:00:10.980> show<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.490> to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
let's get into it i'll show you how to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.350 
let's get into it i'll show you how to
do<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.290> very<00:00:13.860> time-consuming<00:00:14.490> one

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
do it this is a very time-consuming one

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.109 
do it this is a very time-consuming one
so<00:00:16.080> basically<00:00:16.440> you're<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.039> invest<00:00:17.220> this

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
so basically you're going to invest this

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.609 
so basically you're going to invest this
is<00:00:18.330> an<00:00:18.539> investing<00:00:19.320> method<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:21.060> example<00:00:21.619> we

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
is an investing method so for example we

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.609 
is an investing method so for example we
have<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.949> new<00:00:23.160> team<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.820> week<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.750> last

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
have the new team of a week for last

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.070 
have the new team of a week for last
week<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.160> was<00:00:26.189> wednesday<00:00:26.880> image<00:00:27.539> Tuesday

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
week it was wednesday image Tuesday

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.679 
week it was wednesday image Tuesday
Tuesday<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:29.039> Tuesday<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.910> normally<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> best

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
Tuesday and Tuesday is normally the best

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.549 
Tuesday and Tuesday is normally the best
time<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.199> do<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.030> example<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:34.380> get

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
time to do it so for example if we get

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.430 
time to do it so for example if we get
this<00:00:34.710> player<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.219> his<00:00:35.460> name<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> Dennis<00:00:36.440> we

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this player here his name is Dennis we

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.840 
this player here his name is Dennis we
went<00:00:37.680> by<00:00:37.980> him<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:39.090> today<00:00:39.870> tuesday<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.739> then

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
went by him but today tuesday and then

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.139 
went by him but today tuesday and then
we<00:00:41.850> wait<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.379> example<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> month<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.700> very

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
we wait for for example a month a very

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.990 
we wait for for example a month a very
long<00:00:45.329> time<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.600> no<00:00:45.989> he<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.010> 10<00:00:47.250> K<00:00:47.460> now<00:00:47.730> in
