I've got the other side panel on here
and<00:01:39.650> I've<00:01:40.650> reconnected<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.759> green<00:01:42.030> fan<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
and I've reconnected the green fan and
put<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> other<00:01:43.439> side<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.890> radiator

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
put down the other side of the radiator

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.679 
put down the other side of the radiator
to<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.210> more<00:01:45.390> air<00:01:45.600> flow<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:46.049> through<00:01:46.380> there

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
to get more air flow going through there

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.109 
to get more air flow going through there
this<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:48.930> key<00:01:49.110> from<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:49.530> cold<00:01:49.920> got<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
this little key from very cold got a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.660 
this little key from very cold got a
nice<00:01:51.420> arrangement

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.540 

means<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:56.680> Harold<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.920> talking<00:01:57.950> about<00:01:58.280> the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
means that Harold is talking about the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.240 
means that Harold is talking about the
fan<00:01:58.760> noise<00:01:58.970> because<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.750> video<00:02:00.590> card<00:02:00.920> makes

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
fan noise because the video card makes

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.910 
fan noise because the video card makes
the<00:02:01.430> most<00:02:01.580> amount<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.180> noise<00:02:02.420> but<00:02:03.380> obviously

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
the most amount of noise but obviously

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.380 
the most amount of noise but obviously
you<00:02:04.130> can't<00:02:04.400> see<00:02:04.640> what<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:04.850> was<00:02:04.940> talking<00:02:05.180> about

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
you can't see what I was talking about

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.080 
you can't see what I was talking about
now<00:02:05.690> because<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:07.160> can't<00:02:07.400> hear<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.730> fan<00:02:07.940> noise

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
now because you can't hear the fan noise

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.090 
now because you can't hear the fan noise
