00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 hi people i am returning to tokyo 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.110
 today 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:17.610
 Today I show you how to get ahead 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:20.910
 in minecraft and all very cool only 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.640
 with wood found only once version wood to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.380
 wood around wood person yes in this 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.609
 case you will find such a wood 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.000
 Elsewhere you will find something else 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:38.340
 we do have only times a first time 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 Everywhere you see it would be very 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.980
 idly whole minecraft long ever again 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.130
 fallen down 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.430
 that would be very idle always this 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.930
 each one as long as one 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.270
 needs as you see I have now 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.270
 I do not care about two 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.379
 then you see, that's enough 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.990
 wooden boards and then you take them 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.410
 once then if you have tropical wood on it 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.080
 do you too because I have it that way 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.899
 and in the bottom right of the inventory of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.050
 everything has a different color 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.819
 Now we need such a workbench 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.060
 I can go with you once with every wood 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:27.119
 show that really goes with every neck 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.310
 that does not matter with the stock can 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.740
 I me later I can for my 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.910
 I'll take some with me now 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.910
 times five pieces 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.560
 and we put that down here 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:58.289
 then I show myself the things all 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:00.630
 forces might even be clear that 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.700
 nobody really does that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.479
 not matter 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.009
 what you take for what should I hope 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:17.239
 I have you showing you right now 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:22.380
 all material is still 1 and so on 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:25.380
 and some things that you can 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.050
 maybe think what it is but some 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.220
 maybe not the question 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.440
 answer you now 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 I say we are here now 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.790
 Just in the ground and looked exactly 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.110
 how much and how you see it takes 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.329
 long until it's your turn 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.430
 you just pick this pickaxe 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:50.000
 here and there it is much faster 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.000
 but that is still relatively slow 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 therefore 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.520
 I'll just keep going 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.440
 my strength the boxster could then 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.970
 of course also illegal 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.880
 Of course you can do more 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.620
 but they do not have that much right now 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.540
 lust and you see we have six 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.490
 paving stones what do the mails bring 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.500
 replaced as well as just that 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.590
 and exactly the same recipe just that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:23.950
 you were standing up there and see now 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:26.350
 you 12 times and there you see already 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.260
 is clearly faster but there is 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:37.690
 also a coronation 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:41.380
 I take here you need to take 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.780
 I have everything now no I miss that 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.360
 still 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.980
 yes and and that's when you're lucky 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.930
 Dad I can be very short now 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.150
 do not say no 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.470
 You may find this way someday 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.840
 Iron ore in the ground I have now 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.200
 grad I do not think of everyone now 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.580
 fall see the iron 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.129
 or diamond you can do there 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.280
 you have to burn first or too 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.319
 no idea who this is by no means 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.040
 so you only need one diamond 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.090
 and then just say it 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.300
 refuse because that's what you say oh 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.770
 cool I found it 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.010
 As you can see with wooden sticks, that works 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.650
 not at all 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.630
 but it is here with the stone 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.229
 diamond, of course, again very much 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.889
 fast 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.830
 yes and that does not do much now 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.470
 you can do it from there no there was 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.780
 is a very special so brings 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.250
 not very much now and I do 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.030
 this and do that right now 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.729
 again longer than I wanted to do 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.530
 but as here 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.630
 we just found it that way 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.370
 cool the iron I have to go now 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:07.910
 Of course everything is down here now 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:09.889
 that also looks like this in the case you ey 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.860
 no sorry people in any case 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.529
 her iron ore with the coal in it 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.129
 the oven is 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:22.779
 yes and then you can do that with me 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:27.649
 stone and left made with wood 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:30.559
 Can you save the little space there 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:36.229
 matter but is already fierce how many 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:38.599
 do not store things like hers 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.969
 everything goes much faster again 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.039
 that's it with the video people you see 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:47.899
 what you can do with wood is 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:53.649
 to say your half left world yours 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:59.479
 half minecraft world consists of him 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:06:03.429
 is made of vertical wood otherwise 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.429
 I'm out of here 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.210
 jazz 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.210
 It's an experiment 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.759
 New 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.960

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:29.710
 So we go with a really people 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.370
