of<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:36.989> year<00:00:37.020> candidate<00:00:37.560> I<00:00:38.480> happen<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of the year candidate I happen to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.430 
of the year candidate I happen to
disagree<00:00:39.630> I<00:00:40.470> think<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.700> any<00:00:42.140> boxing<00:00:43.140> fan

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
disagree I think that any boxing fan

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.190 
disagree I think that any boxing fan
should<00:00:43.860> watch<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.370> fight<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
should watch this fight but I think that

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.710 
should watch this fight but I think that
really<00:00:46.410> what's<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.130> to<00:00:47.220> be<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
really what's going to be is a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.450 
really what's going to be is a
career-defining<00:00:48.720> moment<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.590> not<00:00:49.920> even<00:00:50.040> air

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
career-defining moment for not even air

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.730 
career-defining moment for not even air
and<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.240> really<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.900> this<00:00:52.050> will<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.290> a

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
and I really think that this will be a

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.740 
and I really think that this will be a
one-sided<00:00:53.520> fight<00:00:53.790> for<00:00:54.090> nothing<00:00:54.180> over<00:00:54.570> there

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
one-sided fight for nothing over there

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.710 
one-sided fight for nothing over there
all<00:00:55.380> right<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.910> want<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> start<00:00:57.510> off<00:00:57.900> by

all right so I want to start off by

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.490 
all right so I want to start off by
saying<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:02.930> mira<00:01:03.930> nair<00:01:04.199> has<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:05.450> 2<00:01:06.450> maybe<00:01:07.350> 3
