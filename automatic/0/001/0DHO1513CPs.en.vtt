the<00:01:58.850> speed<00:01:59.210> I'm<00:01:59.570> just<00:01:59.840> going<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.200> be<00:02:00.380> take<00:02:00.650> the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
the speed I'm just going to be take the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.859 
the speed I'm just going to be take the
day<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.280> try<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.909> heat<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:02.780> you

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
day and try it with the heat but you

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.390 
day and try it with the heat but you
could<00:02:03.020> just<00:02:03.050> put<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.590> one<00:02:03.680> time<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.190> leave

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
could just put that to one time to leave

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.290 
could just put that to one time to leave
it<00:02:04.610> as<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:05.950> okay<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.580> now<00:02:07.790> I'm<00:02:08.030> going<00:02:08.209> to

it as it is okay and now I'm going to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.059 
it as it is okay and now I'm going to
take<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.600> perfect<00:02:08.959> medium<00:02:09.080> again<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.950> I'm

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.570 
take the perfect medium again and I'm
going<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.369> apply<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.700> over<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.330> top<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.660> the

going to apply it over the top of the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.030 
going to apply it over the top of the
to<00:02:12.940> push<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.270> down<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.440> I'm<00:02:14.590> going<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.860> make

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
to push it down and I'm going to make

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.250 
to push it down and I'm going to make
sure<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.730> poverty

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
sure it's poverty

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.950 
sure it's poverty
piece<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.860> paper

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.770

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the clear alter combusted enamel this is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.880 
the clear alter combusted enamel this is

if<00:02:26.460> you're<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.850> going<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.540> play

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
if you're just going to have it play

you<00:02:28.849> can<00:02:29.030> get<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.299> my<00:02:29.390> bunker<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.170> where<00:02:30.290> I'm

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
you can get to my bunker but where I'm

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.110 
you can get to my bunker but where I'm
going<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.650> embed<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.159> stump<00:02:31.430> into<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.879> so<00:02:32.030> I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
going to embed a stump into you so I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.570 
going to embed a stump into you so I
like<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.510> use<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.840> close

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
like to use to close

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.790 
like to use to close
so<00:02:35.060> we<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.330> sprinkle<00:02:35.870> some<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> power

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
so we just sprinkle some of the power

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.310 
so we just sprinkle some of the power
and<00:02:37.800> then<00:02:38.640> go<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> lift<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.420> up<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.870> pick<00:02:40.170> some

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
and then go to lift it up and pick some

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.110 
and then go to lift it up and pick some
ports<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.220> tap<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.850> excess

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
ports and I can to just tap the excess

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.420 
ports and I can to just tap the excess
off<00:02:42.330> as<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.080> victims

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
this is going cold so we just need to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.720 
this is going cold so we just need to
then<00:03:22.310> make<00:03:22.550> sure<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:23.060> just

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
then make sure you just

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.960 
then make sure you just
quick<00:03:24.480> eat<00:03:25.140> honor

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
quick eat honor

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.000 
quick eat honor
and<00:03:27.060> then<00:03:27.480> while<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:27.960> hot<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.740> add<00:03:28.980> a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
and then while it's hot just add a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.820 
and then while it's hot just add a
second<00:03:29.580> layer<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.910> ultra<00:03:30.660> thick<00:03:30.840> straight<00:03:31.440> on

second layer of ultra thick straight on

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.420 
second layer of ultra thick straight on
to<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> top<00:03:32.330> left<00:03:34.190> tap<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.340> excess

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
to the top left tap the excess

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.300 
to the top left tap the excess
we're<00:03:37.849> going<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.180> embed<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.450> stamp<00:03:39.189> into<00:03:40.189> this

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
we're going to embed a stamp into this

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.250 
we're going to embed a stamp into this
so<00:03:40.670> I've<00:03:40.790> just<00:03:40.819> got<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.239> start<00:03:41.569> any<00:03:41.750> standards

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
so I've just got a start any standards

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.080 
so I've just got a start any standards
better<00:03:42.470> tools<00:03:42.920> better<00:03:43.189> to<00:03:43.459> take<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.909> perfect

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
better tools better to take the perfect

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.660 
better tools better to take the perfect
medium<00:03:44.569> and<00:03:45.260> we're<00:03:45.379> going<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.590> ink<00:03:45.890> stamp<00:03:46.430> up

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
medium and we're going to ink stamp up

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.660 
medium and we're going to ink stamp up
first<00:03:47.239> with<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:47.689> perfect<00:03:48.110> major<00:03:48.519> then<00:03:49.519> we're

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
first with the perfect major then we're

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.940 
first with the perfect major then we're
going<00:03:49.849> to<00:03:49.909> melt<00:03:50.180> second<00:03:51.170> layer<00:03:51.349> of<00:03:51.650> the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.400 

it'll<00:03:55.610> melt<00:03:55.760> quicker<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:56.239> time<00:03:56.300> every<00:03:57.200> coat

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
it'll melt quicker this time every coat

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.140 
it'll melt quicker this time every coat
that<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.680> do<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.129> just<00:03:58.310> melts<00:03:58.550> because<00:03:58.910> it<00:03:59.030> is

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
that you do it just melts because it is

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.270 
that you do it just melts because it is
hot

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
hot

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.550 
hot
which<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.910> another<00:04:01.240> I<00:04:01.450> don't<00:04:01.660> do<00:04:02.110> this<00:04:02.290> so
