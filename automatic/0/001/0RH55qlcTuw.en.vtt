00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.039 
the things that I've gone through
probably<00:03:27.930> ever<00:03:29.390> surgery<00:03:30.390> being<00:03:30.570> one<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.810> them

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
probably ever surgery being one of them

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.680 
probably ever surgery being one of them
mind<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.500> because<00:03:32.340> I'm<00:03:32.910> used<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.120> hurricanes

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
mind you because I'm used to hurricanes

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.960 
mind you because I'm used to hurricanes
but<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.470> go<00:03:34.709> inland<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.370> avoid<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
but you can go inland and avoid the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.960 
but you can go inland and avoid the
worst<00:03:36.150> part<00:03:36.510> for<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.130> tornado<00:03:38.579> is<00:03:38.819> so

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
worst part for that but a tornado is so

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.539 
worst part for that but a tornado is so
unexpected<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.200> unpredictable<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.370> was

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
unexpected and so unpredictable it was

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.900 
unexpected and so unpredictable it was
just<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:42.350> what<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.859> is<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.190> random<00:03:44.459> it

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
just like what and it is so random it

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.280 
just like what and it is so random it
could

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
could

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.899 
could

stressful<00:05:45.589> for<00:05:45.889> me<00:05:45.949> I've<00:05:46.129> always<00:05:46.339> been<00:05:46.639> a

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
stressful eater and this I guess was

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.149 
stressful eater and this I guess was
like<00:05:50.719> the<00:05:51.139> straw<00:05:51.349> that<00:05:51.379> broke<00:05:51.679> the<00:05:51.739> camel's

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
like the straw that broke the camel's

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.699 
like the straw that broke the camel's
back<00:05:52.219> because<00:05:52.729> I<00:05:52.759> really<00:05:53.509> fell<00:05:54.199> back<00:05:54.439> on<00:05:54.589> my

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:54.709 
back because I really fell back on my
