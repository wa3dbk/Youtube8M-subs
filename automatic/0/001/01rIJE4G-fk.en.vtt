okay<00:00:05.660> you've<00:00:05.930> seen<00:00:05.959> this<00:00:06.490> this<00:00:07.490> is<00:00:07.549> called<00:00:07.939> a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
okay you've seen this this is called a

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.220 
okay you've seen this this is called a
yes<00:00:09.789> this<00:00:10.789> is<00:00:10.969> an<00:00:11.090> old-fashioned<00:00:11.780> lathe<00:00:11.990> and

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
yes this is an old-fashioned lathe and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.470 
yes this is an old-fashioned lathe and
the<00:00:12.350> way<00:00:12.469> you<00:00:12.529> move<00:00:12.830> the<00:00:12.980> tool<00:00:13.219> is<00:00:13.520> like<00:00:14.240> this

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
the way you move the tool is like this

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.099 
the way you move the tool is like this
with<00:00:14.779> a<00:00:14.809> vernier<00:00:15.439> calipers<00:00:16.539> uh-huh<00:00:17.539> and<00:00:17.990> you

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
with a vernier calipers uh-huh and you

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.080 
with a vernier calipers uh-huh and you
can<00:00:18.260> set<00:00:18.439> an<00:00:18.560> angle<00:00:18.949> and<00:00:19.160> straight<00:00:19.490> across<00:00:19.699> and

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
can set an angle and straight across and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.230 
can set an angle and straight across and
forward<00:00:20.690> it<00:00:20.780> back<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:21.789> you<00:00:22.789> just<00:00:22.970> have<00:00:23.119> to

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
forward it back and you just have to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.090 
forward it back and you just have to
like<00:00:23.420> move<00:00:23.780> it<00:00:23.960> a<00:00:24.020> little<00:00:24.050> bit<00:00:24.230> measure<00:00:24.860> it

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
like move it a little bit measure it

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.800 
like move it a little bit measure it
move<00:00:25.460> it<00:00:25.610> a<00:00:25.640> little<00:00:25.760> bit<00:00:25.910> measure<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:26.330> go<00:00:26.630> down

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
move it a little bit measure it go down

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.080 
move it a little bit measure it go down
a<00:00:26.840> little<00:00:27.050> bit<00:00:27.260> try<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.710> again<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:28.880> takes

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
a little bit try it again it takes

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.670 
a little bit try it again it takes
forever<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:30.130> machine<00:00:31.130> dial<00:00:31.490> apart<00:00:31.850> on<00:00:32.000> this

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
forever to machine dial apart on this

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:43.380 
forever to machine dial apart on this
this<00:00:33.680> is<00:00:33.859> the<00:00:34.100> what<00:00:34.730> has<00:00:34.850> been<00:00:34.969> replaced<00:00:35.270> by

and this index is out to the tool it's
in<00:01:04.330> use<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:05.380> then<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.650> comes<00:01:05.950> in<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.460> it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
in use and then it comes in and it

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.180 
in use and then it comes in and it
machines<00:01:06.910> what<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.270> needs<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.710> run<00:01:08.710> comes<00:01:08.979> back

bars and hogs and finish tools all there

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.969 
bars and hogs and finish tools all there
it's<00:01:16.150> all<00:01:16.360> changed<00:01:16.780> automatically<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.770> it's

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
it's all changed automatically and it's

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.070 
it's all changed automatically and it's
all<00:01:18.160> done<00:01:18.400> numerically<00:01:19.030> with<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.720> computer

control<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:22.119> advantage<00:01:22.540> is<00:01:22.720> that<00:01:22.900> instead<00:01:23.200> of

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
control the advantage is that instead of

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.430 
control the advantage is that instead of
taking<00:01:23.940> four<00:01:24.940> hours<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.450> make<00:01:25.479> a<00:01:25.600> cup<00:01:25.930> if

taking four hours to make a cup if
you're<00:01:26.619> pretty<00:01:26.860> good<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:28.060> do<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.450> four

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
you're pretty good we do it in four

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.380 
you're pretty good we do it in four
minutes<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.130> remember<00:01:30.520> if<00:01:30.850> we<00:01:31.030> saw<00:01:31.210> in<00:01:31.330> the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
minutes so we remember if we saw in the

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.840 
minutes so we remember if we saw in the
machine<00:01:31.690> shop<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.590> ingot<00:01:32.950> here's<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.520> ingot

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
machine shop the ingot here's the ingot

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:45.420 
machine shop the ingot here's the ingot
it's<00:01:34.780> been<00:01:34.960> machined<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:36.100> been<00:01:36.250> cut<00:01:36.490> out

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.080 

get<00:01:46.430> a<00:01:46.460> center<00:01:46.820> pin<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.370> case<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:49.790> dual

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
get a center pin in this case is a dual

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.600 
get a center pin in this case is a dual
durometer<00:01:50.300> energy<00:01:51.260> core<00:01:51.470> wheel<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.490> you've

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
durometer energy core wheel and you've

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.430 
durometer energy core wheel and you've
got<00:01:52.760> a<00:01:52.790> top<00:01:53.060> pin<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:54.800> fits<00:01:55.070> on<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:56.030> precisely

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.390 

and<00:02:00.820> then<00:02:01.820> when<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.060> pour<00:02:02.300> it<00:02:02.920> we've<00:02:03.920> got<00:02:04.369> a

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
and then when you pour it we've got a

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.430 
and then when you pour it we've got a
poor<00:02:04.670> line<00:02:04.880> here<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:05.360> we<00:02:05.509> adjust<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.900> floor<00:02:06.200> so

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
poor line here so we adjust the floor so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.690 
poor line here so we adjust the floor so
that<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.650> pours<00:02:06.890> right<00:02:06.979> up<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.430> bevel<00:02:09.700> we

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
that it pours right up to that bevel we

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.190 
that it pours right up to that bevel we
use<00:02:10.820> a<00:02:10.850> shot<00:02:11.300> machine<00:02:11.510> instead<00:02:11.989> of<00:02:12.110> a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
use a shot machine instead of a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.410 
use a shot machine instead of a
continuous<00:02:12.380> bore<00:02:13.010> it's<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.819> little<00:02:14.030> harder<00:02:14.300> to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
continuous bore it's a little harder to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.500 
continuous bore it's a little harder to
do<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.810> way<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.709> not<00:02:15.860> messy

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
do it that way but it's not messy

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.180 
do it that way but it's not messy
you<00:02:17.510> saw<00:02:17.750> her<00:02:17.810> which<00:02:18.020> on<00:02:18.260> our<00:02:18.530> urethane<00:02:18.830> shop

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
you saw her which on our urethane shop

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.310 
you saw her which on our urethane shop
looks<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.550> same<00:02:19.700> way<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.330> like<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:21.050> can<00:02:21.230> eat

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
looks the same way it's like you can eat

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.690 
looks the same way it's like you can eat
up<00:02:21.470> before<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.070> don't<00:02:22.250> want<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.519> because

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
up before but you don't want to because

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.530 
up before but you don't want to because
it's<00:02:22.970> silicone<00:02:23.510> out<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.940> if<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.390> make

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
it's silicone out of it so if you make

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.259 
it's silicone out of it so if you make
precision<00:02:29.980> aluminum<00:02:30.980> bowls<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.550> get<00:02:32.090> a

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
precision aluminum bowls you get a

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.390 
precision aluminum bowls you get a
precision<00:02:32.570> wheel<00:02:32.930> out<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:34.190> don't<00:02:34.280> have

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
precision wheel out of it we don't have

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.210 
precision wheel out of it we don't have
to<00:02:34.580> machine<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.030> edges<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:36.530> lot<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.950> people

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
to machine the edges a lot of people

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.970 
to machine the edges a lot of people
made<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.940> up<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:39.290> order<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.560> make<00:02:39.709> less

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
made like up in order to make less

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.130 
made like up in order to make less
tooling<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.880> make<00:02:41.060> one<00:02:41.390> bigger<00:02:41.660> wheat<00:02:41.930> one

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
tooling you make one bigger wheat one

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.199 
tooling you make one bigger wheat one
beer<00:02:42.650> mold<00:02:42.920> then<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:43.820> cut<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
beer mold then you just cut the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.069 
beer mold then you just cut the
different<00:02:44.480> diameters<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.170> shave<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:47.079> your

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
different diameters and shave it so your

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.229 
different diameters and shave it so your
catch<00:02:48.410> tooling<00:02:48.829> cost<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.430> tooling<00:02:50.180> is

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
catch tooling cost and tooling is

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.550 
catch tooling cost and tooling is
expensive<00:02:50.750> if<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.019> don't<00:02:51.200> make<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.350> yourself

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
expensive if you don't make it yourself

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.530 
expensive if you don't make it yourself
that's<00:02:52.010> you're<00:02:52.459> going<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.670> pay<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:53.120> lot<00:02:53.480> more

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
that's you're going to pay a lot more

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.050 
that's you're going to pay a lot more
than<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:53.959> pay<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.340> we<00:02:55.610> just<00:02:55.790> ended<00:02:56.000> up

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
than we pay and so we just ended up

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.819 
than we pay and so we just ended up
making<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.690> lot<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.500> molds<00:02:58.030> yeah<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.299> waistline

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
making a lot of molds yeah and waistline

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.450 
making a lot of molds yeah and waistline
so<00:03:00.829> these<00:03:00.980> molds<00:03:01.459> are

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:14.210 

these<00:03:06.970> moles<00:03:07.210> are<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:07.570> reheating

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.120 

wheels<00:03:14.820> are<00:03:15.060> cooked<00:03:15.330> like<00:03:15.810> cupcakes<00:03:16.050> we<00:03:16.920> bake

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
wheels are cooked like cupcakes we bake

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.000 
wheels are cooked like cupcakes we bake
them<00:03:17.310> for<00:03:17.520> about<00:03:17.640> 40<00:03:18.180> minutes<00:03:18.830> then<00:03:19.830> we

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
them for about 40 minutes then we

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.770 
them for about 40 minutes then we
there's<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.670> little<00:03:20.970> machine<00:03:21.240> over<00:03:21.480> there<00:03:21.510> we

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
there's a little machine over there we

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.740 
there's a little machine over there we
pop<00:03:22.020> them<00:03:22.170> out<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.440> mold

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.750 

and<00:03:30.440> then<00:03:30.590> they<00:03:30.710> get<00:03:30.830> spread<00:03:31.100> on<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.370> floor<00:03:31.610> to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
and then they get spread on the floor to

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.960 
and then they get spread on the floor to
cool

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.380 

probably<00:03:36.720> address<00:03:37.020> of<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.230> day<00:03:37.410> tomorrow

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
probably address of the day tomorrow

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:50.630 
probably address of the day tomorrow
then<00:03:39.390> they'll<00:03:39.540> go<00:03:39.720> through<00:03:40.100> cutting<00:03:49.640> then

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
then they'll go through cutting then

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.060 
then they'll go through cutting then
they<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.970> washed<00:03:51.440> they<00:03:52.440> come<00:03:52.620> back<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:52.980> they

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
they get washed they come back and they

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.700 
they get washed they come back and they
get<00:03:53.220> printed<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:54.630> while<00:03:54.840> we're<00:03:55.050> here<00:03:55.560> I'll

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
get printed so while we're here I'll

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.870 
get printed so while we're here I'll
show<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:55.950> printing<00:03:57.200> so<00:03:58.340> these<00:03:59.340> these

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
show you printing so these these

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.300 
show you printing so these these
machines<00:04:00.360> are<00:04:00.540> called<00:04:00.720> pad<00:04:00.960> printers<00:04:01.380> it's<00:04:02.250> a

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
machines are called pad printers it's a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.280 
machines are called pad printers it's a
really<00:04:02.640> interesting<00:04:02.910> process<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.110> guys

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
really interesting process and you guys

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.710 
really interesting process and you guys
into<00:04:04.620> process<00:04:05.040> at<00:04:05.220> all<00:04:05.330> this<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.480> kind<00:04:06.660> of

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
into process at all this is kind of

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.600 
into process at all this is kind of
magical<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.440> don't<00:04:07.980> know<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.459> guy<00:04:08.580> that

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
magical I don't know the guy that

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.590 
magical I don't know the guy that
developed<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.240> was<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.450> genius<00:04:11.300> you<00:04:12.300> can<00:04:12.420> feel

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
developed this was a genius you can feel

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:23.960 
developed this was a genius you can feel
it<00:04:12.720> if<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.930> like<00:04:21.650> okay<00:04:22.650> guys<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.520> should<00:04:23.670> have

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
it if you like okay guys I should have

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.250 
it if you like okay guys I should have
got<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:26.600> so<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:29.400> thing<00:04:29.700> picks<00:04:30.480> up<00:04:30.750> ink<00:04:31.020> off<00:04:31.230> a

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
got to so this thing picks up ink off a

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.580 
got to so this thing picks up ink off a
printing<00:04:31.740> plate<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.940> burn<00:04:33.570> your<00:04:33.780> design<00:04:34.140> into

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
printing plate you burn your design into

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.190 
printing plate you burn your design into
a<00:04:34.620> at<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.160> etch<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.370> into<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.090> plate<00:04:36.540> like<00:04:37.080> an

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
a at you etch it into a plate like an

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.440 
a at you etch it into a plate like an
old-fashioned<00:04:37.800> printing<00:04:38.100> plate<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:39.210> then

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
old-fashioned printing plate and then

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.130 
old-fashioned printing plate and then
you<00:04:39.480> squeegee<00:04:40.140> ink<00:04:40.380> into<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.000> depressions

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
you squeegee ink into the depressions

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.350 
you squeegee ink into the depressions
with<00:04:43.140> a<00:04:43.169> metal<00:04:43.560> squeegee<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.970> that's<00:04:45.150> what's

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
with a metal squeegee so that's what's

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.600 
with a metal squeegee so that's what's
inked<00:04:45.720> right<00:04:46.050> where<00:04:46.230> your<00:04:46.380> design<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.890> and

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
inked right where your design is and

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.590 
inked right where your design is and
then<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:48.780> pad<00:04:49.110> comes<00:04:49.770> down<00:04:50.040> and<00:04:50.550> picks<00:04:51.150> up

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
then this pad comes down and picks up

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.130 
then this pad comes down and picks up
squishes<00:04:52.500> picks<00:04:52.800> up<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.130> design<00:04:54.080> now<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
squishes picks up the design now the

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.610 
squishes picks up the design now the
inks<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.620> here<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:57.660> comes<00:04:57.870> across<00:04:58.169> and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
inks on here and it comes across and

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.000 
inks on here and it comes across and
then<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.400> goes<00:04:59.550> down<00:04:59.580> and<00:05:00.240> by<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.200> while<00:05:01.800> it's

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
then it goes down and by that while it's

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.440 
then it goes down and by that while it's
coming<00:05:02.340> across<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.900> material<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:04.500> drying<00:05:05.450> so

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
coming across the material is drying so

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.190 
coming across the material is drying so
it<00:05:06.600> gets<00:05:06.780> sticky

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
it gets sticky

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.770 
it gets sticky
you<00:05:07.560> know<00:05:07.650> how<00:05:07.770> stuff<00:05:08.010> gets<00:05:08.220> attacking<00:05:08.780> well

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
you know how stuff gets attacking well

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.210 
you know how stuff gets attacking well
it's<00:05:09.960> special<00:05:10.350> ink<00:05:10.560> it's<00:05:11.340> tacky<00:05:11.910> in<00:05:12.810> like<00:05:13.470> that

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
it's special ink it's tacky in like that

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.600 
it's special ink it's tacky in like that
much<00:05:14.400> time<00:05:15.140> so<00:05:16.140> it<00:05:16.530> goes<00:05:16.740> from<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:17.070> well<00:05:17.280> to

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
much time so it goes from the well to

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.480 
much time so it goes from the well to
the<00:05:18.419> wheel<00:05:18.570> about<00:05:18.840> like<00:05:19.050> that<00:05:19.229> and<00:05:19.560> by<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
the wheel about like that and by the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.730 
the wheel about like that and by the
time<00:05:20.669> it<00:05:20.850> gets<00:05:20.970> there<00:05:21.120> it's<00:05:21.450> tacky<00:05:21.930> enough<00:05:22.050> to

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
time it gets there it's tacky enough to

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.370 
time it gets there it's tacky enough to
stick<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.220> wheel<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:24.630> it<00:05:24.720> comes<00:05:24.960> off<00:05:25.140> on

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
stick to the wheel and it comes off on

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.230 
stick to the wheel and it comes off on
the<00:05:25.500> wheel

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
the wheel

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.870 
the wheel
so<00:05:26.960> this<00:05:27.110> is<00:05:27.229> like<00:05:27.380> a<00:05:27.410> transfer<00:05:28.810> pad<00:05:29.810> it's<00:05:30.880> it's

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
so this is like a transfer pad it's it's

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.520 
so this is like a transfer pad it's it's
really<00:05:32.120> smell<00:05:32.539> it<00:05:32.690> is<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:32.990> only<00:05:33.139> place<00:05:33.380> you're

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
really smell it is the only place you're

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.219 
really smell it is the only place you're
going<00:05:33.650> to<00:05:33.710> smell<00:05:33.889> VOCs<00:05:34.460> it's<00:05:35.180> because<00:05:35.569> the

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
going to smell VOCs it's because the

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.409 
going to smell VOCs it's because the
reason<00:05:36.500> it's<00:05:36.620> getting<00:05:36.889> tacky<00:05:37.160> is<00:05:38.030> because

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
reason it's getting tacky is because

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.689 
reason it's getting tacky is because
those<00:05:38.690> there's<00:05:39.139> solvent<00:05:39.620> in<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.949> ink<00:05:40.130> it's

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
those there's solvent in the ink it's

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.180 
those there's solvent in the ink it's
exploding<00:05:41.509> out<00:05:41.660> of<00:05:41.840> there<00:05:41.990> if<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.710> can<00:05:42.889> see<00:05:42.919> it

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
exploding out of there if you can see it

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.450 
exploding out of there if you can see it
the<00:05:43.430> molecules<00:05:44.150> would<00:05:44.419> be<00:05:44.569> like<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:44.930> geyser

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
the molecules would be like that geyser

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.100 
the molecules would be like that geyser
it's<00:05:46.460> coming<00:05:46.819> out<00:05:46.940> so<00:05:47.210> fast<00:05:47.479> as<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:47.930> comes

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
it's coming out so fast as it comes

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.559 
it's coming out so fast as it comes
across<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:49.430> it<00:05:49.580> gets<00:05:49.729> tacky<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.300> that's<00:05:50.419> what

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
across so it gets tacky and that's what

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.110 
across so it gets tacky and that's what
makes<00:05:50.750> it<00:05:50.840> work<00:05:51.280> they<00:05:52.280> do<00:05:52.460> one<00:05:52.639> color<00:05:52.849> at<00:05:53.060> a

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
makes it work they do one color at a

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:10.400 
makes it work they do one color at a
time

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.140 

all<00:06:11.410> right<00:06:11.650> that<00:06:12.250> concludes<00:06:12.370> the<00:06:12.699> tour

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
all right that concludes the tour

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.460 
all right that concludes the tour
thank<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:13.600> George<00:06:13.720> Powell<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.199> everybody

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
thank you George Powell and everybody

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.610 
thank you George Powell and everybody
skate<00:06:14.740> one<00:06:14.949> okay<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:19.139> if<00:06:20.139> you<00:06:20.169> look<00:06:20.410> closely

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
skate one okay and if you look closely

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.330 
skate one okay and if you look closely
you<00:06:20.919> can<00:06:20.949> see<00:06:21.220> an<00:06:21.340> indentation<00:06:21.790> on<00:06:22.090> both<00:06:22.330> ends

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
you can see an indentation on both ends

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.400 
you can see an indentation on both ends
where<00:06:24.340> it<00:06:24.370> was<00:06:24.550> on<00:06:24.580> the<00:06:24.729> press<00:06:25.120> that<00:06:25.960> tells<00:06:26.229> us

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
where it was on the press that tells us

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.070 
where it was on the press that tells us
this<00:06:26.620> center<00:06:26.949> line<00:06:27.160> so<00:06:28.150> we<00:06:28.300> have<00:06:28.449> two<00:06:28.720> Center

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
this center line so we have two Center

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.010 
this center line so we have two Center
lines<00:06:29.290> for<00:06:29.770> drilling
