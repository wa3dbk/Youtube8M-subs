00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello, youtube scrap metal band 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.760
 here who speaks in Tuscany the purpose of this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.690
 video is to complete the part of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.730
 armament dealing with item maintenance 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 I have here some of the instruments 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.160
 for cleaning and maintenance of weapons and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.590
 I wanted to introduce you to not 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.720
 new to most but there are 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 those who are unaware that there are kits 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.070
 for cleaning and maintenance of a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.610
 weaponry 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.010
 these items usually comes a rod 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.969
 that in the case of a pistol obviously 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.940
 a thicker rod and but shorter 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:54.629
 you ride're thinking find and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.899
 end of these rods is that you 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.210
 fix a tip 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:05.729
 in fact comes three tips in this 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.500
 equipment and you alternate a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.340
 with the other 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.790
 the ends are usually those one 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.470
 cloth serving for you to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.810
 clean and pass a powder solvent 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.090
 something for a company more 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.100
 net of literally washing and two 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.250
 types of brush with a brush that is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.040
 made with fibrous material looks like a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.079
 horsehair similar thing 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.939
 perhaps this is another type of 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.700
 and it looks like a brush with 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.689
 horsehair can get through 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.869
 inside the barrel and can also do 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.700
 a deeper brushing with a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.840
 steel brush 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.610
 this steel or metal brush 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.049
 I think it must be made of brass to be 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.240
 more accurate 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.329
 you can do the cleaning that's what 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.130
 It's smart, the hand is hard. 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.680
 the products that are usually passed 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.100
 at the time of the maintenance of a weapon 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.590
 It depends of course the largest water type 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.590
 for example where it has a connotation of 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.080
 lead powders and other things 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.230
 type you need to use a 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.300
 product mix 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.690
 this combination normally includes these 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.980
 ten items here the lubricating oil should 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.480
 be kept out of the reach of children. 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:44.010
 with second is here and this is the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.770
 solvent of people who granted this 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.710
 dose here of test solvent 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.170
 A friend of mine , Daniel. 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.930
 Thank you Daniel if one day you will videos 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.540
 They were that I really liked the present. 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.180
 he actually bought half a liter of 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 snake ice cream not in the united states 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.380
 and I brought was wearing very little the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.360
 His arms and I gave him a small glass 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.280
 I bought especially for them 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:19.050
 here is a certain flannel this panela is 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.390
 clean the lubricant for cleaning and 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.180
 Here a small brush used to 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.370
 you pass the oil or even odd by 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.890
 inside as you need to take 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.680
 gunpowder the end of a certain place 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.000
 in general the people will take it from the body 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.180
 gives here another plan that serves to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.830
 heavier cleaning we'll say like this 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.230
 details of such a plan 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.570
 is that the amount of gunpowder left 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.910
 depending on the amount of shots and is 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.190
 very big so you need cloth 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.080
 even this is normal we have 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.140
 I 'm waiting for my gun 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.090
 arrive in fact she is already in the store 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.450
 with what only the police strike is missing 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.280
 federal just released in mid no 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.580
 I look forward to having this equipment here 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.580
 anyway there are other types 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:18.400
 and sings instead of 2015 his team 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:22.390
 comes in a kind of iron 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.380
 twisted as school points in this case 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.390
 here the brush is only for it is not from 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.650
 brass is that material appeared with 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.020
 horsehair 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.180
 ok this is not part of any kit 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.370
 but I bought here for cleaning the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.410
 corner of my face my depression 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:44.440
 already this one especially my weapon 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.400
 Fire is a cbc 7022 God willing 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.690

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.270

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.260
