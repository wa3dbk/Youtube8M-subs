00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.330
 hello everyone to all it's morgane on 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.160
 finds himself talks of the last 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.540
 new maps brought by the house 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.889
 wolves so if you have not seen a 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.750
 I also did a video on the 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.160
 lair of poultry and on the yard of 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.869
 the widow so do not hesitate to go there 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.980
 take a walk and so this map the 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.110
 black shield down this is the one that I 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.579
 do not like in this dlc personally 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.200
 again this is my personal opinion 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.390
 you can have yours and do not need 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.250
 hesitate to express it in comment I 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.689
 do not like this map because I find 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.149
 that in its gameplay to the the same 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.290
 through the same flaws with a map 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.520
 as an asylum 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.489
 that is, we will end up 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.350
 finally in a hall fight 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.059
 in a face-to-face fight and all the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.910
 time in the same place it's a little bit 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.399
 pity I find it really too much 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.839
 centralized too much we tend to 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.620
 find all the time in the same 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.600
 situation 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.530
 which is not the case in both 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.149
 other matches I think we can 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.890
 really have a gaming experience 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.149
 varied during the game and I do not 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.429
 do not think it's the case on shield 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.440
 Black domination because I find myself 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.809
 that this is of course the best mode for 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.580
 play in pvp after that's my taste again 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.400
 once but in dominance 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.080
 the central point this kind of point 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.790
 who is besides on the outside is going 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.190
 really change all the time of tomorrow 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.080
 a little bit like the point b / asylum that 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.340
 really going to be the same principle is 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.720
 finally the other two points go 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.520
 to be captured a little bit 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.900
 each team to a point and then that's 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.850
 like that and then we focus 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.530
 on the center so it's a little bit 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.510
 damage even between the points to try 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.580
 we are finally in 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.740
 a corridor really we have a small 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.720
 platform above an author who is going 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.610
 to do that we will just cross there 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.620
 but it's really a gameplay that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.210
 personally I do not like at all 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.580
 from personal title shot what am I trying 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.790
 to do that is to break that 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.100
 dynamic of this rigid gameplay a little 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.970
 little and leave in others others 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.500
 places on the map 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.910
 it's a bit I think what it takes 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.550
 do it when it's like that a bit like 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.560
 on asylum not to remain at the level of 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.840
 point b face to face the two corridors 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.040
 it's true it's between is I find it 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.900
 a little bit a little bit like 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.220
 not very interesting gameplay and 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.230
 by the way for that, I got 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.060
 found in some parts had 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.280
 precisely from the campers to snipers this 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.260
 which makes me confirm that the map does not have 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.580
 necessarily been well designed on that plane 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.840
 of course he can not predict everything a 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.850
 spray it's up to the players not to do 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.960
 it's not to have this behavior 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.210
 when the maps are well done 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.710
 does not arrive and it's quite pleasant 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.000
 can not prevent players from playing 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.500
 as it had recovered it's not 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.300
 forbidden it's not it's not the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.770
 cheating it's very annoying it's very 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.360
 annoying but it's not necessarily very 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.760
 pleasant in my opinion even for themselves 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.500
 if they make a good score but everything 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.450
 at least the map allows it so 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.350
 some do it and so on this map 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.940
 I ended up with 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.370
 campers at the sniper precisely in this 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.320
 open area outside and it was 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.260
 rather very unpleasant and not very 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.090
 interesting at the fun level of play at 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.680
 level of design since I told you 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.330
 that I loved the heart of the wave 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.560
 like I do not think she 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.240
 catch up on this map 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.700
 it's a brand that's going on so 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.950
 phobos one so next to march so 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.960
 the universe is March and we have nothing 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.790
 very very interesting on this map at 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.530
 final we have something very very 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.880
 common nothing innovative compared 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.550
 precisely to the universe of March 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.590
 nothing special we have no points 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.630
 remarkable as one might have on 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.700
 on the other maps so really a 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.340
 disappointment on this map personally 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.130
 once again it's my personal taste 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.110
 I hope that has allowed you to have a good 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.090
 cost overview of this map and strait 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.520
 my part because suddenly I finished I 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.800
 you have presented the three maps so a 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.210
 map with a very good gameplay the landmark 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.010
 thieves a matte with a very good 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.870
 design the heart of the wave and a map 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.660
 rather disappointing of this one the shield 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.430
 black this is my opinion cast the vote in 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.010
 comments especially do not hesitate 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.600
 do not hesitate to share to like a 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.890
 commented and we find ourselves very quickly 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.640
 for many other things on the chain 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.640
 and on the stream
