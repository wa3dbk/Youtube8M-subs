in Bergen County New Jersey I just

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.320 
in Bergen County New Jersey I just
wanted<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.010> take<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.190> few<00:00:20.460> minutes<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.910> explain

the three main types of synthetic
decking<00:00:23.700> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> market<00:00:24.240> today

decking on the market today

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.890 
decking on the market today
the<00:00:26.340> first<00:00:26.580> type<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.180> oldest<00:00:27.570> type<00:00:27.720> of

the first type and the oldest type of
decking<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> composite<00:00:29.099> decking<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> know

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
decking is composite decking now I know

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.390 
decking is composite decking now I know
the<00:00:30.300> word<00:00:30.529> composite<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.890> throwing<00:00:32.279> around

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
the word composite is throwing around

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.060 
the word composite is throwing around
kind<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:32.910> Kleenex<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:33.930> tissues<00:00:34.260> when

surface of the board you'll see that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.370

more expensive than a composite board is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.290

but<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> nicer<00:02:11.640> aesthetic<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
but you get a nicer aesthetic and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.800 
but you get a nicer aesthetic and
perhaps<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.900> best<00:02:13.110> part<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:14.810> it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
perhaps the best part of it is that it

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.839 
perhaps the best part of it is that it
wears<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.530> cools<00:02:16.740> very<00:02:17.040> easily

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
wears and it cools very easily

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.280 
wears and it cools very easily
because<00:02:18.270> there's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.660 
cling to and from the mold and the
