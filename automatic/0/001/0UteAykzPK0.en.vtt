00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
better now for the feather start by

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.240 
better now for the feather start by
making<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.690> circle<00:03:11.870> line<00:03:12.200> as<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.680> stem<00:03:12.920> and

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
making a circle line as the stem and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.860 
making a circle line as the stem and
same<00:03:13.670> as<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:13.970> first<00:03:14.180> just<00:03:14.450> create<00:03:14.690> little

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
same as you first just create little

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.319 
same as you first just create little
strokes<00:03:15.350> coming<00:03:15.799> out<00:03:15.920> from<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.340> stem<00:03:16.910> and

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
strokes coming out from the stem and

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.150 
strokes coming out from the stem and
again<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.870> definitely<00:03:18.410> use<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.799> toothpick

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
again you can definitely use a toothpick

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.949 
again you can definitely use a toothpick
for<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.579> because<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:20.090> doesn't<00:03:20.420> have<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.810> be

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
for this because it doesn't have to be

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.650 
for this because it doesn't have to be
