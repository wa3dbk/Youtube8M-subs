00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
samsung galaxy help and of course the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.680 
samsung galaxy help and of course the
galaxy<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.150> went<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.450> sleep

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
galaxy just went to sleep

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.500 
galaxy just went to sleep
okay<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.620> do<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.460> have<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.820> infrared<00:02:45.090> plugged

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
okay I do not have the infrared plugged

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.830 
okay I do not have the infrared plugged
and<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.840> plugs<00:02:46.020> into<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.590> headphone<00:02:46.860> jack<00:02:47.840> but

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
and it plugs into the headphone jack but

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.000 
and it plugs into the headphone jack but
the<00:02:49.260> thing<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:51.440> thought<00:02:52.440> people<00:02:52.500> should

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the thing that I thought people should

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.600 
the thing that I thought people should
see<00:02:53.400> or<00:02:53.760> hear<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:58.100> hopefully<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.400> hear

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
see or hear and hopefully you can hear

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:18.230 
see or hear and hopefully you can hear
that<00:03:14.570> so<00:03:15.570> this<00:03:15.690> thing<00:03:15.990> works<00:03:16.290> by<00:03:17.160> putting<00:03:17.970> a

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
that so this thing works by putting a

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.650 
that so this thing works by putting a
sound<00:03:18.710> onto<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:22.250> chip<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.520> I'm<00:03:23.940> guessing<00:03:24.540> it

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
sound onto the chip and I'm guessing it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.140 
sound onto the chip and I'm guessing it
works<00:03:24.930> very<00:03:25.260> similar<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.130> let's<00:03:26.550> see<00:03:26.700> if<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:26.910> can

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
works very similar to let's see if I can

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.290 
works very similar to let's see if I can
find<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.660> real<00:03:27.810> fast<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:32.220> course<00:03:32.610> not<00:03:32.910> why

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
find it real fast of course not why

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.240 
find it real fast of course not why
isn't<00:03:33.750> anything<00:03:34.020> ever<00:03:34.290> where<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:34.650> want<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.070> to

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
isn't anything ever where I want it to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:48.010 
isn't anything ever where I want it to
be<00:03:40.100> yes<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.340> know<00:03:41.400> oh<00:03:43.220> where<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.250> heck<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.130 

I<00:03:48.110> do<00:03:48.770> serial<00:03:49.400> output<00:03:51.100> which<00:03:52.100> if<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.720> listen

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
I do serial output which if you listen

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:02.850 
I do serial output which if you listen
to<00:03:54.260> this

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:15.759 

so<00:04:03.490> if<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.850> go<00:04:06.540> something<00:04:07.540> like<00:04:08.400> 56

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:26.020 

let's<00:04:16.190> try<00:04:16.400> 19200

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.340 

okay<00:04:26.780> let's<00:04:27.200> drop<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:28.120> thing<00:04:29.120> down<00:04:29.450> and<00:04:29.870> let's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
okay let's drop the thing down and let's

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.380 
okay let's drop the thing down and let's
go

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
go

00:04:31.390 --> 00:05:02.480 
go
300<00:04:32.390> baht<00:04:35.470> 300<00:04:40.420> okay<00:04:41.420> why<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.350> that<00:04:42.470> working

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.310 

anyway<00:05:03.490> I'm<00:05:04.240> guessing<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.840> works<00:05:05.020> something

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
anyway I'm guessing it works something

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.130 
anyway I'm guessing it works something
similar<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.010> that<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:08.650> I'm<00:05:08.710> going<00:05:08.920> to<00:05:10.140> plug

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
similar to that so I'm going to plug

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.350 
similar to that so I'm going to plug
this<00:05:11.350> in<00:05:11.680> I'm<00:05:12.280> going<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.610> turn<00:05:12.820> it<00:05:12.970> on<00:05:13.090> first

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
this in I'm going to turn it on first

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.550 
this in I'm going to turn it on first
there's<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.720> little<00:05:13.960> on/off<00:05:14.470> switch<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:16.560> plug

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
there's a little on/off switch and plug

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.920 
there's a little on/off switch and plug
it<00:05:17.770> into<00:05:17.920> the<00:05:20.160> shirts<00:05:21.160> in<00:05:21.370> there

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:38.480 

restart<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.110> desktop<00:05:27.300> pets<00:05:28.300> app<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:33.220> I

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.960 

crashed<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.880> pet

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:06:00.370 

it's<00:05:45.420> real<00:05:45.780> hard<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.110> use<00:05:46.410> with<00:05:46.770> one<00:05:46.980> hand

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.430
