00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
themselves aren't really that big I'm

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:10.380 
themselves aren't really that big I'm
only<00:02:53.900> standing<00:02:54.350> over<00:02:54.950> here<00:02:55.280> like<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:57.200> hill<00:02:57.500> up

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.699 

because<00:03:11.390> it's<00:03:11.569> an<00:03:11.690> easy<00:03:11.870> way<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.440> hill<00:03:12.620> up

okay<00:03:15.709> music<00:03:16.400> time

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:41.379 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:45.100 

so<00:05:42.379> despite<00:05:43.039> there<00:05:43.339> being<00:05:43.369> many<00:05:43.999> floors<00:05:44.479> the

so despite there being many floors the

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.469 
so despite there being many floors the
fours<00:05:45.550> themselves<00:05:46.550> are<00:05:46.699> actually<00:05:46.879> quite

fours themselves are actually quite

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.519 
fours themselves are actually quite
small<00:05:48.369> so<00:05:49.369> it<00:05:50.089> shouldn't<00:05:50.449> be<00:05:50.569> too<00:05:50.659> hard<00:05:51.349> of<00:05:51.469> a

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:51.529
