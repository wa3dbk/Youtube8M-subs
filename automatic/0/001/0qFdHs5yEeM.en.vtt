 ae 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:03.870
 ae 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.050
 ae 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.149
 ae 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.719
 The cheese cheese according to the proposals was seen as how people interact with 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:12.739
 the players 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.469
 but forgot something not 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.240
 I had already spoken to earlier manuscripts 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.010
 I want the bars with the pane still without number 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.769
 one of us are the characters that are 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.949
 if we look for everton not materials 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.180
 so U.S 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.180
 in memory we did not have that choice either talents 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 this is the following 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.510
 The actress talents each character stabbed to death 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.460
 around the world 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 for yesterday two people next year 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.210
 or not a drop 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.310
 1 with the format 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.770
 in the clashes ok this because 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.990
 we come back 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.130
 Valcke in Cariacica 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.110
 some talents 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 we have bigger talents here 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.840
 amin every character of doctor kraft 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 has 3 specialties 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.080
 however you have to choose one to play is not 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.940
 as we evolve from the outstanding level that 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.390
 we climb a little 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.490
 that in mind we can distribute 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 between the facilities 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.720
 in exchange d not have 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390
 the specialties you have 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.690
 It is estimated that 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.780
 Nothing is more than 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.410
 the player to racon 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.480
 the world in the animal is not why the teen singer pt called evil only by 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.630
 exchange issue 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.900
 a pair that made 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 The name dispenses with comments. 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.029
 yes, smart tv ready 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.059
 For those who like to play with 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.059
 does not have a ceiling is an honor a 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.159
 it's a she's the one specialty 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.060
 what does pt 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.959
 mosquito or animal 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.309
 but 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:29.919
 but the highlight is the owner of the shot 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.819
 does not have as many attacks to anacom 'shots' different attitudes 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.329
 so the focus of the damage is who gives the pt 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.639
 Hugo hunter ok last year 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.699
 we have the maximum 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:45.959
 mark coma 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.130
 marquinho 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.089
 the scheme is very good 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.839
 however have the pros and cons I will not go into too many details here 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.659
 at the time 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.389
 1 forward is that I have to think higher 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.289
 who is the year per second 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.459
 1 however 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.459
 as much as I really like to play 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.239
 had even thrilled 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.699
 1 our well neighborhood explains 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.710
 1 whenever I have spoken this goes with more in the moment 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.869
 for kings 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.869
 for that the best script and the maximum 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.769
 Okay, she has some. 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.149
 different smells like for human realities 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:33.190
 as the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.079
 the other strong team 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.079
 1 will be installed is also very jealous of the scenes 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.799
 deputy 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.589
 issued what happens 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.609
 1 there are only two types of damage 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.969
 there were no protests 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.969
 there is physical damage gone in Mexico 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.780
 magic damage, it is illustrated by a 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.589
 August or abortion 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:05.229
 pages 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.259
 meeting is used by all of the children's class 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.869
 e.g. paladin 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.869
 the fisherman 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.419
 Death Knight 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.719
 A gay out there is going 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:22.659
 yesterday 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:27.279
 and physical damage is improving ils for the better during this week with the 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.279
 maritime maximum 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.479
 the complainant gems 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.249
 to be dead in the feijoada 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.249
 the agents acting this subject was studied because 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.029
 as I already had a very good average of hashish 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.269
 and I also believe that he will soon die and spend a lot of money 

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:46.700
 with new years 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.379
 part of these reserves 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.289
 1 I decided 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.099
 gemma is not 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.120
 Ah why periodic razor 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.210
 nobody prepared and only for us 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.320
 and would require one indicated by physical damages we can not only then 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.150
 my grandmother and the game chip 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.030
 walls that absorb lion ok treat well perceived in the pib 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.339
 slightly smaller 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:15.719
 in q1 but a little more human last time not but anyway it's a 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.550
 pretty powerful woman back 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.440
 and it's an interesting thing that kinds of sports that are full of positives okay 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.569
 I really like 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.800
 so each character has 3 news 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.479
 I marked 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.809
 So 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:40.150
 the singer also has the support of pt 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.569
 what is destroyed 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.759
 the noble of the building of the animal 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.479
 other players do not have 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.470
 others have almost no 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.330
 this option 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.020
 these 15 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.460
 I can play with a player by playing with only one woman at a time 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.400
 you can 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.400
 we tried character 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.529
 I go a lot at night. 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.180
 70 points 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.180
 if we do not talk if we try to build 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.099
 1 so I see in it you can throw 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.110
 I want here for example used 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.729
 15 points I'm so alone 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.729
 15 points 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.509
 and with others the printed and paid text 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.400
 because this will put a very good light on 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.550
 She's focused on this trap, he says. 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.240
 no mobilization tickets at times 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.759
 d already the pasep must have 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.169
 green lantern premiere 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.729
 1 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:52.439
 in the decision 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.439
 is a very interesting light I like cases taken with the fingers 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.039
 I'll show you that we have to make chocolate. 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.849
 OK 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.830
 there is something also called experts 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.159
 eclipse 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.749
 9th 

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:20.210
 nothing is more 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.740
 than 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.020
 some years explain 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.480
 The man ended up talking to you, they have clicks to the mayor. 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.940
 we have here myths that are structures that we put in the character 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:41.819
 we are three as there was 83 large and three small we have small 

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:43.479
 the lazy samba-plot 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:45.240
 when will I buy 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.540
 with the production buy three months ago 

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.619
 but I always put the platforms of states that one loves 

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:55.159
 the fiction forget that we can put the character for what improved 

00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:57.770
 the attacks or 

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.180
 the 7 why
