00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 right to an explosion of more sick 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 in addition to follow me on 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.200
 facebook on twitter on youporn at 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.540
 watch my videos and share reli 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.170
 kennedy cops and sent checks from 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.609
 500 euros the perfect thing what except 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.930
 this is not the case and you are especially 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.430
 more and more numerous than a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.279
 cogging is addressing you girls the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.019
 people who do not have a penis 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 normally brief so I was saying that you 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.540
 are more and more of us 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:41.610
 ask that same question that looks 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:44.850
 vampire diaries I like tailoring if 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.360
 I have a poster of season 3 pasted under 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.039
 my door 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 it's really because I have a good 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.570
 reason so think about two minutes 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 before asking mail questions 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 to answer the related questions I 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 do the movies well quotation marks for 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.680
 well show that I say annex between 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.850
 quotation marks I think of people cons 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.289
 with his fingers to show that we are doing 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.000
 in quotation marks but I do it when 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.430
 yes it's not quite normal since 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.890
 when I'm not normal I'm 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.549
 a madman and say that I have a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.950
 social life 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.540
