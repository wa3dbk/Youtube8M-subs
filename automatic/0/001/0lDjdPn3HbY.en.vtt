00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.110 
instead you could use the drum set from
those<00:02:42.360> games<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.100> just<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.250> know<00:02:44.310> reenact

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
those games and just you know reenact

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.340 
those games and just you know reenact
scenes<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:45.870> favorite<00:02:46.290> movie<00:02:47.160> drumline

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
scenes from your favorite movie drumline

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.790 
scenes from your favorite movie drumline
so<00:02:49.350> yeah<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.250> game<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.550> flawed<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.800> it's

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
so yeah the game is flawed because it's

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.970 
so yeah the game is flawed because it's
trying<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.430> throw<00:02:54.390> anything<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.709> Nick

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980

Cannon has done in his career I mean
what<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> damn<00:02:59.280> waste<00:02:59.550> I<00:03:01.010> mean<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.190> damn<00:03:02.400> dude

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
too late way to go Nick so the game is

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.860 
too late way to go Nick so the game is
not<00:03:10.950> even<00:03:11.190> being<00:03:11.310> socialist<00:03:11.970> as<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.180> football
