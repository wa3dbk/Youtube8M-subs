plugs<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> 2003<00:00:14.880> 3.8<00:00:15.599> liter<00:00:15.809> v6<00:00:16.320> Mustang<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
plugs on a 2003 3.8 liter v6 Mustang I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.630 
plugs on a 2003 3.8 liter v6 Mustang I
looked<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.670> over<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.970> internet<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.640> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
looked all over the internet and I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.160 
looked all over the internet and I
couldn't<00:00:20.880> find<00:00:21.060> anything<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> decided

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
couldn't find anything so I decided

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.390 
couldn't find anything so I decided
screw<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.250> myself

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
screw it I'm going to do it myself

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880 
screw it I'm going to do it myself
figure<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.119> out<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.330> my<00:00:24.359> own<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:25.320> show

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
figure it out on my own and then show

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470 
figure it out on my own and then show
you<00:00:25.949> guys<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> video<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.090> few<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
you guys the video of a few of the

you guys the video of a few of the
things<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> came<00:00:27.990> across<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.740> was

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
things that I came across when I was

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.040 
things that I came across when I was
doing<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:29.910> what<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
doing that now what I'm going to do is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.500

I'm<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> change<00:00:32.399> them<00:00:32.730> right<00:00:33.390> in

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I'm not going to change them right in

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
I'm not going to change them right in
front<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.200> I've<00:00:34.829> already<00:00:35.010> done

as<00:00:40.920> getting<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.700> job<00:00:41.969> done<00:00:42.030> now<00:00:42.960> I'm

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
as getting this job done now I'm

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
as getting this job done now I'm
assuming<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.370> all<00:00:44.399> guys<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:45.090> how<00:00:45.270> spark

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
assuming you all guys know how spark

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.060 
assuming you all guys know how spark
plugs<00:00:45.899> work<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> why<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:46.590> need<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> be

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
plugs work and why they need to be

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.690 
plugs work and why they need to be
changed<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.469> etc<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.680> stuff<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
changed and etc and stuff like that I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
changed and etc and stuff like that I
don't<00:00:51.059> I'm<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.420> don't<00:00:51.690> need<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:51.989> through

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
don't I'm not I don't need to go through

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:08.620 
don't I'm not I don't need to go through
that<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.370> show<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.579> guys<00:01:07.400> a

that I'm just going to show you guys a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
that I'm just going to show you guys a
wrench<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.260> really<00:01:10.530> helpful<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.100> have

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
wrench and it really helpful to have

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.490 
wrench and it really helpful to have
this<00:01:11.460> disc<00:01:12.060> level<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.930> helps<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> lot

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
this disc level on it that helps a lot

couple of the things that I came across

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.069 
couple of the things that I came across
when<00:01:58.350> doing<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:59.549> just<00:02:00.079> accessibility

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
when doing this was just accessibility

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.990 
when doing this was just accessibility
is<00:02:01.290> pretty<00:02:01.590> difficult<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.130> me<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.549> my<00:02:02.790> arm

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
is pretty difficult for me to get my arm

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.969 
is pretty difficult for me to get my arm
and<00:02:03.149> reach<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.829> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and reach it down there because as you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
and reach it down there because as you
can<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.490> things<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.939> kind<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.270> tucked

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
can see these things are kind of tucked

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
can see these things are kind of tucked
away<00:02:07.259> pretty<00:02:07.710> far<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> back<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.509> it

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
away pretty far in the back there it

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.559 
away pretty far in the back there it
feels<00:02:09.720> pretty<00:02:09.989> difficult

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
feels pretty difficult

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.679 
feels pretty difficult
I<00:02:10.629> had<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.879> disconnect<00:02:12.879> this<00:02:12.999> little<00:02:13.329> guy<00:02:13.480> right

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689

here<00:02:14.049> and<00:02:14.349> then<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.519> just<00:02:15.730> push<00:02:16.359> it<00:02:16.480> over<00:02:16.719> to<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
here and then I just push it over to the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.839 
here and then I just push it over to the
side<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.469> order<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.769> get<00:02:17.920> my<00:02:18.129> arm<00:02:18.280> back<00:02:18.549> there

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
side in order to get my arm back there

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.170 
side in order to get my arm back there
and<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.019> where<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.290> 9/16<00:02:21.069> saw<00:02:21.370> wrench<00:02:21.969> or

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
ratchet came into play and then the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.640 
ratchet came into play and then the
flathead<00:02:25.180> screw<00:02:25.450> driver<00:02:25.480> had<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.290> take<00:02:26.620> a
