Minecraft now I believe with the Steve
skin<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.950> also<00:00:38.070> animates<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> face<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.969> facial

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
skin it also animates the face of facial

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.500 
skin it also animates the face of facial
expressions<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.200> everything<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.329> such<00:00:42.329> as

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
expressions and everything but I such as

expressions and everything but I such as
moving<00:00:42.750> eyes<00:00:43.110> depending<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.800> where<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
moving eyes depending on where the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
moving eyes depending on where the
player<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.280> looking<00:00:44.820> yeah<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.840> play<00:00:45.989> opens

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

panting<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.050> eyebrows<00:00:49.950> become<00:00:50.780> sad<00:00:51.780> when

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
panting and eyebrows become sad when

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.529 
panting and eyebrows become sad when
hungry<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.620> confident<00:00:53.250> /<00:00:53.489> angry<00:00:53.789> when<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
hungry or confident / angry when I

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.900 
hungry or confident / angry when I
aggressive<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.530> we've<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.129> got<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.309> model<00:00:56.730> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
aggressive so we've not got that model I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
aggressive so we've not got that model I
don't<00:00:57.210> believe<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.780> skin<00:00:58.109> anyway<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.100> I'm

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
don't believe on this skin anyway so I'm

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.310 
don't believe on this skin anyway so I'm
guessing<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
guessing for now that it is just on the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.009 
guessing for now that it is just on the
Steve<00:01:01.620> model<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.629> still<00:01:03.809> adds

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
Steve model but so in this it still adds

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.250 
Steve model but so in this it still adds
a<00:01:04.409> ton<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> stuff<00:01:04.890> regardless<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.519> them

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
a ton of stuff regardless of them

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.600 
a ton of stuff regardless of them
regardless<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.470> having<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> Steve<00:01:07.979> skin<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.430> not

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
regardless of having a Steve skin or not

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.640 
regardless of having a Steve skin or not

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
resistance this is so it looks

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.520 
resistance this is so it looks

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
perspective but it just changed a third

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.550 
perspective but it just changed a third
person<00:02:21.940> there<00:02:22.600> we<00:02:22.690> go<00:02:22.810> actually<00:02:23.200> looks<00:02:23.380> like

person there we go actually looks like

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.140 
person there we go actually looks like

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
drinking it I believe it also does it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.610

for<00:02:29.980> creeper<00:02:30.760> heads<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.270> just<00:02:32.020> general<00:02:32.350> hats

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
for creeper heads and just general hats

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.070 
for creeper heads and just general hats
in<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.040> game<00:02:33.220> now<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:34.030> my<00:02:34.150> creeper<00:02:34.600> looks

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
in the game now for my creeper looks

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.720 
in the game now for my creeper looks
like<00:02:35.200> we've<00:02:35.350> got<00:02:35.380> ya<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> monobrow<00:02:36.490> like<00:02:36.700> a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
like we've got ya like a monobrow like a

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.460 
like we've got ya like a monobrow like a
unibrow<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.210> kind<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.780> going<00:02:38.020> across<00:02:38.170> there

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
unibrow and kind of going across there

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.350 
unibrow and kind of going across there
and<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:39.040> doesn't<00:02:39.310> look<00:02:39.400> very<00:02:39.430> nice<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.150> I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and that doesn't look very nice so I

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000 
and that doesn't look very nice so I
don't<00:02:40.870> believe<00:02:40.990> there's<00:02:41.080> any<00:02:41.290> animation<00:02:41.890> for

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
don't believe there's any animation for

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.400 
don't believe there's any animation for
that<00:02:42.130> as<00:02:42.250> well<00:02:42.280> but<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:43.210> does<00:02:43.420> change<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.290> for

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
that as well but it does change it for

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.020 
that as well but it does change it for
the<00:02:44.470> way<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.680> move<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.190> everything<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.670> gonna

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the way you move and everything I gonna

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the way you move and everything I gonna
show<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.270> what<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.510> means<00:02:46.600> if<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.870> got<00:02:47.020> a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
show you what it means if you got a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.170 
show you what it means if you got a
helmet<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.470> when<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.280> crouch<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.850> helmet

helmet on when you crouch the helmet

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.490 
helmet on when you crouch the helmet
actually<00:02:49.480> moves<00:02:49.720> with<00:02:49.900> your<00:02:50.020> character<00:02:50.470> and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
actually moves with your character and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.100 
actually moves with your character and

the<00:03:40.030> coolest<00:03:40.450> thing<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.750> think<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:41.200> with<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the coolest thing I think is with the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
the coolest thing I think is with the
bell<00:03:41.800> so<00:03:42.790> with<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.390> bell<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.290> hold<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.770> it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
bell so with the bell if you hold it it

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.180 
bell so with the bell if you hold it it
doesn't<00:03:45.910> look<00:03:45.940> any<00:03:46.270> different<00:03:46.830> from<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.980> back

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
doesn't look any different from the back

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.400 
doesn't look any different from the back
or<00:03:48.550> from<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.000> front<00:03:49.300> but<00:03:49.630> if<00:03:50.290> you're

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
or from the front but if you're

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.280 
or from the front but if you're
crouching<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.100> doing<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.490> it<00:03:52.300> your<00:03:52.810> character

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
crouching and doing it it your character

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.080 
crouching and doing it it your character
is<00:03:53.320> actually<00:03:53.860> kind<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.130> holding<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.820> Boeing

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090

actually<00:04:03.280> kind<00:04:03.640> of<00:04:03.670> pulls<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.030> string<00:04:04.240> back

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
actually kind of pulls the string back
