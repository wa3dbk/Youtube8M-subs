just<00:00:13.290> making<00:00:13.380> him<00:00:13.710> look<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> little<00:00:14.340> bit

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
just making him look like a little bit

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.460 
just making him look like a little bit
of<00:00:14.549> bitch<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:15.030> lot<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.049> fans<00:00:16.230> have<00:00:16.379> been

of bitch a lot of fans have been
speculating<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.070> maybe<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.550> was<00:00:17.640> another

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
speculating that maybe it was another

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.340

one<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> Quincy<00:00:18.480> who<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.020> ability

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
to transform into someone else and it

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.210

almost<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.760> little<00:00:26.880> too<00:00:27.029> easily<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.920> this

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
almost a little too easily and this

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.200 
almost a little too easily and this
week's<00:00:29.130> chapter<00:00:29.460> actually<00:00:29.760> opened<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.119> with

these brand new characters lloyd android
and<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.759> seems<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.090> strange<00:00:33.390> at<00:00:33.570> first<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.899> way

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and it seems so strange at first the way

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.299 
and it seems so strange at first the way
the<00:00:34.140> manga<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.680> opened<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.130> didn't

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

the manga actually opened up I didn't
even<00:00:35.370> think<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:35.880> bleach<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.360> first<00:00:36.600> but

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
even think it was bleach at first but

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.270 
even think it was bleach at first but
eventually<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.710> learned<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.129> are

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280

Halbach<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.129> quite<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.519> presence<00:03:09.090> he's<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.660> evil

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
Halbach is quite a presence he's so evil

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.479 
Halbach is quite a presence he's so evil
he<00:03:10.170> doesn't<00:03:10.379> even<00:03:10.440> care<00:03:10.739> about<00:03:10.859> Aizen<00:03:11.370> you

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
he doesn't even care about Aizen you

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.009 
he doesn't even care about Aizen you

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.410 
know he talks about Aizen like he's
nothing<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.069> i<00:03:14.099> think<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> pretty<00:03:15.209> big

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
nothing so i think that is a pretty big

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.940 
nothing so i think that is a pretty big
deal<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.900> just<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.319> fact<00:03:16.349> that<00:03:16.590> he<00:03:16.680> just

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
deal and just the fact that he just

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.220 
deal and just the fact that he just
wants<00:03:17.310> him<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.519> be<00:03:17.549> just<00:03:17.849> a<00:03:17.970> part<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.599> his<00:03:18.840> army

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
wants him to be just a part of his army

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.809 
wants him to be just a part of his army
really<00:03:19.500> i<00:03:19.530> think<00:03:19.680> speaks<00:03:20.069> in<00:03:20.160> volumes<00:03:20.459> for<00:03:20.700> his

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
really i think speaks in volumes for his

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.030 
really i think speaks in volumes for his
power<00:03:21.030> now<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.049> biggest<00:03:22.380> question<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:22.889> week

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
power now the biggest question this week

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.550 
power now the biggest question this week
is<00:03:23.190> yamamoto<00:03:24.030> going<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.359> be<00:03:24.450> killed<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.959> i

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
is yamamoto going to be killed and i

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.250 
is yamamoto going to be killed and i
think<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:26.669> i<00:03:26.910> think<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:28.079> first

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
think so i think this is just the first

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.440 
think so i think this is just the first
step<00:03:28.410> towards<00:03:29.160> his<00:03:29.310> death<00:03:29.579> i<00:03:29.790> think<00:03:30.329> it's

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
step towards his death i think it's

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.420 
step towards his death i think it's
important<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.870> his<00:03:31.079> character<00:03:31.260> dies<00:03:31.620> but

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
important that his character dies but

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.949 
important that his character dies but
you<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.819> that's<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.359> way<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.569> is<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.780> all

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
