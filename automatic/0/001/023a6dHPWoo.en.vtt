00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.629 
it definitely wasn't any farther than
the<00:03:56.329> liver<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.660> don't<00:03:56.900> think<00:03:57.169> but<00:03:57.530> we're<00:03:58.519> gonna

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
the liver I don't think but we're gonna

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.039 
the liver I don't think but we're gonna
go<00:03:58.790> check<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.120> trail<00:03:59.359> out<00:03:59.510> so<00:03:59.629> you<00:03:59.690> can<00:03:59.840> find

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
go check this trail out so you can find

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:07.680 
go check this trail out so you can find
him<00:04:00.910> jump<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> fence<00:04:02.269> right<00:04:02.569> here<00:04:02.629> I<00:04:03.849> just

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.300 

couldn't<00:04:08.690> really<00:04:08.810> find<00:04:09.139> any<00:04:09.379> blood<00:04:09.590> at<00:04:09.829> all<00:04:09.980> I

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
couldn't really find any blood at all I

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.780 
couldn't really find any blood at all I
found<00:04:10.790> two<00:04:11.150> little<00:04:11.389> specks<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.579> that's<00:04:13.579> where

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
found two little specks and that's where

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.670 
found two little specks and that's where
I<00:04:13.819> put<00:04:14.329> my<00:04:14.359> glove<00:04:14.750> before<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.260> left<00:04:15.500> this

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
I put my glove before I left this

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.610 
I put my glove before I left this
morning<00:04:15.739> only<00:04:16.579> followed<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.299> trail<00:04:17.599> he<00:04:18.139> ran

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
morning only followed the trail he ran

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.580 
morning only followed the trail he ran
oh<00:04:19.150> probably<00:04:20.150> 15<00:04:20.630> yards<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.109> then<00:04:21.199> I<00:04:21.229> stopped

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
oh probably 15 yards and then I stopped

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.230 
oh probably 15 yards and then I stopped
just<00:04:21.859> because<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.520> didn't<00:04:22.729> want<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:22.910> push<00:04:23.120> him

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
just because I didn't want to push him

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.939 
just because I didn't want to push him
or<00:04:23.419> anything<00:04:23.570> but<00:04:24.349> he<00:04:24.470> jumped<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.770> fence

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
or anything but he jumped the fence

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.890 
or anything but he jumped the fence
right<00:04:25.099> here<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.610> could<00:04:25.729> see<00:04:26.000> where<00:04:26.570> he<00:04:26.630> kicked

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
right here we could see where he kicked

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.830 
right here we could see where he kicked
up<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.080> leaves<00:04:27.410> running<00:04:28.099> through<00:04:28.310> here<00:04:28.460> so

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.150 

around<00:04:31.020> here<00:04:31.230> there's<00:04:31.410> not<00:04:31.560> really<00:04:31.710> any<00:04:31.919> blood

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
around here there's not really any blood

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.090 
around here there's not really any blood
so<00:04:32.540> just<00:04:33.540> kind<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.870> just<00:04:34.590> kind<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.889> got<00:04:35.070> to

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
so just kind of just kind of got to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.480 
so just kind of just kind of got to
think<00:04:35.940> like<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.120> deer<00:04:36.389> I<00:04:36.449> guess<00:04:37.250> we'll<00:04:38.250> follow

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
think like a deer I guess we'll follow

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.400 
think like a deer I guess we'll follow
this<00:04:38.699> trail<00:04:39.000> right<00:04:39.060> here<00:04:39.240> I'm<00:04:39.780> thinking<00:04:40.260> he

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
this trail right here I'm thinking he

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.590 
this trail right here I'm thinking he
probably<00:04:40.650> took<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.010> easiest<00:04:41.400> path<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:42.360> it's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
probably took the easiest path and it's

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.080 
probably took the easiest path and it's
slightly<00:04:42.870> downhill<00:04:43.169> right<00:04:43.590> here<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:44.100> I'll

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
slightly downhill right here so I'll

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.420 
slightly downhill right here so I'll
just<00:04:45.210> start<00:04:45.449> following<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.290> might<00:04:47.160> have<00:04:47.280> to

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
just start following and might have to

00:04:47.430 --> 00:05:04.590 
just start following and might have to
spread<00:04:47.669> out<00:04:47.850> in<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.030> minute<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.360> don't<00:04:48.419> know

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.190 

No

too<00:06:30.540> far<00:06:31.130> but<00:06:32.130> he<00:06:32.490> went<00:06:32.669> off<00:06:32.820> with<00:06:32.970> some<00:06:33.120> doves

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
later he came right out in my little

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.450 
later he came right out in my little
opening<00:06:39.720> and<00:06:39.870> I<00:06:40.110> shot<00:06:40.560> him<00:06:40.680> right<00:06:40.740> there<00:06:40.979> at<00:06:41.070> 14

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460
