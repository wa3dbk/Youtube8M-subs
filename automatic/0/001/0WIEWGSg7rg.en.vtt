cocoa<00:01:34.079> ball<00:01:34.320> shot<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.770> course<00:01:35.009> where<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.180> use

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
cocoa ball shot of course where we use

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.950 
cocoa ball shot of course where we use
cinema<00:01:36.630> 4d<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.880> first<00:01:38.880> track<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> shot<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
cinema 4d to first track the shot and

cinema 4d to first track the shot and
then<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.380> comped<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.250> using<00:01:41.670> shadows

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
then we comped it in using shadows

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.740 
then we comped it in using shadows
reflections<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.670> again<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.299> instead<00:01:45.659> of
