you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.189> ahead<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.520> throw<00:01:56.729> away<00:01:56.969> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you can go ahead and throw away that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.380 
you can go ahead and throw away that
that<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.469> piece<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.390> instructional

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that little piece of instructional

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.510 
that little piece of instructional
material<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.590> don't<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> keep<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> box

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
material you don't have to keep the box

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.899 
material you don't have to keep the box
I<00:02:02.939> don't<00:02:03.240> keep<00:02:03.390> my<00:02:03.450> harps<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> box<00:02:04.170> either

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
I don't keep my harps in the box either

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.459 
I don't keep my harps in the box either
but<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.210> point<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.320> you're

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
but the point is this is what you're

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.050 
but the point is this is what you're
paying<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.670> thing<00:02:08.879> that's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
paying for and this is the thing that's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.229 
paying for and this is the thing that's
really<00:02:09.509> quite<00:02:09.629> impressive<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.770> why<00:02:11.550> am<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.970> so

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
really quite impressive so why am I so

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.890 
really quite impressive so why am I so
impressed

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
impressed

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.059 
impressed
well<00:02:13.410> first

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
well first

off my litmus test for if I'm Monica's
maid<00:02:16.560> well<00:02:16.799> is<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.159> I<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.489> play<00:02:17.760> up<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.450> down

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
maid well is if I can play up and down

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
maid well is if I can play up and down
the<00:02:18.810> harp<00:02:19.019> with<00:02:19.499> as<00:02:19.739> minimal<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.489> breath

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the harp with as minimal a breath

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.119 
the harp with as minimal a breath
pressure<00:02:21.030> as<00:02:21.299> possible<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.079> have<00:02:22.439> the<00:02:22.650> harp

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
pressure as possible and have the harp

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.209 
pressure as possible and have the harp
respond<00:02:23.549> evenly<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.329> actually<00:02:24.689> fairly

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
respond evenly and actually fairly

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.280 
respond evenly and actually fairly
responsibly<00:02:26.219> so<00:02:26.579> that<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.879> can<00:02:27.120> hear<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.719> note

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
responsibly so that you can hear a note

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.059 
responsibly so that you can hear a note
and<00:02:28.499> you<00:02:28.560> don't<00:02:28.829> hear<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.819> whistling<00:02:30.659> of<00:02:30.810> air<00:02:31.139> as

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
and you don't hear a whistling of air as

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.910 
and you don't hear a whistling of air as
the<00:02:32.400> reed<00:02:32.579> refuses<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.719> respond<00:02:34.139> to<00:02:34.439> minimal

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the reed refuses to respond to minimal

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.649 
the reed refuses to respond to minimal
breath<00:02:35.159> pressure<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:35.969> let<00:02:36.120> me<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.329> do<00:02:36.510> that

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
breath pressure so let me just do that

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:53.229 
breath pressure so let me just do that
for<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.049> now

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.539 

so<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.629> literally<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.409> lowest<00:02:56.310> amount

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
so that is literally the lowest amount

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.330 
so that is literally the lowest amount
that<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.879> can<00:02:57.090> blow<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.659> you<00:02:58.139> hear<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.709> every

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
that I can blow and you hear that every

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.759 
that I can blow and you hear that every
single<00:02:59.519> reed<00:02:59.819> responded<00:03:00.359> both<00:03:00.540> draw<00:03:01.169> and<00:03:01.469> blow

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
single reed responded both draw and blow

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.920 
single reed responded both draw and blow
and<00:03:02.069> that's<00:03:02.819> something<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.389> I<00:03:03.419> find<00:03:03.750> is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
and that's something that I find is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.830 
and that's something that I find is
extraordinarily<00:03:04.889> rare<00:03:05.669> in<00:03:06.030> out-of-the-box

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
extraordinarily rare in out-of-the-box

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.629 
extraordinarily rare in out-of-the-box
harmonic<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.469> I<00:03:07.560> should<00:03:07.769> say<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.400> have

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
harmonic and I should say that I have

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.459 
harmonic and I should say that I have
not<00:03:08.819> even<00:03:08.939> taken<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.480> cover<00:03:09.810> plates<00:03:10.109> off<00:03:10.319> of

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
not even taken the cover plates off of

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.050 
not even taken the cover plates off of
this<00:03:10.650> thing<00:03:10.799> I<00:03:10.859> have<00:03:11.010> not<00:03:11.219> touched<00:03:11.489> your<00:03:11.760> screw

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
this thing I have not touched your screw

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
this thing I have not touched your screw
I've<00:03:12.299> not<00:03:12.870> messed<00:03:13.079> with<00:03:13.169> it<00:03:13.379> in<00:03:13.530> any<00:03:13.829> way<00:03:13.980> it's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
I've not messed with it in any way it's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.390 
I've not messed with it in any way it's
a<00:03:14.489> hundred<00:03:14.760> percent<00:03:15.109> stock<00:03:16.109> right<00:03:17.040> out<00:03:17.189> of<00:03:17.219> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
a hundred percent stock right out of the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.920 
a hundred percent stock right out of the
box<00:03:17.609> I've<00:03:17.879> only<00:03:18.030> had<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.269> for<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.509> date<00:03:18.750> or<00:03:18.900> two

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
box I've only had it for a date or two

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.170 
box I've only had it for a date or two
and<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.949> haven't<00:03:20.220> played<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.669> very<00:03:20.819> much<00:03:20.939> either

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
and I haven't played it very much either

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.869 
and I haven't played it very much either
so<00:03:21.560> right<00:03:22.560> off<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> bat<00:03:22.949> that<00:03:22.979> impressed

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
so right off the bat that impressed

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.020 
so right off the bat that impressed
impressed<00:03:24.720> me<00:03:25.139> because<00:03:25.319> typically<00:03:26.310> even<00:03:26.609> with

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
impressed me because typically even with

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.569 
impressed me because typically even with
the<00:03:27.239> best<00:03:27.449> hand<00:03:27.780> made<00:03:27.989> owners<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.040> sidles<00:03:29.400> I

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
the best hand made owners and sidles I

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.729 
the best hand made owners and sidles I
still<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.419> go<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.930> adjust<00:03:31.319> some<00:03:31.470> of

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
still have to go in and adjust some of

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.099 
still have to go in and adjust some of
the<00:03:31.979> reeds<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.669> they<00:03:32.819> respond<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.479> to<00:03:33.959> low

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
the reeds so that they respond to to low

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.530 
the reeds so that they respond to to low
breath<00:03:34.379> pressure<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.849> flip<00:03:36.269> side<00:03:36.329> of

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
breath pressure now the flip side of

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.300 
breath pressure now the flip side of
that<00:03:36.689> is<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.409> want<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.739> reed<00:03:37.919> to<00:03:38.129> not

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
that is that you want the reed to not

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.839 
that is that you want the reed to not
lock<00:03:39.269> up<00:03:39.540> when<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:40.019> blow<00:03:40.409> or<00:03:40.560> draw<00:03:40.769> hard<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.669> it

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
lock up when you blow or draw hard on it

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.670 
lock up when you blow or draw hard on it
so<00:03:42.329> let<00:03:42.569> me<00:03:42.599> just<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:43.169> a<00:03:43.199> couple<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.590> examples

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
so let me just do a couple of examples

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.219 
so let me just do a couple of examples
of<00:03:44.220> doing<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:45.000> technique<00:03:45.359> drawing<00:03:46.049> really

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
of doing that technique drawing really

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:58.720 
of doing that technique drawing really
hard

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.540 

so<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.420> reads<00:04:00.690> were<00:04:00.959> set<00:04:01.260> right<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.430> sweet

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
so the reads were set right in the sweet

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.449 
so the reads were set right in the sweet
spot<00:04:03.200> not<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.440> low<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.650> they<00:04:04.920> lock<00:04:05.130> when<00:04:05.370> you

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
spot not so low that they lock when you

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.090 
spot not so low that they lock when you
blow<00:04:05.640> high<00:04:05.850> but<00:04:06.450> not<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.020> high<00:04:07.290> up<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.709> they

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
blow high but not so high up that they

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.490

last thing that really impressed me is

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.289 
last thing that really impressed me is
that<00:04:16.350> I've<00:04:16.470> had<00:04:16.680> zero<00:04:16.859> luck<00:04:17.250> with<00:04:17.730> over<00:04:18.090> blows

let's<00:04:32.400> say<00:04:32.660> but<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.050> not<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.470> case<00:04:34.680> for

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
let's say but this is not the case for

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.520 
let's say but this is not the case for
the<00:04:35.010> hot<00:04:35.160> master<00:04:35.610> so<00:04:35.960> right<00:04:36.960> out<00:04:37.140> of<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.320> box

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.950 

ah<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:05.400> little<00:05:05.940> harder<00:05:06.240> for<00:05:06.270> me<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.540> get<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:06.870> the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
ah a little harder for me to get in the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.440 
ah a little harder for me to get in the
sweet<00:05:07.170> spot<00:05:07.470> but<00:05:07.740> once<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.700> get<00:05:08.910> it<00:05:09.000> there<00:05:09.240> I<00:05:09.270> can

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
sweet spot but once I get it there I can

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.020 
sweet spot but once I get it there I can
control<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.170> let's<00:05:10.890> go<00:05:11.130> down<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.790> two

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
control it let's go down to the two

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:21.530 
control it let's go down to the two
overblown<00:05:18.620> can't<00:05:19.620> do<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:20.330> that's<00:05:21.330> partially

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
overblown can't do it that's partially

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:30.230 
overblown can't do it that's partially
my<00:05:21.780> technique<00:05:22.230> let's<00:05:22.650> try<00:05:22.890> three<00:05:29.090> hard<00:05:30.090> to

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
my technique let's try three hard to

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.750 
my technique let's try three hard to
control<00:05:30.510> but<00:05:30.750> they're<00:05:31.310> actually<00:05:32.310> hard<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.490> get

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
control but they're actually hard to get

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.520 
control but they're actually hard to get
not<00:05:33.000> too<00:05:33.150> hard<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.390> control<00:05:33.570> once<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.110> came<00:05:34.260> out

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
not too hard to control once it came out

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.560 
not too hard to control once it came out
that's<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.370> little<00:05:35.520> bit<00:05:35.640> my<00:05:36.000> techniques<00:05:36.390> I

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
that's a little bit my techniques I

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.940 
that's a little bit my techniques I
don't<00:05:36.750> over<00:05:36.990> blow<00:05:37.140> down<00:05:37.350> low<00:05:37.560> on<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.770> harp

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
don't over blow down low on the harp

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.090 
don't over blow down low on the harp
I've<00:05:38.250> tried<00:05:38.880> over<00:05:39.180> draws<00:05:39.750> I'm<00:05:40.290> not<00:05:40.500> good<00:05:40.740> at<00:05:40.890> it

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
I've tried over draws I'm not good at it

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:50.000 
I've tried over draws I'm not good at it
so<00:05:41.310> let's<00:05:41.460> see<00:05:41.700> the<00:05:41.880> seven<00:05:42.270> overdraw<00:05:48.860> can't<00:05:49.860> do

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
so let's see the seven overdraw can't do

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.970 
so let's see the seven overdraw can't do
on<00:05:50.190> but<00:05:50.610> anyway<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:52.170> point<00:05:52.200> is<00:05:52.560> that<00:05:52.770> I<00:05:52.830> can

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
on but anyway the point is that I can

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.370 
on but anyway the point is that I can
get<00:05:53.100> the<00:05:53.250> four<00:05:53.460> five<00:05:53.760> and<00:05:54.120> six<00:05:54.720> over<00:05:55.170> blows

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
get the four five and six over blows

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.170 
get the four five and six over blows
which<00:05:55.650> are<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:55.920> ones<00:05:56.130> that<00:05:56.400> most<00:05:56.670> people

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
which are the ones that most people

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.780 
which are the ones that most people
would<00:05:57.390> want<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:58.110> use<00:05:58.380> in<00:05:58.680> general<00:05:59.010> playing<00:05:59.490> and

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
would want to use in general playing and

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.760 
would want to use in general playing and
the<00:06:00.360> only<00:06:00.570> ones<00:06:00.810> that<00:06:00.960> I've<00:06:01.110> really<00:06:01.560> used

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
the only ones that I've really used

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.190 
the only ones that I've really used
myself<00:06:02.280> in<00:06:02.640> playing<00:06:02.970> get<00:06:03.630> them<00:06:03.780> right<00:06:03.990> out<00:06:04.020> of

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
myself in playing get them right out of

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.680 
myself in playing get them right out of
box<00:06:04.470> with<00:06:04.770> little<00:06:05.220> or<00:06:05.430> no<00:06:05.460> adjustment<00:06:06.420> to<00:06:06.570> this

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
box with little or no adjustment to this

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.440 
box with little or no adjustment to this
harmonica<00:06:07.670> finally<00:06:08.670> that<00:06:08.910> just<00:06:09.090> one<00:06:09.240> note

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
harmonica finally that just one note

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.740 
harmonica finally that just one note
that<00:06:09.810> this<00:06:10.220> harmonica<00:06:11.220> has<00:06:11.600> really<00:06:12.600> nice

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
that this harmonica has really nice

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.640 
that this harmonica has really nice
cover<00:06:13.410> plates<00:06:13.770> super<00:06:14.730> smooth<00:06:15.090> on<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.390> lips

the<00:06:16.650> numbers<00:06:17.040> are<00:06:17.310> there<00:06:17.610> you<00:06:17.940> can<00:06:18.090> see<00:06:18.300> them<00:06:18.510> I

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
the numbers are there you can see them I

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.530 
the numbers are there you can see them I
mean<00:06:19.500> if<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.770> get<00:06:20.040> real<00:06:20.190> close<00:06:20.520> but<00:06:21.180> they<00:06:21.330> don't

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
mean if I get real close but they don't

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.230 
mean if I get real close but they don't
protrude<00:06:21.900> likely<00:06:22.590> Oscar's<00:06:23.040> so<00:06:23.940> they<00:06:24.060> don't

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
protrude likely Oscar's so they don't

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.960 
protrude likely Oscar's so they don't
sort<00:06:24.480> of<00:06:24.540> rub<00:06:24.870> Ron<00:06:25.170> your<00:06:25.530> lips<00:06:25.740> and<00:06:26.640> the

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
plating on the on the covers is really

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.300 
plating on the on the covers is really
really<00:06:29.970> smooth<00:06:30.210> itself<00:06:30.660> I<00:06:30.840> also<00:06:31.290> really<00:06:32.100> like

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
really smooth itself I also really like

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.280 
really smooth itself I also really like
you<00:06:32.580> see<00:06:32.730> the<00:06:32.880> ends<00:06:33.300> there<00:06:33.480> how<00:06:33.780> the<00:06:33.840> corners

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
you see the ends there how the corners

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.800 
you see the ends there how the corners
are<00:06:34.500> rounded<00:06:34.680> a<00:06:35.040> little<00:06:35.070> bit<00:06:35.430> I<00:06:35.670> really<00:06:36.180> like

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
are rounded a little bit I really like

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.810 
are rounded a little bit I really like
that<00:06:37.050> I<00:06:37.290> find<00:06:37.680> special<00:06:38.130> twenties<00:06:38.490> which<00:06:38.670> I

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
that I find special twenties which I

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.110 
that I find special twenties which I
generally<00:06:39.000> like<00:06:39.630> to<00:06:39.660> play<00:06:40.370> they<00:06:41.370> have<00:06:41.550> square

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
generally like to play they have square

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.240 
generally like to play they have square
corners<00:06:42.600> and<00:06:42.750> that<00:06:42.870> can<00:06:43.080> rub<00:06:43.350> right<00:06:44.040> in<00:06:44.190> the

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
corners and that can rub right in the

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.530 
corners and that can rub right in the
corner<00:06:44.610> of<00:06:44.700> your<00:06:44.790> mouth<00:06:44.940> especially<00:06:45.480> if

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
corner of your mouth especially if

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.210 
corner of your mouth especially if
you're<00:06:45.660> doing<00:06:45.900> a<00:06:45.960> lot<00:06:46.140> of<00:06:46.170> low-end<00:06:46.710> kind<00:06:47.160> of

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
you're doing a lot of low-end kind of

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.740 
you're doing a lot of low-end kind of
chugging<00:06:47.640> or<00:06:47.790> something<00:06:48.090> like<00:06:48.180> that<00:06:48.240> so<00:06:48.630> I'm

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
chugging or something like that so I'm

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.030 
chugging or something like that so I'm
finding<00:06:48.990> this<00:06:49.200> to<00:06:49.380> be<00:06:49.410> really<00:06:49.800> nice<00:06:49.980> smooth

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
finding this to be really nice smooth

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.640 
finding this to be really nice smooth
easy<00:06:53.040> to<00:06:53.430> play<00:06:53.700> harmonica<00:06:54.110> one<00:06:55.110> tiny<00:06:55.530> little

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
easy to play harmonica one tiny little

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.970 
easy to play harmonica one tiny little
gripe<00:06:56.130> is<00:06:56.340> that<00:06:56.430> the<00:06:57.300> cover<00:06:57.780> plates<00:06:58.170> don't

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
gripe is that the cover plates don't

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.260 
gripe is that the cover plates don't
fully<00:06:59.550> mesh<00:07:00.050> with<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.440> reed<00:07:02.310> plate<00:07:02.490> right

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
fully mesh with the reed plate right

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.140 
fully mesh with the reed plate right
along<00:07:03.510> the<00:07:03.660> front<00:07:03.840> so<00:07:04.560> if<00:07:04.740> you<00:07:04.920> block<00:07:05.490> out<00:07:05.910> the

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
along the front so if you block out the

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.760 
along the front so if you block out the
holes<00:07:06.360> with<00:07:06.630> your<00:07:06.780> lip<00:07:06.960> and<00:07:07.170> you<00:07:07.260> blow

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.320 

you<00:07:12.770> can<00:07:12.950> actually<00:07:13.340> blow<00:07:13.520> air<00:07:13.790> through<00:07:13.820> that

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
you can actually blow air through that

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.390 
you can actually blow air through that
gap<00:07:14.540> right<00:07:14.750> there<00:07:14.810> which<00:07:15.340> may<00:07:16.340> be

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 
gap right there which may be

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.100 
gap right there which may be
contributing<00:07:17.150> to<00:07:17.180> a<00:07:17.330> little<00:07:17.630> bit<00:07:17.720> of<00:07:17.780> air<00:07:17.900> loss

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
contributing to a little bit of air loss

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.690 
contributing to a little bit of air loss
although<00:07:18.470> in<00:07:18.590> general<00:07:18.920> this<00:07:19.010> is<00:07:19.070> an<00:07:19.310> extremely

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:19.700 
although in general this is an extremely

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.810 
although in general this is an extremely
airtight<00:07:20.240> responsive<00:07:20.900> harmonica<00:07:21.470> so<00:07:21.860> ah<00:07:22.130> the

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 
airtight responsive harmonica so ah the

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.980 
airtight responsive harmonica so ah the
probably<00:07:23.180> the<00:07:23.240> only<00:07:23.390> thing<00:07:23.480> that<00:07:23.630> I'm<00:07:23.840> going

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
probably the only thing that I'm going

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.740 
probably the only thing that I'm going
to<00:07:24.050> do<00:07:24.170> is<00:07:24.440> to<00:07:24.970> mess<00:07:25.970> with<00:07:26.180> the<00:07:26.270> cover<00:07:26.480> place<00:07:26.720> a

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.750 
to do is to mess with the cover place a

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.240 
to do is to mess with the cover place a
little<00:07:26.930> bit<00:07:27.080> to<00:07:27.230> get<00:07:27.380> the<00:07:27.530> seal<00:07:27.770> a<00:07:27.860> little<00:07:28.130> bit

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250 
little bit to get the seal a little bit

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.910 
little bit to get the seal a little bit
better<00:07:28.430> on<00:07:28.520> it<00:07:28.820> so<00:07:29.540> that<00:07:29.780> that<00:07:30.020> air<00:07:30.290> doesn't

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:30.920 
better on it so that that air doesn't

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.220 
better on it so that that air doesn't
leak<00:07:31.070> or<00:07:31.250> whatever<00:07:31.520> but<00:07:32.480> in<00:07:32.630> general<00:07:32.990> I<00:07:33.170> would

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.230 
leak or whatever but in general I would

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.710 
leak or whatever but in general I would
say<00:07:33.500> this<00:07:33.620> is<00:07:33.800> a<00:07:33.830> fantastic<00:07:34.040> harmonica<00:07:34.970> a<00:07:35.150> my

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
say this is a fantastic harmonica a my

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.500 
say this is a fantastic harmonica a my
total<00:07:36.350> Suzuki<00:07:36.860> convert<00:07:37.340> well<00:07:37.850> of<00:07:38.090> course<00:07:38.120> I'm

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:38.510 
total Suzuki convert well of course I'm

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.470 
total Suzuki convert well of course I'm
invested<00:07:39.080> in<00:07:39.290> a<00:07:39.320> whole<00:07:40.040> case<00:07:40.310> of<00:07:40.480> Hohner

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.480 
invested in a whole case of Hohner

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.480 
invested in a whole case of Hohner
harmonica<00:07:42.340> but<00:07:43.340> from<00:07:43.760> now<00:07:43.910> on<00:07:44.150> I<00:07:44.570> will

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.490 
harmonica but from now on I will

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.860 
harmonica but from now on I will
definitely<00:07:46.490> keep<00:07:46.640> the<00:07:46.850> harp<00:07:47.060> master<00:07:47.510> in<00:07:47.630> mind

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:47.870 
definitely keep the harp master in mind

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.170 
definitely keep the harp master in mind
as<00:07:48.200> a<00:07:48.230> harmonica<00:07:48.950> that<00:07:49.130> is<00:07:49.310> well<00:07:49.550> worth<00:07:49.820> going

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:50.180 
as a harmonica that is well worth going

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.630 
as a harmonica that is well worth going
to<00:07:51.070> I<00:07:52.070> do<00:07:52.580> like<00:07:53.060> I<00:07:53.210> said<00:07:53.420> have<00:07:53.600> a<00:07:53.630> Bushman<00:07:54.200> and

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:54.640 
to I do like I said have a Bushman and

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.910 
to I do like I said have a Bushman and
it<00:07:55.640> is<00:07:55.820> eerily<00:07:56.300> similar<00:07:56.630> in<00:07:57.020> form<00:07:57.350> to<00:07:57.440> the<00:07:57.740> Hart

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:57.920 
it is eerily similar in form to the Hart

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.510 
it is eerily similar in form to the Hart
masters<00:07:58.310> so<00:07:58.550> a<00:07:59.110> next<00:08:00.110> video<00:08:00.500> perhaps<00:08:01.040> will<00:08:01.370> be

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 
masters so a next video perhaps will be

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.910 
masters so a next video perhaps will be
comparing<00:08:02.090> it<00:08:02.240> to<00:08:02.380> to<00:08:03.380> see<00:08:03.530> what's<00:08:03.740> different

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:03.920 
comparing it to to see what's different

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.670 
comparing it to to see what's different
between<00:08:04.130> it<00:08:04.550> alright<00:08:05.270> that's<00:08:05.570> about<00:08:05.750> it<00:08:06.020> catch

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 
between it alright that's about it catch

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.250 
between it alright that's about it catch
on<00:08:06.830> the<00:08:06.920> flipside
