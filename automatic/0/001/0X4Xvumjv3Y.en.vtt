six and but there are several move
orders<00:00:22.140> which<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.470> lead<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> similar

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
orders which can lead to similar

orders which can lead to similar
structures<00:00:24.230> this<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> remarkable<00:00:26.220> idea

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
structures this is a remarkable idea

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.359 
structures this is a remarkable idea
which<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:28.080> invented<00:00:28.289> by<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> renowned

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
which was invented by the renowned

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.150 
which was invented by the renowned
trainer<00:00:30.050> chabanenko<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:33.050> essentially<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
trainer chabanenko and essentially the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.520 
trainer chabanenko and essentially the
purpose<00:00:35.610> behind<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.180> move<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> first

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
purpose behind the move is the first

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.170 
purpose behind the move is the first
instance<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> make<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> waiting<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.030> what

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
instance to make a waiting to see what

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
instance to make a waiting to see what
whites<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.860> seems<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
whites going to do and that seems like a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
whites going to do and that seems like a
ridiculous<00:00:44.489> approach<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> opening<00:00:45.690> but

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
ridiculous approach in the opening but

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.770 
ridiculous approach in the opening but
actually<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.969> it's<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.210> entirely<00:00:48.570> clear

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
actually and it's not entirely clear

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.950 
actually and it's not entirely clear
what<00:00:49.170> White's<00:00:49.440> next<00:00:49.860> move<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.960> for

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
what White's next move is and for

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.400 
what White's next move is and for
instance<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.289> he<00:00:52.379> plays<00:00:52.590> III<00:00:54.170> he's<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
instance if he plays III he's going to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.799 
instance if he plays III he's going to
block<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.770> his<00:00:55.890> Bishop<00:00:56.190> temporarily<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.629> he

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
block in his Bishop temporarily if he

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
block in his Bishop temporarily if he
brings<00:00:57.989> his<00:00:58.170> Bishop<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.770> f4<00:00:59.160> g5<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.760> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
brings his Bishop out to f4 g5 and it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.430 
brings his Bishop out to f4 g5 and it
becomes<00:01:00.300> more<00:01:00.539> attractive<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.020> black<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
becomes more attractive for black to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.490 
becomes more attractive for black to
take<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.859> c4<00:01:02.840> because<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.019> Bishop<00:01:04.320> can

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
take on c4 because that Bishop can

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.210 
take on c4 because that Bishop can
behead<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.979> instance<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.339> f4<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.850> 95<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.220> so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
behead for instance on f4 with 95 and so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.130 
behead for instance on f4 with 95 and so
as<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.549> waiting<00:01:08.970> move<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.720> has<00:01:09.900> some

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
as a waiting move it actually has some

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.120 
as a waiting move it actually has some
function<00:01:10.530> also<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:12.000> prepares<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.720> 5<00:01:13.100> which<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
function also it prepares be 5 which is

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.580 
function also it prepares be 5 which is
a<00:01:14.250> very<00:01:14.430> useful<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.229> move<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.439> have

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
a very useful and move to have

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
a very useful and move to have
especially<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.220> black<00:01:17.430> word<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> capture<00:01:18.090> on

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
especially if black word to capture on

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
especially if black word to capture on
c4<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.580> final<00:01:21.000> point<00:01:21.810> behind<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.740> which

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
c4 and the final point behind it which

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
c4 and the final point behind it which
is<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.130> quite<00:01:23.520> remarkable<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.240> queen

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
is really quite remarkable is that queen

is really quite remarkable is that queen
bee<00:01:24.900> three<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> key<00:01:26.640> resource<00:01:26.820> for

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299

well<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:22.300> natural<00:02:23.300> response<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.750> look<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:24.020> is

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
well a natural response to look at is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.480 
well a natural response to look at is
just<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.500> four<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.600> which<00:02:26.600> essentially

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
just a four and which essentially

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.860 
just a four and which essentially
neutralizes<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:29.090> effects<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.600> blacks

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
we have a carls bad porn structure but

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.510 
we have a carls bad porn structure but
with<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.050> white<00:02:54.320> poem<00:02:54.590> already<00:02:54.890> on<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> four

with a white poem already on a four

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.640 
with a white poem already on a four
which<00:02:56.240> affects<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.750> plans<00:02:56.990> quite<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.440> lot

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
which affects the plans quite a lot

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.410 
which affects the plans quite a lot
because<00:02:57.890> why<00:02:58.310> can't<00:02:58.880> play<00:02:59.570> b4<00:03:00.170> b5<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:00.920> easily

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
because why can't play b4 b5 so easily

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.550 
because why can't play b4 b5 so easily
because<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.660> black<00:03:02.840> porn<00:03:03.050> is<00:03:03.170> going<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.380> come

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
because the black porn is going to come

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.320 
because the black porn is going to come
to<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.710> five<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.460> control<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:05.000> square

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
to a five and just control that square

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
to a five and just control that square
and<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:08.090> that's<00:03:08.240> an<00:03:08.420> interesting<00:03:08.870> option<00:03:09.020> if

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
and so that's an interesting option if

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.030 
and so that's an interesting option if
white<00:03:10.340> plays<00:03:10.490> III<00:03:11.080> then<00:03:12.080> black<00:03:12.770> can<00:03:13.010> play

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
white plays III then black can play

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.890 
white plays III then black can play
