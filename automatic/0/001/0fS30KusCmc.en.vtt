 gigas and good here says as you will remember 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.640
 in February we tell you that it does not allow 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.100
 you would arrive from North America and I extracted this 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.100
 news and good we're not going to lay off life 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 2015 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.590
 school an 8GB memory card

 mid-June rest of Latin America 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.290
 and well let's emphasize this that the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.780
 new droid and testing and good does not allow 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.940
 is personally given approximately 20 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.460
 percent thinner and 15 percent 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.970
 lighter than the version we have 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.700
 almost every 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.680
 the edges more rounded so that the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.320
 toys more comfortably 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 also tilt internal 1GB moore that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.870
 It is very good but good to those who 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.510
 bad 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.020
 an lcd screen is 5 inches 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.850
 here of 5 inches compared to age 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.540
 what we have is 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.310
 another is 1 led is a better screen 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.820
 mind but obviously wants pressure 1 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.890
 of cd or the ugliest I suppose and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.390
 well he says that by giving him an image of 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.280
 high of the same difference 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.290
 that cartens the si francis view more 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.880
 better than the previous 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.150
 here also good something good in the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.100
 46 hour battery life the 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.730
 comparison than we are 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.190
 of 13 5 and this 7 hours of video 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.100
 of that well but good the screen leaves 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.900
 Much to be desired and maybe that will help 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.490
 server battles repeated until 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.860
 the colossus of rodas world war collection 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.650
 contains behavioral and god of war 2 with 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.350
 graphics in hd and surely I would 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.800
 I bought in May this very good post 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.320
 it is the edge of the two sides of the game 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.830
 they are very good two that have greater and 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:37.290
 good more than anyone will be the news 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.290
