00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.110
 The proof of this is that we saw only for 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:44.010

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.990
 So, there are people who installed java 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.650
 referee daycare 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.830
 this old one is having a lot of people 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.290
 search the internet with a program 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.630
 people do not like it is virus 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.700
 the computer technician came here me 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.680
 said that this is a shot of a virus and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.009
 is a video card that is missing 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.289

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.020
 This I will not explain now if you 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.010
