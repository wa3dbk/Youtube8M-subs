seven to ten years ago and the benefits
are<00:00:11.940> no<00:00:12.240> slip<00:00:12.540> axle<00:00:13.130> being<00:00:14.130> able<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.490> change

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.470 

now<00:01:34.620> from<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:35.070> understanding<00:01:35.300> talking<00:01:36.300> with

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
now from my understanding talking with

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.320 
now from my understanding talking with
people<00:01:36.770> we<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.280> adjust<00:01:39.000> their<00:01:39.420> wheels<00:01:41.330> to

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
people we have to adjust their wheels to

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.410 
people we have to adjust their wheels to
get<00:01:42.780> them<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.640> adjustment<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.880> my

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
get them to the right adjustment with my

00:01:45.420 --> 00:02:01.130 
get them to the right adjustment with my
trucks<00:01:45.870> you<00:01:46.260> do<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.040> I<00:02:00.080> think<00:02:01.080> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
trucks you do not have to I think that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.359 
trucks you do not have to I think that
is<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.619> adjustment<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:04.369> now

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
is the right adjustment for that one now

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:19.800 
is the right adjustment for that one now
the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.710 

as<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.019> can<00:02:21.200> see<00:02:21.409> quite<00:02:21.950> some<00:02:22.340> difference<00:02:22.819> I'm

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
as you can see quite some difference I'm

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.479 
as you can see quite some difference I'm
not<00:02:23.959> sure<00:02:24.170> if<00:02:24.319> that's<00:02:24.500> too<00:02:24.890> tight<00:02:25.159> or<00:02:25.430> too

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
not sure if that's too tight or too

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.179 
not sure if that's too tight or too
loose<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:29.170> believe<00:02:30.170> that's<00:02:30.319> right<00:02:30.650> where<00:02:30.920> mine

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
loose I believe that's right where mine

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.420 
loose I believe that's right where mine
should<00:02:31.489> never<00:02:32.329> need<00:02:32.540> adjusting<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:34.099> anyway

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
should never need adjusting so anyway

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.369 
should never need adjusting so anyway
now<00:02:34.760> I'm<00:02:34.909> going<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.120> show<00:02:35.269> some<00:02:35.540> videos<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.019> i

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
now I'm going to show some videos that i
