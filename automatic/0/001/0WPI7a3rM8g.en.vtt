00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:16.670
 like Andrew, they are representatives of a modern one 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.460
 but in any case 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.840
 Anachronistic way music 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 their work are sound of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.300
 electronic nature and tend to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.669
 Dancability in differentiated before 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.130
 they are to be considered as the band 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.710
 it is the merit in that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.260
 so-called electrikboy music translates 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 electric body music, too, rather 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.219
 Mellow and melancholy tuned 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.219
 Depeche Mode have brought near field 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.629
 Unique features are sure to be 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.410
 Persian influences of the frontman and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.449
 thanks to composers stephen covey 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.309
 oriental melody courses 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.280
 electronic sequences in light 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:10.740
 Distorted forward as well as song wear 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.860
 striking what figures boni structures and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.830
 melodies testify that their makers 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.580
 In contrast to many scene colleagues 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.479
 certain repertoire of chords and 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.130
 understanding for their use 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.049
 with several albums published 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.610
 they are among the striking ones 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.820
 heavyweights of the alternatives 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.180
 music scene certainly in synonymous 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.720
 all the critics for 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.060
 mood and a good mood 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.600
 I wish you a lot of luck and fun 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.740
 good entertainment 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.869
 I am dogmatic in the next episode 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.409
 Let's treat the letter B like
