that<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.750> wanted<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:44.040> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that that's what I wanted and if you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.020 
that that's what I wanted and if you
notice<00:00:44.489> here<00:00:44.520> they're<00:00:45.239> also<00:00:45.629> curved<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:47.030> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
notice here they're also curved so the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
notice here they're also curved so the
curved<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.750> curved<00:00:49.140> part<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> nail<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
curved the curved part of the nail I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.680 
curved the curved part of the nail I
think<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.329> helps<00:00:51.750> also<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:53.570> for<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
think is what helps also for for the

softener<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.579> kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.850> push<00:01:57.270> them

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
softener and then just kind of push them

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.490 
softener and then just kind of push them
back<00:01:58.880> after<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> push<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.450> back<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:01.049> my<00:02:01.290> nail

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
back after I push them back with my nail

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
back after I push them back with my nail
I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> harsh<00:02:02.549> tool<00:02:02.850> anymore<00:02:03.119> because

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
I don't use a harsh tool anymore because

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.429 
I don't use a harsh tool anymore because
I<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.890> does<00:02:05.159> add<00:02:05.810> dents<00:02:06.810> into<00:02:07.170> your

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.020 
I think that does add dents into your
nails<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.799> you're<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> little<00:02:08.220> tough<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.819> them

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
nails if you're a little tough on them

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.660 
nails if you're a little tough on them
or<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.239> don't<00:02:09.479> realize<00:02:09.780> how<00:02:10.050> tough<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.160> are

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
or you don't realize how tough you are

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
or you don't realize how tough you are
or<00:02:11.730> how<00:02:12.420> strong<00:02:12.810> your<00:02:13.140> you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
or how strong your you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.360 
or how strong your you
fingers<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.750> just<00:02:15.780> use<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:17.069> know<00:02:17.220> my

it so it's really I found that it's
really<00:03:45.750> helpful<00:03:46.079> for<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.560> nails<00:03:46.739> and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
really helpful for the nails and

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
sort of like a a yellow tint to it

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.680 
sort of like a a yellow tint to it
sometimes<00:03:56.130> when<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.280> use<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.519> as<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.760> top<00:03:57.090> coat<00:03:57.359> it

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
sometimes when I use it as a top coat it

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.410 
sometimes when I use it as a top coat it
doesn't<00:03:58.260> look<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.620> great<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.700> I'll<00:03:59.940> use<00:04:00.180> this

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
doesn't look that great so I'll use this

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.599

on I will be running my first half
marathon<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:19.799> October<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.209> water<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:22.109> an

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
marathon in October so water is an

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.790 
marathon in October so water is an
integral<00:04:22.409> part<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:23.130> that

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
integral part of that

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.089 
integral part of that
and<00:04:24.060> moisture<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.300> what<00:04:25.539> we<00:04:25.660> need<00:04:25.900> for<00:04:26.740> our

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
and moisture is what we need for our

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.290 
and moisture is what we need for our
nails<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:29.430> moisturized<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.849> at<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.120> same

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
nails to be moisturized and at the same

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.129 
nails to be moisturized and at the same
time<00:04:31.599> it'll<00:04:32.319> nurture<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:34.210> actual<00:04:34.659> nail<00:04:34.870> bed

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
time it'll nurture the actual nail bed

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.540 
time it'll nurture the actual nail bed
so<00:04:35.409> that<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.650> can<00:04:35.800> grow<00:04:35.979> because<00:04:36.129> if<00:04:36.400> they're

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
so that it can grow because if they're

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.059 
so that it can grow because if they're
knit<00:04:36.759> if<00:04:36.940> they're<00:04:37.210> dry<00:04:37.599> then<00:04:38.560> that's<00:04:38.770> when<00:04:38.949> we

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
knit if they're dry then that's when we

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.860 
knit if they're dry then that's when we
get<00:04:39.220> crack<00:04:39.550> nails<00:04:39.940> that's<00:04:40.389> when<00:04:40.569> we<00:04:40.690> get

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.760
