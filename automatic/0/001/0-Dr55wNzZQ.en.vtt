00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.510
 hello good morning now I will be 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.640
 answering a question to some readers 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.769
 which part of the phone covers the 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.349
 invisible 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.959
 what part are left uncovered I will 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.330
 clarify that when I buy man the 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.829
 full version the most complete of all 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.419
 that at that time I paid with a 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.360
 discount that I already had for a code 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.180
 severe grade before 20 dollars puts it 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.730
 Total free shipping and no paid na 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.630
 why that 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.349
 it's outside 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.149
 the sites that pay customs 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.450
 and how they work but I know it's not going to 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.430
 pay custom 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.430
 it's something I bought in 20 together 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.140
 we will be fine the front part 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.140
 especially 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.079
 the button 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 it's covered you see there 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.060
 has the button 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.830
 the whole screen has 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.830
 it's the only little problem that had already 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.560
 said that a little mÃ¼ller got together 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.850
 ends the film by the simple fact that 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.760
 against the edge has a bit of 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.710
 glue then goes on fertilizing the board 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.130
 from the pocket to luisa but with a simple 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.899
 unit leaves 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.329
 omar that shining that leaves everything 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.480
 time in order for I recommended it what 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.490
 I still recommend 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.820
 on the screen covers everything up to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.860
 button obviously does not cover the speaker is 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.600
 determines 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.600
 and you can see there where ending 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.500
 I have cut 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.430
 the camera does not look like it 's 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.800
 pretty ugly but almost not seen but not 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:55.210
 has it shows it out I'm very close 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.210
 one never do so so today 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.909
 as it is there and leaves the exit of 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.140
 missing the chip the constant button the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.950
 button 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.950
 I think that's where it ends 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.930
 it's where I feel bad 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.480
 and it was my mistake 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.519
 and that little problem that is there that sees that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.950
 lack is a little problem but it is 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.780
 designed well the fork the union between 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.770
 Germanic curve and there would be no way if not and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.820
 what with an empty space for 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.340
 that the pulguita has and does not 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.540
 stick to each other and here the only one 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.120
 piece that I was dismissed because I hit 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.980
 very bad that goes from here to here but 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.470
 it is also covered or on this side 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.880
 the chip on the output of the chip the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.880
 headset all that part 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.810
 the back covers it to see if 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.810
 focus 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.520
 Focus covers everything 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.000
 and if I stuck it badly this looks 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.000
 perfect 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.670
 back there is short to leave the little button 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.890
 residential 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.990
 there is also short 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.350
 and leave space for the button 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.350
 volume 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.660
 like down there the one that said 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.660
 because some dark yes 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:31.170
 there are side cutters it would be speaking 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.170
 the doc how it ended there 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.069
 and to the singing of the microphone 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.800
 and that is where I also stuck 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.660
 and I asked her to stay dirty on the other side 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.270
 lack that covers from here until in this 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.110
 case is out there 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.110
 you stuck 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.930
 the only part that does not cover is a 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.269
 2 mm bit in the part 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.049
 chrome that has forward because filmin 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.489
 is there avn - up to the line and the other 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.190
 piece and then you have the part of 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.320
 above all that band around without 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.650
 end because end ends before it starts 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.800
 the part 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.470
 that this straight ahead ends there 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.610
 the other begins that participates in the 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.110
 chrome plated 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.110
 uncovered but as it is so firm to 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.930
 broadside go to never be put to 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.550
 it's perfect 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.550
 after four or five months 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.450
 also 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.400
 Well, I hope you have tired of this 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.790
 to answer the question of which parts 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.520
