overcame and get ready for this sure I

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:57.970 
overcame and get ready for this sure I
mean<00:00:56.690> at<00:00:56.809> first<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.140> think<00:00:57.320> was<00:00:57.469> really<00:00:57.620> about

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
mean at first I think was really about

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.889 
mean at first I think was really about
that<00:00:58.219> design<00:00:58.579> in<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.850> concept<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.690> match

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
that design in the concept of the match

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.990 
that design in the concept of the match
and<00:01:00.170> really<00:01:00.769> who's<00:01:01.070> going<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.370> shoot<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:01.760> what

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
and really who's going to shoot it what

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.639 
and really who's going to shoot it what
is<00:01:02.089> it<00:01:02.210> going<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.449> determine<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.109> what<00:01:03.260> is<00:01:03.440> it

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
is it going to determine and what is it

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.649 
is it going to determine and what is it
and<00:01:03.859> why<00:01:04.070> do<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.699> would<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.000> be<00:01:05.119> successful

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
and why do it and would it be successful

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.690 
and why do it and would it be successful
if<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:05.960> tried<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:07.009> think<00:01:07.070> we'll<00:01:07.399> find

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
if you tried it and I think we'll find

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.279 
if you tried it and I think we'll find
out<00:01:07.880> certainly<00:01:08.299> here<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.570> few<00:01:08.720> days<00:01:08.899> with

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
out certainly here in a few days with

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.810 
out certainly here in a few days with
the<00:01:09.680> output<00:01:10.039> of<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.159> matches<00:01:10.399> with<00:01:10.789> the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
the output of the matches with the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.480 
the output of the matches with the
design<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.930> truly<00:01:12.170> evaluate<00:01:12.950> and

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
design is to truly evaluate and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.399 
design is to truly evaluate and
determine<00:01:13.640> who<00:01:14.119> would<00:01:14.330> be<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:15.049> world's

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409
