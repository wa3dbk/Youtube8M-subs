00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.700
 track down enemy ships and 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.700

 screen margin closer under the magnifying glass 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.149
 to take 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.000
 then you need your finger 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.950
 just a way to the goal and to pull 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.380

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.069
 or continue the story 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.140
 then the perspective becomes the 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.259
 view you also switched 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.950
 mainly in the game you will see 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.950
 ship 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.500
 Central gameplay element in the game is 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.960
 your ship from the beginning of the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.980
 play only a small nutshell for 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.080

 You can ship your boat via a wheel

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.960
 you know above the tax law 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.790
 you can look around 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.280

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.470

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.390
 Change perspective 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.730
 comes the other ship more 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.430
 you can by fingertip in the melee 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.590
 turn into the best pirates you were 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.110
 now side by side with your opponent 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.220
 and try this with cannons salve 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.520
 off 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.200
 To do this you tap on your cannon 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.020
 a bar you can now on the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.480
 create enemy ship and targets 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.850
 depending on how well you have targeted there 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.020
 the ship of the opponent damages it 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.730
 It can also happen that you 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.130
 weak spots on board of the enemy 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.660
 discovered which ship targeted 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.660
 can take under fire 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.340
 of course, the opponent will be on you 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.860
 fire something again in another 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.780
 perspective is shown over two 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.640
 buttons at the bottom of the screen can 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.610
 you dodge to the right and left 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.750
 if you have them at the right moment 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.360
 pressed and so change the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.570
 Attack and defense policy always 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.910
 off until either you or the opponent in 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.370
 the depths of the sea are sunk 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.560
 generally, all actions require 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.470
 whether it's firing or performing 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.690
 The dodge is a few seconds up 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.000
 they can be used again like that 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.760
 it depends mainly on the timing of whether 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.380
 Your actions will be crowned with success 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.750
 after a successful fight you can per 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.750
 fingertip collecting euro loot 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.290
 during the game you collect so through the 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.940
 fulfill more and more gold by missions 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.400
 and experience points the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.290
 Experience points bring you 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.780
 step increase which you urgently 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.240
 you need new ships only 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.400
 acquire or new team members 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.790
 Thanks in the tavern only thanks 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.780
 if you have the appropriate levels 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.550
 have achieved then and when do you find 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.130
 on your journey also treasure maps of the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.680
 navy and labruce which the story 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.720
 of the game and so on 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.630
 rattles on the map mission for 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.430
 mission from beautiful is that you between 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.680
 Not only the various missions 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.140
 about the card and finger because of way and 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.050
 You can drive here but also openworld 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.780
 moderately straight from the first person yourself 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.760
 You can drive expensive ships thanks 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.220
 more dynamic and never look the same 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.940
 they suddenly stormed up 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.050
 Change day and night and typical 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.960
 sailor songs which your team 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.950
 of itself is really pirani 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.950
 mood on 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.430
 too much realism you should from 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.710
 Do not expect Assassin's creed pirates 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.320
 but you should already in a storm 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.260
 gather the sails and still navigate to 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.880
 can and also wins direction 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.010
 Sailing weather as well as class and weight 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:55.930
 your ship noticeably affect 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:58.150
 the control from my conclusion assassin's 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.310
 creed pirates is a very good game 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.330
 become that high expectations 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.790
 able to fulfill 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.680
 It's a lot of fun with his 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.139
 ship to sail over the sea to 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.030
 enjoy the waves and the green 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.130
 to listen to the Council of Europe 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.380
 the excellent graphics and the great 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.690
 soundscapes have a large share 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.330
 the excellent atmosphere of the 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.949
 Never was it more beautiful over the sea 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.199
 to cruise the sunset 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.150
 against or through a thunderstorm 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.639
 through it comes the easy 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.220
 control and the large scope of the 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.960
 play the complexity of the title 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.770
 one at the beginning, first something 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.450
 slay 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.370
 since the good introduction and the 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.669
 clear menu guidance is one 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.139
 but fast in the game in it 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.760
 however, there are a few that are mine 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.220
 which ubisoft only limited good 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.979
 that is what the 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.810
 Seegefechte staged beautifully and 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:52.300
 also easy to learn after a 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.090
 certain playing time but one of the 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.669
 always the same running fight yet 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.160
 a little annoyed and of course something 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:03.310
 pity since this is a core element 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.080
 of the game are despite this maneuver 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.870
 it should probably be the most beautiful 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.760
 These pirates play on mobile devices 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.650
 how do you like assassin's creed? 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.840
 Pirates has the game your expectations 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.370
 fulfilled then write your opinion 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.020
 in the comments 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.060
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.060
 next video fabia
