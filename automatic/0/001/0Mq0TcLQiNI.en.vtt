00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.870 
much but you can draw a circle for
example<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:38.080> then<00:03:38.500> select<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.370> scissors<00:03:39.580> to

cut<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.209> out<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:41.530> dispose<00:03:42.459> of

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
cut that out and then just dispose of

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.000 
cut that out and then just dispose of
that<00:03:42.940> yellow<00:03:43.150> sheet<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.660> paper<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.320> leave

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
basically and if i zoom out again I can

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.860 
basically and if i zoom out again I can
just<00:03:49.630> drag<00:03:49.989> in<00:03:50.260> another<00:03:50.769> piece<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.489> paper<00:03:51.870> draw

ask this yellow circle on top of that

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.660 
ask this yellow circle on top of that
and<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.780> can<00:04:05.320> just<00:04:05.530> build<00:04:05.739> whatever<00:04:06.340> shapes

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
and you can just build whatever shapes
