00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
my button doesn't work why do you think

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.660 
my button doesn't work why do you think
electronics<00:01:22.570> education<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:23.470> important<00:01:24.040> when

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
electronics education is important when

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.980 
electronics education is important when
I<00:01:24.730> was<00:01:24.880> in<00:01:25.060> high<00:01:25.090> school<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.660> took<00:01:25.750> an

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
I was in high school I took an

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.640 
I was in high school I took an
electronics<00:01:26.530> class<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.390> was<00:01:28.540> ok<00:01:29.410> I<00:01:29.440> don't

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
electronics class and it was ok I don't

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.640 
electronics class and it was ok I don't
want<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.830> name<00:01:29.950> names<00:01:30.120> now<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.450> see<00:01:32.200> you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
want to name names now that I see you

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.500 
want to name names now that I see you
know<00:01:33.360> microcontrollers<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:36.510> programmable

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
know microcontrollers and programmable

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.810 
know microcontrollers and programmable
embeddable<00:01:38.290> electronics<00:01:39.130> it's<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:39.700> much

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
embeddable electronics it's so much

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.460 
embeddable electronics it's so much
better<00:01:40.000> than<00:01:40.150> what<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.450> did<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.990> high<00:01:41.440> school

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
better than what I did in high school

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.880 
better than what I did in high school
and<00:01:42.430> I<00:01:42.550> think<00:01:42.730> it's<00:01:42.820> important<00:01:43.210> because<00:01:43.890> it's

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
and I think it's important because it's

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.360 
and I think it's important because it's
the<00:01:45.070> future<00:01:45.280> you<00:01:46.150> know<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.890> Mike<00:01:48.100> picking

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
the future you know this Mike picking

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.570 
the future you know this Mike picking
this<00:01:48.460> up<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:49.150> educators<00:01:49.750> need<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:50.020> focus<00:01:50.580> they

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
this up the educators need to focus they

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.460 
this up the educators need to focus they
can't<00:01:51.820> have<00:01:51.970> they<00:01:52.630> need<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> mobile<00:01:54.360> unit

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
can't have they need a mobile unit

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.530 
can't have they need a mobile unit
facility<00:01:57.000> where<00:01:58.000> there's<00:01:58.150> not<00:01:58.300> going<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.450> be

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
facility where there's not going to be

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.010 
facility where there's not going to be
room<00:01:58.780> for<00:01:58.810> dogs<00:01:59.200> so<00:02:00.010> they<00:02:00.040> can<00:02:00.220> concentrate<00:02:01.020> we

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
room for dogs so they can concentrate we

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.600 
room for dogs so they can concentrate we
were<00:02:02.140> going<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.320> get<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.500> Dodge<00:02:02.740> Dart<00:02:03.100> but<00:02:03.490> we

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
were going to get a Dodge Dart but we

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.020 
were going to get a Dodge Dart but we
thought<00:02:03.790> I<00:02:03.940> might<00:02:04.090> be<00:02:04.120> too<00:02:04.330> fast<00:02:05.940> didn't<00:02:06.940> you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
thought I might be too fast didn't you

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.759 
thought I might be too fast didn't you
already<00:02:07.180> try<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.690> win<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:07.990> sprinter<00:02:08.440> van<00:02:08.619> in

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
already try to win a sprinter van in

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.610 
already try to win a sprinter van in
this<00:02:08.890> contest<00:02:09.399> yeah<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:11.530> did<00:02:11.709> yes<00:02:12.220> that's<00:02:12.849> true

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
this contest yeah we did yes that's true

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.390 
this contest yeah we did yes that's true
yes

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
yes

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.309 
yes
we<00:02:17.400> did<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:19.590> thing<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.300> win<00:02:21.510> we

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
we did that thing is we can win we

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.680 
we did that thing is we can win we
decided<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.250> year<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.520> gotta<00:02:23.700> come<00:02:24.270> back<00:02:24.450> up

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
decided this year we gotta come back up

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.330 
decided this year we gotta come back up
up<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.410> game<00:02:25.700> bring<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> ruckus<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:28.190> take<00:02:29.190> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
up the game bring the ruckus and take it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.130 
up the game bring the ruckus and take it
