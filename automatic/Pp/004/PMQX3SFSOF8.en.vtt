00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.160 
plating and something you have to be
very<00:02:07.770> careful<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.329> was<00:02:09.479> gold<00:02:09.750> plating

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
very careful now if it was gold plating

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.720 
very careful now if it was gold plating
that<00:02:10.290> we<00:02:10.500> would<00:02:10.679> need<00:02:10.829> to<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.100> karat<00:02:11.549> in

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that we would need to know karat in

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.370 
that we would need to know karat in
order<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.329> be<00:02:12.420> authentic<00:02:12.870> gold

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
order to be authentic gold

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
order to be authentic gold
he<00:02:13.680> needs<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.010> ten<00:02:14.220> karats<00:02:14.579> or<00:02:14.730> higher<00:02:14.940> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
he needs to be ten karats or higher and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.960 
he needs to be ten karats or higher and
so<00:02:15.900> normally<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.739> plated<00:02:17.700> it'll

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
so normally if it's a plated it'll

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.030 
so normally if it's a plated it'll
denote<00:02:18.329> that<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.440> case<00:02:19.680> we're

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
denote that but in this case we're

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.750 
denote that but in this case we're
silver<00:02:20.579> it's<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.329> silver<00:02:21.720> plating<00:02:22.140> its

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
silver it's not silver plating its

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.120 
silver it's not silver plating its
silver<00:02:23.760> tone<00:02:24.030> plating<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:25.200> need<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.860> be<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
silver tone plating we need to be the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.330 
silver tone plating we need to be the
people<00:02:26.459> need<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> be<00:02:26.790> aware<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.060> that

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
people need to be aware of that

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.309 
people need to be aware of that
in<00:02:28.850> authentic<00:02:29.420> products<00:02:29.750> come<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.290> a

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
in authentic products come it is a

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.960 
in authentic products come it is a
detriment<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.100> everybody<00:02:31.580> because<00:02:31.730> their

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
detriment to everybody because their

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.449 
detriment to everybody because their
costs<00:02:32.420> are<00:02:32.510> very<00:02:32.720> low<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:33.140> them<00:02:33.319> nickel<00:02:33.950> versus

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
costs are very low in them nickel versus

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.760 
costs are very low in them nickel versus
silver<00:02:34.790> metal<00:02:35.180> cost<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.600> very<00:02:35.840> different

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
silver metal cost is very different

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.100 
silver metal cost is very different
right<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.130> moment<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.670> big<00:02:38.600> difference<00:02:38.990> in

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
right this moment a big difference in

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.559 
right this moment a big difference in
them<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.800> some<00:02:40.459> people<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.880> want<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.300> and

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
them but some people do want that and

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:42.850 
them but some people do want that and
that's<00:02:41.780> what<00:02:41.959> will<00:02:42.080> give<00:02:42.230> them<00:02:42.440> if<00:02:42.530> they<00:02:42.680> need

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
that's what will give them if they need

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.890 
that's what will give them if they need
it
