 that facilitates a consistent journey into the criticism 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.940

 it can be worthwhile to choose different printers 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.529
 To choose color profiles 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:42.829
 pay attention 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.259

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.969
 he depends on the standard color palette on the page 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.609
 and he determines in which colors Rhodes exports as a bitmap 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.219

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.659
 I now choose an alternative environment 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.329
 There are still some questions that are outside the pop range 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.499
 sometimes they have no choice but we have a specific subject area 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:51.909
 use 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.430

 hopes Prof can export them as Zepek or PDF 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.879
 and then pass on their print shop 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.209
 so it is already clear in advance that the final result should look like 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:16.180

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.340
 to work in color values 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.659
 particularly important 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.809
 if you just create degrees for the internet 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:26.020

 Take the dropper accident over an object 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.779
 Again, you can see the RGB and Hacks values 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.319
 During a course, you can even let the start and validator ads 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.330

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.479
 you can easily add colors to the corresponding palette 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.379
 take an object out 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.980

 Draw colors from one property to another 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.510
 I just hold the left mouse button and hold it down but also that 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.189
