00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.009 
overnight the back is bending very
strange<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.779> I've<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.260> online<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:30.750> guess

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
strange and I've got online and I guess

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.090 
strange and I've got online and I guess
Guppies<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.160> inbreeding<00:00:33.980> going<00:00:34.980> on

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
Guppies a lot of inbreeding going on

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.430 
Guppies a lot of inbreeding going on
with<00:00:35.250> Guppies<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> genetic<00:00:37.079> maybe

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
with Guppies so this is a genetic maybe

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.240 
with Guppies so this is a genetic maybe
feature<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.460> also<00:00:39.360> read<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.559> fish<00:00:41.600> TB<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
feature but I also read about fish TB I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.650 
feature but I also read about fish TB I
never<00:00:44.250> heard<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.610> before<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.420> kind

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
never heard of that before that's kind

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.940 
never heard of that before that's kind
of<00:00:46.309> disconcerting<00:00:47.309> little<00:00:48.410> well<00:00:49.410> scary

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
of disconcerting little well scary

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.139 
of disconcerting little well scary
because<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.030> said<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> contagious<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:53.149> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
because they said it is contagious so I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.310 
because they said it is contagious so I
don't<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.570> should<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.050> rid<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
don't know if I should just get rid of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.299 
don't know if I should just get rid of
this<00:00:55.559> guy<00:00:56.239> it's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:58.170> also<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> genetic

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
this guy it's a it also is a genetic

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.750 
this guy it's a it also is a genetic
deformity<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.710> usually<00:01:01.710> happens<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.489> said

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
deformity that usually happens they said

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.560 
deformity that usually happens they said
in<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> female<00:01:03.719> fish<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> female

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
in the female fish so this is the female

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.490 
in the female fish so this is the female
and<00:01:07.049> again<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.310> growing<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and again it was growing up this is like

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.219 
and again it was growing up this is like
the<00:01:10.710> offspring<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> offspring<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.630> an

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the offspring of the offspring of an

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.070 
the offspring of the offspring of an
offspring<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> original<00:01:15.810> fish

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
offspring of you know the original fish

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
offspring of you know the original fish
that<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.500> purchased<00:01:17.100> some<00:01:17.490> time<00:01:18.060> ago<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.909> out

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that I purchased some time ago and out

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.120 
that I purchased some time ago and out
of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> blue<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.810> ended<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.950> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
of the blue just ended up with this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.719 
of the blue just ended up with this
weird<00:01:23.460> shape<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.830> seems<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.100> eating<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
weird shape back seems to be eating it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.770 
weird shape back seems to be eating it
is<00:01:26.939> active<00:01:27.470> I<00:01:28.470> did<00:01:29.130> read<00:01:29.460> somebody<00:01:30.270> said<00:01:30.509> time

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
is active I did read somebody said time

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.550 
is active I did read somebody said time
to<00:01:30.930> put<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:32.240> clove<00:01:33.240> oil<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.170> they<00:01:34.290> said

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
to put it in clove oil I think they said

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.179 
to put it in clove oil I think they said
so<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:36.479> way<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.200> said<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.979> my

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
so the way they they said that my

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.460 
so the way they they said that my
impression<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> euthanize

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
impression is that's a way to euthanize

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
impression is that's a way to euthanize
fish<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> put<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:42.290> clove<00:01:43.290> oil<00:01:44.210> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
fish is you put it in some clove oil so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.569 
fish is you put it in some clove oil so
I<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> probably<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:47.189> flush<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
I don't know I probably just flush it

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.999 
I don't know I probably just flush it
myself<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:50.280> seems<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.740> like

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
myself but it seems to be you know like

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.200 
myself but it seems to be you know like
I<00:01:53.159> said<00:01:53.220> active<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:57.079> heating<00:01:58.549> but<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.909> again

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I said active and heating but just again

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.120 
I said active and heating but just again
I<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:00.450> wondering<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:00.930> anybody<00:02:01.259> knows<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:02.009> has

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
I was wondering if anybody knows or has
