them and this is a video where I will
show<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.039> how<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:21.420> get<00:00:21.720> charms<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.710> easy<00:00:22.980> way

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
show you how to get charms the easy way

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.890 
show you how to get charms the easy way
so<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.840> setup<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.890> run<00:00:26.900> it's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
so this is my setup for this run it's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380 
so this is my setup for this run it's
really<00:00:28.140> quite<00:00:28.260> easy<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.070> will<00:00:29.369> these<00:00:30.029> are<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
really quite easy but will these are the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.150 
really quite easy but will these are the
two<00:00:30.539> skills<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.050> need<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.410> marathon<00:00:32.009> runner

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
two skills we need a marathon runner

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.729 
two skills we need a marathon runner
which<00:00:32.700> slows<00:00:33.059> down<00:00:33.329> stamina<00:00:33.989> depletion<00:00:34.530> for

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
which slows down stamina depletion for

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
which slows down stamina depletion for
actions<00:00:35.160> other<00:00:35.370> than<00:00:35.550> invasion<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.390> blocking

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
actions other than invasion and blocking

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.049 
actions other than invasion and blocking
which<00:00:36.960> means<00:00:37.579> running<00:00:38.579> will<00:00:39.559> deplete<00:00:40.559> our

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
which means running will deplete our

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.360 
which means running will deplete our
stamina<00:00:43.789> less<00:00:44.789> quickly<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.420> pro<00:00:46.370> transporter

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
stamina less quickly and pro transporter

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.220 
stamina less quickly and pro transporter
which<00:00:47.640> increases<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> speed<00:00:48.750> while

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
which increases the speed while

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.990 
which increases the speed while
transporting<00:00:49.649> items<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.579> decreases

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
transporting items and decreases

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
transporting items and decreases
likelihood<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.660> dropping<00:00:52.020> them<00:00:52.160> that's<00:00:53.160> all

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
likelihood of dropping them that's all

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
likelihood of dropping them that's all
we<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.579> need<00:00:53.879> another<00:00:54.469> thing<00:00:55.469> let's<00:00:55.949> see

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.770 
annoying as you can see the route 21 is
Mark<00:02:54.070> off<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.670> will<00:02:54.910> always<00:02:55.030> have<00:02:55.270> to<00:02:55.570> take

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
Mark off so you will always have to take

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.020 
Mark off so you will always have to take
the<00:02:55.930> small<00:02:56.200> detour<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:57.340> that's<00:02:57.610> okay<00:02:58.000> because

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
the small detour but that's okay because

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.800 
the small detour but that's okay because
the<00:02:58.480> route<00:02:58.690> isn't<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.500> anyway<00:02:59.860> um<00:03:00.810> let's
