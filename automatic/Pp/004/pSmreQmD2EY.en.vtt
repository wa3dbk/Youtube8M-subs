00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
how to maintain the curl pattern when I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.240 
how to maintain the curl pattern when I
wore<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.550> out<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.880> was<00:01:32.000> just<00:01:32.350> like<00:01:33.350> expand<00:01:34.010> into

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250

this<00:01:34.370> big<00:01:34.730> mess<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.780> then<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.410> started<00:01:36.650> guiding

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
this big mess so then I started guiding

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.460 
this big mess so then I started guiding
getting<00:01:37.640> into<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.940> habit<00:01:38.150> of<00:01:38.660> watching<00:01:39.140> my

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470
