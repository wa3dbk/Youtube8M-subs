slightly<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.189> game<00:01:32.400> does<00:01:32.610> look<00:01:32.790> better

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
slightly so the game does look better

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.819 
slightly so the game does look better
than<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.930> max<00:01:34.200> settings<00:01:34.409> just

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
than this I'm with max settings just

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.800 
than this I'm with max settings just
just<00:01:35.579> cuz<00:01:35.729> i'm<00:01:35.820> recording<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.329> I've<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.659> lower

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
just cuz i'm recording it I've to lower

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.399 
just cuz i'm recording it I've to lower
the<00:01:36.990> settings<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.380> bit<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.280> know

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
the settings a bit because you know

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.719 
the settings a bit because you know
that's<00:01:40.409> what<00:01:40.619> that's<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:41.280> needs<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.700> done

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that's what that's what needs to be done

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.069 
that's what that's what needs to be done
but<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:43.049> game<00:01:43.290> looks<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.950> really<00:01:44.189> good

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
obviously not as good with lower

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
swing your back OS based on that we

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.470 
swing your back OS based on that we
should<00:01:56.899> just<00:01:57.899> got<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
should just got it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.780 
should just got it
I<00:02:02.020> like<00:02:03.020> little<00:02:03.230> little<00:02:03.710> firework<00:02:04.370> display<00:02:04.730> in

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
I like little little firework display in

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.220 
I like little little firework display in
the<00:02:04.880> back<00:02:05.060> there<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.450> does<00:02:05.600> sound<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.930> bit<00:02:05.960> funny

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
the back there it does sound a bit funny

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.200 
the back there it does sound a bit funny
huh<00:02:06.470> I'll<00:02:06.860> be<00:02:07.100> honest<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.670> flowers<00:02:08.030> do

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
huh I'll be honest the the flowers do

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.580 
huh I'll be honest the the flowers do
sound<00:02:08.480> a<00:02:08.570> bit<00:02:08.600> funny<00:02:08.869> when<00:02:09.050> they<00:02:09.140> go<00:02:09.290> off<00:02:09.320> every

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
sound a bit funny when they go off every

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.930 
sound a bit funny when they go off every
time<00:02:09.710> but<00:02:10.070> it's<00:02:10.730> whatever<00:02:12.550> gonna<00:02:13.550> try<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.820> get

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
time but it's whatever gonna try to get

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.940 
time but it's whatever gonna try to get
a<00:02:14.000> gonna<00:02:14.810> try<00:02:15.020> get<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.200> good<00:02:15.380> score<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.770> know<00:02:15.860> if

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
a gonna try get a good score you know if

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.720 
a gonna try get a good score you know if
you<00:02:16.070> can<00:02:16.190> get<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.460> think<00:02:16.490> if<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.120> can<00:02:17.180> get<00:02:17.530> ok<00:02:18.530> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
you can get I think if you can get ok so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.280 
you can get I think if you can get ok so
this<00:02:19.730> goal<00:02:20.000> kicking<00:02:20.240> thing<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.660> do<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:21.080> it

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
this goal kicking thing I do like it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.190 
this goal kicking thing I do like it
that<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.530> elite<00:02:21.800> leaderboard<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.990> it's<00:02:23.990> like

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
that is elite leaderboard and it's like

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.230 
that is elite leaderboard and it's like
pretty<00:02:24.650> competitive<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.490> an<00:02:25.610> extent<00:02:25.910> but<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
pretty competitive to an extent but the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.660 
pretty competitive to an extent but the
only<00:02:26.360> problem<00:02:26.630> with<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.710> there<00:02:28.490> is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
only problem with it is that there is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.970 
only problem with it is that there is
definitely<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.210> max<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:30.530> know<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.920> don't

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
definitely a max you know and I don't

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.850 
definitely a max you know and I don't
think<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> max<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.880> that's<00:02:32.180> hard<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.780> get<00:02:32.990> you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
think the max is that's hard to get you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.260 
think the max is that's hard to get you
know<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:34.190> not<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.580> good<00:02:34.730> at<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.970> at<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
know I'm not that good at it at the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.170 
know I'm not that good at it at the
moment<00:02:35.570> but<00:02:35.720> with<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.380> burnt<00:02:36.560> practice

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
moment but with the burnt practice

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.130 
moment but with the burnt practice
people<00:02:38.180> will<00:02:38.300> be<00:02:38.390> able<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.600> get<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.870> max

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
people will be able to get the max

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.320 
people will be able to get the max
pretty<00:02:39.740> easily<00:02:39.950> i<00:02:40.190> think<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.880> get<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> bit<00:02:41.210> of

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
pretty easily i think as we get a bit of

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.410 
pretty easily i think as we get a bit of
a<00:02:41.510> bit<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.320> lag<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.310> know<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:44.000> what<00:02:44.180> it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
a bit of lag but you know it is what it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.950 
a bit of lag but you know it is what it
is<00:02:44.450> come<00:02:45.320> on<00:02:45.410> Parker<00:02:45.620> kick<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.190> over<00:02:46.340> oh

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
is come on Parker kick it over oh

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.200 
is come on Parker kick it over oh
curve<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.950> back<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.370> mean<00:02:49.760> that's<00:02:49.850> just<00:02:50.090> how

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
curve it back I mean that's just how

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.800 
curve it back I mean that's just how
easy<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.720> swing<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.200> back<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:53.690> know

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
easy it is to swing it back but you know

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.090 
easy it is to swing it back but you know
there's<00:02:54.050> only<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.410> certain<00:02:54.590> amount<00:02:54.740> of<00:02:54.920> points

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
there's only a certain amount of points

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.370 
there's only a certain amount of points
you<00:02:55.280> can<00:02:55.310> get<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.820> as<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.930> said<00:02:56.990> there<00:02:57.260> are

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
you can get and as I said there are

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.400 
you can get and as I said there are
these<00:02:57.530> ones<00:02:57.770> back<00:02:57.950> here<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:58.750> my<00:02:59.750> right<00:03:00.020> analog

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
these ones back here but my right analog

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.900 
these ones back here but my right analog
stick<00:03:00.440> doesn't<00:03:00.800> work<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.130> i<00:03:01.160> can't<00:03:01.460> adjust<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
stick doesn't work so i can't adjust the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.030 
stick doesn't work so i can't adjust the
power<00:03:02.120> don't<00:03:02.510> think<00:03:02.720> i<00:03:02.990> think<00:03:03.590> that's<00:03:03.920> how<00:03:04.010> you

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
power don't think i think that's how you

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.820 
power don't think i think that's how you
just<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> power<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.380> right<00:03:06.530> analog<00:03:06.740> stick

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
just the power is the right analog stick

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.440 
just the power is the right analog stick
and<00:03:07.250> obviously<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:07.670> can<00:03:07.850> do<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.030> like<00:03:08.150> hire<00:03:08.420> a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
and obviously you can do it like hire a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.020 
and obviously you can do it like hire a
lot<00:03:08.720> i<00:03:09.709> don't<00:03:10.190> really<00:03:10.280> know<00:03:10.400> why<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.730> do<00:03:11.000> it

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
lot i don't really know why you do it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.170 
lot i don't really know why you do it
but<00:03:11.650> probably<00:03:12.650> just<00:03:12.830> keep<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.130> default<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:17.000> so

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
but probably just keep it default but so

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.530 
but probably just keep it default but so
far<00:03:17.420> everyone<00:03:17.870> I've<00:03:17.989> used<00:03:19.239> Thurston<00:03:20.239> Parker

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
far everyone I've used Thurston Parker

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.750 
far everyone I've used Thurston Parker
and<00:03:20.660> coca<00:03:20.959> there<00:03:21.200> they're<00:03:21.890> kicking<00:03:22.220> all<00:03:22.400> seems

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
and coca there they're kicking all seems

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.330 
and coca there they're kicking all seems
about<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.120> same<00:03:23.320> like<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.739> speed<00:03:25.040> the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
about the same like the the speed the

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.960 
about the same like the the speed the
the<00:03:25.730> bar<00:03:25.970> fills<00:03:26.270> up<00:03:26.480> um<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:28.400> might<00:03:28.610> be<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.790> bit

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
the bar fills up um it might be a bit

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.760 
the bar fills up um it might be a bit
different<00:03:29.390> maybe<00:03:29.900> Thurston's<00:03:30.410> was<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.560> bit

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
different maybe Thurston's was a bit

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.800 
different maybe Thurston's was a bit
slower<00:03:31.070> actually<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.060> do<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.239> think<00:03:32.420> thorssons

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
slower actually I do you think thorssons

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.470 
slower actually I do you think thorssons
was<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> bit<00:03:33.110> slower<00:03:33.380> than<00:03:33.590> Parker's<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.520> think

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
was a bit slower than Parker's I think

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.680 
was a bit slower than Parker's I think
Croaker's<00:03:35.870> was<00:03:36.050> pretty<00:03:36.260> slow<00:03:36.620> as<00:03:36.770> well<00:03:37.690> it's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
Croaker's was pretty slow as well it's

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.199 
Croaker's was pretty slow as well it's
hard<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.900> really<00:03:39.020> tell<00:03:39.140> after<00:03:39.590> doing<00:03:39.739> them<00:03:39.980> a

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
hard to really tell after doing them a

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.770 
hard to really tell after doing them a
bit<00:03:41.209> apart<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:42.100> I'm<00:03:43.100> sure<00:03:43.700> I'm<00:03:44.060> sure<00:03:44.090> was<00:03:44.480> kick

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
bit apart but I'm sure I'm sure was kick

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.120 
bit apart but I'm sure I'm sure was kick
is<00:03:44.900> like<00:03:45.050> park<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.410> obviously<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.800> pretty<00:03:45.980> good

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
is like park is obviously a pretty good

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.810 
is like park is obviously a pretty good
kicker<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:46.550> Thurston<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.780> lot<00:03:47.930> better<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.820> so

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
kicker but Thurston is a lot better I so

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.910 
kicker but Thurston is a lot better I so
for<00:03:50.000> kicks<00:03:50.270> left<00:03:50.510> we're<00:03:51.230> on<00:03:51.290> track<00:03:51.440> here<00:03:51.709> so

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
forget I think the one time I did get a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.290 
forget I think the one time I did get a
pretty<00:03:56.300> decent<00:03:56.450> score<00:03:57.110> oh<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.700> was<00:03:59.180> pretty

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
pretty decent score oh I was pretty

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.000 
pretty decent score oh I was pretty
good<00:03:59.390> actually<00:03:59.600> the<00:04:00.320> one<00:04:00.470> time<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.650> did<00:04:00.860> get<00:04:00.950> a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
good actually the one time I did get a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.740 
good actually the one time I did get a
pretty<00:04:01.130> decent<00:04:01.310> score<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:02.180> got<00:04:02.870> um<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:04.550> did<00:04:04.820> 8<00:04:05.030> 8

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
pretty decent score I got um I did 8 8

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.560 
pretty decent score I got um I did 8 8
kicks<00:04:06.110> from<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.100> Bonas<00:04:07.430> own<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.790> then<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
kicks from the Bonas own and then the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.910 
kicks from the Bonas own and then the
last<00:04:08.780> two<00:04:09.109> were<00:04:09.290> unlike<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.650> highest

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
last two were unlike the highest

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.349 
last two were unlike the highest
difficulty<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.459> just<00:04:10.670> put<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:10.970> straight<00:04:11.150> in

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
difficulty so I just put it straight in

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.440 
difficulty so I just put it straight in
front<00:04:11.570> just<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:11.989> didn't<00:04:12.230> stuff<00:04:12.530> up<00:04:12.739> because

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
front just so I didn't stuff up because

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.289 
front just so I didn't stuff up because
it<00:04:14.140> just<00:04:14.379> takes<00:04:14.530> one<00:04:14.770> stop<00:04:15.069> of<00:04:15.250> stuff<00:04:15.910> up<00:04:16.090> in

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
it just takes one stop of stuff up in

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.879 
it just takes one stop of stuff up in
this<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.690> then<00:04:16.870> you're<00:04:17.200> screwed<00:04:17.380> pretty<00:04:17.650> much

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
this and then you're screwed pretty much

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.039 
this and then you're screwed pretty much
oh<00:04:18.400> done<00:04:18.820> one<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.419> might<00:04:19.570> be<00:04:19.690> perfect

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
oh done one that might be perfect
