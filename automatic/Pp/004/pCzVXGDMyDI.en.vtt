hi there and welcome to cams jungle

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.500 
hi there and welcome to cams jungle
aquaria<00:00:02.669> today<00:00:02.970> I'm<00:00:03.060> going<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.270> be<00:00:03.330> talking

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
aquaria today I'm going to be talking

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.210 
aquaria today I'm going to be talking
about<00:00:03.750> how<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:03.990> dial<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.620> your<00:00:04.740> pressurized

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
about how to dial in your pressurized

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.330 
about how to dial in your pressurized
co2<00:00:05.430> system<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:07.080> this<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.440> method<00:00:07.680> advocated

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
co2 system so this is a method advocated

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.610 
co2 system so this is a method advocated
by<00:00:08.370> Tom<00:00:08.700> Barr<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:10.110> takes<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.410> few<00:00:10.559> weeks

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
by Tom Barr and it takes a few weeks

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.230 
by Tom Barr and it takes a few weeks
depending<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.490> how<00:00:11.730> quickly<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.120> make

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
depending on how quickly you make

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.850 
depending on how quickly you make
adjustments<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.080> how<00:00:13.259> much<00:00:13.650> you're

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
adjustments and how much you're

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.900 
adjustments and how much you're
observing<00:00:14.280> your<00:00:14.370> tank<00:00:14.610> during<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> day<00:00:15.109> but<00:00:16.109> I

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
observing your tank during the day but I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.670 
observing your tank during the day but I
feel<00:00:17.910> like<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.180> really<00:00:18.420> allows<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.529> to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
feel like it really allows you to

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.279 
feel like it really allows you to
maximize<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> co2<00:00:21.240> levels<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.930> your<00:00:22.020> tank

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
maximize the co2 levels in your tank

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.189 
maximize the co2 levels in your tank
without<00:00:22.980> harming<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> fish<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.730> any<00:00:23.850> way<00:00:24.199> so

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
without harming the fish in any way so

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.870 
without harming the fish in any way so
the<00:00:25.350> first<00:00:25.560> step<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:25.980> whole<00:00:26.039> process<00:00:26.400> is

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the first step of this whole process is

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970 
the first step of this whole process is
just<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.240> find<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> starting<00:00:27.779> point<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.410> your

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
just to find a starting point on your

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
just to find a starting point on your
regulator<00:00:29.400> um<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.689> start<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.170> around

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
regulator um I like to start it around

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
regulator um I like to start it around
one<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> two<00:00:31.800> bubbles<00:00:32.219> per<00:00:32.369> second<00:00:32.790> it's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
one to two bubbles per second it's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.650 
one to two bubbles per second it's
usually<00:00:33.840> pretty<00:00:34.170> safe<00:00:35.059> safe<00:00:36.059> starting<00:00:36.450> point

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
usually pretty safe safe starting point

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.459 
usually pretty safe safe starting point
and<00:00:36.930> from<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:39.170> constantly<00:00:40.170> make

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
and from there just constantly make

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.860 
and from there just constantly make
observations<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.340> your<00:00:41.460> tank<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.690> it's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
observations in your tank you know it's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
observations in your tank you know it's
nice<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> drop<00:00:43.770> checker<00:00:44.070> during<00:00:44.489> this

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
nice to have a drop checker during this

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
nice to have a drop checker during this
period<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.469> feel<00:00:46.680> like

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
period of time but I don't feel like

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.250 
period of time but I don't feel like
these<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> most<00:00:47.370> accurate<00:00:47.640> alright<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.960> do

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
these are the most accurate alright I do

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
these are the most accurate alright I do
feel<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.039> fish<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> plants<00:00:51.449> should

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
feel like the fish in the plants should

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
feel like the fish in the plants should
be<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> number<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.020> source<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:54.210> know

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
be a number one source for you know

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.840 
be a number one source for you know
seeing<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.649> co2<00:00:55.920> seen<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> co2

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
seeing what the co2 seen what the co2

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.029 
seeing what the co2 seen what the co2
levels<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.539> they're<00:00:58.530> gonna<00:00:58.649> give<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
levels are at they're gonna give you a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.920 
levels are at they're gonna give you a
more<00:00:59.250> instantaneous<00:00:59.730> response<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> more

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
more instantaneous response and a more

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.070 
more instantaneous response and a more
accurate<00:01:01.140> reading<00:01:02.129> than<00:01:02.489> anything<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
accurate reading than anything like a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.300 
accurate reading than anything like a
drop<00:01:04.350> checker<00:01:04.619> would<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> definitely<00:01:07.310> make

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
drop checker would so definitely make

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
drop checker would so definitely make
your<00:01:08.460> observations<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> fish<00:01:09.780> are

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
your observations if the fish are

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
your observations if the fish are
gasping<00:01:10.560> near<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> surface<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.520> they're

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
gasping near the surface or they're

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
gasping near the surface or they're
they've<00:01:12.510> slowed<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.960> their<00:01:13.080> activity<00:01:13.530> during

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
they've slowed in their activity during

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.570 
they've slowed in their activity during
the<00:01:13.860> day<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.840> you've<00:01:15.990> noticed<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.460> may

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the day that you've noticed then you may

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060 
the day that you've noticed then you may
need<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> increase<00:01:18.180> surface<00:01:18.420> agitation<00:01:19.259> or

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
need to increase surface agitation or

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.260 
need to increase surface agitation or
turn<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:21.330> co2<00:01:22.369> there<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.790> balance

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
turn down your co2 there is a balance

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.170 
turn down your co2 there is a balance
between<00:01:24.390> surface<00:01:24.960> agitation<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.030> pressure<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
between surface agitation and pressure I

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.969 
between surface agitation and pressure I
see<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.840> when<00:01:28.140> you're<00:01:28.229> using<00:01:28.409> pressurized

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
see you in when you're using pressurized

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.670 
see you in when you're using pressurized
co2<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.780> humongous

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
co2 you don't want to have humongous

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.980 
co2 you don't want to have humongous
wave<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.310> across<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.820> water<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.780> do

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
wave going across the water what you do

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.219 
wave going across the water what you do
need<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> small<00:01:35.460> ripple<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.869> keep<00:01:37.020> oxygen

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
need like a small ripple to keep oxygen

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.319 
need like a small ripple to keep oxygen
levels<00:01:37.829> high<00:01:38.070> enough<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:39.240> I've

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
levels high enough I think I've

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.609 
levels high enough I think I've
mentioned<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> previous<00:01:39.930> video<00:01:40.409> but

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
mentioned this in a previous video but

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.819 
mentioned this in a previous video but
oxygen<00:01:41.280> levels<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.970> co2<00:01:42.270> levels<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:43.229> related

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
oxygen levels and co2 levels are related

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
oxygen levels and co2 levels are related
to<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.040> another<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.210> high<00:01:45.390> co2

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
to one another so you can have high co2

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.800 
to one another so you can have high co2
and<00:01:46.259> low<00:01:46.920> oxygen<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.610> high<00:01:47.970> co2<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.720> high

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and low oxygen or high co2 and high

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.880 
and low oxygen or high co2 and high
oxygen<00:01:49.189> those<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:50.430> things<00:01:51.350> are<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.500> related

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
oxygen those two things are not related

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.340 
oxygen those two things are not related
to<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.100> another<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> they're<00:01:54.659> independent<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
to one another so they're independent of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.520 
to one another so they're independent of
one<00:01:55.560> another<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> after<00:01:58.290> you've<00:01:58.409> found

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
one another and so after you've found

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
one another and so after you've found
that<00:01:58.649> starting<00:01:59.100> point<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.579> you've

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that starting point and you you've

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.910 
that starting point and you you've
observed<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.689> tank<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> few<00:02:01.409> days<00:02:01.560> at

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
observed the tank for a few days at

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.550 
observed the tank for a few days at
least<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.540> feel<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.229> turn<00:02:04.409> off

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
least and you feel like you can turn off

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.130 
least and you feel like you can turn off
the<00:02:04.649> co2<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.020> do

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the co2 a little more then you can do

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.469 
the co2 a little more then you can do
that<00:02:07.429> don't<00:02:08.429> turn<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.700> up<00:02:08.789> too<00:02:08.970> much<00:02:09.149> because

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
that don't turn it up too much because

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.900 
that don't turn it up too much because
these<00:02:10.050> quick<00:02:10.319> adjustments<00:02:10.979> will<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.819> know

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
these quick adjustments will you know

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.630 
these quick adjustments will you know
cause<00:02:12.150> algae<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
cause algae and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
cause algae and
obviously<00:02:14.640> they<00:02:14.760> may<00:02:14.880> harm<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.240> fish<00:02:15.390> if<00:02:15.630> you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
obviously they may harm the fish if you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.560 
obviously they may harm the fish if you
turn<00:02:16.080> out<00:02:16.260> too<00:02:16.440> much<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.970> short<00:02:18.210> period<00:02:18.270> of

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
turn out too much in a short period of

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.810 
turn out too much in a short period of
time<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.130> definitely<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.280> patience<00:02:20.730> with

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
time so definitely have patience with

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.840 
time so definitely have patience with
this<00:02:20.970> process<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.280> eventually<00:02:23.280> you'll<00:02:23.760> find

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
this process and eventually you'll find

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.080 
this process and eventually you'll find
the<00:02:24.180> point<00:02:24.420> where<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:25.290> know<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.560> you've

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
the point where you know that you've

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.270 
the point where you know that you've
you're<00:02:27.090> injecting<00:02:27.870> too<00:02:28.380> much<00:02:28.530> co2<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
you're injecting too much co2 and the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.180 
you're injecting too much co2 and the
fish<00:02:29.490> are<00:02:29.700> suffering<00:02:30.630> from<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.260> then

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
fish are suffering from that and then

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.949 
fish are suffering from that and then
you<00:02:32.310> can<00:02:32.459> turn<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.700> down<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:33.240> little<00:02:33.450> bit<00:02:33.660> and

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
you can turn it down a little bit and

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.400 
you can turn it down a little bit and
that<00:02:34.680> will<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:35.010> your<00:02:35.340> maximum<00:02:36.170> amount<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
that will be your maximum amount in the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.340 
that will be your maximum amount in the
tank<00:02:38.510> if<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.750> any<00:02:39.870> questions<00:02:40.230> about

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
tank if you have any questions about

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.680 
tank if you have any questions about
this<00:02:40.650> process<00:02:41.000> then<00:02:42.000> leave<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
this process then leave that in the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.490 
this process then leave that in the
comments<00:02:43.050> below

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
comments below

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.700
