this from my experience and from a
research<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.969> done<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.629> three<00:00:39.809> most

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020

common ways of removing hair down there

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.569 
common ways of removing hair down there
is<00:00:41.640> shaving<00:00:41.940> waxing<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.690> lasering<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.160> shaving

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
is shaving waxing or lasering so shaving

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
is shaving waxing or lasering so shaving
obviously<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.870> easiest<00:00:46.289> way<00:00:46.530> because

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
obviously is the easiest way because

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.250 
obviously is the easiest way because
most<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> us<00:00:47.640> probably<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.239> razor<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.870> can

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
should use a mirror because you don't

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.960 
should use a mirror because you don't
want<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.899> cut<00:01:46.140> yourself<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> can

want to cut yourself like because I can

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.420 
want to cut yourself like because I can

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
get tricky and messy and we don't need a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.330 
get tricky and messy and we don't need a
bloody<00:01:50.729> situation<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.530> shower<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.159> that's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
bloody situation in the shower so that's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.190 
bloody situation in the shower so that's
one<00:01:53.579> way<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.000> shaving<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> easiest

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
one way is shaving it is the easiest

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.410 
one way is shaving it is the easiest
it's<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.890> because<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.340> convenient<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it's good because it's convenient and it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
it's good because it's convenient and it
also<00:01:57.600> doesn't<00:01:57.930> give<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> ingrown<00:01:58.860> hairs

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
also doesn't give a lot of ingrown hairs

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.249 
also doesn't give a lot of ingrown hairs
that<00:01:59.369> waxing<00:01:59.759> does<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> next<00:02:00.630> option<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that waxing does so the next option is

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
that waxing does so the next option is
waxing<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.310> either<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.060> bikini

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
in the back but um but you still have

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.210

like<00:02:18.780> some<00:02:19.140> hair<00:02:19.440> down<00:02:19.800> there

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
like some hair down there

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.190 
like some hair down there
a<00:02:20.250> Brazilian<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.360> other<00:02:21.510> hand<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.930> where

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
a Brazilian on the other hand is where

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.680 
a Brazilian on the other hand is where
all<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.740> hair<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.190> removed<00:02:23.820> now<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.180> benefit

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
all the hair is removed now the benefit

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.240 
all the hair is removed now the benefit
of<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.560> lasts<00:02:25.830> longer<00:02:26.100> than

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
of it is that it lasts longer than

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.460 
of it is that it lasts longer than
shaving<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.150> lasts<00:02:27.330> maybe<00:02:27.540> couple<00:02:28.080> weeks

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
shaving so it lasts maybe couple weeks

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.670 
shaving so it lasts maybe couple weeks
two<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.860> three<00:02:29.160> weeks<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.170> hair<00:02:31.380> grows

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
two to three weeks and the hair grows

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680 
two to three weeks and the hair grows
back<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:32.010> lot<00:02:32.250> finer<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.090> don't<00:02:33.390> need<00:02:33.540> to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
back a lot finer so you don't need to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.650 
back a lot finer so you don't need to
worry<00:02:33.870> about<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:35.130> stubble<00:02:35.850> coming<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.420> and

worry about like stubble coming in and
itchiness<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.410> growing<00:02:37.740> back<00:02:37.980> however<00:02:38.640> I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
sensitive you can't really work out that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.199 
sensitive you can't really work out that
day<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.580> don't<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:56.850> any<00:02:57.030> moisture

because when you wax the wax pulls out
the<00:03:03.690> entire<00:03:04.340> hairpiece<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.640> then<00:03:06.540> your<00:03:06.690> skin

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
sometimes like grows over it and then

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.030 
sometimes like grows over it and then
the<00:03:09.420> newer<00:03:09.660> hair<00:03:09.990> like<00:03:10.350> from<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> root<00:03:10.830> kind

the newer hair like from the root kind

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.470 
the newer hair like from the root kind
of<00:03:11.100> gets<00:03:11.220> trapped<00:03:11.580> into<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.209> get

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480

necessary precaution to make sure you're
not<00:03:19.350> getting<00:03:19.560> ingrown<00:03:20.010> hairs<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.790> actually

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
not getting ingrown hairs so I actually

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.690 
not getting ingrown hairs so I actually
think<00:03:21.720> out<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.170> these<00:03:22.410> three<00:03:22.739> ways<00:03:22.950> waxing<00:03:23.610> is

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
think out of these three ways waxing is

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.120 
think out of these three ways waxing is
probably<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.209> worst<00:03:24.420> that's<00:03:25.320> also<00:03:25.709> pretty

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
probably the worst that's also pretty

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.940 
probably the worst that's also pretty
expensive<00:03:26.519> it's<00:03:26.910> about<00:03:27.090> maybe<00:03:27.360> 50<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.050> $60<00:03:28.650> per

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
expensive it's about maybe 50 to $60 per

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.070 
expensive it's about maybe 50 to $60 per
waxing<00:03:29.400> session<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.600> can<00:03:30.810> be<00:03:30.930> very

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
waxing session so it can be very

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.500 
waxing session so it can be very
expensive<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.890> upkeep<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.880> third<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.390> my

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
expensive to upkeep the third and my

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.070 
expensive to upkeep the third and my
favorite<00:03:33.930> weight<00:03:34.080> is<00:03:34.350> laser<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:36.450> how<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> laser

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
favorite weight is laser so how a laser

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.110 
favorite weight is laser so how a laser
works<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:38.190> laser<00:03:38.489> beam<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.940> light

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
works is that this laser beam of light

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.670 
works is that this laser beam of light
will<00:03:39.269> destroy<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.750> melanin<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.440> hair

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
will destroy the melanin and a hair

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.380 
will destroy the melanin and a hair
follicle<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.400> then<00:03:41.550> eventually<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.239> hair

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
follicle and then eventually the hair

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.330 
follicle and then eventually the hair
follicle<00:03:42.780> will<00:03:42.900> fall<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.470> die<00:03:43.680> out<00:03:43.980> so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
follicle will fall and die out so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.580 
follicle will fall and die out so
lasering<00:03:45.060> only<00:03:45.420> works<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:46.080> have<00:03:46.110> light

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
lasering only works if you have light

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.310 
lasering only works if you have light
skin<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.040> dark<00:03:47.280> hair<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.180> will<00:03:48.660> not<00:03:48.840> work<00:03:49.080> if

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
skin and dark hair it will not work if

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.740 
skin and dark hair it will not work if
you<00:03:49.500> have<00:03:49.769> light<00:03:50.340> hair<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.760> light<00:03:51.269> skin<00:03:51.480> or

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
you have light hair and light skin or

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.190 
you have light hair and light skin or
dark<00:03:52.620> skin<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.340> let<00:03:53.580> her<00:03:53.730> or<00:03:53.910> dark<00:03:54.150> hair<00:03:54.390> the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
dark skin and let her or dark hair the

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.979 
dark skin and let her or dark hair the
reason<00:03:55.530> being<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.980> because<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:57.450> cannot<00:03:57.720> put<00:03:57.959> a

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
reason being is because you cannot put a

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.660 
reason being is because you cannot put a
laser<00:03:58.260> against<00:03:58.769> someone<00:03:59.010> with<00:03:59.040> dark<00:03:59.310> skin<00:03:59.640> or

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
laser against someone with dark skin or

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.430 
laser against someone with dark skin or
else<00:03:59.910> you're<00:04:00.180> going<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.330> get<00:04:00.540> all<00:04:00.690> patchy<00:04:00.959> and

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
else you're going to get all patchy and

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.860 
else you're going to get all patchy and
it's<00:04:02.280> just<00:04:02.459> not<00:04:02.640> good<00:04:02.880> for<00:04:03.180> someone<00:04:03.360> with<00:04:03.600> dark

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
it's just not good for someone with dark

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.530 
it's just not good for someone with dark
skin<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.470> also<00:04:05.010> if<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.760> have<00:04:05.940> light<00:04:06.239> hair

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
skin and also if you have light hair

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.120 
skin and also if you have light hair
you're<00:04:06.959> not<00:04:06.989> going<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.290> have<00:04:07.380> enough<00:04:07.620> melanin

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
you're not going to have enough melanin

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.860 
you're not going to have enough melanin
in<00:04:08.250> there<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.580> make<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.880> hair<00:04:09.090> falls<00:04:09.600> out<00:04:09.840> and

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
in there to make the hair falls out and

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.759 
in there to make the hair falls out and
stop<00:04:10.230> growing

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
stop growing

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.240 
stop growing
um<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.720> thing<00:04:12.870> about<00:04:13.110> laser<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.100> is

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
um the thing about laser is that it is

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.000 
um the thing about laser is that it is
pretty<00:04:14.670> expensive<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.450> can<00:04:15.570> be<00:04:15.630> about<00:04:16.010> $1,500

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
pretty expensive it can be about $1,500

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.070 
pretty expensive it can be about $1,500
for<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.640> entire<00:04:17.970> treatment<00:04:18.330> so<00:04:18.630> you're<00:04:18.780> going

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
for the entire treatment so you're going

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.610 
for the entire treatment so you're going
to<00:04:19.290> need<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:20.340> have<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.519> lot<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:20.970> treatments<00:04:21.750> so

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
to need to have a lot of treatments so

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.469 
to need to have a lot of treatments so
that<00:04:22.770> way<00:04:22.890> when<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.490> hair<00:04:23.760> new<00:04:23.970> hair<00:04:24.180> grows

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
that way when the hair new hair grows

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.360 
that way when the hair new hair grows
out<00:04:24.810> you're<00:04:25.260> going<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.440> kill<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:25.979> then<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
out you're going to kill it and then the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.810 
out you're going to kill it and then the
next<00:04:26.580> train

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
next train

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.950 
next train
with<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.000> new<00:04:27.150> hair<00:04:27.330> girls<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.660> are<00:04:27.780> going<00:04:27.900> to

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
with the new hair girls I are going to

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.090 
with the new hair girls I are going to
kill<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:28.260> you're<00:04:28.410> gonna<00:04:28.500> keep<00:04:28.680> killing<00:04:28.890> it

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
kill it so you're gonna keep killing it

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.580 
kill it so you're gonna keep killing it
until<00:04:29.370> no<00:04:29.580> hair<00:04:29.820> grows<00:04:30.540> out<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.290> can<00:04:31.470> be

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
until no hair grows out so that can be

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.550 
until no hair grows out so that can be
anywhere<00:04:31.860> from<00:04:31.920> $1,500<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:32.990> $2,000<00:04:33.990> my

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 my

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.010 
anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 my
girlfriend<00:04:35.250> she<00:04:35.430> got<00:04:35.610> her<00:04:35.850> whole<00:04:36.150> body<00:04:36.690> laser

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
girlfriend she got her whole body laser

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.330 
girlfriend she got her whole body laser
and<00:04:37.230> she<00:04:37.320> said<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.590> cost<00:04:37.800> ten<00:04:38.040> thousand

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
and she said it cost ten thousand

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
and she said it cost ten thousand
dollars<00:04:38.580> but<00:04:38.700> she<00:04:38.820> said<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.030> was<00:04:39.060> like<00:04:39.240> the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
dollars but she said it was like the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.630 
dollars but she said it was like the
best<00:04:39.570> investment<00:04:40.560> she's<00:04:40.800> ever<00:04:41.010> made

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
best investment she's ever made

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.930 
best investment she's ever made
so<00:04:41.760> with<00:04:42.090> laser<00:04:43.130> what<00:04:44.130> they<00:04:44.220> have<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.580> do<00:04:44.790> is

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
so with laser what they have you do is

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.700 
so with laser what they have you do is
they<00:04:45.030> have<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.390> kind<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.660> remove<00:04:46.230> all<00:04:46.470> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
they have you kind of remove all the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.760 
they have you kind of remove all the
hair<00:04:46.950> down<00:04:47.610> there<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.150> then<00:04:48.810> they're<00:04:49.590> gonna

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
hair down there and then they're gonna

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.900 
hair down there and then they're gonna
you're<00:04:50.100> going<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.280> go<00:04:50.430> in<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.700> they're<00:04:50.790> going

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
you're going to go in and they're going

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.730 
you're going to go in and they're going
to<00:04:50.970> take<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.300> laser<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.900> basically<00:04:52.320> laser

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
to take that laser and basically laser

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.790 
to take that laser and basically laser
all<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.460> area<00:04:53.730> out<00:04:54.210> now<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.050> will<00:04:55.530> say

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
all of that area out now I will say

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.970 
all of that area out now I will say
laser<00:04:56.130> II<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.900> probably<00:04:57.900> more<00:04:58.290> painful<00:04:58.890> at

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
laser II is probably more painful at

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.120 
laser II is probably more painful at
least<00:04:59.130> for<00:04:59.430> me<00:04:59.610> than<00:05:00.420> waxing<00:05:01.170> because<00:05:01.380> it's

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
least for me than waxing because it's

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.490 
least for me than waxing because it's
just<00:05:02.430> like<00:05:02.580> beams<00:05:02.940> of<00:05:03.240> like<00:05:03.390> shock<00:05:04.050> kind<00:05:04.410> of

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
just like beams of like shock kind of

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.530 
just like beams of like shock kind of
going<00:05:04.800> at<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.160> but<00:05:05.790> it's<00:05:05.910> so<00:05:06.120> worth<00:05:06.360> it

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
going at you but it's so worth it

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.360 
going at you but it's so worth it
because<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:07.200> don't<00:05:07.470> get<00:05:07.560> ingrown<00:05:07.980> hairs<00:05:08.220> and

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
because you don't get ingrown hairs and

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.300 
because you don't get ingrown hairs and
the<00:05:08.790> hair<00:05:09.000> grows<00:05:09.240> back<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.690> lot<00:05:10.020> slower<00:05:10.470> so<00:05:11.190> the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
the hair grows back a lot slower so the

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.340 
the hair grows back a lot slower so the
hair<00:05:11.490> will<00:05:11.670> take<00:05:11.940> maybe<00:05:12.120> a<00:05:12.270> month<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:13.110> grow

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
hair will take maybe a month to grow

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.080 
hair will take maybe a month to grow
back<00:05:13.620> or<00:05:13.950> like<00:05:14.190> two<00:05:14.400> months<00:05:14.640> to<00:05:14.730> grow<00:05:14.850> back

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
back or like two months to grow back

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.090 
back or like two months to grow back
fully<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.660> by<00:05:16.110> then<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.500> will<00:05:16.620> have<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.950> have

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
fully and by then you will have to have

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.070 
fully and by then you will have to have
your<00:05:17.250> next<00:05:17.520> laser<00:05:17.880> treatment<00:05:18.480> to<00:05:18.660> get<00:05:18.840> rid<00:05:18.900> of

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
your next laser treatment to get rid of

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.690 
your next laser treatment to get rid of
that<00:05:19.260> all<00:05:19.500> that<00:05:19.680> you<00:05:19.830> hair<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:20.250> comes<00:05:20.490> out

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
that all that you hair that comes out

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.690 
that all that you hair that comes out
and<00:05:21.170> hopefully<00:05:22.170> eventually<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:23.310> will<00:05:23.460> not

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
and hopefully eventually you will not

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.960 
and hopefully eventually you will not
have<00:05:24.090> any<00:05:24.240> regrowth<00:05:24.840> in<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:25.320> area<00:05:25.730> also<00:05:26.730> the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
have any regrowth in that area also the

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.240 
have any regrowth in that area also the
thing<00:05:27.150> about<00:05:27.360> lasering<00:05:27.900> is<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.260> I<00:05:28.440> had<00:05:28.800> my

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
thing about lasering is that I had my

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.640 
thing about lasering is that I had my
like<00:05:29.820> legs<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.480> bikini<00:05:30.810> lasered<00:05:31.260> at<00:05:31.440> one

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
like legs and bikini lasered at one

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.830 
like legs and bikini lasered at one
place<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.610> spent<00:05:32.880> quite<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.210> bit<00:05:33.300> of<00:05:33.630> money

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
place and I spent quite a bit of money

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.680 
place and I spent quite a bit of money
there<00:05:33.990> but<00:05:34.200> my<00:05:34.920> hair<00:05:35.130> grew<00:05:35.460> back<00:05:35.490> Mike<00:05:36.300> all<00:05:36.540> my

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
there but my hair grew back Mike all my

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.630 
there but my hair grew back Mike all my
hair<00:05:36.870> grew<00:05:37.080> back<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:37.530> I<00:05:38.070> just<00:05:38.250> felt<00:05:38.430> like<00:05:38.460> it

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
hair grew back and I just felt like it

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.530 
hair grew back and I just felt like it
was<00:05:38.760> such<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:38.970> waste<00:05:39.210> of<00:05:39.330> money<00:05:39.420> and

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
was such a waste of money and

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.540 
was such a waste of money and
disappointment<00:05:40.380> at<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.620> laser<00:05:41.100> place<00:05:41.430> I

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
disappointment at a laser place I

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.890 
disappointment at a laser place I
thought<00:05:41.730> Laser<00:05:42.060> wasn't<00:05:42.360> going<00:05:42.480> to<00:05:42.540> work<00:05:42.690> for

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
thought Laser wasn't going to work for

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.950 
thought Laser wasn't going to work for
me<00:05:43.250> but<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.280> think<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.700> really<00:05:44.790> depends<00:05:45.240> on<00:05:45.360> who

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
me but I think it really depends on who

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.390 
me but I think it really depends on who
you<00:05:46.080> go<00:05:46.230> to<00:05:46.290> so<00:05:46.650> you<00:05:46.680> know<00:05:46.860> check<00:05:47.100> the<00:05:47.250> reviews
