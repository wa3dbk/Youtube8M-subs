00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.520 
to get it but um you know it's still in
its<00:00:49.890> doable<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.230> instead<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
its doable and instead of going to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.020 
its doable and instead of going to
private<00:00:52.829> match<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.280> show<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.489> guys<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.910> the

clips with using each gun online so you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.630
