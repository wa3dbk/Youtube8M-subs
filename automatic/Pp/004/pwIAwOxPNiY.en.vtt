00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
at it again typical new behavior will

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.889 
at it again typical new behavior will
not<00:01:48.189> stop<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:48.999> once<00:01:49.210> or<00:01:49.359> twice<00:01:49.390> but<00:01:49.749> they'll

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
not stop and once or twice but they'll

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.959 
not stop and once or twice but they'll
do<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.170> same<00:01:50.200> thing<00:01:50.679> over<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.369> over<00:01:51.429> again

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
do the same thing over and over again

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.529 
do the same thing over and over again
here<00:01:52.929> we<00:01:53.049> have<00:01:53.079> a<00:01:53.259> spawning<00:01:53.820> standing<00:01:54.820> looking

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
here we have a spawning standing looking

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.630 
here we have a spawning standing looking
around<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:56.020> nothing<00:01:56.469> and<00:01:56.740> then<00:01:57.249> promptly

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
around it nothing and then promptly

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.859 
around it nothing and then promptly
getting<00:01:58.119> murdered

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
getting murdered

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.109 
getting murdered
it's<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.319> shame<00:01:59.590> now<00:02:00.219> we've<00:02:00.369> gone<00:02:00.549> and<00:02:00.759> planted

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
it's a shame now we've gone and planted

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.819 
it's a shame now we've gone and planted
a<00:02:01.210> camera<00:02:01.359> in<00:02:01.719> the<00:02:01.929> bushes<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.530> now<00:02:02.679> we're

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
a camera in the bushes and now we're

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.770 
a camera in the bushes and now we're
hoping<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.219> see<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.759> new<00:02:03.789> plate<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.509> his

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
hoping to see the new plate on his

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.929 
hoping to see the new plate on his
predators<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:05.890> don't<00:02:05.950> believe<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:06.700> but

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
predators and I don't believe this but

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.300 
predators and I don't believe this but
it<00:02:07.840> seems<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.350> new<00:02:08.380> doesn't<00:02:08.800> even<00:02:08.920> see<00:02:09.190> the

it seems the new doesn't even see the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.620 
it seems the new doesn't even see the
enemy<00:02:09.490> this<00:02:10.060> is

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630

the new may in fact be useful he kills

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.430 
the new may in fact be useful he kills
another<00:03:06.880> teammate<00:03:07.600> only<00:03:07.930> before<00:03:08.230> being

lastly I think we're gonna be able to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.850 
lastly I think we're gonna be able to
find<00:03:13.150> what<00:03:13.540> Kramer<00:03:13.870> has<00:03:14.050> been<00:03:14.230> aiming<00:03:14.440> at<00:03:14.650> in

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
find what Kramer has been aiming at in

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.880 
find what Kramer has been aiming at in
the<00:03:14.950> sky<00:03:15.280> let's<00:03:15.970> see<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.210> he<00:03:16.300> Luck's<00:03:16.480> on<00:03:16.720> no<00:03:17.650> it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
the sky let's see if he Luck's on no it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.830 
the sky let's see if he Luck's on no it
seems<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.400> just<00:03:18.610> another<00:03:18.910> tree<00:03:19.300> perhaps

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
seems to be just another tree perhaps
