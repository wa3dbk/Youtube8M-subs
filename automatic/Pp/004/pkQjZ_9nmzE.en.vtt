00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.290
 they are already 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.390
 many pay 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.090
 have been with those footballers 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:18.610
 I throw 54 13 5 2 4 2 3 1 and so on 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.340
 what is it all about? 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.119
 now it's about the arrangement of the players 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.520
 on the field 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.890
 You have to keep in mind a football field 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.660
 over 7000 square meters and they 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.910
 have ten field players and a goalkeeper 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.490
 to arrange on it 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.100
 I'm attacking today is 442 because 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.520
 it is the basis of the modern game we are 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:46.149
 have four defender four 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.890
 midfielders and two strikers in 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.670
 the defense has become the four-chain 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.780
 enforced it is currently 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.300
 state-of-the-art because you're four 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.309
 defensive players best the entire 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.410
 can cover wide 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.170
 there are also teams of three 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.190
 defensive players or with 5 but 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.440
 These are exceptions 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.410
 This is followed by the midfield 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.020
 with four players also two more 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.650
 striker forward we look at the system 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.610
 throughout we have to make the ball 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.220
 we spread the game 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.700
 the full backs pull to the line 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.100
 a striker lends himself to one 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.220
 midfielder lets himself go forward 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.229
 fall we play against the ball pulls 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.860
 the team is condensed together 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.049
 The rooms make it narrow and short 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.350
 Let's look at the tasks in a 4 4 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.020
 2 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.390
 we have two defenders one 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.549
 left and right you build that 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.759
 but most of all they have to play 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.299
 task the center on the defensive too 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.700
 hold 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.979
 the two full backs have both 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.979
 defensive as well as offensive tasks 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.810
 The same applies to midfield here too 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.149
 the central players are those 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.600
 which provide for defensive stability 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.990
 have to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.170
 the two wing players but the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.729
 Striker assist shooting at goals 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.410
 the two strikers have in the ideal case 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.870
 different characters 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.250
 we have a rather strong game of 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.260
 to fall into midfield and 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.569
 his player feeds with templates and 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.269
 we have a real midfielder who 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.380
 waiting in the penalty area for the templates and 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.210
 then pure 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.730
 the 4 4 2 is on the one hand a classic 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.060
 In England has become a football magazine 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.820
 named after vor.foto on the other hand 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.800
 it is the basis of the modern game many 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.260
 youth teams exercise the 4-4-2 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.940
 because it's easy to learn 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.180
 can play a lot of games with it as well 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.490
 win titles see ac milan end of 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.310
 80's at the beginning of the 90's with arrigo 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.140
 sacchi that perfects the 4-4-2 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.210
 have those until a few years ago 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.750
 most top teams with 4 4 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.450
 2 played in recent years 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.160
 trainer this system but 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.650
 differentiated spain world and 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.100
 For example, europameister plays with 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.600
 a 4 3 3 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.230
 the German national team under 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.300
 joachim lÃ¶w with a 4 2 3 1 and that 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.280
 the same system also plays bavaria 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.330
 Munich and the german champion 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.330
 Borussia Dortmund
