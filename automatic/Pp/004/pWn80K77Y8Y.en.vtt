probably<00:04:08.560> 98%<00:04:09.490> of<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.670> time<00:04:09.850> we<00:04:10.000> were

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.480 
together it's just really neat because
we<00:04:12.850> got<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.150> ask<00:04:13.330> each<00:04:13.660> other<00:04:13.870> questions<00:04:14.490> hate

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
to be able to relate and learn from each

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.940 
to be able to relate and learn from each
other<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:18.160> really<00:04:18.910> respect<00:04:19.540> her<00:04:19.660> it<00:04:20.440> goes<00:04:20.620> both

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950

ways<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.180> that's<00:04:22.720> why<00:04:22.900> we<00:04:23.050> got<00:04:23.260> along<00:04:23.500> so

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
ways and and that's why we got along so

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.250 
ways and and that's why we got along so
well<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.880> don't<00:04:25.420> think<00:04:25.630> he<00:04:25.750> could<00:04:25.930> have<00:04:26.050> gone

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
well so I don't think he could have gone

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.310 
well so I don't think he could have gone
any<00:04:26.680> better<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.910> know<00:04:28.030> we<00:04:28.540> didn't<00:04:29.080> want<00:04:29.260> to
