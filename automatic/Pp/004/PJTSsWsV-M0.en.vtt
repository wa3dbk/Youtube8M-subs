the first thing you do is you get a bowl
of<00:00:31.940> salt<00:00:32.360> water<00:00:32.660> I<00:00:32.990> usually<00:00:33.620> use<00:00:33.800> a<00:00:33.830> mother

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
of salt water I usually use a mother

tank that the corals are coming from it
just<00:00:36.950> absolutely<00:00:37.220> makes<00:00:37.850> them<00:00:38.060> not<00:00:38.210> go

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
just absolutely makes them not go

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.640 
just absolutely makes them not go
through<00:00:38.630> any<00:00:38.780> more<00:00:39.020> stress<00:00:39.230> than<00:00:39.470> is

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
through any more stress than is

one<00:01:57.800> thing<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.220> try<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.670> do<00:01:58.970> is<00:01:59.240> keep<00:01:59.630> the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
one thing that I try and do is keep the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.500 
one thing that I try and do is keep the
heads<00:02:00.619> in<00:02:00.950> different<00:02:01.369> areas<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.330> tell

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
heads in different areas so I can tell

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.000 
heads in different areas so I can tell
them<00:02:02.600> apart<00:02:02.630> cuz<00:02:03.080> sometimes<00:02:03.290> when<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:03.770> cut

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
them apart cuz sometimes when you cut

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.910 
them apart cuz sometimes when you cut
them<00:02:04.130> they<00:02:04.729> all<00:02:04.910> start<00:02:05.210> looking<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.600> same

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
them they all start looking the same

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.080 
them they all start looking the same
another<00:02:06.920> thing<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.220> really<00:02:07.369> important<00:02:07.910> one

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
another thing is really important one

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.150 
another thing is really important one
another<00:02:08.720> trick<00:02:08.990> would<00:02:09.200> be<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.350> chant<00:02:09.830> colored

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
another trick would be to chant colored

reason<00:03:30.640> why<00:03:30.730> i<00:03:30.819> said<00:03:31.150> don't<00:03:31.360> want<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.720> Xenia

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
reason why i said don't want the Xenia

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.479 
reason why i said don't want the Xenia
to<00:03:32.140> go<00:03:32.260> through<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.590> holes<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.040> netting

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
to go through the holes of the netting

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.460 
to go through the holes of the netting
is<00:03:33.610> because<00:03:33.940> then<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.209> lose<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.599> to<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.870> pumps

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
is because then you lose it to the pumps

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.710 
is because then you lose it to the pumps
up<00:03:35.620> our<00:03:35.769> heads<00:03:36.099> and<00:03:36.519> so<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:37.450> way<00:03:37.690> I

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
up our heads and so on and this way I

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.380 
up our heads and so on and this way I
definitely<00:03:38.319> have<00:03:38.650> control<00:03:39.069> over<00:03:39.360> where<00:03:40.360> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
definitely have control over where the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.380 
definitely have control over where the
baby<00:03:41.230> stays<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.819> really<00:03:43.060> does

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390

attached there's different sizing
nettings<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.599> you<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:46.900> use<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.140> actually<00:03:47.500> go

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
nettings that you can use to actually go

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
smaller cuttings I just don't think

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.280 
smaller cuttings I just don't think
there's<00:03:51.940> enough<00:03:52.180> air<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.630> goes<00:03:52.750> through<00:03:53.080> it

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
there's enough air that goes through it

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.770 
there's enough air that goes through it
to<00:03:53.500> keep<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.920> really<00:03:54.100> healthy<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.480> size

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
to keep it really healthy this is a size

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.080 
to keep it really healthy this is a size
I<00:03:55.989> like<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.739> vital<00:03:57.040> ville<00:03:57.220> netting<00:03:57.640> this

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
I like of the vital ville netting this

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.550 
I like of the vital ville netting this
is<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.359> size<00:03:58.600> of<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.870> cutting<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.320> like

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
is the size of the cutting I like

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.009 
is the size of the cutting I like
another<00:04:00.280> thing<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.670> consider<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:01.120> how<00:04:01.540> fast

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
another thing to consider is how fast
