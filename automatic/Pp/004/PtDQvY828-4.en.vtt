00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.640
 wonderful instrument and very funny 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.940
 It is very easy to learn to play and 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.150
 execute so 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.860
 the ukulele is worth today we are going to talk about 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.730
 ukulele instrument of truth that is 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.500
 very easy to play 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.279
 in this case we are going to use a 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.050
 majado 320 sg let's learn how 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.550
 to refine we're going to learn what they are 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.290
 the parts you have and some chords 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.920
 for this singing a song so 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.750
 nothing do not miss this step 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.850
 an easy-to-play instrument easy to 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.800
 Learn to play songs with a simple 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.690
 harmonic circle you touch infinity of 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.440
 songs of consists of four strings 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.440
 OK 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.399
 the parts very similar to a guitar 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.640
 let's tell him he has his pegbox 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:04.350
 the bridge the fretboard the match one 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.350
 harmonic box such that it has a sound 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.930
 very particular of the particular sound is 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.210
 should 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.080
 to the shape that is tuned has four 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 strings correspond to the sun 2000 and the is 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.440
 true also that there is another kind of 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.650
 open tunings that can tune 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.790
 the different 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.710
 let's say in sun 2000 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.830
 the particularity particularity that 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.450
 this has is that the rope above does not 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.180
 it's like the case of the guitar that is the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.680
 more expensive 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.680
 but it is the most acute 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.520
 then in the case of that generates that 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.520
 so particular dream 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.850
 It is very easy tuning is 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.130
 practically like picking up a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.170
 seed in the fifth fret of a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.670
 classical or electric guitar and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
 last four strings 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.950
 would be the tuning of the ukulele with the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.880
 difference that this rope would be a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.400
 eighth highest 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.400
 the sun that mistreats us 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.840
 in seville the last four strings 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.840
 okay and do this 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.459
 difference that this is only an octave 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.459
 higher 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.880
 that's how that purpose in Luque 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.110
 is that 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.670
 so 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.420
 and so the tuning of what is 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.650
 is 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.650
 They are 2000 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.700
 a little bit of some chords as he will play 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.680
 with a song like making a base 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.660
 rhythmic even if you do not know how to play 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.280
 instrument I assure you that the least of 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.110
 the weeks of an occasion 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.110
 and if you do not do well then
