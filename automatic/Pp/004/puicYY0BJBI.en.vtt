systems for you we just got the one this
one<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.519> house<00:00:08.670> today

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
one in the house today

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.970 
one in the house today
and<00:00:11.179> difference<00:00:12.179> from<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.690> 3000<00:00:13.620> model<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
and difference from the 3000 model is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.519 
and difference from the 3000 model is
that<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.730> new<00:00:15.690> needle<00:00:16.230> guidance

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
that you have this new needle guidance

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.099 
that you have this new needle guidance
system<00:00:16.859> which<00:00:17.539> uses<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.930> magnetic<00:00:19.470> field<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
system which uses the magnetic field to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.150 
system which uses the magnetic field to
to<00:00:22.109> work<00:00:22.410> find<00:00:23.279> your<00:00:23.430> needle<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.890> this<00:00:25.890> little

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
to work find your needle so this little

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.359 
to work find your needle so this little
feel<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> play<00:00:28.080> down<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.289> indicates<00:00:28.890> if

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
feel this play down here indicates if

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.880 
feel this play down here indicates if
you're<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> green<00:00:30.240> field<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.710> can

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you're in the green field that you can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.979 
you're in the green field that you can
use<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.279> Beatles<00:00:32.579> needle<00:00:33.090> science<00:00:33.600> system

use your Beatles needle science system
if<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.739> example<00:00:35.160> come<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> probe

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
if you for example come with the probe

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.819 
if you for example come with the probe
close<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> screen<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.500> see<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
close to the screen you will see that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.220 
close to the screen you will see that
you're<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.520> into<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> red<00:00:39.300> field<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:39.930> close

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you're going into the red field or close

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.389 
you're going into the red field or close
to<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.530> magnetizer

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
to the magnetizer

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.000 
to the magnetizer
you<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.530> where<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.860> not

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you will see that this is where you not

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.100 
you will see that this is where you not
want<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> clock<00:00:45.840> or

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
want to go so if you have a clock or

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.500 
want to go so if you have a clock or
something<00:00:46.280> with<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> magnetic<00:00:47.820> field<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
something with a magnetic field it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.369 
something with a magnetic field it
probably<00:00:48.930> will<00:00:49.230> interrupt<00:00:49.760> your<00:00:50.760> field<00:00:51.350> okay

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
probably will interrupt your field okay

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
probably will interrupt your field okay
first<00:00:53.100> thing<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.120> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
let's just get started the display at

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.260 
let's just get started the display at
the<00:02:04.170> moment<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.799> shows<00:02:05.009> me<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:06.000> depth

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the moment it shows me that the depth

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.570 
the moment it shows me that the depth
here<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.770> until<00:02:07.770> 4<00:02:08.069> centimeters

here is until 4 centimeters

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.170 
here is until 4 centimeters
I'm<00:02:11.580> gonna<00:02:11.760> set<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.209> probe<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.720> my<00:02:13.640> mini<00:02:14.640> sim

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.699 

and<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:21.060> by<00:02:21.180> placing<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.959> finger<00:02:22.530> on

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
and I can just by placing the finger on

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.520 
and I can just by placing the finger on
the<00:02:22.830> screen<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.780> change<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.020> contrast

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the screen I can change the contrast

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.559 
the screen I can change the contrast
which<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.920> shown<00:02:26.190> up<00:02:26.430> here<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.819> shows<00:02:27.000> me<00:02:27.060> for

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
which is shown up here it shows me for

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.870 
which is shown up here it shows me for
right<00:02:27.840> now<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.410> wanted<00:02:29.280> maybe<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.580> little<00:02:29.790> bit

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
right now I wanted maybe a little bit

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.030 
right now I wanted maybe a little bit
lighter<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.209> I'm<00:02:30.269> gonna<00:02:30.390> go<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.630> three<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.260> I'm

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
lighter so I'm gonna go to three and I'm

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.710 
lighter so I'm gonna go to three and I'm
not<00:02:32.340> quite<00:02:32.580> satisfied<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.330> depths<00:02:33.630> I

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
not quite satisfied with the depths I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.479 
not quite satisfied with the depths I
think<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:34.319> three<00:02:34.560> centimeters<00:02:35.160> would<00:02:35.310> be

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
think like three centimeters would be

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.270 
think like three centimeters would be
enough<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:35.910> I'm<00:02:35.970> gonna<00:02:36.180> go<00:02:36.360> down<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.280> three

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
enough so I'm gonna go down to three

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.509 
enough so I'm gonna go down to three
centimeters<00:02:38.700> shown<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.569> here<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.019> screen

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
centimeters shown up here in the screen

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.940 
centimeters shown up here in the screen
okay<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:42.090> here<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.840> now<00:02:43.110> maybe<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> nerve

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
okay so here I have now maybe a nerve

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.390 
okay so here I have now maybe a nerve
maybe<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.450> Veen<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.140> I'm<00:02:47.010> gonna<00:02:47.160> use

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
maybe this is a Veen and I'm gonna use

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.390 
maybe this is a Veen and I'm gonna use
this<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:48.480> target<00:02:48.930> first<00:02:49.470> I'm<00:02:49.890> gonna<00:02:50.160> use

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
this one to target first I'm gonna use

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.900 
this one to target first I'm gonna use
the<00:02:50.670> outline<00:02:51.620> technique<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.280> here<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.730> my

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
the outline technique so here is my

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.150 
the outline technique so here is my
needle<00:02:54.299> in<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:55.130> magnet<00:02:56.130> fire<00:02:56.370> from<00:02:57.500> isono<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
needle in the magnet fire from isono and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.430 
needle in the magnet fire from isono and
I'm<00:02:59.400> gonna<00:03:01.910> come<00:03:02.910> close<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.870> probe<00:03:04.170> right

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
I'm gonna come close to the probe right

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.440 
I'm gonna come close to the probe right
now<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.069> I'm<00:03:05.700> gonna<00:03:05.880> go<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.989> skin<00:03:07.230> now<00:03:07.410> and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
now and I'm gonna go on the skin now and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.050 
now and I'm gonna go on the skin now and
the<00:03:09.450> tractor<00:03:09.959> e-guide<00:03:10.319> shows<00:03:10.799> me<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the tractor e-guide shows me the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.300 
the tractor e-guide shows me the
direction<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.019> go<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.620> find<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
direction I have to go in to find the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.120 
direction I have to go in to find the
beam<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.810> I'm<00:03:15.930> gonna<00:03:16.079> place<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.440> through<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
beam so I'm gonna place it through the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.259 
beam so I'm gonna place it through the
my<00:03:17.940> target<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.540> then<00:03:18.660> I'm<00:03:18.780> gonna<00:03:19.370> go<00:03:20.370> north

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
my target and then I'm gonna go north

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.740 
my target and then I'm gonna go north
with<00:03:21.299> my<00:03:21.870> probe<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.920> be<00:03:23.609> sure<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.420> red

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
with my probe and be sure that the red

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.430 
with my probe and be sure that the red
field<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.319> now<00:03:25.609> in<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.940> beam<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.200> what<00:03:28.350> I'm

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
field is now in the beam so what I'm

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.800 
field is now in the beam so what I'm
gonna<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.769> now<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:28.950> just<00:03:32.060> keep<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.390> beam<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
gonna do now I just keep the beam and

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.140 
gonna do now I just keep the beam and
focus<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> red<00:03:34.859> field<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.670> beam<00:03:35.819> and

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
focus and the red field in the beam and

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.110 
focus and the red field in the beam and
I'm<00:03:36.329> gonna<00:03:36.540> push<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.989> needle<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.500> until<00:03:38.120> until

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
I'm gonna push the needle in until until

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.099 
I'm gonna push the needle in until until
the<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:40.590> red<00:03:40.799> field<00:03:41.760> screen<00:03:42.030> now<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.239> can<00:03:42.569> feel

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
the the red field screen now I can feel

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.620 
the the red field screen now I can feel
that<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.410> went<00:03:43.709> through<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.040> vessel<00:03:44.340> wall<00:03:44.519> and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
that I went through the vessel wall and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.690 
that I went through the vessel wall and
I'm<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.109> vessel<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:47.250> also<00:03:47.489> is

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
I'm in the vessel and this also is

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.730 
I'm in the vessel and this also is
indicated<00:03:48.209> by<00:03:48.239> them<00:03:48.859> green<00:03:49.859> field<00:03:50.190> right<00:03:50.459> here
