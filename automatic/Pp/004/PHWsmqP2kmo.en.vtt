alone 3500 you're telling me just
because<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.159> curve<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.330> made<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
because the curve that's what made it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.140 
because the curve that's what made it
possible<00:01:21.830> no<00:01:22.830> actually<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.759> purpose<00:01:24.119> and

possible no actually the purpose and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.149 
possible no actually the purpose and
what<00:01:24.360> made<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.600> possible<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:25.500> made<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> more

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
what made it possible that made it more

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.399 
what made it possible that made it more
difficult<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.090> 3,500<00:01:27.600> milliamps<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
difficult to get 3,500 milliamps in

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.620 
difficult to get 3,500 milliamps in
their<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.360> square<00:01:30.360> peg<00:01:30.570> round

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
their kind of like a square peg round

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.230 
their kind of like a square peg round
hole<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.920> had<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.340> curved<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.790> flat<00:01:33.060> we

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
hole so if we had it curved in flat we

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
hole so if we had it curved in flat we
would<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.450> had<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.350> thicker

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
would have had to make it much thicker

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.679 
would have had to make it much thicker
to<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.240> had<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> work

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
to get it in there so we had to work

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
to get it in there so we had to work
with<00:01:36.869> our<00:01:36.990> team<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.500> curve<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.549> keep<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

curved shape so ok let's talk about the
curve<00:01:53.850> most<00:01:54.659> smart<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.170> said<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.500> the

speaking<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.390> cameras<00:03:21.900> what<00:03:22.020> we<00:03:22.170> got<00:03:22.320> here<00:03:22.560> 13

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
speaking of cameras what we got here 13

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.490 
speaking of cameras what we got here 13
megapixel<00:03:23.790> camera<00:03:24.180> what's<00:03:24.810> unique<00:03:25.170> about<00:03:25.320> it

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
megapixel camera what's unique about it

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.190 
megapixel camera what's unique about it
is<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.310> does<00:03:26.490> have<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:27.030> large<00:03:27.660> active

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
is that it does have a large active

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.930 
is that it does have a large active
pixel<00:03:28.440> sensor<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.250> typically<00:03:29.610> you've<00:03:29.790> got

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
pixel sensor so typically you've got

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.340 
pixel sensor so typically you've got
your<00:03:30.060> active<00:03:30.360> pixel<00:03:30.540> sensor<00:03:30.780> next<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.320> a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
your active pixel sensor next to a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.440 
your active pixel sensor next to a
circuit<00:03:31.770> board<00:03:31.890> well<00:03:32.460> what<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:32.850> decided<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.300> do

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
circuit board well what we decided to do

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.240 
circuit board well what we decided to do
was<00:03:33.600> actually<00:03:34.020> layer<00:03:34.320> them<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.620> top<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:35.010> each

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
was actually layer them on top of each

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.130 
was actually layer them on top of each
other<00:03:35.460> you're<00:03:36.120> going<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.420> get<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.600> larger

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140

the light here is going to turn green

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.969 
the light here is going to turn green
when<00:04:18.669> it's<00:04:18.880> focused<00:04:19.479> in<00:04:19.630> on<00:04:19.720> my<00:04:19.930> face<00:04:20.259> so<00:04:20.859> you

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
display is beautiful what are we looking

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.659 
display is beautiful what are we looking
at<00:04:27.190> it's<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.819> six<00:04:28.630> inch<00:04:28.930> OLED<00:04:29.470> display<00:04:29.949> what<00:04:30.639> I

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
at it's a six inch OLED display what I

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.100 
at it's a six inch OLED display what I
really<00:04:30.970> like<00:04:31.150> about<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.539> displays<00:04:31.900> the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
really like about the displays the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.680 
really like about the displays the
display<00:04:32.470> itself<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:33.160> screen<00:04:33.490> it's<00:04:33.789> flexible

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
display itself the screen it's flexible

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.809 
display itself the screen it's flexible
now<00:04:35.139> it's<00:04:35.500> also<00:04:35.710> housed<00:04:36.069> in<00:04:36.340> gorilla<00:04:36.669> glass

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
now it's also housed in gorilla glass

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.450 
now it's also housed in gorilla glass
and<00:04:37.120> plastic<00:04:37.569> but<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.050> does<00:04:38.319> make<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.889> make

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
and plastic but it does make it a make

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.460 
and plastic but it does make it a make
for<00:04:39.669> a<00:04:39.699> very<00:04:39.759> unique<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:40.930> really<00:04:41.110> allows
