00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 so much to space 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.810
 seven years before he detected in this face 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.869
 extraordinary three-dimensional 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.319
 what are we going to see more closely and in front 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.850
 that is, these alleged the lawyer already in the second the areas less 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.189
 Similary 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.189
 three-dimensional is actually an image 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.579
 e of a cd 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.429
 percent the mode on the crop hood as I dare to say this 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.429
 Well, I dare say it because an experiment was done 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.280
 p the fiscal 11 6 points 6 pixels 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.860
 and you can observe 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.340
 that this face 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.900
 create effects of light and shadow as seen here believe that touched appeared a real being 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.570
 from the straw nose the shadow of the mouth you can see that the source of light is 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.110
 top right 45 degrees 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.450
 that this is 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.330
 who captured his image 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.720
 and plasma because the original image is the one in sight I lose 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.370
 inside and to the right the image appears with this filter that is extraordinary 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.640
 this how you could hide that information that appears in the two 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.560
 figures of the two images these from the center to the right if it comes from side to 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.460
 left side I say it's impossible and it's a strong demonstration of 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.430
 that this comes from other intelligences but it did not stop there 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.830
 four days later, as if I wanted the skewers, I'm going to ask whoever answers this 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.430
 message eight decades of this group ohio was part of it 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.440
 this response appears 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.560
 what 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.520
 Brazil looks like a boy 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.600
 computer 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.060
 something somebody realized that it was something very similar 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.880
 aa to the message sent by fran peek and will marry to space 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.220
 what is this 27 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.970
 percent forgiveness of 16 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.180
 July 1974 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.080
 here you have it how it was coded here you have the right side answer and 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.290
 on the left side you have 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.960
 efe the original message 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.910
 I'm here we have a lot of information these heroes tells us it will be done 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.910
 delivery of the silicon their bodies that are hybrids 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:18.049
 mÃ©ndez just like ours that his sd genome fulfilled 48 consequences of 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.409
 nucleotides more extensive than ours its form 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.659
 e the number of zeros more than 5 billion people living in two 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.699
 planets four moons and finally the artifact with which they sent pd then 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.949
 is
