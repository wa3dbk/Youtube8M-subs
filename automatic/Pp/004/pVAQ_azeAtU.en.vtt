 You can see I'm going to give an island in the corner. 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.189
 but you can see the three blue lines 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.950
 it's red 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.930
 You have to destroy that is the goal. 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.560
 main battle mode 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.619
 in this human way we have the classes 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.670
 and it's five class the demolisher class 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.980
 Medical tank sniper and bazooka I go 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.890

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.659
 tank 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.599
 his skill is that he has more hp 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.879
 because other players the doctor the hp 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.310
 regenerates them is little by little is 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.579
 connected because port takes damage there is 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.889
 this hp is going up according to the time 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.590
 The shooter has more ammo and 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.310
 accelerated recharging of weapons and 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.859
 bazooka the power of rpg is increased to 1 e 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.739

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.049
 beauty I have already mentioned the standard skills 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.639
 now I'll talk about the skills 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.889
 active for those who do not know the active age 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.930
 It's the skill that you get her. 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.730
 said that in five levels 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.709
 and I did not say levels yet, but I'm going 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.159
 Talk, you will understand but only 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.939
 recapitulating here and we are going to assume that 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.519
 You pick the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th level and you 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.780
 can you make your ufpa available 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.689

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.700
 You'll use ofe, and you can only now. 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.120
 I got skill and try again with 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.229
 ten levels and thus 15 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.530
 levels and such 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:28.870
 It's as you can see it's the active life of 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.780
 demolisher is the c4 pumps activated by 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.120
 The remote control of the tank is the 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.819
 April giving force received and it is 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.760
 immune attack and a doctor to 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.280
 his active ability is that he come 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.970
 grenades healing allies and venom 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.340
 enemies 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.680
 the shooter increases the accuracy of 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.409
 firearms and a bazooka lance 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.259
 rockets rpg like i said you guys are 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:57.280
 main object of this game mode is 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:59.229
 You can destroy the towers more 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.430
 how can you see a sea on the map and 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:04.180
 many are connected 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.680
 is so much and grb l is the same number 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.269
 Only you can see I'm going to zoom in and out. 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.250
 on the map again 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.470
 you will see that at the ends of the 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.049
 map time was a castle is connected 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.819
 This is what we do what your 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.349
 object you have to destroy go out 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.750
 only for you to arrive and you have to 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:22.180
 passing by the towers will have these 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.570
 businesses at the end of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.460
 map is the satellite that is as if 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.170
 it was the heart that you have to 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.930
 get this 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.200
 as I said now little I said about 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.780
 levels is increasing and it is 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.880
 against what you're killing and I think 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.920
 which according to time is about this 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.230
 level business and I do not know very well 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.600
 have and I just know so the kind if you 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.700
 get level 5 you release your 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.250
 ability you have your skill in 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.530
 f you as you could if you use 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.210
 yours is you can only use after five 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.550
 books or when you are in the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.640
 level 10 and so on at level 15 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.500
 the levels are also responsible for 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.720
 define your backup time 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.430
 as incredible as it seems expensive 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.470
 the higher your level the greater your time and 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.720
 he replied when I saw him arrive 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.450
 even play is on is the time 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.430
 but the maximum time you can reach in 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.670
 restoration is 30 seconds 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.720
 in this mode it is very similar that no 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.430
 zombie mode 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.760
 in this mode you can win 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.850
 rewards these rewards are kind 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.800
 card cards of eg 10% of 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.530
 extra gain for secondary streets 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.100
 you can also get jewelry and all the 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.680
 ies items is for the purpose of improving your 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.230
 capacity guys my opinion on 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.000
 this new game mode there I liked the 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.490
 linked to a different noise is now a 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.800
 Business that's like that for me and it's not going to work. 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.030
 make a lot of difference because and I have 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.290
 sure that for many players too 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.960
 it will not make much difference because 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.120
 many players like the style of play 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.370
 class is linked is confrontation of 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.990
 Team Seek and Destroy and Destroy 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.780
 this I think is more focused and 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.530
 Relaxed to rest because tomorrow is mine. 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.180
 Ceglia will be playing against boot 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.370
 trying to destroy or I think this 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.310
 This is not my beach, is not it? 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.800
 there is a big question about whether 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.150
 the fps of this map and marshall not for 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.450
 cause of this the paper full of 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.390
 details is my fps got normal 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.880
 The way it was, it did not go down much and more. 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.100
 I did not know that quality stuff 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.350
 tighten up is to get a belly under 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.900
 that you can set the quality of the 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.610
 map and yet a great deal of pressure 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.470
 dropped a lot unless it was exhausted 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.320
 I thought you 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.240
 And dude, like I said, it's a business that 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.310
 It will not make much difference for me 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.070
 handsome beauty also arriving at 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.980
 end of the video and I want to ask for one more 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.050
 since then I apologize if something is wrong 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.240
 because that's a lot of information that way 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.820
 very complicated is very detailed 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.460
 connected and as it is as I said I had 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.370
 very little contact with either a module 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.750
 It's because I just have to do this. 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.460
