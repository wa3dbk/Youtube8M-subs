Jimbo's<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.090> work<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> tried<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> full

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Jimbo's to work I tried it with the full

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.280 
Jimbo's to work I tried it with the full
black<00:01:07.650> shots<00:01:07.920> mod<00:01:08.159> pack<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.670> didn't<00:01:08.909> work

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
black shots mod pack and it didn't work

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
black shots mod pack and it didn't work
I<00:01:10.430> even<00:01:11.430> tried<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.060> start<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> game

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I even tried it to start the game

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
I even tried it to start the game
without<00:01:12.720> XVM<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.220> didn't<00:01:14.430> work<00:01:14.460> either

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
without XVM and that didn't work either

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
without XVM and that didn't work either

so I i went with just Jimbo's here just

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.460

because<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.670> Jimbo's<00:01:18.259> it's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.439> easier

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
because I like Jimbo's it's a lot easier

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.800 
because I like Jimbo's it's a lot easier
to<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.159> kind<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.630> shot<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.659> have

autoloader<00:02:16.209> tanks<00:02:16.630> which<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.080> like<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
autoloader tanks which is just like the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.240 
autoloader tanks which is just like the
French<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.819> instead<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.180> instead<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:21.069> auto

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
French so instead of instead of the auto

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.400 
French so instead of instead of the auto
the<00:02:21.760> rammer<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.270> went<00:02:22.480> with<00:02:22.600> coated<00:02:22.930> optics<00:02:23.050> so

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
the rammer I went with coated optics so

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.910 
the rammer I went with coated optics so
i<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:23.800> plus<00:02:24.400> ten<00:02:24.550> percent<00:02:24.850> on<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> move

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
i can have plus ten percent on the move

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.840 
i can have plus ten percent on the move
it's<00:02:26.920> pretty<00:02:27.130> nice<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.819> brown<00:02:29.489> with<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:30.640> tank

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
it's pretty nice so brown with this tank

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.120 
it's pretty nice so brown with this tank
you<00:02:30.970> do<00:02:31.090> have<00:02:31.269> some<00:02:31.930> okay<00:02:32.350> armor<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.890> front

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
you do have some okay armor in the front

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.150 
you do have some okay armor in the front
so<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:34.019> kind<00:02:35.019> of<00:02:35.080> want<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.440> angle<00:02:35.739> your<00:02:35.860> armor

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
so you kind of want to angle your armor

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.710 
so you kind of want to angle your armor
correctly<00:02:36.550> not<00:02:36.730> do<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.000> side<00:02:37.209> armor<00:02:37.510> thing

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
correctly not do the side armor thing

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.660 
correctly not do the side armor thing
French<00:02:38.560> tanks<00:02:38.830> your<00:02:39.100> armor<00:02:39.310> doesn't<00:02:39.400> really

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
French tanks your armor doesn't really

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.190 
French tanks your armor doesn't really
matter<00:02:39.850> too<00:02:40.090> much<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.480> getting<00:02:40.690> behind<00:02:40.840> cover

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
matter too much so getting behind cover

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.160 
matter too much so getting behind cover
is<00:02:41.470> probably<00:02:41.800> better<00:02:42.030> but<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.510> these<00:02:43.630> tanks

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
is probably better but for these tanks

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.120 
is probably better but for these tanks
it's<00:02:44.920> fine<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.540> he<00:02:46.660> gets<00:02:46.810> jacked<00:02:47.080> up<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.980> least

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
it's fine and he gets jacked up at least

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.509 
it's fine and he gets jacked up at least
this<00:02:48.519> at<00:02:48.940> least<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.810> tier<00:02:50.019> 10<00:02:50.440> heavy<00:02:50.800> the

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
this at least the the tier 10 heavy the

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.870 
this at least the the tier 10 heavy the
tier<00:02:51.760> 9<00:02:52.320> autoloader<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.650> does<00:02:54.070> not<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.640> has<00:02:54.850> a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
tier 9 autoloader it does not it has a

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.309 
tier 9 autoloader it does not it has a
lot<00:02:55.180> more<00:02:55.209> mobility<00:02:55.630> was<00:02:56.019> getting<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.290> was

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
lot more mobility was getting I was

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.220 
lot more mobility was getting I was
getting<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.650> up<00:02:56.739> like<00:02:56.920> 50<00:02:57.220> km/h<00:02:57.880> but<00:02:58.870> it's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
getting it up like 50 km/h but it's

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.570 
getting it up like 50 km/h but it's
probably<00:02:59.650> doesn't<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.040> as<00:03:00.130> much<00:03:00.220> armor

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
probably doesn't have as much armor

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.890 
probably doesn't have as much armor
definitely<00:03:00.940> take<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> peek<00:03:01.299> at<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.750> got<00:03:01.870> a

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
definitely take a peek at it you got a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.080 
definitely take a peek at it you got a
lucky<00:03:02.049> shot<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.440> me<00:03:02.500> there<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.100> track<00:03:06.090> so

lucky shot on me there with the track so

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.759 
lucky shot on me there with the track so
with<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.299> only<00:03:07.450> only<00:03:07.750> problem<00:03:08.230> with<00:03:08.380> having

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
with the only only problem with having

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.220 
with the only only problem with having
four<00:03:09.220> shells<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:10.209> when<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.660> get<00:03:10.900> in<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.079> fight

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
four shells is when you get in a fight

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.870 
four shells is when you get in a fight
and<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.530> only<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.769> like<00:03:11.890> two<00:03:12.280> one<00:03:12.640> or<00:03:12.760> two

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
want to load up another full clip

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.220 
want to load up another full clip
because<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.910> really<00:03:19.570> difficult<00:03:19.780> when<00:03:20.110> you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
because it's really difficult when you

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.380 
because it's really difficult when you
ticket<00:03:20.769> one<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.220> one<00:03:21.400> shot<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.700> take<00:03:22.090> and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
ticket one you have one shot to take and

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.289 
ticket one you have one shot to take and
then<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.200> enemy<00:03:23.470> has<00:03:23.680> like<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.070> minute<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.519> get

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
then the enemy has like a minute to get

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.420 
then the enemy has like a minute to get
in<00:03:25.390> your<00:03:25.510> face<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.049> take<00:03:26.890> shots<00:03:27.160> on<00:03:27.340> you

you're going to see in a little bit here

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.390 
you're going to see in a little bit here
how<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.410> works<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:29.890> i<00:03:29.920> only<00:03:30.040> have<00:03:30.220> three

and the cost of repairs on this tank is
pretty<00:05:55.409> cheap<00:05:55.620> at<00:05:55.800> 24,000<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.580> didn't<00:05:56.789> think

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
pretty cheap at 24,000 I didn't think

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.020 
pretty cheap at 24,000 I didn't think
that<00:05:57.060> was<00:05:57.150> that<00:05:57.300> high<00:05:58.190> so<00:05:59.190> also<00:05:59.490> looking<00:05:59.970> at

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
that was that high so also looking at

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.360 
that was that high so also looking at
