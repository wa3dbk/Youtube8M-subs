 mm 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.589
 % 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.660
 I've always been taught who pays his debts gets rich and that's good I 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.770
 do not understand why this angry summer why not repay the debt 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.789
 since we know that we have the technical means to make tickets to 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.080
 the basis of principles on the machine in high school why we speak not forget 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.720
 than to pay back then that's it 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.950
 after a jog at 1 because he was ready for inflation minus one 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.540
 once an inflation at one knee following rl double-click sterols passed me I 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.270
 put a little balm anelka all in Martinique 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.820
 and I signed so it's impossible we do not dismiss ajar where he 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.610
 owns in Argentina 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.860
 at cambridge 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.130
 niemeyer side of the goods of the earth the city surface of things with the aja 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.270
 do not worry country of the hands downs of this little country dikes 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 branded handbags just like that but I can also most of the time 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.940
 these money problems the head is a quarter of the feet certainly the problem 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.820
 with the yankees to import the aja because already client of freeze pass have 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.800
 already made a name 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.140
 and here in relation to the solution I meant 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.940
 azam could not we stop to agen 7 we do not have money 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.950
 that if we do not talk to no risk and to assure others again - 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.220
 Toussaint 0 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.210
 and not just for and to pay for things and happy town a veto like that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.840
 we pile up money problems in less loans to commit time it was 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.800
 less serious anyway I find 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.080
 kassa aissi to the afp before that the party does the mayor to palliate term 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.860
 it's this character or so it's a little like yesterday for his friends with 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.140
 Castaldi balls of schools will not have evolved 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.930
 I find the problem with the changeover to the euro is that the flashes 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.020
 recently profited that m as commercial said is that massa but that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 I stop last pascal with the way too many brakes 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.800
 he maintained he asks 42 euros is to say that he multiply and polar 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.860
 wages by six it's not if it's someone who has a lot and wants it 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.360
 to say then that we people who donate crafts did not multiply to 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 what it did not help these savages it's like that the hobo at this 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.429
 level that m 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.109
 it's true trap not so much the nacelle of the saone
