00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:05.645
Welcome to another
fantastic episode of...

00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:09.179
...Five Games Five Minutes
from acornelectron.co.uk

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:15.710
CRACK IT! TOWERS is what is
sometimes known as "edutainment".

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:18.897
A game which attempts to
combine education with fun.

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:22.276
This game is almost a case
study in how to do it well.

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:25.381
You're charged with entering
the castle of Count Crack It...

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:27.902
...and getting your mits
on seven of his keys.

00:00:28.503 --> 00:00:31.014
These seven keys unlock
the mysterious room eight.

00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:33.331
That sounds quite
simple a task, ...

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:35.569
...but you do need to read
the instructions too, ...

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:37.466
...else you're not going
to survive very long.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:41.574
CRACK IT! TOWERS features
lots and lots of subgames.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.815
There are many ways
of acquiring keys...

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.936
...and just as many
to lose them again!

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:48.987
Most subgames either
require mental arithmetic...

00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.148
...or for the player to fill in
missing letters, to make progress.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.391
Even the more arcade-
like sections have clues...

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:57.370
...such as coded co-ordinates...

00:00:57.588 --> 00:01:00.198
...so you can make quicker
headway if you use your brain.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.300
The game is aimed at
children up to the age of ten...

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:05.721
...but I still enjoy it at
three times that age.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.320
It constantly keeps
the player on his toes, ...

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:10.307
...with ghosts that kidnap you, ...

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:15.249
...green spiders that will steal your keys unless
you hit the space bar quickly enough, and...

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.690
...all manner of other horrible
nasties that just appear from nowhere.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:23.390
So even though the puzzles are quite
basic, the other elements still make...

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.923
...for a really fun game!

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:28.366
DENIS THROUGH THE DRINKING GLASS.

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:31.801
It's quite one of the strangest
games for the Electron out there.

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:35.150
It's a text adventure which
combines several qualities -

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:39.267
Satire, politics,
poetry and character.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:41.718
Now I'm too young to
remember the political landscape...

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:45.133
...of the early 1980s, but clearly
Margaret and Denis Thatcher...

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.586
...were in Number
10 Downing Street...

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:49.372
...and, according to this
game, Denis liked his ale.

00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:52.040
Playing this game
now is sort of like...

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.980
...trying to enjoy old episodes
of shows like 'Spitting Image'.

00:01:55.487 --> 00:01:58.903
So what was presumably topical
comedy becomes superfluous.

00:01:59.949 --> 00:02:02.024
You're therefore left with a text
adventure that you need to solve...

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.538
...and, coming from the fellows who gave
us HAMPSTEAD and TERRORMOLINOS...

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:08.161
...you can expect it's not
going to be easy-going.

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:09.920
No, far from it.

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:13.396
DENIS THROUGH THE DRINKING
GLASS is UNBELIEVABLY hard.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:16.662
Firstly, you need to remember
to DRINK every ten moves...

00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:17.904
...to avoid sobering up.

00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.513
And the puzzles require
solutions which modern players...

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:22.318
...are NEVER going
to be able to solve.

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:26.355
By all means, check it out for its
absolute peculiarity value alone.

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.392
TRIPLE DECKER 1 is
a compilation of three...

00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:33.218
...programs originally published
in the Electron User magazine.

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:36.117
It retailed at
Â£1.99 and, frankly, ...

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.713
...it's pants!

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:40.832
GRAND PRIX is a laughable,
monochrome overhead racing game...

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:43.677
...where you compete against
three other cars in a five lap race.

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:46.540
Whenever the race starts, you
have to take a few seconds...

00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:48.703
...just to work out
which actual car you are.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.048
Because, of course, all
the cars look identical.

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:52.839
The only way to
win this game...

00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:55.678
...is to stick to the inside lane, and
risk your life on the corners.

00:02:56.174 --> 00:02:59.142
MANIC MOLE is a platform
game, in which you play a mole...

00:02:59.352 --> 00:03:01.016
...searching for his
mole girlfriend.

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:03.126
The essential elements
of a platform game...

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:06.395
...just aren't here - there are no
roaming nasties, for example.

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.651
The playability comes from
working out a 'safe' route...

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:10.852
...across the platforms.

00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:13.236
You might make it as far
as Mavis with perseverence...

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.761
...but the game is just
too boring to try!

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:19.090
DAY AT THE RACES
is like a bad joke.

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:20.827
You simply place
a bet on a horse...

00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:22.584
...and then see
if it wins or not.

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:26.648
The graphics are appalling
and the game is, at best, ...

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.874
...a few hours of some
programmer's spare time!

00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:35.200
SUMMER OLYMPIAD is a rather
ambitious multi-load compendium.

00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:37.249
It includes an open-
ing ceremony demo...

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:41.719
...and games of fencing, triple jump,
skeet-shooting, hurdle jumping and diving.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.889
The aim is to win
the Summer Olympiad.

00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:46.445
And you compete either against
three computer or human players.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.421
Fencing is a first
for the Electron, ...

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.414
...and this is rather
a dandy simulation.

00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:52.916
You have commands for
riposte, parry and lunge...

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.749
...which is a bit unhelpful if you
don't know what these terms mean.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.857
But play the game in the
style of THE LAST NINJA...

00:03:58.045 --> 00:03:59.312
...and you won't
have any problems.

00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:00.871
Triple Jump is next...

00:04:01.014 --> 00:04:02.295
...and is a key-bashing fest.

00:04:02.747 --> 00:04:04.486
The graphics are brilliant,
and really lift a game...

00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:06.147
...that requires
very little skill.

00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:08.953
Take care not to give your-
self Repetitive Strain Injury.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.322
Skeet-shooting is the very
best of the whole compilation.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:15.893
Easy to play, yet tricky to
master and incredibly addictive.

00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:18.680
Managing to hit both
skeets is very satisfying.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.318
Hurdles returns you to key-
bashing, and is rather stressful.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.421
The computer here
always runs beside you...

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:26.364
...and always seems
to be in the lead.

00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:28.350
Finally, we've got Diving.

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:30.751
You take control of a diver
as he plummets earthward...

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.232
...and you try to perform a graceful dive,
tucking and piking when appropriate.

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:36.735
You get extra points for a
smooth entry into the water.

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:39.896
There's very little to complain
about with SUMMER OLYMPIAD...

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:42.881
...but, on the Electron,
it's only available on tape.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.829
And with all of the graphics
and opening screens, ...

00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:47.469
...the loading times are
ASTRONOMICALLY long!

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:49.291
Can't someone
put this on disc?

00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:50.542
Please?!

00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:57.135
ROBOTRON 2084 is a conversion...

00:04:57.266 --> 00:04:59.183
...of the classic Atari
game of the same name.

00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:02.269
You must run, and
blast, everything.

00:05:02.757 --> 00:05:04.689
You can run and fire
at eight different angles...

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:07.730
...and you can fire in any direction
whilst running in a different one!

00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:12.179
This means that you need eight
separate keys just to move around.

00:05:12.597 --> 00:05:15.677
So joystick control is out of
the question, and you need to be...

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.035
...at the level of alertness
that only be achieved by...

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:20.416
...copious amounts of
amphetamine and Red Bull.

00:05:20.646 --> 00:05:22.281
SO I'M TOLD!

00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:26.122
Even then, it's difficult to
live for more than ten seconds.

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:30.433
There's just too many mutant robots
all homing in on you from all angles!

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:33.229
Mind you, that's
precisely the point.

00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:36.260
ROBOTRON 2084 is
a mindless game.

00:05:36.777 --> 00:05:39.056
It's so difficult that, if you
survive a level, you practically...

00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:41.033
...want to add it as an
achievement on your CV.

00:05:42.356 --> 00:05:43.548
It's all slickly
coded though...

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.217
...even if you're
unlikely to get far.

00:05:52.215 --> 00:05:55.679
