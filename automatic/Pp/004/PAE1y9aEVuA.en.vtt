00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
a hidden Tesla first and then I'm going
to<00:01:53.369> build<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.790> air<00:01:54.030> defence<00:01:54.420> over<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> wizard

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
to build my air defence over the wizard

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.679 
to build my air defence over the wizard
tower<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:56.369> because<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.969> air<00:01:57.149> defense<00:01:57.479> has<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
tower just because the air defense has a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.770 
tower just because the air defense has a
shorter<00:01:58.140> builder<00:01:58.500> building<00:01:59.490> time<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
shorter builder building time and I

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
shorter builder building time and I
won't<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.320> wait<00:02:01.469> as<00:02:01.649> long<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:02.219> start

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
won't have to wait as long to start

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.690 
won't have to wait as long to start
building<00:02:02.880> my<00:02:03.030> last<00:02:03.329> defense<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.219> then<00:02:05.219> once

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
building my last defense and then once

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
building my last defense and then once
everything<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.240> built<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.409> ahead<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
everything is built I can go ahead and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.089 
everything is built I can go ahead and
