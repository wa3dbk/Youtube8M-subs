00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
when I first got my troll cutter the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.600 
when I first got my troll cutter the
actual<00:01:51.509> real<00:01:51.930> part<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> outer<00:01:53.189> side

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
actual real part is on the outer side

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.639 
actual real part is on the outer side
and<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.030> inner<00:01:54.240> part<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.380> fake

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and the inner part here is just a fake

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.770 
and the inner part here is just a fake
wheel<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.340> you're<00:01:56.460> rotating<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.570> can

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
wheel so when you're rotating it you can

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.719 
wheel so when you're rotating it you can
see<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.530> outer<00:01:58.979> side<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> only

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
see that the outer side is the only

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.300 
see that the outer side is the only
thing<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.149> actually<00:02:00.360> does<00:02:01.079> rotate<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
thing that actually does rotate for the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.249 
thing that actually does rotate for the
robot<00:02:02.520> mode<00:02:02.880> getting<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.570> utilizes<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
robot mode getting to it utilizes the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
robot mode getting to it utilizes the
exact<00:02:04.590> same<00:02:04.770> transformation<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.640> trail

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
exact same transformation as trail

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.089 
exact same transformation as trail
cutter<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.780> fun<00:02:06.960> transformation<00:02:07.680> that'll

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
cutter it's a fun transformation that'll

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.279 
cutter it's a fun transformation that'll
lead<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.640> guys<00:02:08.910> at<00:02:09.149> home<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.780> experience

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
lead to you guys at home to experience

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.700 
lead to you guys at home to experience
for<00:02:10.410> yourself<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:11.129> taking<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> look

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
for yourself but taking a look

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.290 
for yourself but taking a look
the<00:02:11.830> robot<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.460> see<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.910> colors

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
the robot you can see that the colors

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.360 
the robot you can see that the colors
really<00:02:13.600> do<00:02:13.870> nicely<00:02:14.140> come<00:02:14.530> through<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.040> in

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
really do nicely come through and in

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.920 
really do nicely come through and in
this<00:02:15.490> mode<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.270> where<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.540> see<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
this mode this is where you see the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.630 
this mode this is where you see the
other<00:02:17.050> real<00:02:17.410> big<00:02:17.620> difference<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.370> being

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
other real big difference that being

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.160 
other real big difference that being
that<00:02:18.820> he's<00:02:18.940> got<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> completely<00:02:19.630> different

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
that he's got a completely different

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.900 
that he's got a completely different
head<00:02:20.320> sculpt<00:02:20.770> zooming<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.490> that<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.730> can

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
head sculpt zooming in so that you can

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.520 
head sculpt zooming in so that you can
see<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.240> little<00:02:22.510> bit<00:02:22.600> better<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.320> see

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
see that a little bit better you can see

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.100 
see that a little bit better you can see
that<00:02:23.560> pois<00:02:24.190> utilizes<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.060> more<00:02:25.270> g1<00:02:25.690> look<00:02:25.900> with

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
that pois utilizes the more g1 look with

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.050 
that pois utilizes the more g1 look with
the<00:02:26.260> actual<00:02:26.770> mall<00:02:27.040> play<00:02:27.340> where's<00:02:27.850> trail

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
the actual mall play where's trail

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.820 
the actual mall play where's trail
cutter<00:02:28.270> does<00:02:28.660> not<00:02:28.900> both<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.440> them<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.650> really

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
cutter does not both of them have really

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.470 
cutter does not both of them have really
nice<00:02:30.070> light-piping<00:02:30.310> as<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:30.940> see<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
nice light-piping as you can see the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.390 
nice light-piping as you can see the
blue<00:02:31.960> here<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.560> Cheryl<00:02:32.950> cutter<00:02:33.100> coming

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
blue here on Cheryl cutter coming

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400 
blue here on Cheryl cutter coming
through<00:02:33.580> nicely<00:02:33.820> where<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.660> it's<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.230> little

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
through nicely where is it's a little

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.620 
through nicely where is it's a little
bit<00:02:35.500> harder<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:35.980> see<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.340> hoist<00:02:36.640> that's<00:02:37.270> mostly

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
bit harder to see on hoist that's mostly

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.990 
bit harder to see on hoist that's mostly
because<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.110> choice<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.770> plastic<00:02:39.490> used<00:02:39.700> for

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
because the choice of plastic used for

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.860 
because the choice of plastic used for
it<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.270> kind<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.500> greenish<00:02:42.280> color<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.210> you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
it is kind of a greenish color and you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.960 
it is kind of a greenish color and you
can<00:02:44.110> kind<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.680> see<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:45.040> right<00:02:45.550> there<00:02:45.580> when<00:02:45.940> I

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
can kind of see it right there when I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.030 
can kind of see it right there when I
cover<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.450> up<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> back<00:02:47.020> though<00:02:47.740> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
cover it up on the back though the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.370 
cover it up on the back though the
actual<00:02:48.160> plastic<00:02:48.610> big<00:02:49.090> as<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.510> said<00:02:49.810> 10<00:02:50.110> Ole<00:02:50.260> Miss

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
actual plastic big as I said 10 Ole Miss

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.250 
actual plastic big as I said 10 Ole Miss
has<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.590> green<00:02:50.980> tea<00:02:51.430> sort<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.210> color<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.870> is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
has a green tea sort of color to it is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.140 
has a green tea sort of color to it is
accessory<00:02:53.800> all<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.520> do<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.880> really

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
accessory all you have to do is really

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.020 
accessory all you have to do is really
fold<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.080> itself<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:57.370> create<00:02:57.760> does

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
fold it in on itself and you create does

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.840 
fold it in on itself and you create does
kind<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.780> gun<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.470> suppose<00:02:59.950> where<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.730> can

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
kind of a gun I suppose where you can

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.280 
kind of a gun I suppose where you can
see<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:01.330> top<00:03:01.540> section<00:03:01.840> right<00:03:02.230> here

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
see like the top section right here

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.110 
see like the top section right here
almost<00:03:02.920> being<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.400> trigger<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.850> then<00:03:04.000> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
almost being the trigger and then you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.090 
almost being the trigger and then you
just<00:03:04.330> are<00:03:04.600> not<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> trigger<00:03:05.170> but<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.800> site

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
just are not the trigger but the site

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.190 
just are not the trigger but the site
and<00:03:06.400> then<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.880> just<00:03:07.030> hold<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.510> there<00:03:07.690> it's

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
and then you just hold it in there it's

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.230 
and then you just hold it in there it's
kind<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.530> weird<00:03:08.770> because<00:03:08.980> its<00:03:09.340> upward<00:03:09.580> on<00:03:10.090> an

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
kind of weird because its upward on an

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.270 
kind of weird because its upward on an
angle<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:10.750> if<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:10.990> have<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.920> forearm

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
angle so if you have the the forearm

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.070 
angle so if you have the the forearm
going<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.610> straight<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.180> guns<00:03:13.390> shooting<00:03:13.870> up

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
going on straight the guns shooting up

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080 
going on straight the guns shooting up
so<00:03:14.290> that's<00:03:14.440> really<00:03:14.980> kind<00:03:15.340> of<00:03:15.430> weird<00:03:15.760> that

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
so that's really kind of weird that

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.810 
so that's really kind of weird that
works<00:03:16.330> for<00:03:16.600> me<00:03:16.720> now<00:03:17.230> first<00:03:17.500> articulation<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
works for me now first articulation the

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.820 
works for me now first articulation the
head<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.270> rotates<00:03:19.840> all<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.200> way<00:03:20.290> around<00:03:20.410> on

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
head just rotates all the way around on
