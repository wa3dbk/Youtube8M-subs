 the city executive 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 The first strategic plan has had a prominent role 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.570
 with the implementation of this program began from the beginning of the century 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 a new form of administration 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.600
 for the first time the citizenship was sued their mission of the sip and since 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.630
 want 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.149
 ten years later 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.120
 the excellent result 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.700
 together we have built the dream that we had proposed 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.950
 a strategic plan 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.410
 a process of citizen participation 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.000
 in which he sang private citizens as a representative of the effie of and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.500
 organizations like especially the economic and social patients of the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.349
 city 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.439
 come together to seek a consensus and design the main lines of 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.139
 strategic development as its own name indicates for a city to the medium and 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.549
 long term can be a five year 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.259
 a plus a decade like metrogas 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.469
 Aragon a very good mood 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.650
 Our city 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.580
 he has left behind the past 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.360
 to become a benchmark in terms of sustainability and 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.079
 habitability 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.789
 copernicus 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 They think above all about the economic and social development of the city 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.089
 in Seville for example in this case we have a lot of hair 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.599
 percent approved in 2006 and is in full development with which 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.779
 we can say that the lines just and persimmon will detail even the development 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:05.079
 The urban area of ​​the city is designed but the other is 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.189
 streets above the one of the avenues and the bad lanes 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.599
 people the strategic plan of this case cares about the social future and 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.879
 economic of the city 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.389
 little houses 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.389
 also 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.260
 what we can not imagine a setback in these areas 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.179
 the way forward is marked and now we have the possibility of 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:37.279
 reflect 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.769
 and decide what will be the steps that will take us one until the year 2020 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.089
 the first strategic plan if it is true that there was little to explain to all the 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.530
 world 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.620
 what was the strategic plan and above all had to convince them that 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.280
 that had had also had utility if that time they were to 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.740
 dedicate to the road meetings to the forums that will be hoisted had some 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.340
 I know that the time they are going to devote to the internet to write a proposal is not 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.279
 it was time lost what that 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.370
 was going to be done and of course there was to be a confidence that I think 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:08.559
 finally it was generated 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.969
 in the second technical position that has been much easier 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.430
 e the journey of the first strategic plan, seeing how many of the 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.639
 things almost all the things that were said that were proposed in that plan 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.189
 have been made since the petrolización e sevilla as an aeronautical pole in the 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:29.189
 recovery of the river universal accessibility in a lot of sections 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.280
 that come in our strategic plan the plan the integral plan of the polygon 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.309
 south 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:37.009
 dried was finally put into practice because put in this case 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.990
 when we go with the second dish I tell you 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.539
 the citizens know 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.080
 coombs to the certain science how much we all want from what they propose the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.080
 French dedicated is approved 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.849
 will be realities within the second decade
