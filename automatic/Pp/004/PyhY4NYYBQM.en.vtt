00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 and hello to all but only them fell still 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.190
 a pair of flash or plasticine and boxes 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.480
 started with jumping it when we press 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.570
 forward key and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.519
 and we press in times of space so this is all 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.080
 Dima's training, that is, this is the jump, I 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.680
 so call it groove sheet 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.420
 called 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:36.239
 except from all of them would experience a bit 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:39.360
 harder ie first we compress like 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 we start jumping forward the gap and sharply 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.500
 your code and here we get marfa 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.190
 helps mostly on ghosts very 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:01:03.300
 helps this website write to the opponent and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:07.560
 imperceptibly that is max weber i don't know 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.780
 how best to do so just 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 I show that it is the same 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.010
 jumping the self-propelled shop jump on 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.080
 a box because miss travolta jumps 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.210
 by them experiences of contra key pressing 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.850
 it happens like this we have 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 calmly climb on the double box so 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.930
 I can do it with the help 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.630
 simple flying program that is how 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.400
 we need to do this we jump off 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.549
 about here in this place on the post 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.490
 faces and jump up and down like contour 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 it will look 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:48.060
 so clear show 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:05.039
 can also be straight with beacons 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:05.039
 i.e. space can be even 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:16.720
 benefon and also we can twist different 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:19.360
 sniper side it is very convenient if 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.150
 we land on the ground that shot u 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.739
 we are in my one hundred percent accurate 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.380
 receive savory sayiki please 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.150
 it would be better to show 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.150
 badly 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:35.920
 jump successfully turns to me 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:47.160
 it turns out worse but still show 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:51.730
 maxim please you don't me 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.790
 even let's show how it was done and 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:13.950
 will not work new stage zoom 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:13.950
 not this phase but to do the phase in general 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.960
 let's take 2 just don't have to do 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:41.150
 same 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:43.940
 and this order that it appear to the brain 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.540
 there was no field like this 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.620
