00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.500
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.090
 further consequence of since graffiti 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.650
 tutorials this time we are at the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.840
 artist the cent we are still 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.690
 outside with 3d on the wall and this time 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.890
 with a pro yes then tell me 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.060
 little to you you have one too 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.669
 facebook page and do 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.630
 I'm the adria 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.579
 these are almost 40 years old since 20 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.160
 graffiti has me at some point 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.050
 determined then after the 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.250
 cooking education short time later then 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.890
 actually painter too 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.480
 become 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.430
 once it's up and running well things go bad 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.340
 So we are here in Cologne at one 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.900
 recyclinghof and I have only this time 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.840
 painted a background the adrian had 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.210
 3d painted and everything I join you 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.280
 You could basically have brought 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 Throw the heap if you know how 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.869
 adrian 3ds does not work either 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.729
 really but I take the liberty 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.680
 to illuminate as I want that is 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.390
 Basically you should stop it 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.610
 Photorealism arises or really does 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.040
 3d acts you should pay attention that 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.360
 a light source stop there is the right 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.829
 put it over in the upper left corner and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.219
 Accordingly, stop light and shadow 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.289
 put it that most effectively it 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.549
 But there are also still like the six 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.780
 ever said the dramatic 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.310
 then you look for yourself 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.200
 corner points or certain nice points 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.749
 beautiful structures and the 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.819
 one lit up according to lust and mood and 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:36.020
 in the end I'm also on 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.490
 gone after I saw that 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.810
 also really blatant artist dyne 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.520
 Assist and others are doing really awesome 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.350
 sometimes light freely after snout light 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 and just the style or the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.439
 whatever object is done there 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.530
 then with it also much more or much 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.909
 smaller expression of your persistence 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.709
 after a dash and thread comes from the left 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.819
 the shadow is still on the right side 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.439
 does not have to be so so 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.020
 It may be that much illogical 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.340
 appears on the picture on the me 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.490
 in the end only really like that 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.900
 Freedom said yes and I think so 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.459
 we also put great on top 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.930
 Of course we had almost the whole time 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.690
 That's why we're standing now 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.520
 under a tree for the o-ton but how 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.930
 always long talk looks at you 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.459
 we wish you a lot of fun 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.900
 Take care of yourself until next time 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.900
 sack and the cent 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.160
 O
