00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.900
Welcome to the 30-day challenge to improve your position.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.320
I am Hester Bransen from Riders’ Feeling.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.080
And today I am talking about the sitting and rising trot, and in particular the transition between both trots.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:27.060
If you find the transition difficult between sitting and rising trot, or between rising and sitting trot,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.640
it is good to practice a lot to get better at it.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:41.120
It is better to do it not randomly, but to know exactly how many steps you are going to sit the trot and how many steps you are going to post the trot.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.260
For example: 4 steps sitting and 4 steps rising trot.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.420
It helps if you count out loud to make sure you it goes well.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.080
You count when you sit the first time 1, then you don’t count when you stand, and then you count 2 when you sit again.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.920
You can count for example to 4, 8, 10, etc. thus to an even number.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.560
As long as you begin to sit or post the trot on an even number, you will always post on the correct diagonal in the transition between sitting and rising trot.

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.681
So you don’t need to concentrate on that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.040
It already helps a lot to sit only a few steps and to post only a few steps.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:31.540
What you can also do to train this transition is to sit and stand two steps instead of one.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.840
This is quite difficult, so you need to practice a while before you succeed.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.500
But I am sure that you can get good at it if you exercise for a couple of days in a row.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.640
Perhaps you have a few other nice tips yourself?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.800
Practice makes perfect, I wish you a lot of success.

00:01:54.916 --> 00:02:00.336
1, 2, 3, 4...

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.640
In short, to improve the way you follow your horse’s rhythm in both the sitting and rising trot,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.200
you need to practice a lot of transitions between the sitting and rising trot.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.460
Then you will understand and feel your horse’s rhythm much better.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.040
So practice and make sure you get good at it.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.998
Good luck!
