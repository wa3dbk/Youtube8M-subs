blogs done that and today I thought

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
blogs done that and today I thought

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
because it was kind of hard to do the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
because it was kind of hard to do the
picture<00:00:40.079> tutorial<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> blog<00:00:40.980> I'd<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.430> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
then now you have it may be hard to see

but you have like quadrants you have
four<00:01:41.340> different<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:42.500> quadrants<00:01:43.500> inside

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
four different little quadrants inside

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.480 
four different little quadrants inside
your<00:01:43.979> circle

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
your circle

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.590 
your circle
working<00:01:45.360> within<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> quadrants<00:01:47.600> fold

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
working within one of the quadrants fold

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.069 
working within one of the quadrants fold
the<00:01:48.869> edge<00:01:49.020> down<00:01:49.340> from<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.850> fold<00:01:51.180> mark<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the edge down from one fold mark to the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.969 
the edge down from one fold mark to the
other<00:01:52.229> fold<00:01:52.560> mark<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.439> then<00:01:55.439> use<00:01:55.619> your<00:01:55.649> bone

other fold mark and then use your bone
folder<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.399> smooth<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
folder to smooth it and then on the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.859 
folder to smooth it and then on the
quadrant<00:01:59.670> right<00:01:59.880> beside<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> you're<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
quadrant right beside it you're going to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.120 
quadrant right beside it you're going to
do<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> same<00:02:01.259> thing<00:02:02.149> just<00:02:03.149> fold<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:04.130> until

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
do the same thing just fold it up until

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.990 
do the same thing just fold it up until
you<00:02:05.219> get<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.890> other<00:02:07.890> fold<00:02:08.340> line

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
you get to the other fold line

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.970 
you get to the other fold line
and<00:02:11.000> then<00:02:11.240> smooth<00:02:11.510> down<00:02:11.780> your<00:02:12.020> fold<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.590> then

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
and then smooth down your fold and then

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.680 
and then smooth down your fold and then
you're<00:02:13.100> going<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.250> flip<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.790> over<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.570> it's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
you're going to flip it over so it's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.240 
you're going to flip it over so it's
going<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.870> look<00:02:14.990> like<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.680> then<00:02:15.890> flip<00:02:16.220> it

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
going to look like this and then flip it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.000 
going to look like this and then flip it
over<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:17.260> then<00:02:18.260> you're<00:02:18.380> going<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> take<00:02:18.740> this

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
over and then you're going to take this

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.860 
over and then you're going to take this
edge<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.370> bring<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> your<00:02:20.210> center<00:02:20.630> fold

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
edge and bring it to your center fold

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.970 
edge and bring it to your center fold
line<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.580> just<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:25.360> smooth<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.510> down

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
line so just like that smooth it down

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.710 
line so just like that smooth it down
and<00:02:27.980> then<00:02:28.670> do<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.970> same<00:02:29.150> thing<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.660> other

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
side so just bring bring this fold line

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.100 
side so just bring bring this fold line
right<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.870> center<00:02:36.340> where<00:02:37.340> your<00:02:38.020> where<00:02:39.020> you

one<00:03:00.200> way<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.980> these<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.240> then<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.630> go<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
one way of these and then to go in the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.210 
one way of these and then to go in the
other<00:03:03.080> direction<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.530> what<00:03:03.800> I'm<00:03:03.890> going<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.040> do

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
other direction so what I'm going to do

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.170 
other direction so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.640> put<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.660> piece<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:06.080> scotch<00:03:06.320> tape<00:03:06.590> down

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
is just put a piece of scotch tape down

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.030 
is just put a piece of scotch tape down
so<00:03:08.180> you've<00:03:08.300> got<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.720> fold<00:03:09.020> it<00:03:09.170> two<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.830> one<00:03:10.010> side

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
so you've got to fold it two to one side

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.740 
so you've got to fold it two to one side
and<00:03:13.040> then<00:03:13.340> we've<00:03:13.460> got<00:03:13.580> two<00:03:13.790> folded<00:03:14.210> to<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
and then we've got two folded to the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.930 
and then we've got two folded to the
opposite<00:03:15.140> side<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:15.710> I'm<00:03:16.190> going<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.340> make<00:03:16.910> a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
opposite side and I'm going to make a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:25.780 
opposite side and I'm going to make a
like<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.210> little<00:03:17.570> cross<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:24.580> don't<00:03:25.580> worry

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
like a little cross and don't worry

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.080 
like a little cross and don't worry
about<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.420> scotch<00:03:26.750> tape<00:03:26.990> having<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.470> hold<00:03:27.620> it

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
about the scotch tape having to hold it

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.250 
about the scotch tape having to hold it
perfectly<00:03:29.090> because<00:03:29.360> at<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.780> point<00:03:30.080> we're

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
perfectly because at this point we're

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.500 
perfectly because at this point we're
just<00:03:31.570> getting<00:03:32.570> everything<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:33.050> place<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:34.510> then

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
and to do that I just do this on a sheet

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.600 
and to do that I just do this on a sheet
of<00:05:53.430> paper<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:54.080> just<00:05:55.080> use<00:05:55.320> my<00:05:55.370> pen<00:05:58.610> completely

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:13.279 
of paper I just use my pen completely
cover<00:05:59.910> the<00:06:00.350> snowflake<00:06:11.389> and<00:06:12.389> it's<00:06:12.720> almost<00:06:13.020> out

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
so I'm really squeezing out of it and

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.750 
so I'm really squeezing out of it and

glue before you get the glitter out

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.230 
glue before you get the glitter out
