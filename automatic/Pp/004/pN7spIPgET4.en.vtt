to go ahead and finesse that out and
when<00:01:28.220> I<00:01:28.250> say<00:01:28.490> finesse<00:01:28.820> I'm<00:01:29.000> gonna<00:01:29.120> stick<00:01:29.420> it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
when I say finesse I'm gonna stick it

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.390 
when I say finesse I'm gonna stick it
inside<00:01:29.690> there<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.620> I'm<00:01:30.710> just<00:01:30.740> going<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.130> push

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
there I took my pry bar and I twisted it

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.470 
there I took my pry bar and I twisted it
okay<00:02:54.410> I<00:02:54.440> got<00:02:54.709> down<00:02:55.070> inside<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.820> quarter<00:02:56.150> panel
