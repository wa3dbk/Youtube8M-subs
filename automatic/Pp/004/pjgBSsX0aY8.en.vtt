00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.199
 Brazil takes a look at this 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.470
 the amount 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.619
 of people 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.789
 on the buses not only that I speak always risking his own life but 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.829

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.679
 then fell into the rump these guys can fall on someone else kill someone 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.120
 If there is someone on a bicycle, someone is walking well. 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.140
 the police we talked about here that would do this reinforcement goes to the police 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.390
 passing by 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.370
 Look, people are coming. 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.300
 she did not realize that it was not just her problem if she was taking a risk 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 not so risky the lives of other people too 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.840
 now when is going to be a situation of this 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.800
 Why shop conscientiously? 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.120
 she has category 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.190
 is the life that operates within the bubble of selections 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.229
 But that's where we show you 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.759

 in the cruise game on the cruise and I know we showed yesterday 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.310

 if it falls 2 3 those guys over a car stay happen 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.810
 it's fun 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 It's fun tereza but those walls 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.910
 It's a rough swing to do. 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.740
 firefighter rocks like this 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.410
 for participation 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.220
 three weekly flights 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.710
 the green leaves 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.150
 I'm here the studio with Lieutenant Colonel Cycero 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.479
 colonel lieutenant colonel 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.350
 What can be done 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.100
 can end this kind of thing and why the guys are going to risk it 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.930
 their lives do not aim to expand the tournament and people who are passing 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.660
 catende 75 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.840
 What can be done 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.010
 truth 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.030
 first of all 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.020
 if the health problem 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.440
 people run scaravelli and in a simple analysis 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.760
 but we are working together with the public ministry para 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.689
 the identification of the fans 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.710
 cold at the moment of approach 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.049
 the driving of such persons by another police station 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.589
 on the basis of the first place in Article 39 of the statute of the supporter 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.019
 who promote it celta advanced table yes promote turmoil 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.059
 tomask tomas 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.420
 it is understood as provocation of turmoil 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.849
 first of all 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.849
 and we've been targeting the cops who work at hand 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.279
 in the 34th battalion of his commander 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.859
 and also with Lieutenant-Colonel Carlos and the battalion commanders 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.029
 what we should drive these people to the goal 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:38.809
 to the police station 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:42.949
 based on the status of the supporter and suggesting to the public ministry 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:47.519
 their removal from the stadium was a three-year night three months 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.339
 one year 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.339
 which is what the status of the supporter is 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.199
 the possibility 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.559
 and I'm today I was talking to them time 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.809
 nephew Article 2002 and of the penal code 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.610
 What is preventing or hindering 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.319
 public transportation 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.489
 so screens and more told realizing is that in my interpretation 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.769
 features lined with prevented you from performing once 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.769
 It's like his tourist and hypertension. 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:20.169
 called process 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.859
 divided armed protocol supporter also that the transit 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.769
 we may have an accident and be amazed if in this article the more severe penalty than 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.019
 detention 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.989
 one to two years 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.179
 padata has aggravated tomasson arguing 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.959
 during the game we usually put policing in the corridors 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.169
 to curb this type of action 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.649
 depending on the type of event is the degree of risk of the event 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.649
 we put cops inside the 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.639
 the bus 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.519
 In this case it persists and now taking advantage of the fact that the government 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.499
 I wanted to ask the drivers, huh? 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.539
 pushing the team into a situation this month to prevent 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:03.579
 car 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.829
 within the military police that are already oriented to conduct these 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.910
 people with buzz is the whole county 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.249
 not only do you teach in a prepared scheme 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:17.529
 been seized and then failed to get our people to vote 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.529
 to prevent this from happening because liedson risked his life 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.430
 men too 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.059
 it is not only contemplated with the susep iguaçu all 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:26.370
 there you are going through the broth 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.400
 - we can go no further 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.650
 in sweatshirts or doing some work there 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.169
 he gives silver military police act in that direction and to restrain it later 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.270
 work we do is to position the company's vehicles in the 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.300
 cruise game said 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.470
 if you and we put 24 cars are the runners about the 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.170
 investigation furthermore sales grew from tactical mobile actors 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.860
 in points strategic impact in addition motorcycles we have in the game of 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.349
 then 12 motorcycles only cruise 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.999
 to make safety of the runners ask for the sport 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.799
 now enjoying the audience of the program i is very important to 

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:07.570
 participation of all people to curb this 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.780
 let's go back to the police that sometimes even the police action is 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.930
 important 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.620
 but we have other people can cooperate in the driver 12 a person 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.809
 can collaborate and have interest is the work of letter 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:20.189
 so also 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:25.029
 so we asked them to stop having the car efec in the site is 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.259
 music is all and in that sense in the approach 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.069
 other people who can help us a lot and are being organized leader 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.240
 organized people are people who can influence 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.289
 It's the beach for us and we were working so hard but yesterday in June and now 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.039
 Brazil the people 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.039

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.659
 people are organizing the environment of mining now is a theme that the 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.999
 problems there of confrontation in which those things that are organizing us 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.580
 working hard at it 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.580
 and we have to expand this means of organization now to a degree of 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.839
 dedication to the friend who happens in the city on the occasion of the event 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.389
