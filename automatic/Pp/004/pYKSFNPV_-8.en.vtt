00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
comes out this is a piston style gun so

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.850 
comes out this is a piston style gun so
uh<00:04:56.430> yeah<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:57.729> so<00:04:58.360> kind<00:04:58.600> of<00:04:58.690> cool<00:04:59.020> think<00:04:59.260> that's

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
uh yeah it so kind of cool think that's

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.040 
uh yeah it so kind of cool think that's
cool<00:05:00.160> I<00:05:00.220> guess<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.430> feature<00:05:00.729> or<00:05:01.060> how<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.870> works

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
cool I guess a feature or how it works

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.370 
cool I guess a feature or how it works
is<00:05:02.229> that<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.620> harder<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.789> part<00:05:04.690> of<00:05:04.840> the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
is that the harder the part of the

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.409 
is that the harder the part of the
harder<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.770> pull<00:05:05.949> it<00:05:06.100> back<00:05:06.280> stronger<00:05:07.270> the

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
harder you pull it back stronger the

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.480 
harder you pull it back stronger the
stream<00:05:07.660> is<00:05:07.810> going<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:07.990> be<00:05:08.169> so<00:05:08.919> if<00:05:09.039> you<00:05:09.130> pull<00:05:09.400> it

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
stream is going to be so if you pull it

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
range flat parallel to the ground I got

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.159 
range flat parallel to the ground I got
about<00:06:17.370> 20<00:06:18.370> 22<00:06:18.760> 24<00:06:19.150> feet<00:06:19.539> which<00:06:19.870> is<00:06:19.900> what<00:06:20.080> the

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
degree angle ish I got a from 25 to 28

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.800 
degree angle ish I got a from 25 to 28
feet

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
feet

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.640
