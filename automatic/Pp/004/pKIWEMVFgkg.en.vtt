00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.670
 Ok I do not need your tricks 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.250
 demon hello and welcome again today 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.070
 I present a new trick here in the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.070
 map nu town 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.500
 The first thing we need is for a 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.540
 character to stay in a place of 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.120
 agreement will be me who will stay now 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.500
 what we do is brothers well because 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.610
 every now and then a zombie comes to us 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.290
 the barrier that we are going to make 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.160
 ok what we have to do is duck 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.160
 us right here 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.289
 and open that door and the door that 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.120
 behind not to open it will remain the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.060
 partner in a place where he does not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.010
 come the zombies 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.660
 and nothing we put here 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.660
 just looking at that line 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.160
 and already the zombies will not come for us 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.350
 the truth is that this is a trick 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.410
 pretty easy and pretty good the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.150
 true but good indeed is to say that 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.430
 from time to time to those of us here 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 placed do not see in a piece me and we 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.710
 can kill so be very careful 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.410
 cover us enough looking like this for the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.320
 sides I this trick as you are 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.230
 watching what I recorded on xbox 360 and 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.970
 that in play 3 I do not have the map and nothing I 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.650
 I think that in play 3 it can be done if 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.440
 someone can confirm it by commenting 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.370
 what and nothing now I will show you how is my 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.370
 companion inside 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.630
 as we are observing I put myself in 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.490
 the trick 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.380
 but since he had no money he opened the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.640
 door I put back and what I 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.200
 has to do now the partner that 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.700
 is here is to stay here in the corner 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.409
 of is without opening the door until 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.899
 we have just behind because if 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.310
 open we will already enter the zombies well 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.100
 that nothing that I leave the view of me 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.780
 partner 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.680
 as you see begin to accumulate 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.399
 zombies there in the corner 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.310
 and nothing this is the trick 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.069
 now I'll leave it in bird's eye view 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.769
 that you see everything well and nothing this is 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.230
 all I hope you enjoyed giving
