00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
modules and I wanted something that was

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
modules and I wanted something that was
easier<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> use<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.020> use<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
easier to use and that use the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.930 
easier to use and that use the
conventional<00:00:50.010> house<00:00:50.460> code<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.149> unit<00:00:52.140> code

conventional house code a unit code
encoding<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:53.969> most<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.750> us<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.110> use<00:00:55.289> x10

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
encoding that most of us that use x10

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.610 
encoding that most of us that use x10
for<00:00:56.520> years<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:57.000> accustomed<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.440> so

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
for years are accustomed to and and so

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.900 
for years are accustomed to and and so
that's<00:00:58.800> where<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> pixie<00:01:01.350> link<00:01:01.910> application

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that's where the pixie link application

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.429 
that's where the pixie link application
came<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.420> also<00:01:03.570> want<00:01:03.899> an<00:01:04.019> interface<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
came and I also want an interface that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.950 
came and I also want an interface that
was<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.549> more<00:01:05.700> intuitive<00:01:06.000> 4<00:01:06.330> X<00:01:06.450> 10<00:01:06.659> years

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
was a little more intuitive 4 X 10 years

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
was a little more intuitive 4 X 10 years
than<00:01:07.320> what's<00:01:07.530> built<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.159> but

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
than what's built in here but

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.179 
than what's built in here but
nonetheless<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.450> great<00:01:09.720> device<00:01:10.189> cost

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
nonetheless this is a great device cost

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
nonetheless this is a great device cost
about<00:01:11.400> 100<00:01:11.700> bucks<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.030> sale<00:01:12.299> about<00:01:12.479> 120<00:01:13.200> lists

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
about 100 bucks on sale about 120 lists

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.649 
about 100 bucks on sale about 120 lists
I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.830> depends<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.820> where<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
I think depends on where you get it and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.800 
I think depends on where you get it and
when<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.350> set<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.770> cost<00:01:17.130> versus

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
when you can set out that cost versus

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.870 
when you can set out that cost versus
you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.500> investment<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> PC<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you know the investment in the PC or a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.070 
you know the investment in the PC or a
solid<00:01:21.299> small<00:01:21.540> single<00:01:21.900> board<00:01:22.049> computer<00:01:23.570> cm<00:01:24.570> 11

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
or firecracker setup or whatever it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.819 
or firecracker setup or whatever it
really<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.140> best<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> go

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
really I think is the the best way to go

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.090 
really I think is the the best way to go
and<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> most<00:01:32.670> cost-effective<00:01:33.329> way<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> go

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
and the most cost-effective way to go

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.730 
and the most cost-effective way to go
and<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> offers<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> lot<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.790> options<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.740> going

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and it offers a lot of options for going

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
and it offers a lot of options for going
beyond<00:01:38.100> x10<00:01:38.579> when<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.210> point

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
beyond x10 when you get to that point

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200 
beyond x10 when you get to that point
we're<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> focus<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.290> x10<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> let's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
we're going to focus on x10 so let's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
we're going to focus on x10 so let's
take<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> look<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:42.840> pixie<00:01:43.409> link<00:01:43.649> when<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> start

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
take a look at pixie link when you start

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.410 
take a look at pixie link when you start
it<00:01:44.689> by<00:01:45.689> clicking<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.140> pixie<00:01:46.409> link<00:01:46.619> icon

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
it by clicking the pixie link icon

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.940 
it by clicking the pixie link icon
you'll<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> screen<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
you'll see a screen like this you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.560 
you'll see a screen like this you
probably<00:01:50.220> won't<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.549> any<00:01:50.729> modules<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.360> there

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
probably won't have any modules in there

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.330 
probably won't have any modules in there
it'll<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.409> blank<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.100> just

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
it'll don't just be blank and we just

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.550 
it'll don't just be blank and we just
delete<00:01:54.299> it'll<00:01:54.600> it'll<00:01:54.780> look<00:01:54.930> pretty<00:01:55.110> much<00:01:55.350> like

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
delete it'll it'll look pretty much like

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.100 
delete it'll it'll look pretty much like
this<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.329> many<00:01:57.479> modules<00:01:57.960> as

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
this and so you get as many modules as

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.630 
this and so you get as many modules as
you<00:01:58.140> want<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.500> by<00:01:58.740> clicking<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> plus<00:01:59.610> sign

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you want just by clicking the plus sign

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.190 
you want just by clicking the plus sign
and<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> want<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> go<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.899> configure

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and then you want to go and configure

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.160 
and then you want to go and configure
those<00:02:01.530> modules<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.100> by<00:02:02.399> clicking<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.909> edit

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
those modules just by clicking on edit

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.450 
those modules just by clicking on edit
picking<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> model<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.040> configure

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
picking the model you want to configure

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.889 
picking the model you want to configure
for<00:02:05.490> example<00:02:06.030> pick<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> middle

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
for example pick the one in the middle

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.420 
for example pick the one in the middle
here

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
here

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.130 
here
and<00:02:07.820> you'll<00:02:08.479> see<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.720> screen<00:02:08.990> that<00:02:09.020> looks

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
and you'll see a screen that looks

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.740 
and you'll see a screen that looks
pretty<00:02:09.440> much<00:02:09.560> like<00:02:09.710> this<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> new<00:02:10.610> module<00:02:10.820> so

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
pretty much like this a new module so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.180 
pretty much like this a new module so
you<00:02:11.840> want<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.050> give<00:02:12.140> your<00:02:12.230> model<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.740> title

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
you want to give your model a title

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.730 
you want to give your model a title

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
I use and I would recommend when you set

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.840 
I use and I would recommend when you set
up<00:02:54.080> your<00:02:54.230> smart<00:02:54.680> link<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.160> use<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> fixed

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
up your smart link that you use a fixed

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.620 
up your smart link that you use a fixed
IP<00:02:55.970> address<00:02:56.680> otherwise<00:02:57.680> if<00:02:58.300> your<00:02:59.300> network

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
IP address otherwise if your network

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.120 
IP address otherwise if your network
comes<00:03:00.020> up<00:03:00.200> differently<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.950> gets

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
comes up differently and it gets

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.090 
comes up differently and it gets
assigned<00:03:01.550> at<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.880> different<00:03:02.240> IP<00:03:02.720> address<00:03:03.350> then

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
assigned at a different IP address then

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.800 
assigned at a different IP address then
that<00:03:04.280> would<00:03:04.430> break<00:03:04.610> your<00:03:04.850> your<00:03:05.300> connections

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
that would break your your connections

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.250 
that would break your your connections
here<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:08.060> could<00:03:08.240> have<00:03:08.420> multiple<00:03:08.600> controllers

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
here you could have multiple controllers

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.190 
here you could have multiple controllers
in<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.650> same<00:03:09.830> house<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:11.090> suppose<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.959> and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
in the same house and I suppose and and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.140 
in the same house and I suppose and and
have<00:03:12.680> different<00:03:12.980> IP<00:03:13.100> addresses<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:13.850> one<00:03:14.060> is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
have different IP addresses but one is

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.610 
have different IP addresses but one is
generally<00:03:14.480> sufficient<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.230> can<00:03:15.320> control

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
generally sufficient and you can control

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.759 
generally sufficient and you can control
all<00:03:15.830> 256<00:03:16.820> modules<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.750> really<00:03:18.440> don't<00:03:18.530> need

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
all 256 modules so you really don't need

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.160 
all 256 modules so you really don't need
one<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.850> then<00:03:20.239> we're<00:03:20.480> gonna<00:03:20.570> use<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.870> house

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
one and then we're gonna use a house

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.320 
one and then we're gonna use a house
code<00:03:21.470> we'll<00:03:21.680> use<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.070> conventional<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.730> house

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
code we'll use the conventional a house

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.380 
code we'll use the conventional a house
code<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:23.930> example<00:03:23.989> here<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.830> we'll<00:03:25.580> save<00:03:26.209> my

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
code for example here and we'll save my

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.500 
code for example here and we'll save my
lamp<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.840> on<00:03:26.959> module<00:03:27.410> 3<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:28.090> can't<00:03:29.090> have<00:03:29.239> lamp

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
lamp is on module 3 you can't have lamp

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.390 
lamp is on module 3 you can't have lamp
or<00:03:29.780> appliance<00:03:30.260> modules<00:03:30.709> in<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.010> case<00:03:31.250> I'm

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
or appliance modules in this case I'm

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.710 
or appliance modules in this case I'm
going<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.550> use<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.700> lamp<00:03:31.940> model<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.480> only

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
going to use a lamp model the only

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.780 
going to use a lamp model the only
difference<00:03:33.080> being<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.860> lamp<00:03:34.310> modules

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
difference being that the lamp modules

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.000 
difference being that the lamp modules
show<00:03:35.030> dimming<00:03:35.480> controls<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.260> then

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
show dimming controls and then

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.300 
show dimming controls and then
optionally<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.550> can<00:03:37.880> enter<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.480> picture<00:03:39.100> or<00:03:40.100> take

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
optionally I can enter a picture or take

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.009 
optionally I can enter a picture or take
a<00:03:40.370> picture<00:03:40.670> if<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.030> have<00:03:41.180> an<00:03:41.300> iPhone<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.630> can<00:03:41.810> take

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
a picture if I have an iPhone I can take

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.720 
a picture if I have an iPhone I can take
a<00:03:42.050> picture<00:03:42.260> using<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.709> iPhones<00:03:43.100> camera<00:03:43.580> the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
a picture using the iPhones camera the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.640 
a picture using the iPhones camera the
device<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.150> I<00:03:44.209> want<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.510> control<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.110> use<00:03:45.470> as

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
device that I want to control to use as

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.040 
device that I want to control to use as
a<00:03:45.739> kind<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.269> friendly<00:03:47.269> reminder<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.810> what<00:03:47.930> it

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
a kind of a friendly reminder of what it

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.660 
a kind of a friendly reminder of what it
is<00:03:48.080> I'm<00:03:48.320> controlling<00:03:48.709> but<00:03:49.010> since<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.430> the

iPhone simulator and and or if I was

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.259 
iPhone simulator and and or if I was
using<00:03:53.630> an<00:03:53.840> iPod<00:03:54.170> all<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.640> have<00:03:55.790> there<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.120> the

using an iPod all you have there is the
photo<00:03:56.480> album<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.530> we're<00:03:57.650> going<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:57.860> pick<00:03:57.980> a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
photo album so we're going to pick a

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.190 
photo album so we're going to pick a
picture<00:03:58.280> on<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.549> photo<00:03:58.790> album<00:03:59.299> there's<00:04:00.049> my

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
picture on the photo album there's my

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.930 
picture on the photo album there's my
saved<00:04:00.500> photos<00:04:00.709> having<00:04:01.220> only<00:04:01.340> have<00:04:01.549> one<00:04:01.790> in

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
saved photos having only have one in

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.220 
saved photos having only have one in
there<00:04:02.090> at<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.239> moment<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.630> simulator<00:04:03.049> so

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
there at the moment the simulator so

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.660 
there at the moment the simulator so
we'll<00:04:03.350> pick<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.590> but<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.100> could<00:04:04.310> be<00:04:04.459> any<00:04:04.580> of

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
we'll pick it but it could be any of

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.550 
we'll pick it but it could be any of
them<00:04:04.970> makes<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.269> have<00:04:05.420> in<00:04:05.540> there<00:04:05.690> use<00:04:06.350> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
them makes you have in there use the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.039 
them makes you have in there use the
controls<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.310> adjust<00:04:07.489> Center<00:04:08.090> crop<00:04:08.450> as<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.840> as

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
controls to adjust Center crop as you as

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.280 
controls to adjust Center crop as you as
you<00:04:09.170> wish<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:10.299> then<00:04:11.299> choose<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.750> picture<00:04:12.110> and

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
you wish and then choose the picture and

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.050 
you wish and then choose the picture and
that'll<00:04:13.070> be<00:04:13.220> assigned<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:13.910> particular

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
that'll be assigned to that particular

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.600 
that'll be assigned to that particular
module

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
module

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.970 
module
so<00:04:16.000> this<00:04:16.150> case<00:04:16.450> we<00:04:16.630> have<00:04:16.810> lamp<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.260> on<00:04:17.590> house

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
so this case we have lamp a on house

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.920 
so this case we have lamp a on house
code<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.430> module<00:04:19.390> three

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
code a module three

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.930 
code a module three
there's<00:04:20.769> my<00:04:23.010> smart<00:04:24.010> link<00:04:24.190> controller<00:04:24.580> address

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
there's my smart link controller address

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.880 
there's my smart link controller address
and<00:04:25.240> we'll<00:04:25.750> go<00:04:25.930> back<00:04:25.960> here<00:04:26.410> we'll<00:04:26.590> see<00:04:26.770> that

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
and we'll go back here we'll see that

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.260 
and we'll go back here we'll see that
we're<00:04:27.010> set<00:04:27.250> up<00:04:27.280> when<00:04:27.550> we've<00:04:27.670> got<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.910> picture

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
we're set up when we've got the picture

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.700 
we're set up when we've got the picture
there<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.510> we're<00:04:28.870> all<00:04:28.990> ready<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.290> control

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
there and we're all ready to control

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.010 
there and we're all ready to control
that<00:04:29.920> particularly<00:04:30.280> up<00:04:30.700> now<00:04:31.480> when<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.750> click<00:04:31.990> on

it I have on/off and I can dim the
various<00:04:35.800> controls<00:04:36.540> you'll<00:04:37.540> notice<00:04:37.840> if<00:04:37.960> you

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
various controls you'll notice if you

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.630 
various controls you'll notice if you
just<00:04:38.230> hit<00:04:38.380> brighten<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.920> start<00:04:39.160> with<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.490> goes

unit<00:05:44.230> is<00:05:44.290> already<00:05:44.650> on<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:45.010> DEM<00:05:45.220> state<00:05:45.520> turn

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
unit is already on the DEM state turn

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.270 
unit is already on the DEM state turn
off<00:05:46.000> and<00:05:46.240> then<00:05:46.300> ami<00:05:46.540> is<00:05:46.870> dimming<00:05:47.230> control<00:05:47.320> the

off and then ami is dimming control the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.940 
off and then ami is dimming control the
reason<00:05:48.580> for<00:05:48.730> that<00:05:48.790> is<00:05:49.030> that<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.810> x10<00:05:50.200> modules

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
reason for that is that the x10 modules

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.360 
reason for that is that the x10 modules
at<00:05:51.100> least<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.460> simple<00:05:51.940> ones<00:05:52.090> that<00:05:52.240> I'm<00:05:52.360> using

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
at least the simple ones that I'm using

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.630 
at least the simple ones that I'm using
only<00:05:54.370> go<00:05:54.550> from<00:05:55.890> do<00:05:56.890> not<00:05:57.010> go<00:05:57.190> to<00:05:57.250> a<00:05:57.340> full-on

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.400 
only go from do not go to a full-on

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
state unless it was a full off so you

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.750 
state unless it was a full off so you
can<00:05:59.530> just<00:05:59.710> if<00:05:59.830> you<00:05:59.919> want<00:06:00.100> a<00:06:00.130> full<00:06:00.310> on<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:00.610> can

can just if you want a full on you can

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.210 
can just if you want a full on you can
hit<00:06:00.880> off<00:06:01.120> and<00:06:01.690> then<00:06:02.200> hit<00:06:02.350> on<00:06:02.530> again<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:03.070> go

choose<00:06:46.169> a<00:06:46.199> photo<00:06:46.500> of<00:06:46.770> it<00:06:46.860> in<00:06:46.949> this<00:06:47.069> case<00:06:47.310> I'm

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
choose a photo of it in this case I'm

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.159 
choose a photo of it in this case I'm
not<00:06:47.940> going<00:06:48.120> to<00:06:48.180> bother<00:06:48.300> we've<00:06:48.599> seen<00:06:48.840> how<00:06:48.990> that

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
not going to bother we've seen how that

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.379 
not going to bother we've seen how that
works<00:06:49.349> already<00:06:49.680> and<00:06:49.919> so<00:06:50.039> now<00:06:50.250> I<00:06:50.280> have<00:06:50.550> my<00:06:50.729> my
