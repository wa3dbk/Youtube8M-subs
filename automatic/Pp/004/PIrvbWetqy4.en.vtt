00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
of one and remember there's only six

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.649 
of one and remember there's only six
boxes<00:01:40.490> six<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.850> still<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.240> two<00:01:42.479> more

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
boxes left so out of four boxes we just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.039 
boxes left so out of four boxes we just
had<00:01:46.710> tons<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> mojo<00:01:47.689> probably<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.840> much

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
had tons of mojo probably as much

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.940
