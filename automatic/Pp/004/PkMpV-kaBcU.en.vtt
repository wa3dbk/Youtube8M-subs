00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
eighth of an inch of tread here in the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.840 
eighth of an inch of tread here in the
center<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:49.370> probably<00:00:51.460> better<00:00:52.460> part<00:00:52.700> of<00:00:52.760> a

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
center and probably better part of a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.170 
center and probably better part of a
quarter<00:00:53.210> there<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.630> side<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.850> these

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
quarter there on the side and these

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.660 
quarter there on the side and these
tires<00:00:56.510> I<00:00:56.750> do<00:00:56.810> get<00:00:57.380> on<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.800> can<00:00:57.980> see<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.250> there

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
tires I do get on you can see that there

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.890 
tires I do get on you can see that there
are<00:00:58.700> no<00:00:59.030> chicken<00:00:59.480> strips<00:01:01.090> on<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:02.330> bike<00:01:02.600> there

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
are no chicken strips on this bike there

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.900 
are no chicken strips on this bike there
is<00:01:03.080> nobs<00:01:03.980> but<00:01:04.550> they're<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.150> very<00:01:05.180> very<00:01:05.960> edge

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
is nobs but they're the very very edge

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.710 
is nobs but they're the very very edge
so<00:01:07.910> I<00:01:07.940> get<00:01:08.180> this<00:01:08.360> bike<00:01:08.630> I<00:01:10.240> don't<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.330> can<00:01:11.420> see

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
so I get this bike I don't you can see

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.460 
so I get this bike I don't you can see
that<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:11.930> want<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:12.140> make<00:01:12.260> sure<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:14.140> get<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:15.230> bike

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
that I want to make sure I get this bike

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.300 
that I want to make sure I get this bike
way<00:01:15.830> over<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.110> I'm<00:01:18.110> on<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.500> accelerator<00:01:19.130> so

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
way over and I'm on the accelerator so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.820 
way over and I'm on the accelerator so
the<00:01:19.430> nubs<00:01:19.640> are<00:01:19.820> at<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.030> very<00:01:20.300> edge<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:21.320> the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
the nubs are at the very edge of the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.540 
the nubs are at the very edge of the
tire<00:01:22.040> here<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.740> if<00:01:24.800> you<00:01:24.890> know<00:01:25.010> about<00:01:25.340> the

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
tire here so if you know about the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.470 
tire here so if you know about the
Conqueror<00:01:26.510> is<00:01:26.600> 14<00:01:27.970> it's<00:01:28.970> got<00:01:29.120> a<00:01:29.150> pretty<00:01:29.450> decent

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
Conqueror is 14 it's got a pretty decent

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.970 
Conqueror is 14 it's got a pretty decent
amount<00:01:29.870> of<00:01:30.080> power<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:33.080> I've<00:01:33.650> gotten<00:01:33.920> this

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
amount of power and I've gotten this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.280 
amount of power and I've gotten this
bike<00:01:34.220> way<00:01:34.610> over<00:01:34.940> on<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.150> edge<00:01:35.300> pretty<00:01:36.050> much

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
bike way over on the edge pretty much

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.080 
bike way over on the edge pretty much
full<00:01:36.680> acceleration<00:01:37.010> I've<00:01:37.550> never<00:01:37.850> had<00:01:38.060> a

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
that sure is pretty anyway when it is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.479 
that sure is pretty anyway when it is
running<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.909> really<00:02:08.390> handles<00:02:08.720> great<00:02:09.489> these

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
running it really handles great these

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.670 
running it really handles great these
these<00:02:10.819> tires<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:11.510> really<00:02:12.349> can't<00:02:12.470> say

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
these tires I just really can't say

enough<00:02:12.830> good<00:02:13.010> things<00:02:13.069> about<00:02:13.340> them<00:02:13.610> because

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
enough good things about them because

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.220 
enough good things about them because
they<00:02:15.140> wear<00:02:15.410> great<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:16.370> they<00:02:16.580> stick<00:02:16.940> good<00:02:20.230> you

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
know in truth they're a great deal I

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.390 
know in truth they're a great deal I
think<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.180> got<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.720> both<00:02:24.620> sets<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.040> these<00:02:25.190> tires

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
think I got the both sets of these tires

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.920 
think I got the both sets of these tires
were<00:02:25.640> within<00:02:25.879> about<00:02:25.970> 10<00:02:26.299> bucks<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.660> each<00:02:26.750> other

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
were within about 10 bucks of each other

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.949 
were within about 10 bucks of each other
and<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.170> think<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:28.280> set<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.959> concourse

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
and I think the set on the concourse

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.819 
and I think the set on the concourse
there<00:02:30.170> were<00:02:30.459> about<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.849> want<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.870> say<00:02:33.049> a<00:02:33.349> hundred

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
there were about I want to say a hundred

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.250 
there were about I want to say a hundred

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
think about the same for the put the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.750 
think about the same for the put the
tires<00:02:44.390> on<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.660> Ducati<00:02:44.959> maybe<00:02:45.579> five<00:02:46.579> or<00:02:46.610> ten

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
tires on the Ducati maybe five or ten

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.000 
tires on the Ducati maybe five or ten
bucks<00:02:47.060> cheaper<00:02:48.190> but<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:50.390> Duke<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:51.010> stock

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
bucks cheaper but the Duke the stock

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.089 
bucks cheaper but the Duke the stock
tires<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.519> they<00:02:52.549> replaced<00:02:53.049> they<00:02:54.049> were<00:02:54.109> they

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
tires that they replaced they were they

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.330 
tires that they replaced they were they
were<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:55.489> totally<00:02:55.760> gone<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.780> about<00:02:57.500> three

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
were just totally gone and about three

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.369 
were just totally gone and about three
thousand<00:02:58.730> miles<00:02:58.879> they<00:02:59.120> stuck<00:02:59.780> good<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.200> mean

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
thousand miles they stuck good I mean

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.130 
thousand miles they stuck good I mean
they<00:03:00.440> stuck<00:03:00.739> really<00:03:01.010> about<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.310> same<00:03:01.870> in<00:03:02.870> my

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
they stuck really about the same in my

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.440 
they stuck really about the same in my
opinion<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.959> they<00:03:05.959> were<00:03:06.019> more<00:03:06.590> expensive

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
opinion but they were more expensive

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.199 
opinion but they were more expensive
they<00:03:08.450> wore<00:03:08.959> faster<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.889> they<00:03:10.819> didn't<00:03:11.030> really

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
they wore faster and they didn't really

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.140 
they wore faster and they didn't really
seem<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.450> stick<00:03:11.780> any<00:03:11.930> better<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.880> what<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.060> know

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
seem to stick any better so what I know

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.650 
seem to stick any better so what I know
about<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.720> Shinto<00:03:15.169> tires<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:16.660> they're

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
about the Shinto tires is they're

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.250 
about the Shinto tires is they're
actually<00:03:18.790> from<00:03:19.790> what<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:19.970> hear<00:03:20.299> they're

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260

actually<00:03:22.419> Yokohama

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.610 

what<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.270> guess<00:03:28.480> they're<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.020> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
what is it I guess they're the the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.740 
what is it I guess they're the the
compounds<00:03:30.280> I've<00:03:30.430> used<00:03:30.640> came<00:03:31.270> from<00:03:31.300> Yokohama

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750
