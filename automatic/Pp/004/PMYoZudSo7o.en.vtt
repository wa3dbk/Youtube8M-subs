drove by no police officer at all

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.830 
drove by no police officer at all
so<00:05:26.610> officers<00:05:27.610> probably<00:05:27.820> presumed<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.480> you

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
so officers probably presumed that you

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.450 
so officers probably presumed that you
know<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.620> know<00:05:29.710> they<00:05:29.830> probably<00:05:30.010> know<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.370> law

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
know you know they probably know the law

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.730 
know you know they probably know the law
is<00:05:30.490> legal<00:05:31.090> Constitution<00:05:31.690> right<00:05:31.840> so<00:05:32.140> maybe

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
is legal Constitution right so maybe

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.560 
is legal Constitution right so maybe
that's<00:05:32.920> why<00:05:33.040> I<00:05:33.070> didn't<00:05:33.340> come<00:05:33.490> out<00:05:33.520> water<00:05:34.180> so
