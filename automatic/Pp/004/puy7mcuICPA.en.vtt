00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
bigger now you have a couple of choices

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.420 
bigger now you have a couple of choices
to<00:03:33.910> work<00:03:34.209> one<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.840> pound<00:03:35.109> rocks<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.889> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
trouble with that is sometimes you break

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.979 
trouble with that is sometimes you break
your<00:03:38.440> stone<00:03:38.769> when<00:03:39.069> you're<00:03:39.220> doing<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.989> the

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
your stone when you're doing that the

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.250 
your stone when you're doing that the
other<00:03:41.019> is<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:42.099> screen<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.639> wash<00:03:43.049> walk<00:03:44.049> down

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
other is to screen the wash walk down

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.159 
other is to screen the wash walk down
the<00:03:44.470> wash<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.040> look<00:03:45.190> for<00:03:45.400> something<00:03:45.760> shiny

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
the wash and look for something shiny

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.409 
the wash and look for something shiny
and<00:03:47.169> just<00:03:47.440> up<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.799> wash<00:03:48.239> probably<00:03:49.239> out<00:03:49.389> of

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
and just up the wash probably out of

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:58.530 
and just up the wash probably out of
this<00:03:49.780> Rock<00:03:51.900> see<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:54.750> Sunstone<00:03:55.750> crystal<00:03:57.540> this

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
this Rock see that Sunstone crystal this

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.839 
this Rock see that Sunstone crystal this
is<00:03:58.599> clear<00:03:59.819> beautiful<00:04:02.129> they<00:04:03.129> can<00:04:03.400> use<00:04:03.639> the

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
is clear beautiful they can use the

action<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.629> water<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:05.109> like<00:04:05.230> we<00:04:05.500> do<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:05.799> in

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
action of water just like we do in in

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.720 
action of water just like we do in in
the<00:04:06.340> gold<00:04:06.549> mining<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.180> get<00:04:08.169> behind<00:04:08.579> all<00:04:09.579> these

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
on a lapidary machine all it is is a

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:53.010 
on a lapidary machine all it is is a
grinding<00:06:50.860> wheel<00:06:50.969> with<00:06:51.969> our<00:06:52.120> stone<00:06:52.419> on<00:06:52.659> the<00:06:52.809> end

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
grinding wheel with our stone on the end

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.489 
grinding wheel with our stone on the end
of<00:06:53.259> what's<00:06:54.069> called<00:06:54.249> a<00:06:54.400> dot<00:06:54.669> stick<00:06:55.060> and<00:06:55.419> per<00:06:56.259> the

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:56.499 
of what's called a dot stick and per the

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.899 
of what's called a dot stick and per the
diagram<00:06:57.039> it's<00:06:57.249> giving<00:06:57.639> us<00:06:57.819> angles<00:06:58.689> to<00:06:58.930> cut<00:06:59.169> and

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 
diagram it's giving us angles to cut and

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.489 
diagram it's giving us angles to cut and
certain<00:07:00.909> numbers<00:07:01.270> and<00:07:01.930> what<00:07:02.080> we're<00:07:02.259> going<00:07:02.439> to

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:02.499 
certain numbers and what we're going to

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:04.950 
certain numbers and what we're going to
do<00:07:02.710> is<00:07:02.860> we<00:07:03.069> set<00:07:03.310> our<00:07:03.490> angle<00:07:03.939> here<00:07:04.240> on<00:07:04.419> this<00:07:04.629> on

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
do is we set our angle here on this on

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.209 
do is we set our angle here on this on
this<00:07:05.169> index<00:07:05.999> so<00:07:06.999> you<00:07:07.060> mines<00:07:07.300> wore<00:07:07.629> out<00:07:07.870> it's

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:08.219 
this index so you mines wore out it's

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.999 
this index so you mines wore out it's
this<00:07:09.219> is<00:07:09.460> quite<00:07:09.759> old<00:07:09.939> machinery<00:07:10.479> and<00:07:11.289> once<00:07:11.830> we

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.009 
this is quite old machinery and once we

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.260 
this is quite old machinery and once we
have<00:07:12.249> our<00:07:12.870> angle<00:07:13.870> set<00:07:14.499> then<00:07:15.370> we<00:07:15.520> just<00:07:15.729> go

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
have our angle set then we just go

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.579 
have our angle set then we just go
around<00:07:16.569> on<00:07:17.349> the<00:07:18.099> numbers<00:07:19.289> whatever<00:07:20.289> the

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:20.589 
around on the numbers whatever the

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:24.329 
around on the numbers whatever the
diagram<00:07:21.159> is<00:07:21.520> or<00:07:21.969> are<00:07:22.300> our<00:07:22.930> own<00:07:23.469> diagram<00:07:24.129> if

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:24.339 
diagram is or are our own diagram if

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:25.739 
diagram is or are our own diagram if
we've<00:07:24.520> made<00:07:24.729> something<00:07:25.029> up<00:07:25.300> and<00:07:25.509> we're<00:07:25.599> going

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:25.749 
we've made something up and we're going

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.399 
we've made something up and we're going
to<00:07:25.809> cut<00:07:26.020> it<00:07:26.699> and<00:07:27.699> this<00:07:28.089> is<00:07:28.270> what<00:07:28.449> our<00:07:28.479> cut<00:07:29.020> stone

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:29.409 
to cut it and this is what our cut stone

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:33.239 
to cut it and this is what our cut stone
is<00:07:29.589> going<00:07:29.740> to<00:07:29.860> look<00:07:30.069> like<00:07:31.889> some<00:07:32.889> of<00:07:32.949> these<00:07:33.039> are

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:33.249 
is going to look like some of these are

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:35.219 
is going to look like some of these are
quite<00:07:33.490> valuable<00:07:33.849> especially<00:07:34.539> when<00:07:35.050> they're

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:35.229 
quite valuable especially when they're

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:42.029 
quite valuable especially when they're
in<00:07:35.379> the<00:07:36.539> Reds<00:07:37.539> and<00:07:37.930> the<00:07:38.110> Pink's<00:07:39.209> and<00:07:40.620> that's<00:07:41.620> it

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039 
in the Reds and the Pink's and that's it

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:50.590 
in the Reds and the Pink's and that's it
such<00:07:42.399> don't

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:50.600 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.660
