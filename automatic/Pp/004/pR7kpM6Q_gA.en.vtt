with<00:02:46.819> water<00:02:47.120> or<00:02:47.709> 1%<00:02:48.709> milk<00:02:48.800> after<00:02:49.400> your<00:02:49.760> surgery

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
with water or 1% milk after your surgery

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.660 
with water or 1% milk after your surgery
and<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:51.019> only<00:02:51.140> has<00:02:51.260> two<00:02:51.709> grams<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.220> sugar<00:02:52.430> which

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
and it only has two grams of sugar which

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.820 
and it only has two grams of sugar which
is<00:02:52.730> like<00:02:53.030> as<00:02:53.239> low<00:02:53.660> as<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.019> can<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.620> mean

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
is like as low as you can get I mean

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.770 
is like as low as you can get I mean
it's<00:02:55.400> pretty<00:02:55.790> close<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.299> low<00:02:56.510> as<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.720> can

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's pretty close to the low as you can

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.320 
it's pretty close to the low as you can
get<00:02:56.900> as<00:02:57.049> for<00:02:57.230> our<00:02:57.319> sugars<00:02:57.880> for<00:02:58.880> protein

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
get as for our sugars for protein

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.390 
get as for our sugars for protein
because<00:02:59.600> any<00:02:59.810> protein<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.590> going<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.250> have

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
because any protein is going to have

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.670 
because any protein is going to have
sugar<00:03:01.670> in<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.180> that's<00:03:03.049> what<00:03:03.170> they<00:03:03.319> told<00:03:03.380> me

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
sugar in it and that's what they told me

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.130 
sugar in it and that's what they told me
I<00:03:03.709> took<00:03:04.130> about<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:04.790> at<00:03:04.910> walmart<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:06.080> took
