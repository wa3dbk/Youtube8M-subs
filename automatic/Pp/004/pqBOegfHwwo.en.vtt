00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.599 
well she little quick video here this
morning<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.840> have<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.319> broken<00:00:04.770> manifold<00:00:05.430> off

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
morning I have the broken manifold off

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.379 
morning I have the broken manifold off
of<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:05.850> 472<00:00:06.600> caddy<00:00:07.140> driver's<00:00:07.919> side<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:09.030> that

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
of that 472 caddy driver's side and that

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.520 
of that 472 caddy driver's side and that
must<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.719> been<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.840> common<00:00:10.260> occurrence

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
must have been a common occurrence

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.830 
must have been a common occurrence
because<00:00:11.120> when<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.210> start<00:00:12.389> looking<00:00:12.480> for<00:00:12.750> these

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
because when you start looking for these

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.140 
because when you start looking for these
manifolds<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.250> find<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.610> passenger

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
manifolds you can find that passenger

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.660 
manifolds you can find that passenger
side<00:00:15.360> all<00:00:15.570> day<00:00:15.599> long<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.160> driver<00:00:17.400> side

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
side all day long but that driver side

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
side all day long but that driver side
is<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> little<00:00:17.940> bit<00:00:18.210> harder<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.900> come<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.289> with

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
is a little bit harder to come up with

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.730
