00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.510
 Phase 7 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.510
 Installation of the doors 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:15.779
 First, the three internal frame profiles one at the top and two at the side at the 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.779
 Number of bets 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.289
 As you can see, it may be necessary after checking the length 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.880
 Drill office or side frame profiles to cut off if the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 Panel over the edge of the frame protrudes 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.250
 Seal with silicone and mount the frame profiles 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.460
 the tape from the attachment points boy for the door 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 share 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.030
 Seal the previously mounted frame profiles with silicone and then the door 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.800
 To do this, first mount the floor part inserts around the entry of pipe 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.799
 and conduits for the electrical cables on the top too 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.799
 enable 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.700
 Offer the door and insert the outer lower frame Prophet 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.090
 in the lower part in which now the dripstones mount 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 thanks to this profile, the water can lock inwards 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:15.129
 Also in this case, the profile may need to be tailored which 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.129
 Panel over the edge of the number of protrudes 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.370
 Seal with silicone and then the outer frame profiles of the door 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.149
 assembled 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.659
 a practical system thanks to which the profile is adapted to different strengths 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 can be 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.769
 The packaging also contains a gasket which after use at the 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.669
 Edge of the vice of the door 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.669
 in hermetic closure allows 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.749
 Now all screws of the door can be screwed in and lashed down 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.299
 Finally, place the cover plates of the screws 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.479
 If the door is not perfect you can do it with the extra 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.629
 provided ring nut in the lower part may be adjusted 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.009
 as they watch here
