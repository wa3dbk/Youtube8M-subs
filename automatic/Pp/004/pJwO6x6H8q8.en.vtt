00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.940
 valencia vintage you see at 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.510
 valencia what about the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.000
 this family contact dispute 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.590
 restored or radio silence 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.300
 I have no contact at the moment 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.490
 Family is disconnected on Christmas 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.700
 spend well over new year separately 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.730
 So make the family so there is 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.989
 now first silence and would like synonymous 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.030
 and that's how it stays because of me 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.700
 do not leave me from anybody in the world 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.230
 kind of humble somehow any way 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.770
 or beat because there is no 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.530
 People have the skills to be so valentin 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.210
 What are you doing New Year's Eve? 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.020
 that's what you ask me do you hate me 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 forget our day 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.330
 oh so a person kannada marry 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.830
 or rather no nonsense in about 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.710
 I just go warrior stefan 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.390
 Blum comes to the gala or I will 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.310
 Continue to spend with the person 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.220
 I have mostly experienced like this year 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.430
 and it would be in berlin and me 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.320
 I guess I'll probably go after that 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.490
 krefeld case because the person has to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.930
 nothing seems to me on New Year's Eve 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.649
 I want to make my ex-boyfriend one must 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.200
 saying 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.869
 Berlin, of course, very many 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.930
 Invitations get to Berlin and 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.850
 to munich for big events 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.280
 but I always think that's western 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.259
 Christmas day is very important in that 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.060
 year for me because christmas connect 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.299
 with the family with the people you 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.840
 I love to spend 28 all alone and 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.060
 New Year's Eve I think there you should 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.530
 spend the day with the person with 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.960
 the one most 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 has experienced in the year and he new year's eve 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.470
 is still open either in 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.170
 krefeld because stefan blumtritt or stop 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.550
 then really very private for two 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.550
 with the person I am the most
