products<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.570> non-gmo<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.549> not

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
products are non-gmo but they are not

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.539 
products are non-gmo but they are not
organic<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.860> majority<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> their

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
organic and the majority of their

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.899 
organic and the majority of their
products<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.299> even<00:01:45.570> vegan<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.909> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
products are not even vegan so the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.789 
products are not even vegan so the
reason<00:01:48.270> behind<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:49.079> meatless<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
reason behind that they are meatless and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.460 
reason behind that they are meatless and
soy<00:01:49.950> free<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.479> them<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.290> eggs

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
soy free but a lot of them have the eggs

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.039 
soy free but a lot of them have the eggs
in<00:01:52.799> them<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.540> something<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> need<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
in them so that's something you need to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.260 
in them so that's something you need to
be<00:01:55.140> aware<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> before<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> was<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.939> mean<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
be aware of before I was I mean at that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.569 
be aware of before I was I mean at that
time<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> vegan<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.530> looking<00:01:59.250> at<00:01:59.369> this

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
time I was a vegan but looking at this

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.609 
time I was a vegan but looking at this
box<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.210> seeing<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.750> meat<00:02:00.990> free<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
box and seeing that it's meat free I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.340 
box and seeing that it's meat free I
would<00:02:01.680> assume<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:03.210> know<00:02:03.360> oh<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.630> vegan<00:02:03.840> but

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
would assume you know oh it's vegan but

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.749 
would assume you know oh it's vegan but
you<00:02:04.890> always<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.310> read<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> fine<00:02:05.729> print

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you always have to read the fine print

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.180 
you always have to read the fine print
so<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.290> my<00:02:07.380> favorite<00:02:07.680> products

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so this was one of my favorite products

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.369 
so this was one of my favorite products
but<00:02:08.340> unfortunately<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.149> not

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
but unfortunately it is not

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.140 
but unfortunately it is not
the<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:10.890> product<00:02:11.159> that<00:02:11.310> they<00:02:11.489> do<00:02:11.549> offer<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the one product that they do offer that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.289 
the one product that they do offer that
is<00:02:12.540> vegan<00:02:13.230> with<00:02:13.470> no<00:02:13.709> eggs<00:02:14.040> or<00:02:14.310> anything<00:02:14.519> it's

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
is vegan with no eggs or anything it's

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.780 
is vegan with no eggs or anything it's
going<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.690> be<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.200> vegan<00:02:16.799> burgers<00:02:17.220> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
going to be the vegan burgers and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.070 
going to be the vegan burgers and
actually<00:02:18.150> pick<00:02:18.330> these<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.629> from<00:02:18.810> Whole<00:02:19.049> Foods

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530 
actually pick these up from Whole Foods
whole<00:02:19.680> pizzas<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.239> largest

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
whole pizzas one of the largest

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.589 
whole pizzas one of the largest
distributors<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.379> their<00:02:22.620> product<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.599> keep

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
distributors of their product so keep

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.850 
distributors of their product so keep
that<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.870> mind<00:02:25.049> when<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> tell<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.769> about

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that in mind when I tell you about

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.580 
that in mind when I tell you about
everything<00:02:26.220> else<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:27.150> corn<00:02:27.870> products<00:02:28.290> are

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
everything else so corn products are

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.860 
everything else so corn products are
basically<00:02:29.489> comprised<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.420> something<00:02:30.720> called

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
basically comprised of something called

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.470 
basically comprised of something called
mycoprotein<00:02:31.909> the<00:02:32.909> many<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.360> are

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
mycoprotein the many of you are

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.270 
mycoprotein the many of you are
wondering<00:02:33.659> what<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.470> heck<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.739> mycoprotein

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
wondering what the heck is mycoprotein

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.270 
wondering what the heck is mycoprotein
so<00:02:35.879> mycoprotein<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.349> said<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.769> be<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.890> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
so mycoprotein is said to be a a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.360 
so mycoprotein is said to be a a
mushroom<00:02:38.909> like<00:02:38.940> organism<00:02:39.829> but<00:02:40.829> I<00:02:40.860> did<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.159> lot

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
mushroom like organism but I did a lot

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.130 
mushroom like organism but I did a lot
of<00:02:41.400> research<00:02:41.640> which<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.510> should<00:02:42.750> do<00:02:42.959> if

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
of research which you should do if

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.500 
of research which you should do if
you're<00:02:43.349> promoting<00:02:43.590> products<00:02:44.310> or<00:02:45.090> sharing

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
you're promoting products or sharing

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.380 
you're promoting products or sharing
them<00:02:45.660> let's<00:02:45.930> lift<00:02:46.349> a<00:02:46.879> mycoprotein<00:02:47.879> they've

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
them let's lift a mycoprotein they've

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.050 
them let's lift a mycoprotein they've
said<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:49.079> actually<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> mushroom<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.940> is

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
said is not actually a mushroom but is

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.569 
said is not actually a mushroom but is
more<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.420> fungus<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.829> is<00:02:52.950> not<00:02:53.099> naturally

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
more of fungus and it is not naturally

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.080 
more of fungus and it is not naturally
you<00:02:54.510> know<00:02:54.769> derived<00:02:55.769> from<00:02:56.069> anything<00:02:56.519> it's<00:02:56.790> you

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
you know derived from anything it's you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.089 
you know derived from anything it's you
know<00:02:57.209> chemically<00:02:57.750> engineered<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.769> lot<00:02:59.010> of

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
know chemically engineered and a lot of

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.089 
know chemically engineered and a lot of
people<00:02:59.310> are<00:02:59.400> against<00:02:59.849> these<00:03:00.420> products<00:03:01.069> but<00:03:02.069> I

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
people are against these products but I

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.699 
people are against these products but I
will<00:03:02.370> go<00:03:02.579> into<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:04.019> know<00:03:04.140> what<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.590> can

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
will go into you know what you can

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.940 
will go into you know what you can
expect<00:03:04.829> what<00:03:05.579> I<00:03:05.609> like<00:03:05.879> so<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.530> corn<00:03:10.530> product

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
expect what I like so the corn product

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.009 
expect what I like so the corn product
this<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.519> veggie<00:03:12.090> burger<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.720> they<00:03:12.840> come

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
this is the veggie burger so they come

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.620 
this is the veggie burger so they come
in<00:03:13.200> rosin<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:14.579> like<00:03:14.730> frozen<00:03:14.970> little<00:03:15.269> patties

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
in rosin just like frozen little patties

in rosin just like frozen little patties
my<00:03:16.410> first<00:03:16.620> implant<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.400> they<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:18.030> know<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
my first implant is that they you know I

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.020 
my first implant is that they you know I
think<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.139> price<00:03:19.349> point<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.739> good<00:03:20.010> I'll<00:03:20.849> go

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
think the price point is good I'll go

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.120 
think the price point is good I'll go
into<00:03:21.239> everything<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.840> there's<00:03:22.200> no<00:03:22.410> packaging

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
into everything so there's no packaging

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.530 
into everything so there's no packaging
around<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.609> would<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.030> think<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.419> very

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
around this would you think it's very

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.440 
around this would you think it's very
interesting<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.769> don't<00:03:26.700> really<00:03:26.849> buy<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.030> ton<00:03:27.419> of

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
interesting I don't really buy a ton of

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.780 
interesting I don't really buy a ton of
frozen<00:03:27.870> products<00:03:28.169> but<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.319> do<00:03:28.410> see<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.250> you

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
frozen products but I do see that you

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.150 
frozen products but I do see that you
know<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> lot<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.480> vegans<00:03:30.959> type<00:03:31.590> brands<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.040> they

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
know a lot of vegans type brands if they

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.740 
know a lot of vegans type brands if they
offer<00:03:32.370> something<00:03:32.669> similar<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:33.329> comes<00:03:33.569> at

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
offer something similar it comes at

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.319 
offer something similar it comes at
least<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:34.430> some<00:03:35.430> sort<00:03:35.639> of<00:03:35.700> package<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.299> I

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
least in some sort of package but I

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.240 
least in some sort of package but I
guess<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.810> look<00:03:36.959> at<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:37.590> you're

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
guess if you look at it you know you're

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.089 
guess if you look at it you know you're
cutting<00:03:38.579> down<00:03:38.760> on<00:03:39.030> waste<00:03:39.329> perhaps<00:03:40.049> but<00:03:41.010> they

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
cutting down on waste perhaps but they

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.270 
cutting down on waste perhaps but they
come<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.879> I<00:03:42.019> for<00:03:43.019> me<00:03:43.199> I<00:03:43.440> didn't<00:03:44.129> cook

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
come like this so I for me I didn't cook

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.710 
come like this so I for me I didn't cook
it<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.519> pan<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:45.000> think<00:03:45.209> you're<00:03:45.329> just<00:03:45.449> adding

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
it in a pan I think you're just adding

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.500 
it in a pan I think you're just adding
excess<00:03:46.079> oil<00:03:46.379> and<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:47.549> like<00:03:47.879> to<00:03:47.970> use<00:03:48.090> olive<00:03:48.269> oil

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
excess oil and I like to use olive oil

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.689 
excess oil and I like to use olive oil
and<00:03:48.690> when<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.870> heat<00:03:49.079> olive<00:03:49.230> oil<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.400> very

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
and when you heat olive oil to a very

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.059 
and when you heat olive oil to a very
high<00:03:50.910> temperature<00:03:51.169> which<00:03:52.169> is<00:03:52.290> past<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.680> smoke

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
high temperature which is past the smoke

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.000 
high temperature which is past the smoke
point<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.879> becomes<00:03:54.239> carcinogenic<00:03:55.199> and<00:03:55.379> either

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
point it becomes carcinogenic and either

as<00:06:04.000> far<00:06:04.180> as<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.479> quality<00:06:04.840> of<00:06:05.050> it<00:06:05.229> I<00:06:05.560> will

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
as far as the quality of it I will

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.650 
as far as the quality of it I will
compare

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
compare

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.260 
compare
I'd<00:06:07.840> say<00:06:08.050> it<00:06:08.200> has<00:06:08.440> a<00:06:08.800> very<00:06:09.220> neat<00:06:09.520> like<00:06:09.730> texture

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
I'd say it has a very neat like texture

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.390 
I'd say it has a very neat like texture
which<00:06:10.840> is<00:06:10.870> not<00:06:11.290> a<00:06:11.770> typical<00:06:12.280> of<00:06:12.700> vegan<00:06:13.110> products

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
which is not a typical of vegan products

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.010 
which is not a typical of vegan products
but<00:06:15.400> I<00:06:15.430> would<00:06:15.730> say<00:06:15.850> it's<00:06:16.030> not<00:06:16.180> really<00:06:16.450> my<00:06:16.630> cup

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
but I would say it's not really my cup

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.900 
but I would say it's not really my cup
of<00:06:17.050> tea<00:06:17.170> just<00:06:17.440> because<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.740> don't<00:06:18.310> naturally

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
of tea just because I don't naturally

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.850 
of tea just because I don't naturally
gravitate<00:06:19.480> towards<00:06:19.870> wheat<00:06:20.050> products<00:06:20.680> so

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
gravitate towards wheat products so

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.920 
gravitate towards wheat products so
something<00:06:21.250> that<00:06:21.370> reminds<00:06:21.880> me<00:06:21.940> of<00:06:22.060> that<00:06:22.120> just

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
something that reminds me of that just

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.110 
something that reminds me of that just
makes<00:06:23.140> me<00:06:23.380> a<00:06:23.410> little<00:06:23.500> you<00:06:24.100> know<00:06:24.250> anything<00:06:24.820> but

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120
