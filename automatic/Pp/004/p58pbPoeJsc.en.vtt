00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.600
 this is for those who 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.250
 here from 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.200
 cars left only lights all 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.660
 the rest, respectively, and the owner 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.279
 car completely as it is 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.840
 Satan himself is an engineer and I understand that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.599
 he himself has completely thought of a design 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.689
 respectively, that's all body kits 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.360
 everything is called metal surgery yes then 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.579
 what to do with the door machine as you see 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.460
 it's all very long hard work 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.160
 something did not work immediately altered 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.520
 several times but what was the car with 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.310
 volume 1 and 8 turbo as I understand it 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.720
 rear and front-wheel drive or floor and 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.030
 front-wheel drive respectively 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.400
 redoing the car all brake 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.640
 the system costs brembo residual drives 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.920
 wheels stand in style room with fully 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.830
 redone the whole body kit it's all done 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.590
 suspensions wings 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.310
 which is redone in the car now order 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.310
 320 horsepower it will help cars 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:33.229
 cool like a fast and furious movie. 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:35.569
 being done is also told that he is the first 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.090
 the guy on street racing came beautifully 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.429
 let it so too 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.860
 worth nitrous oxide we just bred 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.539
 nozzles specifically for show when 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.549
 purely show car so that you can 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.549
 drive up and release 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.049
 also a car and accordingly 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.200
 redone exhaust system + added 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.340
 this one is on cars 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.420
 just rs and here you see 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.610
 accordingly rises and falls 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.319
 they introduced it all here 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.840
 hooked up everything works for speed 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.269
 opens as expected but very much. 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.630
 really cool 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:22.290
 how much money drowned here more 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.720
 million more than a million listens to the very 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.430
 I look at it and it seems to me that here I am 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.430
 I think even closer to two probably
