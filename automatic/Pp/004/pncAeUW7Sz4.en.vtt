00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
like all of these games they're designed

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.829 
like all of these games they're designed
to<00:00:27.409> be<00:00:27.829> fun<00:00:28.159> but<00:00:28.429> also<00:00:28.609> to<00:00:28.819> make<00:00:29.119> kids<00:00:29.449> think

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
to be fun but also to make kids think

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.319 
to be fun but also to make kids think
there's<00:00:30.199> slightly<00:00:30.529> educational<00:00:31.369> or<00:00:31.849> maybe<00:00:32.239> a

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
there's slightly educational or maybe a

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.480 
there's slightly educational or maybe a
lot<00:00:32.540> educational<00:00:33.200> this<00:00:33.710> one<00:00:33.920> is<00:00:34.040> like<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
lot educational this one is like the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.220 
lot educational this one is like the
opposite<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.030> memory<00:00:35.360> match<00:00:35.540> you<00:00:35.840> have<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.080> put

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
opposite of memory match you have to put

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.540 
opposite of memory match you have to put
things<00:00:36.500> side<00:00:37.310> by<00:00:37.340> side<00:00:38.030> you<00:00:38.510> cannot

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
things side by side you cannot

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.650 
things side by side you cannot
everything<00:00:40.550> that<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:40.970> put<00:00:41.180> next<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.510> each

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
everything that you put next to each

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.410 
everything that you put next to each
other<00:00:41.810> can't<00:00:42.320> match<00:00:42.880> what<00:00:43.880> else<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.180> put<00:00:44.300> that

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
other can't match what else you put that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.240 
other can't match what else you put that
so<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:44.750> basically<00:00:44.870> instead<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.950> putting

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
so it so basically instead of putting

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.470 
so it so basically instead of putting
things<00:00:46.280> together<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:46.700> match<00:00:46.970> your<00:00:47.210> put

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
things together that match your put

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.640 
things together that match your put
things<00:00:47.630> together<00:00:47.720> that<00:00:47.930> don't<00:00:48.140> match<00:00:48.440> it

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
things together that don't match it

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.100 
things together that don't match it
remotely<00:00:49.240> so<00:00:50.240> that's<00:00:50.420> confusing<00:00:50.810> for<00:00:50.990> some

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
remotely so that's confusing for some

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.620 
remotely so that's confusing for some
kids<00:00:51.350> who<00:00:51.470> teaches<00:00:51.680> kind<00:00:52.520> of<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.090> opposite

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
kids who teaches kind of the opposite

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.290 
kids who teaches kind of the opposite
and<00:00:53.840> make<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.710> think<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:55.430> that's<00:00:55.610> what<00:00:55.760> saddle

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
and make you think so that's what saddle

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:16.570 
and make you think so that's what saddle
up<00:00:56.390> is<00:00:56.600> all<00:00:56.780> about<00:01:14.620> saddle<00:01:15.620> up<00:01:15.710> comes<00:01:16.010> with<00:01:16.190> 50

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
up is all about saddle up comes with 50

up is all about saddle up comes with 50

horizontally or vertically but when you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.539 
horizontally or vertically but when you
do<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.049> for<00:01:33.260> example<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.770> can't<00:01:34.040> put<00:01:34.190> these<00:01:34.370> two

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549

do it for example I can't put these two
cards<00:01:34.820> together<00:01:34.909> for<00:01:35.240> two<00:01:35.360> reasons<00:01:35.540> 1i<00:01:35.990> have

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
cards together for two reasons 1i have

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.289 
cards together for two reasons 1i have
two<00:01:36.740> boots<00:01:37.010> next<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.370> each<00:01:37.430> other<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.850> I

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
two boots next to each other and to I

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.510 
two boots next to each other and to I
have<00:01:38.600> two<00:01:38.810> blues<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.350> are<00:01:39.470> diagonal<00:01:39.950> both<00:01:40.340> of

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
have two blues that are diagonal both of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.690 
have two blues that are diagonal both of
those<00:01:40.670> are<00:01:40.940> not<00:01:41.479> allowed<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.310> can<00:01:43.460> flip<00:01:43.549> the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
those are not allowed so I can flip the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700 
those are not allowed so I can flip the
card<00:01:43.909> over<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:45.049> still<00:01:45.260> doesn't<00:01:45.470> work

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
card over and it still doesn't work

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.590 
card over and it still doesn't work
because<00:01:45.979> there<00:01:46.460> are<00:01:46.580> two<00:01:46.790> saddles<00:01:47.210> or<00:01:47.330> next<00:01:47.540> to

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
because there are two saddles or next to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.130 
because there are two saddles or next to
each<00:01:47.690> other<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:48.110> try<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.040> this<00:01:49.220> way<00:01:49.520> and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
each other I try to do it this way and

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.260 
each other I try to do it this way and
here<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.170> have<00:01:51.530> two<00:01:52.100> greens<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.760> two<00:01:52.880> saddles

here I have two greens and two saddles

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.359 
here I have two greens and two saddles
that's<00:01:53.450> no<00:01:53.600> good<00:01:53.810> flip<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.560> over<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.830> have<00:01:55.070> two

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
that's no good flip it over I have two

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.480 
that's no good flip it over I have two
horseshoes<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.570> are<00:01:56.689> diagonally<00:01:57.170> ah<00:01:57.460> here<00:01:58.460> i

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
horseshoes that are diagonally ah here i

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.520 
horseshoes that are diagonally ah here i
have<00:01:58.790> two<00:01:59.119> boots<00:01:59.540> so<00:01:59.810> that<00:01:59.930> doesn't<00:02:00.200> work<00:02:00.320> this

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
have two boots so that doesn't work this

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.340 
have two boots so that doesn't work this
way<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:01.159> blues<00:02:01.520> are<00:02:01.820> diagonal<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.510> tried<00:02:03.200> this

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
way to blues are diagonal I tried this

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.460 
way to blues are diagonal I tried this
way<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.710> lo<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.310> behold<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:05.150> works<00:02:05.540> four

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
way and lo and behold it works four

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.229 
way and lo and behold it works four
different<00:02:06.770> colors<00:02:06.860> for<00:02:07.250> different<00:02:07.670> shapes

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
different colors for different shapes

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.440 
different colors for different shapes
and<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.310> add<00:02:10.459> more<00:02:10.759> cards<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.300> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
and so you can add more cards to the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.380 
and so you can add more cards to the
grid<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.470> let's<00:02:12.680> say<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.860> add<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.310> one<00:02:13.490> here

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
grid so let's say I add this one here

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.980 
grid so let's say I add this one here
and<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:16.100> can<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.760> red<00:02:17.660> green<00:02:17.960> yellow

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
and you can see that red green yellow

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.980 
and you can see that red green yellow
grey<00:02:18.650> red<00:02:18.950> grey<00:02:19.190> yellow<00:02:19.459> green<00:02:19.990> fork

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
grey red grey yellow green fork

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.480 
grey red grey yellow green fork
everything's<00:02:21.560> different<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.280> those<00:02:22.459> are

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
everything's different so those are

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.830 
everything's different so those are
allowed<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.730> go<00:02:22.970> there<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.480> say<00:02:23.660> wait<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
allowed to go there and you say wait a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.510 
allowed to go there and you say wait a
minute<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:24.260> those<00:02:24.440> two<00:02:24.709> Reds<00:02:24.950> are<00:02:25.100> diagonal

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
minute but those two Reds are diagonal

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.580 
minute but those two Reds are diagonal
well<00:02:25.790> if<00:02:26.030> they<00:02:26.540> were<00:02:26.600> two<00:02:26.930> cards<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.470> are

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
well if they were two cards that are

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.040 
well if they were two cards that are
orthogonally<00:02:28.340> adjacent<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.750> wouldn't

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
orthogonally adjacent that that wouldn't

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.660 
orthogonally adjacent that that wouldn't
work<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:30.530> because<00:02:30.709> they're<00:02:31.040> diagonally

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
work but because they're diagonally

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.490 
work but because they're diagonally
adjacent<00:02:32.240> that's<00:02:32.540> allowed<00:02:32.900> that's<00:02:33.320> actually

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
adjacent that's allowed that's actually

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.770 
adjacent that's allowed that's actually
little<00:02:33.830> confusing<00:02:34.160> for<00:02:34.400> kids<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.630> there's

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
little confusing for kids but there's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.030 
little confusing for kids but there's
three<00:02:35.990> games<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.440> play<00:02:36.470> with<00:02:36.709> this<00:02:36.830> in

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
three games you can play with this in

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.290 
three games you can play with this in
one<00:02:37.790> game<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.540> turn<00:02:38.780> over<00:02:38.990> two<00:02:39.410> cards<00:02:39.830> and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
one game you turn over two cards and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.790 
one game you turn over two cards and
players<00:02:41.300> are<00:02:41.540> looking<00:02:41.900> at<00:02:42.020> these<00:02:42.170> two<00:02:42.410> cards

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
players are looking at these two cards

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.240 
players are looking at these two cards
trying<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.370> find<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:44.380> legitimate<00:02:45.380> spot<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.069> put

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
trying to find a legitimate spot to put

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.520 
trying to find a legitimate spot to put
them<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.760> board<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.900> first<00:02:48.140> person

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
them on the board and the first person

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.170 
them on the board and the first person
to<00:02:48.560> find<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.980> will<00:02:49.100> shout<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.550> out<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.910> be<00:02:50.090> able

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
to find it will shout it out and be able

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.270 
to find it will shout it out and be able
to<00:02:50.330> put<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.720> board<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.200> you're<00:02:52.160> not

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
to put on the board and you're not

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.530 
to put on the board and you're not
allowed<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.519> pick<00:02:52.790> them<00:02:53.000> up<00:02:53.120> you're<00:02:53.390> not

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
allowed to pick them up you're not

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.120 
allowed to pick them up you're not
allowed<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.780> rotate<00:02:54.080> them<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.860> can<00:02:55.010> be

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
allowed to rotate them so it can be

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.280 
allowed to rotate them so it can be
quite<00:02:55.340> difficult<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.970> fact<00:02:56.239> right<00:02:56.930> now<00:02:56.959> I'm

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
quite difficult in fact right now I'm

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.630 
quite difficult in fact right now I'm
trying<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.590> do<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.860> as<00:02:57.980> I'm<00:02:58.130> talking<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.580> you

trying to do it as I'm talking to you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.949 
trying to do it as I'm talking to you
and<00:02:58.850> I'm<00:02:58.910> really<00:02:59.180> having<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.660> hard<00:02:59.690> time

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and I'm really having a hard time

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.620 
and I'm really having a hard time
figuring<00:03:00.350> out<00:03:00.709> where<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.489> put<00:03:01.940> either<00:03:02.239> of

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
figuring out where to put either of

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.940 
figuring out where to put either of
these<00:03:03.110> cards<00:03:04.239> so<00:03:05.239> but<00:03:05.510> let's<00:03:05.690> say<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.870> could<00:03:06.350> let

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
these cards so but let's say I could let

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.440 
these cards so but let's say I could let
me<00:03:07.040> find<00:03:07.280> one<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.550> I<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.820> can<00:03:07.940> put<00:03:08.300> out

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
me find one that I know I can put out

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.630 
me find one that I know I can put out
all<00:03:09.260> right<00:03:09.410> here<00:03:09.739> let's<00:03:09.980> say<00:03:10.130> this<00:03:10.280> was<00:03:10.459> one<00:03:10.610> of

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
all right here let's say this was one of

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.729 
all right here let's say this was one of
the<00:03:10.760> two<00:03:10.910> cards<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.630> say<00:03:11.810> AHA<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.980> goes<00:03:13.340> here

the two cards and I say AHA it goes here

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.470 
the two cards and I say AHA it goes here
if<00:03:15.739> that<00:03:15.920> happens<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.519> get<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.150> keep<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.450> other

if that happens I get to keep the other

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.259 
if that happens I get to keep the other
card<00:03:17.870> okay<00:03:18.620> that's<00:03:18.950> one<00:03:19.130> game<00:03:19.310> first<00:03:19.640> person

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
card okay that's one game first person

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.819 
card okay that's one game first person
to<00:03:20.329> get<00:03:20.450> enough<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.140> these<00:03:21.260> cards<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
to get enough of these cards is the

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.949 
to get enough of these cards is the
winner<00:03:22.010> another<00:03:23.000> version<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.690> give<00:03:23.810> each

players have cards in their hands and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.850 
players have cards in their hands and
they<00:03:35.630> just<00:03:35.810> put<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.019> in<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.290> cards<00:03:36.530> as<00:03:36.620> fast

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
they just put that in the cards as fast

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.740 
they just put that in the cards as fast
they<00:03:37.010> can<00:03:37.130> on<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.400> grid<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:38.540> first

of<00:03:41.180> all<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.450> cards<00:03:41.690> in<00:03:41.780> our<00:03:41.900> hand<00:03:42.110> is<00:03:42.260> also<00:03:42.799> the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
of all the cards in our hand is also the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.130 
of all the cards in our hand is also the
winner<00:03:43.329> so<00:03:44.329> that's<00:03:44.480> basically<00:03:44.570> how<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:44.959> play

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
winner so that's basically how you play

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.330 
winner so that's basically how you play
the<00:03:45.170> game<00:03:45.290> as<00:03:45.530> long<00:03:45.650> as<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:45.890> remember<00:03:46.100> that

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
the game as long as you remember that

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.490 
the game as long as you remember that
matching<00:03:46.850> or<00:03:47.000> actually<00:03:47.390> lack<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:48.049> matching

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
matching or actually lack of matching
