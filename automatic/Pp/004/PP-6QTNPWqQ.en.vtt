00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.369
 units 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.310

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.880
 start the battle free on the map 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:49.420
 for metal 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.909
 and not tilted because they come to the same 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.810
 time and in your game 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.130
 community 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:02.240
 I already enter sometimes at times 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.060
 good sometimes the vÃ©lez to yours and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.360
 here you have the little circle and above 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.850
 enemies as they go 0-0 for now 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.970
 then to the left are all yours 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.610
 and down to the left has the life that 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.330
 you stay and save with in the kilometers 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.070
 how it goes totally would go for example in 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.410
 the caterpillar will get the caterpillar from 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.420
 orange or red turn red is that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.870
 for cat 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.930
 as you see one of my team has 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.930
 killed one of our people go 11 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.480
 then if you want to talk in the dialogue 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.550
 what they have to give intro to put 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:55.879
 for example or the ideology of interest 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.879
 to the euro or losing 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.640
 and good if you hit the button to 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.460
 above you can register the master with 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.400
 powers for better 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.100
 and not for 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.390
 earning with insurance have completed 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.569
 and good 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.569
 I'm going to try that in a few months 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.319
 what is urgent this part of the skin 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.319
 but good 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.659
 another thing 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.260
 to dirty ones 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.220
 i 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.000
 has died one of the lane is good the 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:59.579
 friendly base wanted records captured 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.120
 so the one that reds on the map to the 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.569
 right when you get to work and what 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.700
 I will try 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.930
 and try to load more good with it 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.959
 dedicate to the call that I have left and 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.120
 now how do you see where the point is 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.139
 putting more and more red is the level 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.139
 of liquid cargo 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.340
 ah 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.110
 they do not see an uncle 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.379
 yes 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.220
 this is the huge 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.330
 ah 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.720
 look 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.380
 Well they killed me 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.289
 and the natural base, that is, we are going to 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.880
 to lose 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.000
 as you see below on the left 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.440
 they have all the damage we carry 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.510
 how they see a lot of good now battle 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.670
 and when the battle is over we put you 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.860
 defeated victory and the currency that 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.320
 they will always be older and now what 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.400
 all right 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.710
 we inhabit and I do not have to water the 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.370
 shove because earlier 24 if I'm not 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.650
 waiting quite then when 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.150
 we have is judicial should develop 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:44.590
 here and it's explaining 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:51.040
 According to Europe, they ask you for money 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:54.350
 and good and this all because there is nothing 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.990
 good to know what's there 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.689
 here they have the deposit are all 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.369
 tanks that have study 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.369
 but what do their tanks cost? 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:08.949
 the store different both the tank 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:11.399
 freeing heavy that depends on the 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:15.039
 forces with the fast etc 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:18.179
 the abbot of service that how have you been 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.179

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.879
 they do not have something technological 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.930
 well they notice that they have like 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:31.259
 buying it get a bigger one 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.930
 then there are the barracks that are the 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:37.330
 They are important 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:41.740

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:45.889
 higher level everyone can be love and 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:53.600

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:01.210
 punt editorial I can do a battle 

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:03.670
 of euphoria 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.510
 to learn to play 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.510
