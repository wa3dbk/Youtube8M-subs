00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.850
 at this stand we have presented 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.890
 lighting 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.320
 its functionality given lighting 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.620
 block layout systems 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.620
 of management 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.530
 the ability to integrate the two systems into 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.760
 one of the fixtures 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.940
 on this stand I want you 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.940
 to demonstrate 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.090
 proximity switch sans so 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.340
 called dimmable 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.810
 This lamp is especially so that 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.810
 he has the focus lens vt 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.870
 turn accordingly also he 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 is regulated 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.100
 here are the lamps which 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.830
 more used by jewelers shopping 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.840
 equipment or in any object 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.110
 need to light 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.680
 telescopic lift 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.400
 that go inside the case there 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.400
 cold and warm glow 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.180
 here is a more designer lamp 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.700
 who has the ability to line up 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.859
 when mounting in different directions 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.689
 up and down adjustment 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.999
 downstairs lamp with protection class ip44 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.590
 blog posts that allows 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.829
 bathroom applications 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.329
 also on kitchen sets 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.619
 the only back side has 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.619
 protection class these 20 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.090
 LED strips our novelty 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.090
 luminaire with two mounting systems 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.840
 but also an invoice 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.840
 turns off using the sensor 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.640
 ride world 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.500
 our touch lights 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.820
 rgb tape 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.830
 shelf support 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.869
 which do not carry the function of the spider holder 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.350
 but is lighting and scattered 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.350
 this stream 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.890
 universal focused 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.570
 shelf support that only illuminates 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.060
 edge edging 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.060
 which gives an interesting solution 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.349
 used in glass thickness from 6 to 12 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.349
 millimeters 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.620
 here the lines show diagrams 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.599
 wiring distribution 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.819
 this circle means self catering 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.670
 the outlet you plug into a regular outlet 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.299
 our driver through the connector accordingly 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.799
 connect it from the driver 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.540
 connector god which distributes light and 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.319
 a switch that gives control 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.790
 opportunity 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.939
 accordingly what makes us different from 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.879
 we have no other competing companies 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.910
 we twist everything goes by connecting 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.920
 through the connector 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.590
 people not having much experience in 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.030
 an electrician can assemble mount it 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.790
 by myself 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.770
 at this booth personalized new 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.480
 converter for 350 milliampere hour which 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.190
 allows you to integrate two systems into 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.830
 one 12 volts to 350 milliamps 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.450
 here is the pier she too 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.069
 new 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.989
 extension cable which has six 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.860
 millimeters one and a half meter to 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.879
 each chipset 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.879
 goes to 4 lights 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.750
 opportunity 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.540
 from one slot from the driver distribution 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.939
 on 6 fixtures of our slots that 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.420
 allows at least load the driver on 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:05.790
 Gold is represented here 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.790
 one driver three switches 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.090
 this booth shows the opportunity 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.850
 single switch control 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.520
 three drivers 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.170
 different floors 12 24 volts 30 years 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.000
 milliamps per hour that is 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.140
 systems can be controlled using just 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.560
 just one switch and this one 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.560
 boxes 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.270
 here is the cult system 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.270
 the ability to control from the remote 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.040
 my valentine 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.630
 will be a separate article 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.250
 god of the receiver is a separate part number 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.870
 This path is suitable for other sides. 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.590
 receiver 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.590
 this system 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.000
 here is shown that from one driver 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.530
 you could do the distribution 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.340
 switch and two respectively 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.340
 lighting systems
