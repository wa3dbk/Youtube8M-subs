00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.420
 Thank you so much!! 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.700
 Good family 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.210
 Today we want to introduce you 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.320
 to a friend of ours that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.050
 he has been accompanying us 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.420
 in some concerts we have done in Barcelona 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.050
 and for Catalonia. 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.740
 She is here from these lands 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.500
 and of course, 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.050
 we had to invite him to come today. 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.970
 She is called Marina 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.430
 and it will help us to sing this song 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.050
 in Sign Language Catalana. 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.740
 Please a lot of applause for her! 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.830
 A strong applause 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.120
 for the Navy 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.480
 who is the artist who carries us. 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.590
 That is the applause in Sign Language eh !! 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.060
 Beyond !! A strong applause that sounds, 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.390
 this one that sounds like the Navy 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.010
 that accompanies us many times 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.530
 with this sensibility 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.200
 and bringing the song to many people who would not arrive. 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.070
 Thank you very much, Jalón, really. 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.040
 We leave you with "Sva-ters" 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.270
 which now wears the big party. 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.500
 This is not over, this begins. 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.120
 Truly, thank you very much. 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.930
 We are very far from home 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.400
 and we felt very well welcomed. 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.850
 Thanks for this popular dinner so beautiful 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.190
 what are you here for Xaló? 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.000
 And so keep up the Holidays, really. 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.540
 And places full, that's life! 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.440
 Now in some corner of the square here we will ride 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.160
 a little stall. 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.180
 If someone wants a T-shirt, 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.050
 a disk 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.410
 or make a beer, 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.930
 we are here, right? 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.150
 Thank you so much!
