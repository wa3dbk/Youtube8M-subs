expect that however if you remember last
season<00:02:01.289> when<00:02:01.499> we<00:02:01.560> played<00:02:01.799> against<00:02:02.009> hall<00:02:02.219> first

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
season when we played against hall first

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.120 
season when we played against hall first
uh<00:02:02.810> first<00:02:03.810> half<00:02:04.079> against<00:02:04.319> all<00:02:04.469> last<00:02:04.710> season<00:02:04.890> we

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
uh first half against all last season we

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.399 
uh first half against all last season we
played<00:02:05.310> great<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.060> I'd<00:02:06.329> say<00:02:06.479> overall<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
played great and I'd say overall that

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.350 
played great and I'd say overall that
that<00:02:07.859> first<00:02:08.130> home<00:02:08.369> game<00:02:08.610> last<00:02:08.880> season<00:02:09.000> he<00:02:09.149> did

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that first home game last season he did

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.050 
that first home game last season he did
play<00:02:09.479> very<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.470> well<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.700> got<00:02:11.880> into

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
play very very well and then got into

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
play very very well and then got into
our<00:02:12.210> second<00:02:12.660> game<00:02:12.780> last<00:02:13.020> season<00:02:13.319> he<00:02:13.530> was

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
our second game last season he was

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.190 
our second game last season he was
against<00:02:13.830> Aston<00:02:14.610> Villa<00:02:14.640> mid<00:02:15.060> week<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.480> we

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
against Aston Villa mid week and we

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.290 
against Aston Villa mid week and we
struggled<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.950> game<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:18.000> hope<00:02:18.180> that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
struggled in that game and I hope that

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.330 
struggled in that game and I hope that
we<00:02:18.390> don't<00:02:18.510> get<00:02:18.690> second<00:02:19.110> game<00:02:19.290> syndrome<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.159> you

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
think obviously are the golfing quantity

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.520 
think obviously are the golfing quantity
that<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:39.530> have<00:02:39.769> will<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.610> know<00:02:40.700> be<00:02:40.909> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
that we have will you know be the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.860 
that we have will you know be the
turning<00:02:42.530> point<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.040> game<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:44.569> one<00:02:44.720> thing

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
turning point in this game the one thing

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.750 
turning point in this game the one thing
I'm<00:02:44.989> really<00:02:45.019> fearful<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.829> is<00:02:46.010> Bernie<00:02:46.489> getting

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
I'm really fearful of is Bernie getting

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.819 
I'm really fearful of is Bernie getting
a<00:02:46.819> foot<00:02:47.000> no<00:02:47.329> no<00:02:47.480> sorry<00:02:47.720> Lester<00:02:47.989> again<00:02:48.379> an<00:02:48.530> early

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
a foot no no sorry Lester again an early

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.710 
a foot no no sorry Lester again an early
goal<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.489> could<00:02:49.760> dampen<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.269> atmosphere

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
goal that could dampen the atmosphere

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.080 
goal that could dampen the atmosphere
and<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.769> could<00:02:51.950> start<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.370> get<00:02:52.519> us<00:02:52.640> Russian

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
and it could start to get us Russian

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.259 
and it could start to get us Russian
stuff<00:02:53.450> but<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:54.110> think<00:02:54.560> overall<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.340> think<00:02:56.000> this

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
stuff but I think overall I think this

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.670 
stuff but I think overall I think this
would<00:02:56.390> be<00:02:56.420> again<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.930> we<00:02:57.019> will<00:02:57.200> win<00:02:57.349> quite

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
would be again that we will win quite

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.460 
would be again that we will win quite
clearly<00:02:58.069> to<00:02:58.459> be<00:02:58.579> honest<00:02:58.879> I<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.090> think<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.870> um<00:03:00.140> I

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
clearly to be honest I I think that um I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.099 
clearly to be honest I I think that um I
I<00:03:01.190> expect<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:02.000> few<00:03:02.180> goals<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:02.720> game<00:03:02.930> I

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
I expect a few goals in this game I

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.710 
I expect a few goals in this game I
think<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.590> first<00:03:03.769> 10<00:03:04.040> 15<00:03:04.760> 20<00:03:05.209> minutes<00:03:05.480> will<00:03:05.690> be

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
think the first 10 15 20 minutes will be

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.319 
think the first 10 15 20 minutes will be
kg<00:03:06.379> I<00:03:06.410> think<00:03:06.680> we<00:03:06.769> may<00:03:06.920> get<00:03:07.099> an<00:03:07.220> early<00:03:07.640> goal<00:03:07.819> but

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
kg I think we may get an early goal but

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.940 
kg I think we may get an early goal but
in<00:03:08.450> after<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:08.959> think<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.379> we<00:03:09.470> will<00:03:09.620> start

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
in after that I think that we will start

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.920 
in after that I think that we will start
to<00:03:10.190> uh<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.909> know<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.090> find<00:03:11.359> holes<00:03:11.659> in<00:03:11.810> their

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
to uh you know to find holes in their

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.690 
to uh you know to find holes in their
defense<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.560> definitely<00:03:12.950> work<00:03:13.190> they<00:03:13.519> will

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
defense and definitely work they will

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.250 
defense and definitely work they will
come<00:03:13.940> with<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.120> 2<00:03:14.329> blocks<00:03:14.599> before<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:15.049> all

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
come with a 2 blocks before like all

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.170 
come with a 2 blocks before like all
teams<00:03:15.500> do<00:03:15.829> when<00:03:16.489> they<00:03:16.579> come<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.819> stamford

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
teams do when they come to stamford

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.580 
teams do when they come to stamford
bridge<00:03:17.209> isn't<00:03:17.659> in<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.930> bottom<00:03:18.200> half<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.500> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
bridge isn't in the bottom half of the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.399 
bridge isn't in the bottom half of the
table<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.129> yeah<00:03:19.340> expect<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.239> but<00:03:21.200> yeah

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
table so yeah expect that but yeah

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.349 
table so yeah expect that but yeah
overall<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.220> think<00:03:22.310> it's<00:03:22.609> going<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.760> be<00:03:22.879> great<00:03:23.030> I

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
overall I think it's going to be great I

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.240 
overall I think it's going to be great I
want<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.599> see<00:03:23.750> Filipe<00:03:24.200> Luis<00:03:24.230> make<00:03:24.739> his<00:03:24.890> premier

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
want to see Filipe Luis make his premier

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.339 
want to see Filipe Luis make his premier
league<00:03:25.310> debut<00:03:25.459> at<00:03:25.849> left-back<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.629> honestly

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
league debut at left-back I honestly

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.659 
league debut at left-back I honestly
think<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.769> reason<00:03:27.799> why<00:03:28.159> he<00:03:28.280> didn't<00:03:28.579> play

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
think that the reason why he didn't play

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.069 
think that the reason why he didn't play
the<00:03:29.060> first<00:03:29.269> game<00:03:29.389> in<00:03:29.599> the<00:03:29.630> season<00:03:29.930> just

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
the first game in the season just

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.659 
the first game in the season just
because<00:03:30.349> it<00:03:30.470> was<00:03:30.500> against<00:03:30.739> burnley<00:03:31.130> away<00:03:31.400> and

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
because it was against burnley away and

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.819 
because it was against burnley away and
it<00:03:32.480> really<00:03:32.660> wouldn't<00:03:32.930> suit<00:03:33.200> his<00:03:33.319> style<00:03:33.620> in

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
it really wouldn't suit his style in

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.440 
it really wouldn't suit his style in
that<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.130> i'm<00:03:34.430> pretty<00:03:34.700> sure<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:34.819> Mourinho

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
that and i'm pretty sure that Mourinho

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.449 
that and i'm pretty sure that Mourinho
will<00:03:35.630> try<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.840> bed<00:03:36.139> him<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.410> slowly<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.220> surely

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
will try to bed him in slowly but surely

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.890 
will try to bed him in slowly but surely
and<00:03:37.639> also<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:37.849> gotta<00:03:38.000> say<00:03:38.150> jospeh<00:03:38.540> liquid<00:03:38.780> so

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
and also you gotta say jospeh liquid so

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.390 
and also you gotta say jospeh liquid so
there<00:03:39.019> has<00:03:39.109> been<00:03:39.319> performing<00:03:39.709> very<00:03:39.919> very<00:03:40.190> well

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
there has been performing very very well

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.000 
there has been performing very very well
so<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:41.720> going<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.930> be<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.079> very<00:03:42.530> very<00:03:42.769> good

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
so it's going to be a very very good

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.990 
so it's going to be a very very good
game<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.519> I'm<00:03:44.419> going<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.720> be<00:03:44.810> very<00:03:44.989> very<00:03:46.000> focused

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
game I I'm going to be very very focused

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.460 
game I I'm going to be very very focused
and<00:03:47.150> see<00:03:47.359> what<00:03:47.510> happens<00:03:47.840> with<00:03:47.959> Fernando

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
and see what happens with Fernando

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.080 
and see what happens with Fernando
Torres<00:03:48.799> does<00:03:49.160> he<00:03:49.280> get<00:03:49.459> on<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.609> pitch<00:03:49.849> this

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
Torres does he get on the pitch this

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.569 
Torres does he get on the pitch this
time<00:03:50.299> if<00:03:50.750> he<00:03:50.930> doesn't<00:03:51.230> play<00:03:51.379> tomorrow<00:03:51.919> not

even<00:03:52.700> as<00:03:52.879> a<00:03:52.910> substitute<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.750> think<00:03:53.989> it<00:03:54.079> becomes

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
even as a substitute I think it becomes

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.199 
even as a substitute I think it becomes
very<00:03:54.500> very<00:03:55.010> clear<00:03:55.310> that<00:03:55.340> Jose<00:03:55.730> Jose<00:03:55.819> Mourinho

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
very very clear that Jose Jose Mourinho

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.119 
very very clear that Jose Jose Mourinho
doesn't<00:03:56.840> want<00:03:56.989> him<00:03:57.109> at<00:03:57.199> the<00:03:57.230> club<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:58.010> he's

doesn't want him at the club and he's

doesn't want him at the club and he's
