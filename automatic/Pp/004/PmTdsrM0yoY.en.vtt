00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 if you remember last year when 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.589
 I did the press conference of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.690
 closing said the first week 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.670
 will try the four defense unfortunately 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.440
 unfortunately it is not a bad thing is a 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.900
 as a matter of fact I miss so many players 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.740
 who were going back to the world championship 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 precisely because the only purchase 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.240
 important of a certain level than re 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.990
 here train with us apart now 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.580
 arrived also totÃ² however from over all 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.320
 it's easier because a different role is 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.110
 because of what he says I thought 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 appropriate to start from the three-man defense 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.219
 just to do it he will decide for 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.520
 understand what I want that organization 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.710
 from the defense itself to three because each 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.079
 coach to his hand can not be 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.629
 generalize the defense three by four 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.210
 three defense as in this case too 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.850
 mazzarri then the boy 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.219
 I want everyone to absorb them as soon as possible 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
 my concepts and then once that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.870
 everyone will arrive as soon as I get the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.210
 possibility I will also work on defense 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.309
 to four as I said precisely I 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 inverted times here in this sense 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.750
 I believe that moreover player 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.549
 experienced expert like me 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.740
 he says it doesn't take long to understand the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.310
 three defense also because for certain 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.490
 verse is easier because there is more 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.770
 protection there is an extra man to play 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.439
 four 4 because you have to take 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.420
 different mechanisms one by one 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.060
 well understand even visually there is a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.759
 lower cover in front of your own 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.500
 door 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.290
 there are two ways to score many goals 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.390
 that we divide them for the whole team and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.520
 make it a little many in so many 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.700
 nicoli in many or sometimes 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.350
 it happens there is the striker who scores so many goals 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.600
 for how I would like to play there 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.220
 how my team usually play 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.229
 teams easier to find so many 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.250
 players who score more goals 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.730
 to start for example from the exterior 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.130
 midfielders then if we always go 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.979
 beyond what I see 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.350
 signals from other parts today tips 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.300
 states that so many states states that they 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.540
 we see few teams playing like this 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.700
 we see a lot of quality people who do not 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.670
 gives reference points that are inserted 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.680
 we for example come to mind i 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.300
 two names that played the last one 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.180
 match with Lazio for example with 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.310
 hernanes and kovacic is more a striker 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.610
 that as it was also in that game 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.410
 icardi, however, in the games he has 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.160
 did a considerable number 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.720
 of goals like palacio so I think that 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.580
 chance to score goals 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.560
 you play well if we have certain 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.410
 mechanisms there are so many players that 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.500
 They have to make enough 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.540
 for example the hand and if I have unfortunately 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.310
 he too has not even left now 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.450
 this time with us from the beginning why 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.830
 in the world, however, he did me in the past 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.260
 looks in his face in his best 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.720
 vintage made a dozen 12 goals if not 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.570
 so it is not a player 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.040
 being considered an attacker he can though 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.130
 the team plays a certain way but 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.890
 do a number of important thing e 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.870
 kovaci a boy in great evolution 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.760
 we saw it grow with us 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.860
 in the last game right against the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.709
 Lazio was decisive assists and did 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.970
 I believe we will continue to trust 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.980
 and he will deserve it 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.370
 it may be that he also does things in 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.250
 in short, a whole year repeats not 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.840
 I want you to think that without attackers 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.180
 you can't make many goals 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.660
 or the team can only score goals 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.500
 just forwards as people say first 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.500
 tips in short
