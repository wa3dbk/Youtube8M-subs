 I am the saint of our site garden world to us 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.680
 very often ask questions about varieties and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.490
 tomatoes and eggplants and peppers which 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.750

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.230
 experiment this second time i 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.980
 always ask my neighbors what 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.010
 they are better sorts of what they 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.150
 I prefer to grow go and look 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.629
 really where is the good harvest 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.800
 hangs and that's why I choose 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.870
 its varieties 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.970
 I will say that my people like them very much 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.120
 bullish heart that year we had a very 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.670
 a good harvest we have a lot of it would be less than 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.489
 the heart was groove planted there was you 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.019
 than a heart and a lion heart about 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.239

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.890

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.479

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.580
 And now I look at me a lot 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:07.240
 enough varieties and some varieties 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.890
 convenient to sign like this jars 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.800

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.430

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.560
 but also the first time I learned about this variety 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.530
