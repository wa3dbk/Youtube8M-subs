hey guys have you ever been on a

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.650 
hey guys have you ever been on a
mountain<00:00:07.560> bike<00:00:07.620> ride<00:00:08.069> we're<00:00:08.549> about<00:00:09.330> three

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
mountain bike ride we're about three

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.560 
mountain bike ride we're about three
quarters<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:10.049> the<00:00:10.320> way<00:00:10.350> through<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.889> ride<00:00:11.570> you

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
quarters of the way through the ride you

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.090 
quarters of the way through the ride you
ate<00:00:12.750> everything<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.379> had<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.559> drink<00:00:13.980> all

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
ate everything you had you drink all

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.550 
ate everything you had you drink all
your<00:00:14.280> water<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.940> then<00:00:15.270> you<00:00:15.510> just<00:00:15.809> were<00:00:16.199> so

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
your water and then you just were so

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.340 
your water and then you just were so
tired<00:00:17.330> you<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> make<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.900> back<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
tired you have to make it back to the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.170 
tired you have to make it back to the
trailhead<00:00:19.620> and<00:00:20.100> you're<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.520> hungover<00:00:20.880> your

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
trailhead and you're just hungover your

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.950 
trailhead and you're just hungover your
handlebars<00:00:21.980> just<00:00:22.980> completely<00:00:23.720> exhausted<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
handlebars just completely exhausted and

handlebars just completely exhausted and
out<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.650> energy<00:00:26.510> well<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:28.310> athlete<00:00:29.310> slang

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
out of energy well in athlete slang

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
out of energy well in athlete slang
terms<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.990> would<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.350> bonked<00:00:32.030> be<00:00:33.030> 0<00:00:33.300> NK<00:00:33.930> ed

bonked or hit the wall basically well in
most<00:00:40.110> cases<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.710> ran<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.130> of<00:00:41.160> energy<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> in

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
most cases you ran out of energy so in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.210 
most cases you ran out of energy so in
this<00:00:42.989> vid<00:00:43.260> I'll<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.920> over<00:00:44.450> some<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> key

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
this vid I'll go over some of the key

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.850 
this vid I'll go over some of the key
things<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.640> athletes<00:00:48.600> would<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.440> eating

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
things that athletes would be eating

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.610 
things that athletes would be eating
before<00:00:50.640> their<00:00:50.820> athletic<00:00:51.380> activity<00:00:52.380> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
before their athletic activity and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
before their athletic activity and
during<00:00:53.399> their<00:00:53.579> athletic<00:00:54.059> activity<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.050> keep

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
during their athletic activity to keep

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.000 
during their athletic activity to keep
them<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:55.739> bonking<00:00:56.840> okay<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.860> nutshell

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
them from bonking okay so in a nutshell

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.369 
them from bonking okay so in a nutshell
we<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.090> two<00:01:00.780> different<00:01:00.960> types<00:01:01.230> of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
we have two different types of

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.209 
we have two different types of
carbohydrates<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.670> made<00:01:03.420> equal<00:01:04.409> we

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219 
carbohydrates that are not made equal we

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:06.800 
carbohydrates that are not made equal we
have<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> symbol<00:01:05.790> carbohydrates<00:01:06.509> and<00:01:06.719> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
have the symbol carbohydrates and the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.230 
have the symbol carbohydrates and the
complex<00:01:07.229> carbohydrates<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.850> simple

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
complex carbohydrates so simple

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.169 
complex carbohydrates so simple
carbohydrates<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.039> glucose<00:01:11.609> you<00:01:12.060> have

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
carbohydrates you have glucose you have

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.050 
carbohydrates you have glucose you have
sucrose<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.109> have<00:01:13.229> fructose<00:01:13.889> and<00:01:14.249> fructose

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
sucrose you have fructose and fructose

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.830 
sucrose you have fructose and fructose
is<00:01:15.359> from<00:01:16.009> essentially<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.340> fruits<00:01:17.819> that<00:01:18.179> we

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
is from essentially the fruits that we

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.340 
is from essentially the fruits that we
have<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.409> vegetables<00:01:20.719> so<00:01:21.719> basically<00:01:22.200> we

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
have in some vegetables so basically we

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
have in some vegetables so basically we
have<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.469> molecular<00:01:23.219> structure<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:23.999> and<00:01:24.270> it's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
have a molecular structure here and it's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.800 
have a molecular structure here and it's
by<00:01:24.569> itself<00:01:24.959> and<00:01:25.429> these<00:01:26.429> like<00:01:27.060> glucose<00:01:27.569> for

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
by itself and these like glucose for

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.769 
by itself and these like glucose for
instance<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.709> bloodstream<00:01:28.950> it's

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:29.779 
instance is in your bloodstream it's

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:31.999 
instance is in your bloodstream it's
broken<00:01:30.779> down<00:01:30.899> from<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.439> food<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> eat

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
broken down from the food that you eat

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.389 
broken down from the food that you eat
goes<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.759> bloodstream<00:01:33.179> and<00:01:34.069> glucose<00:01:35.069> and

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
goes to your bloodstream and glucose and

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.539 
goes to your bloodstream and glucose and
oxygen<00:01:35.609> feed<00:01:36.389> your<00:01:36.719> cells<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:38.310> produce

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
oxygen feed your cells and they produce

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.569 
oxygen feed your cells and they produce
ATP<00:01:38.999> or<00:01:39.450> adenosine<00:01:40.380> triphosphate<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.429> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
ATP or adenosine triphosphate it's the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.730 
ATP or adenosine triphosphate it's the
production<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.179> energy<00:01:42.389> and<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> whole

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
production of energy and it's the whole

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
production of energy and it's the whole
cellular<00:01:44.490> respiratory<00:01:45.179> cycle<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:47.630> when<00:01:48.630> you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
cellular respiratory cycle so when you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.709 
cellular respiratory cycle so when you
eat<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> bunch<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.219> simple<00:01:51.029> carbohydrates

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
eat a bunch of simple carbohydrates

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.409 
eat a bunch of simple carbohydrates
let's<00:01:51.959> say<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.139> had<00:01:52.380> some<00:01:52.619> fruit<00:01:53.039> juice<00:01:53.419> then

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:54.419 
let's say you had some fruit juice then

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:55.879 
let's say you had some fruit juice then
you're<00:01:54.599> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.749> have<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:55.289> instant<00:01:55.770> energy

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:55.889 
you're going to have some instant energy

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:58.940 
you're going to have some instant energy
because<00:01:56.789> these<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.929> molecular<00:01:58.289> structure

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
because these this molecular structure

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.249 
because these this molecular structure
here<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.279> easy<00:01:59.489> to<00:02:00.239> assimilate<00:02:00.929> in<00:02:01.079> your

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
here it's easy to assimilate in your

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.059 
here it's easy to assimilate in your
blood<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.709> get<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.279> yourselves<00:02:02.669> and<00:02:04.069> you'll

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
blood and get to yourselves and you'll

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.029 
blood and get to yourselves and you'll
have<00:02:05.219> energy<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:06.139> a<00:02:07.139> short<00:02:07.529> period<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.979> time

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
have energy for a short period of time

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.380 
have energy for a short period of time
before<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.690> juice<00:02:09.929> runs<00:02:10.470> out<00:02:10.880> now<00:02:11.880> compare

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
before the juice runs out now compare

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.200 
before the juice runs out now compare
that<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.380> complex<00:02:13.790> carbohydrates<00:02:14.790> which

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
that to the complex carbohydrates which

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.580 
that to the complex carbohydrates which
typically<00:02:15.810> come<00:02:16.080> from<00:02:16.260> star

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
typically come from star

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.890 
typically come from star
churches<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.030> see<00:02:18.209> basically<00:02:18.629> this

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
churches and you can see basically this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.449 
churches and you can see basically this
complex<00:02:19.860> carbohydrate<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.849> chain<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.629> this

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
complex carbohydrate is a chain of this

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.339 
complex carbohydrate is a chain of this
glucose<00:02:23.840> molecule<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.500> chain<00:02:26.180> where

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
glucose molecule here it's a chain where

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.979 
glucose molecule here it's a chain where
after<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.440> digest<00:02:28.860> after<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.819> eat<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.390> start

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
after you digest after you eat and start

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.770 
after you digest after you eat and start
digesting<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:32.220> complex<00:02:32.879> carbohydrate

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
digesting this complex carbohydrate

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.759 
digesting this complex carbohydrate
you'll<00:02:34.080> start<00:02:34.349> breaking<00:02:34.860> these<00:02:35.700> molecules

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
you'll start breaking these molecules

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.710 
you'll start breaking these molecules
into<00:02:37.769> pieces<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.489> there's<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.030> slow<00:02:39.450> release

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
into pieces and there's a slow release

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.920 
into pieces and there's a slow release
of<00:02:40.200> these<00:02:40.860> glucose<00:02:41.760> molecules<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.900> your

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
of these glucose molecules in your

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.289 
of these glucose molecules in your
bloodstream<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.310> that's<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.670> key<00:02:44.849> difference

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
bloodstream so that's the key difference

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.449 
bloodstream so that's the key difference
between<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.870> simple<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.590> complex<00:02:47.099> or

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
between the simple and the complex or

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.000 
between the simple and the complex or
the<00:02:47.489> complex<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.810> takes<00:02:48.870> your<00:02:49.170> body<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.590> while

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
the complex it takes your body a while

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.520 
the complex it takes your body a while
to<00:02:50.430> break<00:02:50.849> this<00:02:51.150> down<00:02:51.390> into<00:02:51.530> individual

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
to break this down into individual

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.789 
to break this down into individual
glucose<00:02:53.160> molecules<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.720> happens<00:02:55.079> over

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
glucose molecules and that happens over

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.270 
glucose molecules and that happens over
hours<00:02:56.340> rather<00:02:56.880> than<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:58.049> few<00:02:58.709> seconds<00:02:59.160> or

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
hours rather than a few seconds or

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.059 
hours rather than a few seconds or
minutes<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.690> simple<00:03:01.049> carbohydrate<00:03:01.739> these

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
minutes of the simple carbohydrate these

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.550 
minutes of the simple carbohydrate these
do<00:03:02.370> not<00:03:02.519> get<00:03:02.700> assimilated<00:03:03.230> quickly<00:03:04.230> because

do not get assimilated quickly because

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.250 
do not get assimilated quickly because
your<00:03:05.040> body<00:03:05.250> needs<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.730> break<00:03:05.910> down<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.870> bond

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
your body needs to break down this bond

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.530 
your body needs to break down this bond
here<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:08.810> oxygen<00:03:09.810> bond<00:03:10.819> so<00:03:11.819> we'll<00:03:12.360> go<00:03:12.510> over

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
here this oxygen bond so we'll go over

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.400 
here this oxygen bond so we'll go over
some<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.099> foods<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:15.060> are<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:16.379> I

wheat bread and for those on a
gluten-free<00:04:29.790> diet<00:04:30.350> they<00:04:31.350> would<00:04:31.590> select<00:04:32.040> from

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
gluten-free diet they would select from

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.280 
gluten-free diet they would select from
the<00:04:32.400> top<00:04:32.610> here<00:04:32.990> potatoes<00:04:33.990> or<00:04:34.320> rice<00:04:36.200> so<00:04:37.200> all

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
the top here potatoes or rice so all

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.740 
the top here potatoes or rice so all
these<00:04:37.500> are<00:04:37.979> just<00:04:38.370> basic<00:04:38.610> examples<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
these are just basic examples of the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.270 
these are just basic examples of the
complex<00:04:40.560> carbohydrates<00:04:42.950> okay<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:43.979> lot<00:04:44.190> of

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
complex carbohydrates okay a lot of

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.550 
complex carbohydrates okay a lot of
people<00:04:44.430> have<00:04:44.760> this<00:04:45.240> ice<00:04:45.600> camelback<00:04:46.290> or

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
people have this ice camelback or

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.000 
people have this ice camelback or
hydration<00:04:46.979> unit<00:04:47.520> which<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.330> 70<00:04:49.290> ounce<00:04:49.470> unit

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
hydration unit which is a 70 ounce unit

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.210 
hydration unit which is a 70 ounce unit
and<00:04:50.600> there's<00:04:51.600> one<00:04:51.810> way<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.020> expand<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.100> amount

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
and there's one way to expand the amount

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.200 
and there's one way to expand the amount
of<00:04:53.750> fluids<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:55.080> carry<00:04:55.380> in<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.919> also<00:04:56.490> carry

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
of fluids you carry in it and also carry

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.990 
of fluids you carry in it and also carry
more<00:04:57.770> carbohydrates<00:04:58.770> as<00:04:59.130> it's<00:04:59.460> simple<00:04:59.850> and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
more carbohydrates as it's simple and

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
more carbohydrates as it's simple and
complex<00:05:00.470> so<00:05:02.090> basically<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:03.120> take<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.750> water

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
complex so basically I take a water

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.960 
complex so basically I take a water
bottle<00:05:04.229> and<00:05:04.590> then<00:05:04.860> I'm<00:05:05.160> currently<00:05:05.490> filling<00:05:05.760> it

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
bottle and then I'm currently filling it

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.279 
bottle and then I'm currently filling it
with<00:05:06.000> cytomax<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.229> there's<00:05:07.979> plenty<00:05:08.190> of<00:05:08.430> other

your<00:05:40.740> blood<00:05:40.800> level<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.580> then<00:05:41.760> you'll<00:05:41.940> come

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
your blood level and then you'll come

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.150

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
and you want to stay away from that so

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.330 
and you want to stay away from that so
it's<00:05:46.950> one<00:05:47.130> way<00:05:47.310> this<00:05:47.940> is<00:05:48.150> one<00:05:48.360> way<00:05:48.510> of<00:05:48.930> holding

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
it's one way this is one way of holding

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.379 
it's one way this is one way of holding
more<00:05:50.340> fluids<00:05:50.820> and<00:05:51.180> it'll<00:05:51.840> be<00:05:51.930> similar<00:05:52.350> to

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
more fluids and it'll be similar to

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.210 
more fluids and it'll be similar to
carrying<00:05:54.389> a<00:05:54.630> hundred<00:05:55.470> ounce<00:05:55.620> unit<00:05:56.070> like<00:05:56.190> this

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
carrying a hundred ounce unit like this

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.190 
carrying a hundred ounce unit like this
sometimes<00:05:56.610> this<00:05:56.940> is<00:05:57.120> just<00:05:57.360> too<00:05:57.600> big<00:05:57.870> for<00:05:58.110> the

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
sometimes this is just too big for the

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.140 
sometimes this is just too big for the
trails

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
trails

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.100 
trails
so<00:06:01.030> sometimes<00:06:02.030> I'll<00:06:02.210> just<00:06:02.330> fill<00:06:02.690> this<00:06:02.870> up

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
so sometimes I'll just fill this up

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.580 
so sometimes I'll just fill this up
because<00:06:03.980> i<00:06:04.220> want<00:06:04.460> the<00:06:04.820> complex<00:06:05.630> carbohydrates

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
because i want the complex carbohydrates

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.880 
because i want the complex carbohydrates
but<00:06:07.280> i'll<00:06:07.670> only<00:06:07.850> fill<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.750> camel<00:06:09.140> back<00:06:09.290> about

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
but i'll only fill this camel back about

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.090 
but i'll only fill this camel back about
fifty<00:06:10.280> percent<00:06:10.670> of<00:06:10.880> water<00:06:11.180> but<00:06:11.810> i'll<00:06:11.930> have<00:06:12.140> my

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
fifty percent of water but i'll have my

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.830 
fifty percent of water but i'll have my
carbohydrates<00:06:13.850> here<00:06:14.150> or<00:06:14.330> maybe<00:06:14.510> three

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
carbohydrates here or maybe three

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.720 
carbohydrates here or maybe three
quarters<00:06:15.290> with<00:06:15.530> water<00:06:15.830> and<00:06:16.160> then<00:06:16.220> I'll<00:06:16.490> carry

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
quarters with water and then I'll carry

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.320 
quarters with water and then I'll carry
this<00:06:17.080> so<00:06:18.080> in<00:06:18.410> it<00:06:18.560> it<00:06:19.100> fits<00:06:19.340> nicely<00:06:19.460> right

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
this so in it it fits nicely right

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.790 
this so in it it fits nicely right
inside<00:06:20.720> there<00:06:20.930> nice<00:06:21.290> and<00:06:21.500> convenient<00:06:23.800> okay

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
inside there nice and convenient okay

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.410 
inside there nice and convenient okay
another<00:06:25.190> thing<00:06:25.310> you<00:06:25.670> can<00:06:25.790> take<00:06:26.030> for

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
another thing you can take for

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.470 
another thing you can take for
additional<00:06:27.260> carbohydrates<00:06:28.070> or<00:06:28.400> the<00:06:28.820> gels<00:06:29.120> and

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
additional carbohydrates or the gels and

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.050 
additional carbohydrates or the gels and
I<00:06:29.600> find<00:06:29.840> these<00:06:30.020> are<00:06:30.400> pretty<00:06:31.400> good<00:06:31.520> for<00:06:32.000> the

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
I find these are pretty good for the

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.840 
I find these are pretty good for the
wait<00:06:32.270> I<00:06:32.600> mean<00:06:32.750> these<00:06:32.900> are<00:06:33.080> very<00:06:33.290> light<00:06:33.620> and<00:06:33.860> one

wait I mean these are very light and one
of<00:06:34.940> these<00:06:35.060> gels<00:06:35.420> is<00:06:35.630> good<00:06:35.810> for<00:06:36.020> about<00:06:36.200> 45

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich most

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.250 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich most
people<00:07:04.940> have<00:07:05.620> read<00:07:07.000> they<00:07:08.000> got<00:07:08.210> jam<00:07:08.930> or<00:07:09.110> jelly

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:12.890 
and they got peanut butter so this is

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.400 
and they got peanut butter so this is
good<00:07:13.130> because<00:07:13.310> like<00:07:14.240> whole<00:07:14.480> wheat<00:07:14.510> get<00:07:15.230> your

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
good because like whole wheat get your

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.250 
good because like whole wheat get your
complex<00:07:15.860> carbohydrates<00:07:16.900> from<00:07:17.900> the<00:07:18.080> wheat

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
complex carbohydrates from the wheat

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.220
