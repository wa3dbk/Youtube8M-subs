00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
beautiful movies I've ever seen yeah I

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.280 
beautiful movies I've ever seen yeah I
saw<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.250> really<00:03:23.610> deserves<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:24.180> 3d<00:03:24.750> treatment

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
saw it really deserves it's 3d treatment

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.140 
saw it really deserves it's 3d treatment
I<00:03:25.380> think<00:03:25.710> so<00:03:25.920> yeah<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.640> do<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.760> think<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
I think so yeah what do you think is the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.490 
I think so yeah what do you think is the
moral<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.480> story<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.780> mean<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.050> for<00:03:28.320> kids

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
moral of the story I mean it's for kids

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.590 
moral of the story I mean it's for kids
right<00:03:28.950> yeah<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> think<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.910> whole<00:03:30.060> point<00:03:30.360> is

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
right yeah I think the whole point is

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.680 
right yeah I think the whole point is
just<00:03:31.700> because<00:03:32.700> things<00:03:32.970> are<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.420> way<00:03:33.510> they<00:03:33.660> are

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
just because things are the way they are

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.970 
just because things are the way they are
now<00:03:34.020> doesn't<00:03:34.410> mean<00:03:34.500> that's<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:34.800> they're

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
now doesn't mean that's how they're

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.200 
now doesn't mean that's how they're
always<00:03:35.130> going<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.490> be<00:03:35.670> or<00:03:35.970> how<00:03:36.060> they're

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
always going to be or how they're

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.640 
always going to be or how they're
supposed<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.570> be<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.990> and<00:03:37.290> then<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.530> other

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
supposed to be and and then the other

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.100 
supposed to be and and then the other
thing<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.070> me<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.520> it's<00:03:38.700> about<00:03:38.970> if<00:03:39.810> you're
