00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
basically if it's something that's

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.960 
basically if it's something that's
already<00:00:16.090> been<00:00:16.240> done<00:00:16.599> I<00:00:17.400> kind<00:00:18.400> of<00:00:18.460> try<00:00:18.610> to<00:00:18.640> study

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
already been done I kind of try to study

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.390 
already been done I kind of try to study
some<00:00:19.210> video<00:00:19.540> on<00:00:19.810> it<00:00:20.080> or<00:00:20.230> watch<00:00:20.619> someone<00:00:21.040> do<00:00:21.220> it

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
some video on it or watch someone do it

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.220 
some video on it or watch someone do it
you<00:00:21.970> see<00:00:22.150> if<00:00:22.240> I<00:00:22.330> can<00:00:22.450> watch<00:00:22.570> someone<00:00:22.840> do<00:00:23.050> it<00:00:23.170> I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
you see if I can watch someone do it I

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.380 
you see if I can watch someone do it I
can<00:00:23.380> pick<00:00:23.619> it<00:00:23.740> up<00:00:23.860> right<00:00:24.010> away<00:00:24.160> but<00:00:24.970> usually

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
can pick it up right away but usually

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.120 
can pick it up right away but usually
you<00:00:25.480> want<00:00:25.630> to<00:00:25.720> step<00:00:25.960> into<00:00:26.230> it<00:00:26.410> you<00:00:26.770> know<00:00:26.920> if

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
you want to step into it you know if

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.910 
you want to step into it you know if
it's<00:00:27.310> like<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:28.660> it's<00:00:28.840> like<00:00:28.930> a<00:00:28.960> flip<00:00:29.289> variation

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
it's like if it's like a flip variation

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.859 
it's like if it's like a flip variation
or<00:00:30.039> something<00:00:30.430> you<00:00:30.580> can<00:00:30.699> usually<00:00:30.939> ease<00:00:31.359> into

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
or something you can usually ease into

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.360 
or something you can usually ease into
them<00:00:32.020> so<00:00:32.199> you<00:00:32.290> just<00:00:32.470> start<00:00:32.680> flipping<00:00:33.070> a<00:00:33.160> bunch

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
them so you just start flipping a bunch

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.970 
them so you just start flipping a bunch
take<00:00:33.790> one<00:00:34.000> step<00:00:34.330> at<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.570> time<00:00:34.660> you<00:00:35.470> just<00:00:35.530> do<00:00:35.830> the

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
take one step at a time you just do the

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.850 
take one step at a time you just do the
baby<00:00:36.160> steps<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:36.850> then<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.530> know<00:00:38.620> if<00:00:38.739> it's

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
baby steps and then you know if it's

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.490 
baby steps and then you know if it's
like<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:40.210> you<00:00:40.360> have<00:00:40.540> to<00:00:40.659> commit<00:00:40.870> fully<00:00:41.199> to

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
like one you have to commit fully to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.200 
like one you have to commit fully to
like<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.769> back<00:00:42.100> flip<00:00:42.370> you're<00:00:42.610> just<00:00:42.820> learning

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
like a back flip you're just learning

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.670 
like a back flip you're just learning
the<00:00:43.300> back<00:00:43.479> foot<00:00:43.720> for<00:00:43.900> the<00:00:43.960> first<00:00:43.989> time<00:00:44.379> then

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
the back foot for the first time then

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.280 
the back foot for the first time then
you<00:00:44.830> got<00:00:44.979> to<00:00:45.070> use<00:00:45.159> the<00:00:45.339> phone<00:00:45.489> bit<00:00:45.790> so<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:47.110> just

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
you got to use the phone bit so it just

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.079 
you got to use the phone bit so it just
depends<00:00:47.710> on<00:00:47.769> what<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.040> want<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.280> do<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:48.790> take

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
depends on what you want to do is take

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.090 
depends on what you want to do is take
your<00:00:49.210> time<00:00:49.420> be<00:00:49.720> safe<00:00:49.750> that's<00:00:50.620> what<00:00:50.769> I<00:00:50.830> try<00:00:51.040> to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
your time be safe that's what I try to

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.530 
your time be safe that's what I try to
do<00:00:51.309> even<00:00:51.519> though<00:00:51.760> it's<00:00:51.909> hard<00:00:52.059> to<00:00:52.210> be<00:00:52.299> safe

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
do even though it's hard to be safe

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.240 
do even though it's hard to be safe
doing<00:00:52.870> this<00:00:52.989> stuff<00:00:53.260> I'll<00:00:53.769> have<00:00:53.949> everything

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
doing this stuff I'll have everything

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.369 
doing this stuff I'll have everything
planned<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.940> usually<00:00:55.659> never<00:00:55.870> works<00:00:56.110> out<00:00:56.350> that

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
planned it usually never works out that

00:00:56.379 --> 00:02:02.370 
planned it usually never works out that
way

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.300 

yeah

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:40.149 

all<00:02:06.850> right<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:10.860> kidding

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:57.970 

yeah<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.170> think<00:02:43.409> oh<00:02:45.140> yeah<00:02:46.140> yeah<00:02:46.590> oh

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.510 

I<00:02:59.170> think<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.470> need<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.709> go<00:03:00.890> ride<00:03:01.130> for<00:03:01.489> a

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
I think I just need to go ride for a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.050 
I think I just need to go ride for a
while<00:03:01.730> now<00:03:02.420> two<00:03:02.780> tears<00:03:03.020> ran<00:03:03.349> out<00:03:03.940> budgets<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
while now two tears ran out budgets and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:04:00.040 
while now two tears ran out budgets and
shred

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.000 

a<00:04:00.910> lot<00:04:01.910> of<00:04:01.940> times<00:04:02.180> I'm<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:02.510> tired<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.140> stressed

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
a lot of times I'm so tired and stressed

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.550 
a lot of times I'm so tired and stressed
out<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.610> shot<00:04:05.270> from<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:05.750> all<00:04:05.900> I'm<00:04:06.230> just<00:04:06.440> an

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
out and shot from it all I'm just an

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.070 
out and shot from it all I'm just an
auto<00:04:06.800> mode<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:07.640> I'm<00:04:08.000> not<00:04:08.240> even<00:04:08.480> thinking<00:04:08.660> one

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
auto mode so I'm not even thinking one

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:36.110 
auto mode so I'm not even thinking one
bit<00:04:09.320> about<00:04:09.560> what<00:04:09.740> I'm<00:04:09.830> doing

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.610 

and<00:04:37.120> it's<00:04:37.240> almost<00:04:37.449> bad<00:04:37.690> if<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:37.990> snap<00:04:38.260> out<00:04:38.500> of

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
and it's almost bad if I snap out of

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.680 
and it's almost bad if I snap out of
that<00:04:38.680> because<00:04:39.040> then<00:04:39.910> I'm<00:04:40.030> aware<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.360> I'm

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
that because then I'm aware that I'm

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.780 
that because then I'm aware that I'm
riding<00:04:41.110> it's<00:04:41.320> like<00:04:41.440> oh<00:04:41.680> my<00:04:42.010> god<00:04:42.190> riding<00:04:42.669> right

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
riding it's like oh my god riding right

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.280 
riding it's like oh my god riding right
now<00:04:42.970> so<00:04:43.270> it's<00:04:43.479> kind<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.720> good<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.080> just

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
now so it's kind of good that I just

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.710 
now so it's kind of good that I just
stay<00:04:44.530> in<00:04:44.710> that<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:45.699> don't<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.479> stay<00:04:46.660> in

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
stay in that that don't I can stay in

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.120 
stay in that that don't I can stay in
that<00:04:46.780> zone<00:04:47.050> it's<00:04:47.320> almost<00:04:47.470> like<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.770> don't<00:04:47.830> ever

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
that zone it's almost like I don't ever

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.550 
that zone it's almost like I don't ever
make<00:04:48.430> mistakes
