00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.630
 and the sun 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.980
 more for me because I have seen Jacques 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.839
 become the day before 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.839
 best firefighters I had to meet 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.269
 he joined us because he wanted to help his peers 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.720
 who knows how many houses are still standing because every detail 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230
 how many lives have been saved 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 he gave his life for this cause 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.590
 a twist 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.590
 his presence made us better 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.730
 you can already make a promise 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.150
 when the blade will sound 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.870
 that's why as funds will all be 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 executives afterwards 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.940
 people often ask me 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.880
 how do firefighters enter a building on fire 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.800
 while everyone is trying to get out 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.190
 of the territory 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.190
 I answered that question by fleeing the life of a man 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.120
 it's your courage 30 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.680
 and today we all want to be as brave as you 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.620
 instead of taking risks 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.010
 we want to celebrate classic 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.250
 so I will ask you for balls in amazonia 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 two slaps 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.770
 the rbs 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.489
 the normal way 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.359
 valiant 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.359
 the star climb 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.549
 masses to -5% 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.879
 the scene 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.359
 facing a solid ism 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.789
 precisely the means 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.789
 visa inc 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.819
 that's his mission 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.579
 this is still to see 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.649
 25 5% 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.649
 saab is launched 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.509
 because 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.739
 not reassuring 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:42.949
 relative
