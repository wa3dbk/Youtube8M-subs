but by that time this armor and armament
was<00:00:24.200> outdated<00:00:25.599> but<00:00:26.599> nevertheless<00:00:26.899> it<00:00:27.320> was<00:00:27.439> a

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:27.469 
was outdated but nevertheless it was a

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.679 
was outdated but nevertheless it was a
very<00:00:27.710> important<00:00:28.219> tank<00:00:28.489> for<00:00:29.239> the<00:00:29.300> Germans

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
very important tank for the Germans

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.619 
very important tank for the Germans
because<00:00:29.809> it<00:00:30.469> was<00:00:30.649> really<00:00:31.369> their<00:00:31.550> first<00:00:31.730> one<00:00:33.370> so

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
because it was really their first one so

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.150 
because it was really their first one so
this<00:00:35.629> is<00:00:35.690> just<00:00:35.899> gonna<00:00:36.079> be<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.559> quite<00:00:36.890> brief

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
this is just gonna be a quite brief

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.800 
this is just gonna be a quite brief
review<00:00:37.610> because<00:00:37.760> there's<00:00:38.030> not<00:00:38.390> much<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.780> show

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
review because there's not much to show

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.460 
review because there's not much to show
so<00:00:39.530> let's<00:00:40.070> get<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:40.340> it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
so let's get to it

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.640 
so let's get to it
so<00:00:42.470> the<00:00:42.820> chassis<00:00:43.820> is<00:00:44.120> almost<00:00:44.720> identical<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.530> my

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
so the chassis is almost identical to my

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.410 
so the chassis is almost identical to my
older<00:00:46.190> version<00:00:46.550> which<00:00:46.820> I<00:00:46.970> have<00:00:47.060> a<00:00:47.090> video<00:00:47.329> on<00:00:47.390> my

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
older version which I have a video on my

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.920 
older version which I have a video on my
channel<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:47.930> think<00:00:49.329> so<00:00:50.329> that's<00:00:50.420> basically<00:00:50.840> the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
channel I think so that's basically the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.830 
channel I think so that's basically the
same<00:00:51.230> because<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:51.590> quite<00:00:51.860> like<00:00:52.010> that<00:00:52.040> but<00:00:52.840> the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
same because I quite like that but the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.880 
same because I quite like that but the
top<00:00:54.320> area<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.739> completely<00:00:55.310> redesigned<00:00:56.890> the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
top area is completely redesigned the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.680 
top area is completely redesigned the
tank<00:00:58.130> has<00:00:58.340> been<00:00:58.489> narrowed<00:00:58.760> by<00:00:59.149> one<00:00:59.360> stud<00:00:59.660> to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
tank has been narrowed by one stud to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.260 
tank has been narrowed by one stud to
the<00:00:59.899> center<00:01:00.020> is<00:01:00.440> 5<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:00.920> 7<00:01:01.160> 6<00:01:01.340> wide<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:02.120> looks

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
the center is 5 and 7 6 wide so it looks

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.560 
the center is 5 and 7 6 wide so it looks
perfect<00:01:02.809> now<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.170> width<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:08.180> also<00:01:08.479> I've

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
perfect now and width and also I've

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.109 
perfect now and width and also I've
eliminated<00:01:08.780> almost<00:01:09.619> all<00:01:10.039> studs<00:01:10.639> from<00:01:10.909> this

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
eliminated almost all studs from this

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.629 
eliminated almost all studs from this
tank<00:01:11.329> previously<00:01:12.109> as<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.499> had<00:01:12.889> loads<00:01:13.159> of<00:01:13.369> studs

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:13.639 
tank previously as I had loads of studs

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.090 
tank previously as I had loads of studs
on<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:14.990> didn't<00:01:15.289> look<00:01:15.409> very<00:01:15.590> good<00:01:15.740> one

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
on it and just didn't look very good one

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.980 
on it and just didn't look very good one
now<00:01:16.310> I'm<00:01:16.819> really<00:01:17.060> pleased<00:01:17.359> how<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:17.600> looks<00:01:17.780> it's

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.239 
there is the exhaust oven that's
relatively<00:01:26.630> plain<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:27.409> it's<00:01:28.009> kind<00:01:28.219> of

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
relatively plain but it's kind of

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:34.180 
relatively plain but it's kind of
accurate<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.819> the<00:01:28.850> real<00:01:29.060> thing

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190
