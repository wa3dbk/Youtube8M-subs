00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
had the opportunity to do the dribbling

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
had the opportunity to do the dribbling
and<00:01:38.909> catching<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.810> first<00:01:40.079> team<00:01:40.320> finished

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and catching the first team finished

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.830 
and catching the first team finished
would<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> winning<00:01:41.280> team<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
would be the winning team now if you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
would be the winning team now if you
found<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.530> too<00:01:43.770> difficult<00:01:44.310> for

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
found that this was too difficult for

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.649 
found that this was too difficult for
your<00:01:44.610> students<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.180> they<00:01:45.299> weren't<00:01:45.600> very

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
your students because they weren't very

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.910 
your students because they weren't very
confident<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.350> your<00:01:46.470> dribbling<00:01:46.649> or

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
confident with your dribbling or

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.190 
confident with your dribbling or
catching<00:01:47.220> skills<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.299> simplify<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.990> by

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
catching skills you can simplify it by

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.139 
catching skills you can simplify it by
actually<00:01:49.320> getting<00:01:49.799> rid<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> those<00:01:50.189> second

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
actually getting rid of those second

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940 
actually getting rid of those second
spot<00:01:51.360> markers<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.619> them<00:01:52.770> just

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
spot markers and actually have them just

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.160 
spot markers and actually have them just
dribbling<00:01:53.280> past<00:01:53.659> pretty<00:01:54.659> much<00:01:54.780> within<00:01:54.960> arm's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
dribbling past pretty much within arm's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.810 
dribbling past pretty much within arm's
reach<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.710> their<00:01:55.860> teammates<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
reach of their teammates and it's a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060 
reach of their teammates and it's a
smaller<00:01:57.090> throw<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.780> therefore<00:01:58.530> they'll<00:01:58.979> be

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
smaller throw and therefore they'll be

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
smaller throw and therefore they'll be
probably<00:01:59.369> facing<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> direction<00:02:00.630> closer

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
probably facing in the direction closer

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.780 
probably facing in the direction closer
towards<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> teammates<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.340> I'll<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
towards the teammates and I'll make it a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.789 
towards the teammates and I'll make it a
lot<00:02:02.939> easier<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.299> them<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> catch<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.960> well<00:02:04.110> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
lot easier for them to catch as well to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.200 
lot easier for them to catch as well to
explain<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> students<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.119> need

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
explain it to the students you just need

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.459 
explain it to the students you just need
to<00:02:06.329> tell<00:02:06.509> them<00:02:06.630> when<00:02:06.750> they're<00:02:06.869> dribbling<00:02:07.229> past

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
to tell them when they're dribbling past

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.260 
to tell them when they're dribbling past
their<00:02:07.680> teammates<00:02:08.069> they<00:02:08.310> need<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.759> catching

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
their teammates they need to be catching

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.999 
their teammates they need to be catching
and<00:02:09.390> throwing<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.690> balls<00:02:09.899> back<00:02:10.110> when<00:02:10.860> they're

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
and throwing the balls back when they're

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.619 
and throwing the balls back when they're
dribbling<00:02:11.370> down<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> other<00:02:11.760> side<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.390> they

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
dribbling down the other side all they

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.309 
dribbling down the other side all they
need<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.959> doing

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
need to be doing

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.670 
need to be doing
dribbling<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.150> that's<00:02:15.150> how<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.329> play

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
dribbling and that's how you play

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.989 
dribbling and that's how you play
dribble<00:02:16.680> catch<00:02:16.829> for<00:02:17.249> more<00:02:17.370> Mario<00:02:17.609> game<00:02:17.819> and
