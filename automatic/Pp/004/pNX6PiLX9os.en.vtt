going to shoot his arms because just one
arm<00:03:43.770> starts<00:03:44.070> glowing<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.920> you'll<00:03:47.100> learn<00:03:47.280> his

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
arm starts glowing so you'll learn his

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.890 
arm starts glowing so you'll learn his
moves<00:03:47.760> pretty<00:03:48.000> quickly<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.880> guy<00:03:51.030> has<00:03:51.240> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
moves pretty quickly so this guy has the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.650 
moves pretty quickly so this guy has the
lead<00:03:52.080> five<00:03:52.440> also<00:03:52.880> one<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> spray<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.570> he

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
lead five also one is the spray that he

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.870 
lead five also one is the spray that he
shoots<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.110> ground<00:03:55.320> one's<00:03:55.710> jumping<00:03:56.070> which

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
shoots on the ground one's jumping which

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.490 
shoots on the ground one's jumping which
i<00:03:57.030> think<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.330> best<00:03:57.630> way<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.320> whale<00:03:58.860> on<00:03:58.890> them

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
i think is the best way to whale on them

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.330 
i think is the best way to whale on them
fireballs<00:04:01.500> another<00:04:01.860> one<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:04.100> then<00:04:05.100> here<00:04:05.310> we

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
fireballs another one and then here we

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.580 
fireballs another one and then here we
go<00:04:05.520> okay<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.300> when<00:04:06.420> he<00:04:06.510> jumps<00:04:06.780> like<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.080> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
go okay so when he jumps like that the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.710 
go okay so when he jumps like that the
third<00:04:07.800> one<00:04:08.040> no<00:04:08.190> matter<00:04:08.280> what<00:04:08.610> he's<00:04:09.390> going<00:04:09.690> to

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
third one no matter what he's going to

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.560 
third one no matter what he's going to
actually<00:04:09.900> land<00:04:10.200> in<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.500> middle<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.940> when<00:04:12.390> you

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
actually land in the middle so when you
