00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.650 
suggest that Crystal Palace have a
chance<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.180> Chelsea's

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
chance but I really think Chelsea's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.139 
chance but I really think Chelsea's
players<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.110> much<00:00:43.290> too<00:00:43.590> far<00:00:44.550> superior<00:00:44.969> if

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
would be surprised Pass can get anything

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
would be surprised Pass can get anything
from<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.379> game<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> even<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.730> crystal

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
into their last two games but the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020 
into their last two games but the
Chelsea<00:00:58.260> team<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.590> fasting<00:00:59.250> period<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> person

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
Chelsea team is fasting period of person

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
Chelsea team is fasting period of person
I'm<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.359> big<00:01:00.539> fan<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> crystal<00:01:01.260> Christ

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
I'm not a big fan of the crystal Christ

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.049 
I'm not a big fan of the crystal Christ
attack<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.309> very<00:01:02.550> few<00:01:02.609> goals<00:01:02.940> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
attack that's for very few goals this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.520 
attack that's for very few goals this
season<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> chance<00:01:04.379> with

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
season so I think it's a chance with

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.230 
season so I think it's a chance with
Chelsea<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> keep<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> clean<00:01:05.790> sheet<00:01:05.820> or
