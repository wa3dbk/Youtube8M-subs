00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
for one of them being that glass walls

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.740 
for one of them being that glass walls
now<00:01:58.840> have<00:01:59.200> only<00:01:59.500> one<00:01:59.860> side<00:02:00.130> as<00:02:00.460> they<00:02:01.000> do<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.270> pc

glass block and pocket edition there is
a<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.670> weird<00:02:10.030> texture<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.899> goes<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.290> with

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
a really weird texture that goes on with

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.900 
a really weird texture that goes on with
it<00:02:11.680> where<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:11.980> can<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.220> see<00:02:12.459> through<00:02:12.760> and

there's like all six sides visible and
it<00:02:15.160> really<00:02:15.430> lags<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.269> game<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.690> looks<00:02:16.750> ugly

these<00:02:20.320> room<00:02:20.590> or<00:02:20.739> ten<00:02:20.920> updates<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.550> now<00:02:21.730> glass

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
these room or ten updates so now glass

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.410

walls<00:02:22.900> look<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.380> same<00:02:23.590> again<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:25.180> only

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
walls look the same again and not only

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.080 
walls look the same again and not only
that<00:02:25.570> but<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.709> game<00:02:26.920> now<00:02:27.070> limits<00:02:27.400> cpu<00:02:27.880> usage

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
that but the game now limits cpu usage

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.640 
that but the game now limits cpu usage
when<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.600> app<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.080> running<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
be like a huge memory sucker it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.199 
be like a huge memory sucker it
basically<00:02:35.590> just<00:02:36.040> sucks<00:02:36.580> up<00:02:36.730> all<00:02:36.910> available

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209

basically just sucks up all available
memory<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.810> game<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:39.360> unfortunately<00:02:40.360> it

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
causes some devices to lag and it just

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.780 
causes some devices to lag and it just
doesn't<00:02:44.290> function<00:02:44.470> properly<00:02:44.680> anymore<00:02:45.370> so

changes<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.850> builds<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.329> you<00:03:10.450> would<00:03:10.540> make<00:03:10.570> so

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
changes to builds that you would make so

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.970 
changes to builds that you would make so
for<00:03:11.019> example<00:03:11.140> you're<00:03:11.470> building<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.829> nice

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
for example you're building a nice

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.770 
for example you're building a nice
statue<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.180> close<00:03:13.420> out<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.750> game

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
statue and you close out the game

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.180 
statue and you close out the game
because<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.440> go<00:03:14.530> do<00:03:14.739> something<00:03:15.100> you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
because you have to go do something you

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.520 
because you have to go do something you
come<00:03:15.340> back<00:03:15.579> later<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.180> what<00:03:17.079> you<00:03:17.170> just<00:03:17.320> built

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
come back later and what you just built

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.050 
come back later and what you just built
is<00:03:17.650> gone<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.400> basically<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> game<00:03:18.940> just

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
is gone it's basically the game just

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.270 
is gone it's basically the game just
doesn't<00:03:19.390> say<00:03:19.570> what<00:03:19.720> you're<00:03:19.870> doing<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:21.010> I'm

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280

animal<00:04:06.050> in<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.319> game<00:04:06.530> not<00:04:07.250> only<00:04:07.400> that<00:04:07.489> but

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
animal in the game not only that but

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.880 
animal in the game not only that but
better<00:04:08.120> fog<00:04:08.450> on<00:04:08.750> clouds<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.530> starting

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
better fog on clouds and starting

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.390 
better fog on clouds and starting
farther<00:04:10.190> away<00:04:10.340> following<00:04:10.819> say<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.660> sky<00:04:12.049> color

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
farther away following say the sky color

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.610 
farther away following say the sky color
was<00:04:13.400> also<00:04:13.790> added<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.390> fog<00:04:14.780> now<00:04:15.110> looks<00:04:15.380> more

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
was also added so fog now looks more

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.849 
was also added so fog now looks more
natural<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.280> more<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.720> correct<00:04:18.109> texture<00:04:18.590> /

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.310 
developers are hoping that build six
would<00:04:24.320> be<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.560> final<00:04:24.950> build<00:04:25.190> but<00:04:25.880> build<00:04:26.870> seven

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
would be the final build but build seven

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.930 
would be the final build but build seven
came<00:04:27.560> around<00:04:27.800> because<00:04:28.430> there<00:04:28.610> were<00:04:28.700> other

came around because there were other
bugs<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.660> still<00:04:30.380> had<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.710> be<00:04:30.830> fixed<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.430> they

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
bugs that still had to be fixed and they

bugs that still had to be fixed and they
fixed<00:04:32.389> an<00:04:32.479> issue<00:04:32.600> with<00:04:33.020> server<00:04:33.500> recovery<00:04:34.190> on

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
fixed an issue with server recovery on

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.430 
fixed an issue with server recovery on
Android<00:04:35.270> there<00:04:35.419> was<00:04:35.510> an<00:04:35.630> audio<00:04:35.930> issue<00:04:36.200> that

was fixed players can also sleep in

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.070 
was fixed players can also sleep in
servers<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:41.090> few<00:04:41.270> tweaks<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.690> were<00:04:41.870> made

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
servers and a few tweaks that were made

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.080 
servers and a few tweaks that were made
include<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:43.039> clouds<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.580> trainer<00:04:43.910> now

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
include the clouds and trainer now

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.150 
include the clouds and trainer now
tinted<00:04:44.539> red<00:04:44.720> during<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.169> sunset<00:04:45.410> so<00:04:45.890> now

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
tinted red during the sunset so now

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.610 
tinted red during the sunset so now
everything<00:04:46.640> has<00:04:46.789> it<00:04:47.000> like<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.360> red<00:04:47.750> shadow

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
everything has it like that red shadow

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.320 
everything has it like that red shadow
cast<00:04:49.130> onto<00:04:49.400> it<00:04:49.700> you<00:04:49.729> know<00:04:49.940> when<00:04:50.180> you're

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
cast onto it you know when you're

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.540 
cast onto it you know when you're
viewing<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.690> real<00:04:50.870> sunset<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.979> get<00:04:52.130> that<00:04:52.310> red

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
viewing the real sunset you get that red

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.360 
viewing the real sunset you get that red
glow<00:04:52.910> on<00:04:52.940> everything<00:04:53.710> they<00:04:54.710> made<00:04:54.950> text

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
glow on everything they made text

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.190 
glow on everything they made text
rendering<00:04:55.580> much<00:04:55.970> faster<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:56.510> they<00:04:56.780> added

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
rendering much faster and they added

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.190 
rendering much faster and they added
back<00:04:57.410> water<00:04:57.800> sounds<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:59.120> like<00:04:59.539> you<00:04:59.690> fall<00:05:00.050> into

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
back water sounds so like you fall into

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.529 
back water sounds so like you fall into
the<00:05:00.410> water<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.860> splash<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:02.090> sound<00:05:02.390> was

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
the water you splash that sound was

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.140 
the water you splash that sound was
removed<00:05:02.870> for<00:05:03.080> some<00:05:03.260> reason<00:05:03.590> but<00:05:04.039> then<00:05:04.220> in<00:05:04.610> beta

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
removed for some reason but then in beta

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.960 
removed for some reason but then in beta
build<00:05:05.390> 7<00:05:05.900> that<00:05:06.500> water<00:05:06.830> sound<00:05:07.190> was<00:05:07.400> added<00:05:07.789> back

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
build 7 that water sound was added back

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.650 
build 7 that water sound was added back
so<00:05:08.960> Tom<00:05:09.320> had<00:05:09.530> said<00:05:09.800> that<00:05:10.090> build<00:05:11.090> 7<00:05:11.510> was

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
so Tom had said that build 7 was

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.520 
so Tom had said that build 7 was
uploaded<00:05:12.229> to<00:05:12.610> Android<00:05:13.610> as<00:05:13.820> well<00:05:13.850> as<00:05:14.390> Apple<00:05:15.229> so

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
uploaded to Android as well as Apple so

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.350 
uploaded to Android as well as Apple so
build<00:05:15.800> 7<00:05:16.100> was<00:05:16.280> hopefully<00:05:16.700> going<00:05:16.729> to<00:05:17.060> be<00:05:17.180> the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
build 7 was hopefully going to be the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.770 
build 7 was hopefully going to be the
last<00:05:17.690> beta<00:05:18.080> build<00:05:18.440> but<00:05:19.160> unfortunately<00:05:20.120> the

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
last beta build but unfortunately the

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.830 
last beta build but unfortunately the
optimization<00:05:21.710> of<00:05:21.890> text<00:05:22.460> characters<00:05:23.150> that

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
optimization of text characters that

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.620 
optimization of text characters that
they<00:05:24.020> had<00:05:24.200> done<00:05:24.440> in<00:05:24.680> build<00:05:24.919> 7<00:05:25.630> apparently

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
they had done in build 7 apparently

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.650 
they had done in build 7 apparently
broke<00:05:27.080> all<00:05:27.350> of<00:05:27.380> text<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:28.520> acquisitions<00:05:29.419> so

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
broke all of text and acquisitions so

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.129 
broke all of text and acquisitions so
they<00:05:29.810> submitted<00:05:30.440> a<00:05:30.620> build<00:05:30.919> 8<00:05:31.220> and<00:05:31.610> build<00:05:32.600> 8<00:05:32.840> is

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
they submitted a build 8 and build 8 is

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.400 
they submitted a build 8 and build 8 is
supposed<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:33.770> be<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.669> final<00:05:35.389> beta<00:05:35.600> build<00:05:35.990> so

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
supposed to be the final beta build so

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.300 
supposed to be the final beta build so
hopefully<00:05:37.070> build<00:05:37.370> 80<00:05:38.350> will<00:05:39.350> be<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.620> last<00:05:39.830> bug

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
hopefully build 80 will be the last bug

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.339 
hopefully build 80 will be the last bug
fixing<00:05:40.849> thing<00:05:41.030> that<00:05:41.180> they<00:05:41.300> have<00:05:41.419> to<00:05:41.599> do<00:05:41.780> but

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
fixing thing that they have to do but

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.170 
fixing thing that they have to do but
they<00:05:42.470> did<00:05:42.650> say<00:05:42.680> that<00:05:43.070> build<00:05:43.250> 7<00:05:43.640> was<00:05:43.789> submitted

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
they did say that build 7 was submitted

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.890 
they did say that build 7 was submitted
to<00:05:44.300> apple

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
to apple

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.840 
to apple
suming<00:05:45.290> they<00:05:45.380> submit<00:05:45.770> build<00:05:46.009> eight<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.460> Apple

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
suming they submit build eight to Apple

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.439 
suming they submit build eight to Apple
as<00:05:47.000> well<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:47.930> hopefully<00:05:48.169> if<00:05:48.650> we<00:05:48.800> are<00:05:48.919> lucky

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
as well so hopefully if we are lucky

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.249 
as well so hopefully if we are lucky
build<00:05:50.449> eight<00:05:50.750> will<00:05:51.199> be<00:05:51.410> the<00:05:51.919> final<00:05:52.370> update

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
build eight will be the final update

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.920 
build eight will be the final update
beta<00:05:54.259> test<00:05:54.710> thing<00:05:55.100> for<00:05:55.880> a<00:05:55.910> zero<00:05:56.210> point<00:05:56.449> 10<00:05:56.720> we

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
beta test thing for a zero point 10 we

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.189 
beta test thing for a zero point 10 we
should<00:05:57.199> be<00:05:57.380> seeing<00:05:58.030> pocket<00:05:59.030> edition<00:05:59.120> on<00:05:59.660> both

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
should be seeing pocket edition on both

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.460 
should be seeing pocket edition on both
the<00:06:00.620> android<00:06:01.160> and<00:06:01.460> apple<00:06:02.150> app<00:06:02.300> stores<00:06:02.780> within

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
the android and apple app stores within

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.640 
the android and apple app stores within
one<00:06:04.070> to<00:06:04.370> two<00:06:04.699> weeks<00:06:04.990> assuming<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.350> this<00:06:06.440> is

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
one to two weeks assuming that this is

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.540 
one to two weeks assuming that this is
the<00:06:06.770> last<00:06:06.800> build<00:06:07.370> so<00:06:08.150> if<00:06:08.539> it<00:06:08.750> is<00:06:08.780> on<00:06:09.340> zero<00:06:10.340> point

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
the last build so if it is on zero point

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.730 
the last build so if it is on zero point
10<00:06:10.729> will<00:06:10.910> be<00:06:10.940> out<00:06:11.150> in<00:06:11.180> about<00:06:11.449> a<00:06:11.630> week<00:06:12.020> or<00:06:12.289> two

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
10 will be out in about a week or two

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.120 
10 will be out in about a week or two
hopefully<00:06:13.610> we<00:06:13.820> do<00:06:14.060> see<00:06:14.389> it<00:06:14.539> out<00:06:14.770> if<00:06:15.770> there<00:06:16.100> are

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
hopefully we do see it out if there are
