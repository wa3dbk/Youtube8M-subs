00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.030 
you'd have to learn every single dance
again<00:03:01.720> way<00:03:01.930> too<00:03:02.200> much<00:03:02.410> you're<00:03:02.620> probably<00:03:02.830> doing

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
again way too much you're probably doing

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.949 
again way too much you're probably doing
five<00:03:03.370> weeks<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.790> don't<00:03:03.940> find<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.450> imagine<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
five weeks I don't find you imagine the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.170 
five weeks I don't find you imagine the
neither<00:03:05.650> are<00:03:05.920> caused<00:03:06.100> too<00:03:06.310> many<00:03:06.400> problems<00:03:06.550> I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
neither are caused too many problems I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.520 
neither are caused too many problems I
think<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.540> will<00:03:07.600> be<00:03:07.660> too<00:03:07.870> difficult<00:03:08.050> tell<00:03:08.440> me

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
think that will be too difficult tell me

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.900 
think that will be too difficult tell me
it's<00:03:08.620> gonna<00:03:08.709> be<00:03:08.830> tough<00:03:08.980> enough<00:03:09.190> as<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.519> so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
it's gonna be tough enough as it is so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.400 
it's gonna be tough enough as it is so
