in<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.799> video<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.490> will<00:00:06.060> introduce<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
in this video I will introduce how to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.480 
in this video I will introduce how to
study<00:00:08.240> shadows<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.630> light<00:00:10.410> levels<00:00:10.860> within

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
study shadows and light levels within

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.950 
study shadows and light levels within
Revit<00:00:12.210> by<00:00:13.049> using<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:14.219> shadow<00:00:14.960> functioned

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
Revit by using the shadow functioned

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.250 
Revit by using the shadow functioned
within<00:00:16.260> Revit<00:00:16.940> using<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.180> render<00:00:19.080> function

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
within Revit using the render function

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.060 
within Revit using the render function
to<00:00:19.949> get<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> realistic<00:00:20.789> view<00:00:21.270> inside<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.830> same

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
to get a realistic view inside the same

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.290 
to get a realistic view inside the same
space<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.900> last<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.369> illuminance<00:00:26.369> simulation

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
space and last a illuminance simulation

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.950 
space and last a illuminance simulation
with<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> different<00:00:28.650> light<00:00:29.429> levels<00:00:29.880> again<00:00:30.660> in

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
with the different light levels again in

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.370 
with the different light levels again in
the<00:00:31.650> same<00:00:31.890> perspective<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> same<00:00:33.780> time<00:00:34.110> as

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the same perspective at the same time as

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.330 
the same perspective at the same time as
the<00:00:34.920> realistic<00:00:35.520> view<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> case<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:38.129> in

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the realistic view in this case and in

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.970 
the realistic view in this case and in
more<00:00:38.760> detail<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.600> first<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
more detail the first one is a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.900 
more detail the first one is a
perspective<00:00:41.520> view<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.719> applied<00:00:43.910> specific

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
perspective view with applied specific

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.799 
perspective view with applied specific
time<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> day<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.860> activate<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.670> one

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
time of day so if I activate this one

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.500 
time of day so if I activate this one
then<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> examine<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.270> shadow

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
then I go in and examine the shadow

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.319 
then I go in and examine the shadow
patterns<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.030> turn<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.180> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
study then I can play this date with the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.899 
study then I can play this date with the
different<00:01:14.880> time<00:01:15.420> steps<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.560> each<00:01:16.710> hour<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
different time steps for each hour to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.010 
different time steps for each hour to
see<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.140> shadows<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.780> direct<00:01:21.780> light

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
see how is the shadows and direct light

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.249 
see how is the shadows and direct light
coming<00:01:22.650> into<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> space<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.110> way

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
coming into the space so this is one way

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.010 
coming into the space so this is one way
of<00:01:25.290> doing<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.970> deactivate<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> view<00:01:27.360> again<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
of doing it deactivate the view again to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
of doing it deactivate the view again to
go<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> sheet<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
go back to the sheet this one is a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.609 
go back to the sheet this one is a
rendered<00:01:30.780> image<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.490> specified<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
rendered image we have specified a

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.640 
rendered image we have specified a
specific<00:01:34.619> date<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.970> time<00:01:36.110> using<00:01:37.110> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
specific date and a time using this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.300 
specific date and a time using this
perspective<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:39.450> render<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.990> image<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
perspective to render this image with a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.660 
perspective to render this image with a
few<00:01:42.079> characteristic<00:01:43.079> materials<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:44.610> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
few characteristic materials to get a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.319 
few characteristic materials to get a
better<00:01:45.000> atmosphere<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.880> feeling<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.090> this

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
better atmosphere and feeling of this

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.230 
better atmosphere and feeling of this
space<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:49.590> relation<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> materials<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
space in relation to the materials and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.550 
space in relation to the materials and
the<00:01:51.600> light<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.710> these<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.280> ones<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:54.560> rented

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the light so these two ones is rented

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
the light so these two ones is rented
and<00:01:55.969> simulated<00:01:56.969> through<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> cloud<00:01:58.020> function

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and simulated through the cloud function

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.609 
and simulated through the cloud function
that<00:01:59.159> you'll<00:01:59.369> find<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> view<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.619> Brenda

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that you'll find on the view and Brenda

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.609 
that you'll find on the view and Brenda
in<00:02:01.799> cloud<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.369> will<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.149> multi-cell<00:02:03.810> show<00:02:04.140> some

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
in cloud I will in multi-cell show some

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.460 
in cloud I will in multi-cell show some
of<00:02:04.740> these<00:02:05.189> steps

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
of these steps

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.760 
of these steps
just<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.920> show<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.940> introduce<00:02:08.390> them<00:02:08.770> here

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
just to show it to introduce them here

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.370 
just to show it to introduce them here
so<00:02:10.430> when<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:10.700> use<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.180> render<00:02:11.390> in<00:02:12.050> cloud

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
so when you use the render in cloud

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.230 
so when you use the render in cloud
function<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.160> actually<00:02:13.520> have<00:02:13.670> different

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
function you actually have different

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.750 
function you actually have different
possibilities<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.290> still<00:02:15.620> image<00:02:15.920> that's

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
possibilities like still image that's

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.110 
possibilities like still image that's
the<00:02:17.030> middle<00:02:17.330> one<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:18.620> interactive

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the middle one and the interactive

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.550 
the middle one and the interactive
panorama<00:02:20.120> I'll<00:02:20.420> show<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:21.020> little<00:02:21.050> bit<00:02:21.350> later

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
panorama I'll show a little bit later

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.040 
panorama I'll show a little bit later
and<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.340> illuminance<00:02:22.910> that's<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.630> last<00:02:23.810> one

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
and the illuminance that's the last one

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.950 
and the illuminance that's the last one
with<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.500> light<00:02:24.710> levels<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
with the light levels so this is the the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.260 
with the light levels so this is the the
options<00:02:27.640> within<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:29.380> 360<00:02:30.380> cloud<00:02:31.270> rendering

options within the 360 cloud rendering

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.140 
options within the 360 cloud rendering
function<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.290> can<00:02:33.560> examine<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.700> see<00:02:34.730> your

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
function you can examine and see your

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.580 
function you can examine and see your
simulation<00:02:36.110> or<00:02:36.490> renderings<00:02:37.490> in<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.660> window

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
simulation or renderings in this window

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.790 
simulation or renderings in this window
here<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.390> let's<00:02:41.390> take<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.810> first<00:02:41.959> one<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.740> is

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
here so let's take the first one this is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.920 
here so let's take the first one this is
the<00:02:43.130> interactive<00:02:43.730> view<00:02:44.270> where<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:44.810> actually

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
the interactive view where we actually

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.250 
the interactive view where we actually
can<00:02:45.550> examine<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.820> view<00:02:47.120> by<00:02:48.640> looking<00:02:49.640> around

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
can examine the view by looking around

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.900 
can examine the view by looking around
from<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.530> position<00:02:51.740> we<00:02:52.490> have<00:02:52.610> specified

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
from this position we have specified

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.960 
from this position we have specified
within<00:02:53.570> Revit<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.920> let's<00:02:55.040> get<00:02:55.220> possible<00:02:55.520> to

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
within Revit so let's get possible to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.390 
within Revit so let's get possible to
see<00:02:56.780> how<00:02:57.020> does<00:02:57.230> this<00:02:57.440> space<00:02:57.770> look<00:02:58.130> in

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
see how does this space look in

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.080 
see how does this space look in
different<00:02:59.390> notation<00:02:59.959> for<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:01.090> specific

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
different notation for this specific

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.190 
different notation for this specific
place<00:03:02.300> or<00:03:03.190> as<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.250> showed<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.570> middle<00:03:05.870> image

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
place or as I showed in the middle image

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.780 
place or as I showed in the middle image
this<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.340> still<00:03:08.030> image<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.570> this<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.410> the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
this is the still image and this is the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.930 
this is the still image and this is the
illuminance<00:03:11.230> simulated<00:03:12.230> laughs<00:03:12.950> they<00:03:13.700> say

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
illuminance simulated laughs they say

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.020 
illuminance simulated laughs they say
another<00:03:14.660> possibility<00:03:15.140> here<00:03:15.519> where<00:03:16.519> it's

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
another possibility here where it's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.530 
another possibility here where it's
about<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.870> solar<00:03:18.200> study<00:03:18.530> for<00:03:18.860> some<00:03:19.850> specific

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
about a solar study for some specific

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.160 
about a solar study for some specific
time<00:03:21.350> steps<00:03:21.680> from<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.910> early<00:03:23.330> morning<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.989> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
time steps from the early morning to the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.130 
time steps from the early morning to the
late<00:03:24.350> afternoon<00:03:25.070> that<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.209> specified<00:03:26.900> within

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
late afternoon that you specified within

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.580 
late afternoon that you specified within
Revit<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.800> this<00:03:28.610> ends<00:03:29.180> up<00:03:29.330> in<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.720> small<00:03:30.380> video

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
Revit and this ends up in a small video

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.020 
Revit and this ends up in a small video
that<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:31.459> generate<00:03:32.450> from<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:33.170> cloud<00:03:34.030> in

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
that you can generate from the cloud in

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.199 
that you can generate from the cloud in
other<00:03:35.239> videos<00:03:35.660> I<00:03:35.959> will<00:03:36.370> explain<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.760> show<00:03:37.790> how

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
other videos I will explain and show how

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.690 
other videos I will explain and show how
to<00:03:38.500> set<00:03:39.500> up<00:03:39.610> these<00:03:40.610> kind<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.060> studies
