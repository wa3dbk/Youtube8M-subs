00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the end it helped a lot so between m3

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.990 
the end it helped a lot so between m3
and<00:01:31.210> m4<00:01:32.210> DTM<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:34.040> far<00:01:34.310> you're<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.820> get

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
and m4 DTM so far you're that you get

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.460 
and m4 DTM so far you're that you get
with<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.600> 40<00:01:36.320> p.m.<00:01:37.960> what's<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.080> difference

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
with the 40 p.m. what's the difference

between the car seats a big prison well

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.130 
between the car seats a big prison well
we<00:01:43.460> I<00:01:43.700> would<00:01:43.970> say<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:44.240> definitely<00:01:44.690> made<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:44.930> step

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
we I would say we definitely made a step

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.550 
we I would say we definitely made a step
forward<00:01:45.380> over<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.190> winter<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.960> course<00:01:48.380> you

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
forward over the winter of course you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
forward over the winter of course you
are<00:01:48.649> not<00:01:48.800> taking<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.520> m3<00:01:50.330> now<00:01:50.509> again<00:01:50.840> same<00:01:51.110> for

are not taking the m3 now again same for
and<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.300> try<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.869> again<00:01:54.020> what<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.500> the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
and and and try it again what is the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.919 
and and and try it again what is the
difference<00:01:55.100> at<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.340> end<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> car<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.090> mean

difference at the end of the car I mean
if<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.350> stop<00:01:57.770> was<00:01:58.039> em's<00:01:58.250> really<00:01:58.610> try<00:01:58.819> to

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
if we stop was em's really try to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.510 
if we stop was em's really try to
develop<00:01:59.200> same<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.500> over<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.800> winter<00:02:01.220> try<00:02:01.459> to

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
develop same for over the winter try to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.160 
develop same for over the winter try to
optimize<00:02:01.850> every<00:02:02.720> every<00:02:03.080> test<00:02:03.350> every<00:02:05.170> every

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
optimize every every test every every

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.309 
optimize every every test every every
improvement<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.069> car<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:08.390> get<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.990> pedal

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
improvement of the car to get it pedal

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.440 
improvement of the car to get it pedal
on<00:02:09.410> track<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.399> quite<00:02:10.610> difficult<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:11.120> say

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
on track so it's quite difficult to say

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.230 
on track so it's quite difficult to say
what<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.840> difference<00:02:12.470> now<00:02:12.650> between<00:02:12.680> m3<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.550> m4

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
what is difference now between m3 and m4

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.059 
what is difference now between m3 and m4
but<00:02:14.450> definitely<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.470> made<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> step<00:02:15.860> forward

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
but definitely we made a step forward

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.790 
but definitely we made a step forward
and<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.849> good<00:02:16.970> direction<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.530> far<00:02:18.770> I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
and in a good direction and so far I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.440 
and in a good direction and so far I
feel<00:02:19.099> very<00:02:19.190> comfortable<00:02:19.430> as<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.030> car<00:02:20.270> very

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
feel very comfortable as a car very

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.820 
feel very comfortable as a car very
confident<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.550> yeah<00:02:22.550> or<00:02:23.360> with<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
confident and yeah or with the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.140 
confident and yeah or with the
continuous<00:02:24.830> like<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.160> yeah

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
continuous like this yeah

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.660 
continuous like this yeah
first<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.049> race<00:02:28.439> they<00:02:29.280> are<00:02:30.090> important<00:02:31.670> I

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
first the race they are important I

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.509 
first the race they are important I
think<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.569> pretty<00:02:33.720> pretty<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.260> good<00:02:34.519> start

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
think it's pretty pretty a good start

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.850 
think it's pretty pretty a good start
into<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.879> race<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.180> course<00:02:36.629> first<00:02:37.439> of<00:02:37.560> all<00:02:37.739> we

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
into the race of course first of all we

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.380 
into the race of course first of all we
need<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.040> wait<00:02:38.400> what<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.849> weather<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.180> doing

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
need to wait what the weather is doing

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.750 
need to wait what the weather is doing
then<00:02:40.019> as<00:02:40.140> well<00:02:40.379> start<00:02:40.799> first<00:02:41.220> lab<00:02:41.489> first

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
then as well start first lab first

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.500 
then as well start first lab first
corner<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.329> go<00:02:42.720> through<00:02:43.110> clear<00:02:44.299> but<00:02:45.299> but

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
corner to go through clear but but

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.000 
corner to go through clear but but
overall<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:46.079> course<00:02:46.319> it's<00:02:46.470> it's<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.829> good

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
overall of course it's it's a good

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.720 
overall of course it's it's a good
opportunity<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.970> start<00:02:48.180> from<00:02:48.329> pole<00:02:48.480> position

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
opportunity to start from pole position

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.479 
opportunity to start from pole position
in<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.909> future<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.780> think<00:02:52.079> of<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:52.920> career<00:02:53.340> in

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
in the future you think of a career in

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.140 
in the future you think of a career in
Formula<00:02:53.909> One<00:02:54.120> or<00:02:54.329> Andres<00:02:54.930> racing<00:02:55.409> board<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
Formula One or Andres racing board the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.379 
Formula One or Andres racing board the
TTM<00:02:57.659> a<00:02:59.060> long<00:03:00.060> way<00:03:00.389> from<00:03:01.379> here<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.159> would<00:03:03.120> say

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
TTM a long way from here on I would say

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.330 
TTM a long way from here on I would say
yeah<00:03:03.599> it's<00:03:03.720> possible<00:03:03.920> first<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.040> all<00:03:05.159> I<00:03:05.220> think

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
yeah it's possible first of all I think

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.399 
yeah it's possible first of all I think
we<00:03:05.519> need<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.790> say<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> DTM<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.750> next<00:03:07.319> to

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
we need to say it's a DTM is next to

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.009 
we need to say it's a DTM is next to
former<00:03:07.620> loved<00:03:07.859> ones<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:09.299> highest<00:03:09.480> class

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
former loved ones as the highest class

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.869 
former loved ones as the highest class
in<00:03:10.230> motor<00:03:10.680> sport<00:03:11.010> especially<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.579> touring

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
in motor sport especially in touring

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.949 
in motor sport especially in touring
cars<00:03:12.120> worldwide<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.950> definitely<00:03:14.129> we<00:03:15.090> are<00:03:15.299> in<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
cars worldwide so definitely we are in a

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.190 
cars worldwide so definitely we are in a
good<00:03:16.579> good<00:03:17.579> way<00:03:18.799> for<00:03:20.540> me<00:03:21.540> for<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> moment

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
good good way for me for the moment

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.349 
good good way for me for the moment
there<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.769> no<00:03:23.069> no<00:03:23.400> thinking<00:03:23.790> about<00:03:24.030> Formula

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
there is no no thinking about Formula

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.330 
there is no no thinking about Formula
