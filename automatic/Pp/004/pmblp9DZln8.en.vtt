00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.970 
how to do a delicious pasta this is I
think<00:00:06.600> it's<00:00:06.720> great<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:07.140> kids<00:00:07.350> because<00:00:07.649> we

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
think it's great for kids because we

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.070 
think it's great for kids because we
won't<00:00:08.189> be<00:00:08.340> showing<00:00:09.210> any<00:00:09.330> vegetables<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.050> your

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
won't be showing any vegetables on your

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.470 
won't be showing any vegetables on your
plate<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.559> would<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.740> like<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.920> hidden

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
plate so it would be like a hidden

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.990 
plate so it would be like a hidden
vegetable<00:00:12.480> pasta<00:00:12.769> dinner<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:14.190> let's<00:00:14.490> get<00:00:14.759> onto

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
vegetable pasta dinner so let's get onto

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.400 
vegetable pasta dinner so let's get onto
the<00:00:15.299> ingredients<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.929> we'll<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.170> using

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the ingredients that we'll be using

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.370 
the ingredients that we'll be using
today<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.910> already<00:00:18.420> made<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> past<00:00:19.020> because

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
today so I already made the past because

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.080 
today so I already made the past because
this<00:00:19.529> part<00:00:19.740> takes<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.100> longest<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.939> is

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
this part takes the longest so this is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.349 
this part takes the longest so this is
not<00:00:21.210> exactly<00:00:21.810> completely<00:00:22.939> hardened<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
not exactly completely hardened is that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
not exactly completely hardened is that
thing<00:00:24.510> right<00:00:24.720> working<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.769> guess

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
thing right working for it I guess

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
thing right working for it I guess
hardened<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:27.029> we're<00:00:27.180> gonna<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
hardened because we're gonna have to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.050 
hardened because we're gonna have to
stir-fry<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.500> little<00:00:28.800> bit<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.550> some<00:00:29.820> light
