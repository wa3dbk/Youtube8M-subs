episode we're going to talk about saving
seeds<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.990> found<00:00:13.200> some<00:00:13.500> varieties<00:00:14.009> of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
seeds now we found some varieties of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.760 
seeds now we found some varieties of
crops<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.240> really<00:00:15.599> really<00:00:15.900> enjoy<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.680> we

crops that we really really enjoy and we
wanted<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.160> save<00:00:17.460> some<00:00:17.760> seeds<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.420> that's<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
wanted to save some seeds and that's a

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.330 
wanted to save some seeds and that's a
great<00:00:19.260> way<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.470> make<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.859> initial

great way to make that initial
investment<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.300> seeds<00:00:21.539> continue<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> pay

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
investment in the seeds continue to pay

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
confident that they are dry you can

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
confident that they are dry you can
store<00:00:48.809> them<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.649> paper<00:00:49.800> bag<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> rest

cover the top of it with a coffee filter

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
cover the top of it with a coffee filter
this<00:01:35.130> will<00:01:35.369> allow<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.759> air<00:01:36.060> movement<00:01:36.509> but

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
this will allow for air movement but

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.420 
this will allow for air movement but
limiting<00:01:37.170> anything<00:01:37.560> else<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:38.009> getting<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
limiting anything else from getting in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.480 
limiting anything else from getting in
and<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:39.110> refresh<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.350> water<00:01:40.530> every<00:01:41.189> day<00:01:41.220> or

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and out refresh the water every day or

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.469 
and out refresh the water every day or
so<00:01:42.829> once<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.159> see<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.640> jelly<00:01:44.909> layer<00:01:45.240> is

so once you can see the jelly layer is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.679 
so once you can see the jelly layer is
gone<00:01:45.750> you're<00:01:46.350> done<00:01:46.560> fermenting<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:48.509> can

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
gone you're done fermenting you can

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
gone you're done fermenting you can
collect<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> seeds<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> spread<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.130> on

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.550 
the coffee filter to air dry once dry
you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.060> store<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.659> seeds<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.170> rest<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you can store the seeds with the rest of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.969 
you can store the seeds with the rest of
your<00:01:55.710> collection<00:01:57.350> tomato<00:01:58.350> seeds<00:01:58.740> are
