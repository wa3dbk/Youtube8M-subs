00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.700 
we'll play first it sounds very good if
we<00:00:04.500> draw<00:00:04.650> forest<00:00:05.690> it's<00:00:06.690> also<00:00:06.810> incredibly<00:00:07.049> bad

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.980 

really<00:00:12.600> upsetting<00:00:12.960> green<00:00:13.230> sources

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
this just doesn't do anything if we

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.380 
this just doesn't do anything if we
don't<00:00:40.520> draw<00:00:40.850> green<00:00:42.280> we<00:00:43.280> draw<00:00:43.430> an<00:00:43.489> oculus<00:00:43.970> which

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.270 

well

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.300 

other<00:00:57.000> horrors

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
other horrors

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.560 
other horrors
it<00:00:59.880> sounds<00:01:00.300> way<00:01:00.570> better<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.420> all

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it sounds way better that is not at all

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
it sounds way better that is not at all
obvious<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:04.380> that's<00:01:04.590> the<00:01:04.800> right<00:01:04.950> choice<00:01:05.580> or

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
obvious if that's the right choice or

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.920 
obvious if that's the right choice or
not<00:01:06.680> looks<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.800> it<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.660> wish<00:01:09.660> we<00:01:09.810> had

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
not looks like it was here wish we had

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750 
not looks like it was here wish we had
those<00:01:10.020> guilt<00:01:10.290> gates<00:01:10.470> actually<00:01:10.920> maybe<00:01:11.640> I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
those guilt gates actually maybe I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
those guilt gates actually maybe I
should<00:01:11.910> be<00:01:12.000> taking<00:01:12.270> those<00:01:12.360> higher<00:01:15.050> I<00:01:16.050> mean<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
should be taking those higher I mean I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.110 
should be taking those higher I mean I
should<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.220> shamble<00:01:17.520> shark<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.820> our<00:01:17.940> turn

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
should just shamble shark on our turn

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.190 
should just shamble shark on our turn
right<00:01:18.360> there's<00:01:18.690> no<00:01:18.900> real<00:01:19.080> reason<00:01:19.320> not<00:01:19.620> to<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
right there's no real reason not to I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.300 
right there's no real reason not to I
guess<00:01:22.200> we'll<00:01:22.350> wait<00:01:24.590> it's<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> exact<00:01:26.010> same<00:01:26.070> as

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
guess we'll wait it's the exact same as

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.410 
guess we'll wait it's the exact same as
if<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.490> played<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.760> under<00:01:26.940> turn<00:01:27.090> though<00:01:27.270> it's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
if we played it under turn though it's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.910 
if we played it under turn though it's
not<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.660> we<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:28.080> him<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.500> anything<00:01:28.680> because

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
not like we got him or anything because

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:37.500 
not like we got him or anything because
we<00:01:29.130> waited

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.330 

we<00:01:38.080> were<00:01:38.200> definitely<00:01:38.350> correct<00:01:38.680> about<00:01:39.010> him

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
we were definitely correct about him

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:51.940 
we were definitely correct about him
going<00:01:39.700> big

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.030 

that's<00:01:52.909> pretty<00:01:53.689> large

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.120 

alright<00:01:56.610> let's<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.000> play<00:01:57.180> that

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.859 

check<00:02:03.729> with<00:02:03.880> both<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.329> want<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.600> kill<00:02:04.750> them

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
check with both we want to kill them

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:05.969 
check with both we want to kill them
before<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.229> can<00:02:05.409> actually<00:02:05.530> get<00:02:05.740> off<00:02:05.860> the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
before you can actually get off the

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.969 
before you can actually get off the
ground<00:02:06.130> deer<00:02:06.930> can't<00:02:07.930> youth<00:02:08.050> rises<00:02:08.440> yet<00:02:08.619> anyway

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
ground deer can't youth rises yet anyway

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.889 
ground deer can't youth rises yet anyway
and<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:09.550> probably<00:02:09.910> actively<00:02:10.300> bad<00:02:10.479> for<00:02:10.720> Miffy

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
and it's probably actively bad for Miffy

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.290 
and it's probably actively bad for Miffy
does

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.930 

snakes<00:02:15.990> are<00:02:16.110> guys<00:02:16.230> even<00:02:16.470> bigger<00:02:16.940> Carter's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
snakes are guys even bigger Carter's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.230 
snakes are guys even bigger Carter's
fine

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.140 

kind<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:23.990> crappy<00:02:24.850> let's<00:02:25.850> attack<00:02:26.030> with

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
kind of crappy let's attack with

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.590 
kind of crappy let's attack with
everything<00:02:27.430> whoo<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.700> was<00:02:28.730> bad<00:02:29.000> actually<00:02:29.240> I

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
everything whoo that was bad actually I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.670 
everything whoo that was bad actually I
shouldn't<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:29.960> played<00:02:30.080> swamp<00:02:30.380> sure<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.560> play

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
shouldn't have played swamp sure to play

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.410 
shouldn't have played swamp sure to play
for<00:02:30.890> us<00:02:30.920> there<00:02:31.190> oh<00:02:32.410> whatever<00:02:37.090> blocks<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.240> guy

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
for us there oh whatever blocks this guy

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.000 
for us there oh whatever blocks this guy
anyway<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.800> probably<00:02:40.010> am<00:02:40.250> not<00:02:40.670> pumping<00:02:42.010> he

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
anyway so I probably am not pumping he

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:54.120 
anyway so I probably am not pumping he
goes<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.340> six<00:02:45.700> when<00:02:46.700> we<00:02:46.760> just<00:02:46.910> verdant<00:02:47.180> Haven

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.040 

would<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:54.910> rather<00:02:55.150> burden<00:02:55.600> Haven<00:02:55.900> be

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
would have rather burden Haven be

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.250 
would have rather burden Haven be
basically<00:02:56.560> anything<00:02:56.860> else<00:02:57.130> at<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.310> point

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
basically anything else at this point

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.860 
basically anything else at this point
but<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.590> guess<00:02:59.740> this<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.010> okay<00:03:00.780> he's<00:03:01.780> not

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
but I guess this is okay he's not

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.860 
but I guess this is okay he's not
leaving<00:03:02.020> up<00:03:02.230> mana<00:03:02.760> can't<00:03:03.760> pick<00:03:03.940> fight<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.300> just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
leaving up mana can't pick fight it just

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:14.830 
leaving up mana can't pick fight it just
playing<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.230> snapshot<00:03:05.470> okay<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:07.060> guy<00:03:07.210> is<00:03:07.270> big

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.490 

this<00:03:15.620> guy<00:03:15.800> is<00:03:15.860> huge<00:03:16.550> by<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.450> way<00:03:19.900> all<00:03:20.900> right<00:03:21.050> so

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
this guy is huge by the way all right so

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.020 
this guy is huge by the way all right so
if<00:03:21.950> we<00:03:22.220> attack<00:03:22.550> with<00:03:24.519> Campbell<00:03:25.519> shark<00:03:25.760> we

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
if we attack with Campbell shark we

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.670 
if we attack with Campbell shark we
force<00:03:26.330> them<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.510> trade<00:03:27.019> which<00:03:27.290> i<00:03:27.410> think<00:03:27.470> is

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
force them to trade which i think is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.000 
force them to trade which i think is
probably<00:03:27.950> okay<00:03:28.550> here<00:03:29.590> question<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.860> do<00:03:30.950> we

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
probably okay here question is do we

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.690 
probably okay here question is do we
attack<00:03:31.310> what<00:03:31.489> these<00:03:31.640> guys<00:03:31.879> as<00:03:32.120> well<00:03:33.700> oculus

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
attack what these guys as well oculus

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.160 
attack what these guys as well oculus
doesn't<00:03:34.940> really<00:03:35.060> get<00:03:35.180> through<00:03:35.480> neither<00:03:35.989> does

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
doesn't really get through neither does

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.839 
doesn't really get through neither does
biome<00:03:36.530> answer<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.280> might<00:03:37.430> even<00:03:37.519> be<00:03:37.640> more

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
biome answer it might even be more

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.630 
biome answer it might even be more
correct<00:03:38.090> just<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.420> wait<00:03:42.310> because<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.489> thing

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
correct just to wait because this thing

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.979 
correct just to wait because this thing
should<00:03:43.790> actually<00:03:43.940> just<00:03:44.239> kill<00:03:44.390> them<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.629> on<00:03:44.840> its

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
should actually just kill them in on its

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.270 
should actually just kill them in on its
own

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.360 

yeah<00:03:50.940> let's<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.180> hold<00:03:51.390> back<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:52.130> can<00:03:53.130> force

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
yeah let's just hold back I can force

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.120 
yeah let's just hold back I can force
this<00:03:53.550> trade<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:54.030> don't<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.209> that's<00:03:54.390> relevant

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
this trade I don't think that's relevant

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.020 
this trade I don't think that's relevant
it<00:03:56.130> could<00:03:56.310> be<00:03:56.400> if<00:03:56.490> you<00:03:56.550> had<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:56.670> pit<00:03:56.850> fight

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
it could be if you had a pit fight

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.190 
it could be if you had a pit fight
though<00:03:59.450> because<00:04:00.450> then<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.870> pick<00:04:01.020> fight

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
though because then you can pick fight

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.100 
though because then you can pick fight
this<00:04:01.350> fight<00:04:01.650> or<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.280> couldn't<00:04:02.550> otherwise<00:04:03.110> you

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
this fight or you couldn't otherwise you

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.030 
this fight or you couldn't otherwise you
just<00:04:04.200> find<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.530> drink<00:04:04.770> all<00:04:05.130> right<00:04:06.890> make<00:04:07.890> that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
just find a drink all right make that

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.270 
just find a drink all right make that
guy<00:04:08.220> big<00:04:08.459> sure<00:04:10.489> Sarah<00:04:11.489> talk<00:04:11.760> okay<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.980> we<00:04:14.100> can't

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
guy big sure Sarah talk okay so we can't

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.340 
guy big sure Sarah talk okay so we can't
actually<00:04:14.459> kill<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.060> Drake<00:04:15.480> without<00:04:15.930> making

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
actually kill the Drake without making

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.160 
actually kill the Drake without making
our<00:04:16.470> guy<00:04:16.680> in<00:04:16.980> x2<00:04:17.549> which<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:18.180> sort<00:04:18.389> of<00:04:18.419> annoying

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.410 

going<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.860> make<00:04:24.950> this<00:04:25.040> guy<00:04:25.220> even<00:04:25.460> bigger<00:04:25.700> now

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
going to make this guy even bigger now

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.710 
going to make this guy even bigger now
we<00:04:26.480> have<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:26.660> couple<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.870> tramp<00:04:27.170> leurs<00:04:28.630> so<00:04:29.630> we

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
we have a couple of tramp leurs so we

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.330 
we have a couple of tramp leurs so we
can<00:04:29.810> make<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:30.020> guy<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:31.060> 43<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.480> then<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.900> 5<00:04:33.170> to<00:04:33.470> 6

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
can make this guy a 43 and then a 5 to 6

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.220 
can make this guy a 43 and then a 5 to 6
1<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:37.150> think<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:38.240> do<00:04:38.420> attack<00:04:38.660> with<00:04:38.810> Shambo

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
1 I think we do attack with Shambo

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.300 
1 I think we do attack with Shambo
now<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.620> eyes<00:04:39.710> trample<00:04:40.190> it<00:04:42.010> will<00:04:43.010> force<00:04:43.190> them

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
now that eyes trample it will force them

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.690 
now that eyes trample it will force them
to<00:04:43.370> lose<00:04:43.670> one<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:44.030> those<00:04:44.120> guys<00:04:44.240> at<00:04:44.450> least

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:56.890 

probably<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.880> SAP<00:04:50.090> jaw<00:04:51.340> really<00:04:52.340> takes<00:04:52.580> three

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.840 

and<00:04:57.560> then<00:04:57.680> we<00:04:57.740> have<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.860> pretty<00:04:58.220> good<00:04:58.370> bored<00:04:58.729> at

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
and then we have a pretty good bored at

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.040 
and then we have a pretty good bored at
that<00:04:58.970> point<00:04:59.240> so<00:05:01.330> now<00:05:02.330> we<00:05:02.570> just<00:05:02.660> need<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.930> play

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
that point so now we just need to play

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.559 
that point so now we just need to play
around<00:05:03.139> either<00:05:03.410> eyes

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.510 

which<00:05:10.199> he<00:05:10.469> is<00:05:10.529> not<00:05:10.830> going<00:05:10.919> to<00:05:10.979> have<00:05:11.099> metaphor

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
which he is not going to have metaphor

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.689 
which he is not going to have metaphor
okay

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.450 

five<00:05:17.699> men<00:05:17.880> are<00:05:18.060> okay<00:05:18.810> no<00:05:19.169> apparently<00:05:20.039> not<00:05:20.100> like

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
five men are okay no apparently not like

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:30.600 
five men are okay no apparently not like
that<00:05:20.669> huh

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.730 

well<00:05:31.610> if<00:05:32.600> you<00:05:32.720> guys<00:05:32.780> needs<00:05:33.020> arise<00:05:33.200> yes<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.620> keep

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
well if you guys needs arise yes to keep

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.530 
well if you guys needs arise yes to keep
it<00:05:33.860> up<00:05:36.610> if<00:05:37.610> he<00:05:37.700> doesn't<00:05:37.850> have<00:05:38.000> either<00:05:38.120> eyes<00:05:38.360> I

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
it up if he doesn't have either eyes I

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.040 
it up if he doesn't have either eyes I
think<00:05:38.780> you<00:05:38.900> should<00:05:39.110> still<00:05:39.440> keep<00:05:39.590> up<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.890> mana

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
think you should still keep up the mana

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.230 
think you should still keep up the mana
depending<00:05:42.050> on<00:05:42.110> what<00:05:42.200> he<00:05:42.260> has<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.560> guess<00:05:43.240> because

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
depending on what he has I guess because

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.670 
depending on what he has I guess because
at<00:05:44.360> least<00:05:44.540> makes<00:05:44.810> me<00:05:44.960> play<00:05:45.110> around<00:05:45.380> it<00:05:47.680> but

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
at least makes me play around it but

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.900 
at least makes me play around it but
maybe<00:05:48.890> that's<00:05:49.160> wrong

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.930 

I<00:05:57.000> mean<00:05:57.570> we<00:05:57.690> have<00:05:57.810> 12<00:05:58.140> trampled<00:05:58.680> plus<00:05:59.130> 5<00:05:59.580> damage

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
I mean we have 12 trampled plus 5 damage

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.780 
I mean we have 12 trampled plus 5 damage
on<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.330> board<00:06:00.570> so<00:06:01.080> we<00:06:01.170> have<00:06:01.260> 17<00:06:01.680> damage<00:06:02.010> you

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
on the board so we have 17 damage you

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.570 
on the board so we have 17 damage you
only<00:06:02.880> block<00:06:03.090> 9<00:06:03.360> of<00:06:03.510> it<00:06:03.630> right<00:06:03.750> now<00:06:04.580> we

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
only block 9 of it right now we

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
only block 9 of it right now we
definitely<00:06:05.760> have<00:06:06.000> lethal<00:06:07.790> without<00:06:08.790> etherized

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
definitely have lethal without etherized

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.480 
definitely have lethal without etherized
you<00:06:10.140> know<00:06:10.230> screwing<00:06:10.500> us<00:06:10.650> up<00:06:10.800> he's<00:06:11.280> probably

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
you know screwing us up he's probably

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.980 
you know screwing us up he's probably
just<00:06:11.640> doing<00:06:11.850> some<00:06:12.000> math<00:06:12.210> figuring<00:06:12.840> out<00:06:12.900> if

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
just doing some math figuring out if

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.680 
just doing some math figuring out if
he's<00:06:13.140> dead<00:06:13.320> or<00:06:13.350> not<00:06:13.530> I<00:06:14.090> don't<00:06:15.090> think<00:06:15.420> he<00:06:15.510> is

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
he's dead or not I don't think he is

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.600 
he's dead or not I don't think he is
since<00:06:16.110> we<00:06:16.260> can't<00:06:16.440> actually<00:06:16.530> get<00:06:17.190> lethal<00:06:17.550> I

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
since we can't actually get lethal I

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.580 
since we can't actually get lethal I
think<00:06:17.820> without<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.450> biome<00:06:18.690> answer<00:06:18.960> but<00:06:19.320> I

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
think without the biome answer but I

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.180 
think without the biome answer but I
guess<00:06:20.250> there<00:06:20.370> is<00:06:20.460> trampled<00:06:20.820> to<00:06:20.940> think<00:06:21.090> about

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
guess there is trampled to think about

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:30.010
