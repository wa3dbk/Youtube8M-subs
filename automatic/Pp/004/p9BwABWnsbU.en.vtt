00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the guys that they had on their team we

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.960 
the guys that they had on their team we
really<00:00:26.310> tried<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> take<00:00:26.609> them<00:00:26.730> away<00:00:26.910> from

really tried to take them away from

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.390 
really tried to take them away from
their<00:00:27.180> strengths<00:00:27.539> Ian<00:00:28.529> clerk<00:00:28.740> got<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.369> for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
a minute but I think Nick really cooled

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.600 
a minute but I think Nick really cooled
them<00:00:31.080> off<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.529> together<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.279> team<00:00:32.430> we

normally<00:00:39.660> hedge<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.440> those<00:00:40.710> screens<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.219> lot<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
normally hedge on those screens a lot of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.459 
normally hedge on those screens a lot of
switching<00:00:41.879> today<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.180> guys<00:00:42.450> may<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.050> able<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
switching today you guys may be able to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.990 
switching today you guys may be able to
do<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.250> size<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.820> thought

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
do that because of your size I thought

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
do that because of your size I thought
that<00:00:45.120> was<00:00:45.270> an<00:00:45.390> interesting<00:00:45.480> wrinkle<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.680> put

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that was an interesting wrinkle you put

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.080 
that was an interesting wrinkle you put
into<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> defense<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.820> maybe<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
into the defense and maybe the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.549 
into the defense and maybe the
difference<00:00:48.420> tonight<00:00:48.570> yeah<00:00:49.200> when<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
difference tonight yeah when you get a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
difference tonight yeah when you get a
guy<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.710> grant<00:00:50.250> Jared<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.000> Brandon<00:00:51.270> Ashley

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
guy like grant Jared and Brandon Ashley

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.510 
guy like grant Jared and Brandon Ashley
switching<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> point<00:00:53.309> guards

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
switching and you know the point guards

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.319 
switching and you know the point guards
thing<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.820> could<00:00:53.910> beat<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:54.149> off<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
thing they could beat them off the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.490 
thing they could beat them off the
dribble<00:00:54.510> when<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:54.989> room<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.440> a
