00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
piping bag with the nozzle into a jug

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.680 
piping bag with the nozzle into a jug
and<00:00:28.539> then<00:00:29.350> you<00:00:29.680> can<00:00:29.890> open<00:00:30.730> up<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:31.030> piping<00:00:31.510> bag

and you can fill it quite easily because

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.690 
and you can fill it quite easily because
your<00:00:34.300> hands<00:00:34.719> will<00:00:34.870> be<00:00:34.930> free<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:36.340> with<00:00:36.550> your

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
your hands will be free so with your

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.600 
your hands will be free so with your
hand<00:00:36.970> at<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.510> bottom<00:00:37.890> using<00:00:38.890> it<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.160> direct

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
hand at the bottom using it to direct

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.910 
hand at the bottom using it to direct
the<00:00:39.910> piping<00:00:40.450> bag<00:00:40.660> and<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.440> hands<00:00:41.710> at<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.890> top

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
the piping bag and the hands at the top

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.060 
the piping bag and the hands at the top
is<00:00:42.520> doing<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.420> pressure<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:44.530> squeeze<00:00:44.860> the

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
is doing the pressure to squeeze the

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.910 
is doing the pressure to squeeze the
icing<00:00:45.520> out<00:00:45.700> of<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.030> bag<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.380> want<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:47.770> make

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
icing out of the bag so you want to make

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.360 
icing out of the bag so you want to make
sure<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.370> icing<00:00:48.910> goes<00:00:49.809> right<00:00:50.649> up<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.190> edge

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
sure the icing goes right up to the edge

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.750 
sure the icing goes right up to the edge
of<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.910> case<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.649> make<00:00:53.649> sure<00:00:53.950> as<00:00:54.280> much<00:00:54.579> as

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
of the case and make sure as much as

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.729 
of the case and make sure as much as
possible<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.989> icing<00:00:56.410> bag<00:00:56.620> is<00:00:57.149> vertical

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
possible that the icing bag is vertical

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.380 
possible that the icing bag is vertical
so<00:00:59.739> with<00:00:59.950> even<00:01:00.340> pressure<00:01:01.170> slowly<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:04.059> move

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
so with even pressure slowly just move

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.760 
so with even pressure slowly just move
the<00:01:04.780> icing<00:01:05.350> bag<00:01:05.700> around<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:07.030> edge<00:01:07.649> you've<00:01:08.649> got

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
the icing bag around the edge you've got

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.480 
the icing bag around the edge you've got
plenty<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.189> time<00:01:09.459> so<00:01:09.490> don't<00:01:09.850> rush<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.479> then

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
plenty of time so don't rush it and then

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.879 
plenty of time so don't rush it and then
go<00:01:12.490> over<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:12.909> top<00:01:13.209> half<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:13.869> then<00:01:14.679> when<00:01:14.799> you

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:14.889 
go over the top half and then when you

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:17.340 
go over the top half and then when you
finish<00:01:15.100> ease<00:01:15.609> off<00:01:15.880> on<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.060> pressure<00:01:16.389> and<00:01:16.749> just

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
finish ease off on the pressure and just

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.980 
finish ease off on the pressure and just
pull<00:01:17.709> the<00:01:18.069> bag<00:01:18.280> up<00:01:18.639> and<00:01:19.329> you<00:01:19.569> should<00:01:19.719> get<00:01:19.929> a

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
pull the bag up and you should get a

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.620 
pull the bag up and you should get a
lovely<00:01:20.409> little<00:01:20.560> peak<00:01:20.950> like<00:01:21.249> that<00:01:21.429> so<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.509> end

as<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.599> do<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.080> get<00:02:11.200> more<00:02:11.319> practice<00:02:11.800> it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
as you do it and get more practice it

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.120 
as you do it and get more practice it
becomes<00:02:12.220> easier<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.730> easier<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.920> again<00:02:14.920> just

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
becomes easier and easier and again just

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.640 
becomes easier and easier and again just
keep<00:02:15.370> rotating<00:02:15.550> around

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
keep rotating around

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.410 
keep rotating around
now<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.159> do<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.459> double<00:02:17.670> layer<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.330> you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
now you can do a double layer if you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.070 
now you can do a double layer if you
wanted<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.090> am<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.690> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.049> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
single layer and we're going to do to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.300 
single layer and we're going to do to
finish<00:02:24.239> off<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.569> middle<00:02:24.840> bit<00:02:24.989> it's<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.069> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
finish off the middle bit it's just a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.430 
finish off the middle bit it's just a
big<00:02:26.730> rosette<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.659> middle<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.110> squeeze<00:02:28.409> a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
big rosette in the middle so squeeze a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.130 
big rosette in the middle so squeeze a
bit<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.709> harder<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.250> then<00:02:29.700> pull<00:02:29.940> away<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:31.049> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
bit of harder and then pull away and you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.479 
bit of harder and then pull away and you

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the actual icing itself so you just move

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.240 
the actual icing itself so you just move
that<00:02:58.170> around<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.650> might<00:02:58.799> put<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.010> little<00:02:59.040> bit

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
that around I might put a little bit

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.500 
that around I might put a little bit
more<00:02:59.310> on<00:02:59.549> there<00:02:59.700> good<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> little<00:03:00.420> bit

more on there good to be a little bit
generous<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.700> again<00:03:02.700> move<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.120> case<00:03:03.900> around

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
generous and again move the case around

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.940 
generous and again move the case around
not<00:03:05.040> your<00:03:05.310> palette<00:03:05.670> knife<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.470> do<00:03:07.680> that

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
not your palette knife so you do that

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.610 
not your palette knife so you do that
this<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:08.879> when<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.329> rotate<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.140> case<00:03:10.349> in<00:03:10.530> your

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
this is when you rotate the case in your

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.059 
this is when you rotate the case in your
hand<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.519> then<00:03:12.060> use<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.599> palette<00:03:13.019> knife<00:03:13.069> just

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
hand and then use the palette knife just

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.390 
hand and then use the palette knife just
to<00:03:14.310> smooth<00:03:14.609> it<00:03:14.730> off<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.709> little<00:03:16.709> bit<00:03:16.859> like<00:03:17.069> so

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
to smooth it off a little bit like so

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.500 
to smooth it off a little bit like so
and<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:19.470> cover<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.890> all<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.310> then<00:03:21.150> at<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.480> end

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
and to cover it all and then at the end

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.379 
and to cover it all and then at the end
you<00:03:22.109> can<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.319> go<00:03:22.680> back<00:03:22.709> over<00:03:22.919> it<00:03:23.430> until<00:03:23.790> you

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
you can just go back over it until you

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.110 
you can just go back over it until you
are<00:03:24.419> happy<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:26.250> there<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.459> go<00:03:26.489> that's<00:03:26.790> three

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
are happy so there we go that's three

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.460 
are happy so there we go that's three
different<00:03:27.450> ideas<00:03:27.840> using<00:03:28.530> buttercream<00:03:28.889> icing

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
different ideas using buttercream icing

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.869 
different ideas using buttercream icing
the<00:03:31.470> fourth<00:03:31.739> technique<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.819> use

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
the fourth technique is to use

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.420 
the fourth technique is to use
ready-made<00:03:33.389> icing<00:03:34.169> you<00:03:34.799> just<00:03:35.129> roll<00:03:35.400> out

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
ready-made icing you just roll out

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.360 
ready-made icing you just roll out
between<00:03:36.299> two<00:03:36.569> pieces<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.019> cling<00:03:37.319> wrap<00:03:37.530> like

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
between two pieces of cling wrap like

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.059 
between two pieces of cling wrap like
I've<00:03:38.579> done<00:03:38.700> here<00:03:38.870> put<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> icing<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.379> top<00:03:40.709> then

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
I've done here put the icing on top then

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.830 
I've done here put the icing on top then
put<00:03:41.310> another<00:03:41.519> piece<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.940> cling<00:03:42.120> wrap<00:03:42.239> on<00:03:42.480> top

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
put another piece of cling wrap on top

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.229 
put another piece of cling wrap on top
of<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.560> then<00:03:44.280> what<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.489> do<00:03:44.669> is<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:45.060> roll

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
of that and then what you do is you roll

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.000 
of that and then what you do is you roll
it<00:03:45.389> out<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.569> your<00:03:45.810> desired<00:03:46.199> thickness<00:03:46.319> and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it out to your desired thickness and

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.920 
it out to your desired thickness and
then<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.699> saves<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.090> any<00:03:48.239> mess<00:03:48.480> on<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.750> work

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
then it saves on any mess on the work

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.379 
then it saves on any mess on the work
surface<00:03:49.199> so<00:03:50.190> I've<00:03:50.280> chosen<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.790> do<00:03:50.910> black<00:03:51.359> and

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
surface so I've chosen to do black and

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.099 
surface so I've chosen to do black and
