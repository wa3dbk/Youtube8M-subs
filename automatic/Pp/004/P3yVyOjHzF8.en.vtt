00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.640
 Welcome to a new edition of our Savior bag here 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.859
 me very easily very sour is currently on the road there in 2010 in Munich 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.649
 the latest developments of the catfish of the Greizer Dimension Digital Textile Art 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.229
 Impression not only 10 cents but also the electronics can 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.519
 from the printer Command because also plastic can conduct electricity and the Nikon 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.019
 d90 well can be easily printed on each other perfect for one 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.780
 cheap mass production 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.390
 everywhere where a way whereby the masses are needed to 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.080
 Example of medical devices as if this is now or Latin and we put in 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.490
 Future Polis probably way to deploy Poletto League but can still 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.000
 more also clock last important to their regions are products of the police 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.470
 this technology will probably be two new flat displays in the future 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.180
 Lighting concepts and new solar cells allow 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.380
 but the science discovered in the late seventies Herbstes 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.210
 Plastic hose conduct electricity and can even shine 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.250
 a lot was done 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.820
 Brolin more so plastics and Billy tronic are so polito nick 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.850
 merged a key technology for many industries 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.119
 only the political scientist Qatar's potentials electronics massively extreme 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.009
 the Fraunhofer institute for 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.590
 Reliability and microintegration in Munich in short the ZMP is Germany 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 Ronny Thome with blacksmith 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.770
 Ing explores the team around Professor Karlheinz Bock's new products and the man 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.840
 she makes 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.960
 ultra flat transistors lighting elements and flexible batteries Polito Michelle 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.619
 deliver 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.069
 Munich have unequal materials 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.509
 combine the metals and plastics into one unit if it succeeds 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.590
 Procedures for developing then probably in Munich because 

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:09.259
 Germany has recognized the importance of this key technology Clara 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.279
 in research policy development flexible electronics 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.279
 and organic electronics, especially in material development 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.280
 you are very well positioned but also in the process and around 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.499
 Production technology developed 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.399
 Different material combinations require polishing and is 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.469
 own due to the different material properties 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.109
 manufacturing processes 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.209
 for the production SchÃ¼tte cost-effective practical 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.209
 The Munich team is focusing on a simple strategy 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.069
 Each material is processed with an already known technique in the 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.699
 Police and adapted so becomes a protective forest, for example 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.489
 in a simple screen-printing process on the Bunny Tom's component 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.629
 applied 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.349
 only if all production steps are seamlessly intermeshed 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.479
 Mass production and low unit prices possible 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.189
 so it has the polish with 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.860
 even that costs sent light unknown woman postponed some proceedings 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.539
 in the multiplicity of the procedures for the different materials 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.509
 A great strength of the political scientist is needed 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.549
 meanwhile almost all kinds of materials are processed and with each other 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.459
 be combined 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.319
 this is the technology 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.129
 to put the carriage out of the paper under the components and 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.959
 Products in which there was simply no room for Pietro 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:32.239
 Ing 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.529
 the political scientist catastrophes them to our handling of microelectronics 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.770
 to change thoroughly everywhere 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.690
 where another sheet of paper fits in between can also be feces in the future 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.859
 protects against being installed 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.309
 flexible 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.309
 Thus, political scientist circuits are aptly described 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.109
 They also enable new products for the consumer 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.389
 He can certainly look at large screens in the wall 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.989
 look forward to large-scale Senso plants what the carpet his son 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.979
 Logistics support in a company but also in the office 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.659
 he can look forward to that maybe flexible little helper his 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.159
 We can support health directly on the skin which can be cross-linked 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.909
 but he may also be flexible on no screens friends maybe 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.500
 Taking along with his mobile phone is easier reading the newspaper 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.659
 in the morning, for example, in the suburban train 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.050
 accepted 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.110
 Quote on flexible health care the patient just like one 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.189
 Wrist watch can wear 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.979
 7 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.819
 wherever inflexible and heavy circuit boards determine product design today 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.789
 will relieve the police and lead to new products 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.699
 or keep incorporating protectors Chen circuits easier 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.699
 Make ounces smarter 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.749
 No 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.159
 this achievement could possibly be he is the rush 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.969
 huge in microelectronics 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.969
 So it remains exciting how the development continues 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:06.400
 what we have today the next fair easily now I have more bag there 

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:10.579
 then again in my own hand thank you very much for TuS Celle and until 

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:11.110
 next time
