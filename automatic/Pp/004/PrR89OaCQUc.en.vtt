wd-40 but you might actually get that to
work<00:02:22.319> for<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.980> we're<00:02:26.099> going<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.459> a

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
work for you now we're going to get a

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.620 
work for you now we're going to get a
port<00:02:27.239> down<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.510> 2<00:02:27.630> by<00:02:27.780> 4<00:02:28.110> 2<00:02:28.349> by<00:02:28.500> 3<00:02:29.360> place<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.540> on

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
port down to 2 by 4 2 by 3 place it on

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.000 
port down to 2 by 4 2 by 3 place it on
the<00:02:30.720> top<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:32.000> snag<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.860> get<00:02:34.860> the

the top of it and snag it to get the
shaft<00:02:35.250> out<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:48.269> now<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.870> shaft<00:02:49.170> out

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
shaft out so now we have the shaft out

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.390 
shaft out so now we have the shaft out
of<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.620> bearing<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.190> there's<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.239> spacer<00:02:52.400> that

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
do is remove the three dowel pins that

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.200 
do is remove the three dowel pins that
hold<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.920> in<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:32.210> can<00:04:32.390> see<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.720> one<00:04:32.870> there

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
hold it in you can see the one there

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.650 
hold it in you can see the one there
just<00:04:35.210> take<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.390> center<00:04:35.750> punch<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:38.030> drive<00:04:38.390> that

cover and pry it up and out what we need
to<00:05:05.780> do<00:05:05.960> is<00:05:07.630> disconnect<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.930> stator<00:05:09.290> leaves

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
to do is disconnect the stator leaves

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.980 
to do is disconnect the stator leaves
from<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.030> right<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.330> fire<00:05:12.040> but<00:05:13.040> rectifier<00:05:13.580> is

from the right to fire but rectifier is

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.840 
from the right to fire but rectifier is

up we don't carefully damage the

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.620 
up we don't carefully damage the
rectifier<00:05:19.640> because<00:05:19.910> we're<00:05:20.150> going<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.300> replace

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
rectifier because we're going to replace

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.740 
rectifier because we're going to replace
the<00:05:20.960> rectifier<00:05:21.470> but<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.730> stator<00:05:23.060> leads<00:05:23.390> the

want to maintain as much of those as

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.420 
want to maintain as much of those as
possible

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430

this<00:05:31.430> one<00:05:33.010> has<00:05:34.010> not<00:05:34.280> been<00:05:34.340> soldered<00:05:34.910> it's<00:05:35.690> been

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
this one has not been soldered it's been

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.850 
this one has not been soldered it's been
welded<00:05:36.610> so<00:05:37.610> we<00:05:37.850> want<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.210> remove<00:05:41.740> just<00:05:42.740> the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
welded so we want to remove just the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.080 
welded so we want to remove just the
very<00:05:43.100> top<00:05:43.430> of<00:05:43.730> the<00:05:43.850> weld<00:05:44.090> because<00:05:44.900> you<00:05:45.230> can<00:05:45.410> see

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
very top of the weld because you can see

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.960 
very top of the weld because you can see
this<00:05:47.090> split<00:05:47.690> area<00:05:48.020> right<00:05:48.380> here<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:49.669> weld

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
this split area right here the weld

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.030 
this split area right here the weld
doesn't<00:05:50.360> go<00:05:50.480> down<00:05:50.720> that<00:05:50.930> far<00:05:51.230> the<00:05:51.440> weld<00:05:51.650> only

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
doesn't go down that far the weld only

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.780 
doesn't go down that far the weld only
goes<00:05:52.250> down<00:05:53.740> to<00:05:54.740> where<00:05:54.890> the<00:05:55.010> screw<00:05:55.250> driver<00:05:55.430> is

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
goes down to where the screw driver is

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.390 
goes down to where the screw driver is
right<00:05:56.060> now<00:05:57.610> so<00:05:58.610> what<00:05:58.790> we're<00:05:58.940> going<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.150> do<00:06:00.400> is

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
right now so what we're going to do is

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.940 
right now so what we're going to do is
take<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.700> pair<00:06:01.880> of<00:06:02.000> side<00:06:02.240> cuts

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.190 

and<00:06:05.950> cut<00:06:06.340> just<00:06:06.640> the<00:06:06.730> uppermost<00:06:07.210> portion<00:06:07.660> of<00:06:08.050> it

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
and cut just the uppermost portion of it

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.970 
and cut just the uppermost portion of it
off<00:06:11.130> it's<00:06:12.130> going<00:06:12.310> to<00:06:12.370> require<00:06:12.610> some<00:06:12.700> force<00:06:13.980> but

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
off it's going to require some force but

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.010 
off it's going to require some force but
