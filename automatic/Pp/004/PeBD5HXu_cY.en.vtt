00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.080
 3d-graphic round play expire passable on the right side has the 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.670
 Outcry was big as the publisher bitComposer its newest Lines 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.360
 presented the subtitle now Bettin Päckchen wears the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.020
 turn-based tactical game she enjoys today cult status we have 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.050
 we played very early version and give no all-clear 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.270
 because she leaves him very thoughtful first impression please note that 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.050
 some things are still provisional 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.279
 for example, the overview map top right or the four identical units 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.579
 Tires and armament left top that still come from times 1 2 and later 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.360
 by a Mirte Dieter Hieke faces should be replaced on the interface 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 and the on-screen character values ​​they are not yet final 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.340
 Speaking of character values ​​this again enormously important for certain tasks 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.540
 fight with high attention worth discovering for example faster 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.700
 Eminem does not mean that she also loosens the explosive devices 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 defuse 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.820
 because with such gaudy should prefer to see a colleague with Home 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.059
 Explosive it turn 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 and to hate their customers with good medicine know know now 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
 not quite come 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.610
 basically the new chapter Leins runs in real time but they can 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.930
 at any time with a hit on the spacebar that happen persistent many 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.920
 also give several in a row 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.590
 for example, snatch snatch or rock as here in the area and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.160
 when enemy contact independently opens the fire 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.600
 or they indicate exactly when appears automatically pause is about when 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 create a culprit or enemy fire 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.750
 so it was not exclusive in the aforementioned reasons 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.300
 turn-based 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.579
 In the near future also called Exchange Heinlein will be installed 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:37.510
 with that action 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.980
 who coordinate their passwords so that for example the first one with for 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.740
 regurgitates 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.610
 the second fire protection gives and the third the care needs interior 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.600
 Kolat 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.820
 8 by the way 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 the koi of the opponents is of course not finished here either 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.250
 The night watch may also determine whether the fighter and targeted 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.860
 from the hip sustained fire shoots until the magazine is empty or a short 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.920
 Fire burst gives off 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 or calls targeted shot attaches 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.499
 By the way, do not be surprised that you still see the daycare on the map 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.139
 "Of course, that's still going to change as in the classics they have to be enemies 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.929
 with their fighters and if they hear an enemy but not yet 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:28.039
 Most of the corresponding Marks can also look at the risk as well 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.549
 the developers about the possibility of "a position by satellite on the 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.220
 Mini map to let ads 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.360
 This will either cost you money or rarely be possible ever 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.360
 by difficulty level 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.519
 very cool satellite can be seen in the 3d models not only the weapon of one 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.079
 soldiers 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.680
 but also his equipment of his clothes his armor Pässler 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.979
 West wear the guys over the uniform 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:56.230
 later comes the well-known than painting but more detailed 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.679
 depending on the terrain and time of day there's then individual make-up 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.479
 and our old acquaintance Gandhi has even done fine 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.699
 We also liked the interiors of many buildings 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.579
 Details show for example advertising posters lead with 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:12.829
 the strawberries 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.469
 but that leaves us cold, of course, we are more in tactical information 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.160
 Interested 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 and lo and behold randomly stands in the corner and flip-chart Rome 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:28.239
 I have the best tactics and nothing if you get four good ideas right here 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:28.919
 a man has 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.879
 So Merkel AR thou shalt not threw in the forest hand grenades thou shalt not 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.040
 clumsy should there can let species throw SID awkward should should 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.760
 do not throw with left and de 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.370
 clumsy should clearly in the red poorly achievable target area 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.370
 throw 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.249
 Luckily he is supposed to be better at throwing and awakens us proportionately 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.619
 scheduled retreat by an elite school for Lidl 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.739
 our conclusion the still very early version makes already very good impression what 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.280
 the tactical battles are concerned 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.890
 to the strategy part where we get back on the map cities and crucial 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.790
 Position the mines and airfields conquer the fictional land of his 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.680
 The dictatorships can liberate those around nine months before the planned small one 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.440
 Scenes do not say much because the strategy card is simply not 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.200
 built-in, however, the new chapter Lines should also seizure-free 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.080
 orientate 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.870
 Therefore, we should not be more disappointed 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.099
 But on the contrary
