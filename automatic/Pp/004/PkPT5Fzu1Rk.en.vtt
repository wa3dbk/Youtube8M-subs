00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.090
 ah 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.570
 analyze the condition of the hair before 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.350
 proceed to its application 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.640
 in cases of very sensitized hair 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.010
 especially porous or with others 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.670
 zante processes recommended derry 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.220
 a test of previous resistance 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.050
 to do it, simply apply the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.560
 step 2 of absolut on a small 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.470
 Tuft of the neck wait a few minutes and 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.489
 measure the resistance of the hair if it is 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.930
 normal you can proceed to the application 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.670
 If the hair rises in temperature or 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.040
 presents alterations in elasticity 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.580
 you will have to mix the product with 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.410
 Saler 21 or ultimately give up 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.410
 of the application of the absolut process 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.210
 wash your hair with purifying shampoo 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.210
 by salerm cosmetics 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.960
 I know how well with a towel and apply 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.960
 Step 1 pretreatment not on Saturn 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.729
 comb and section the hair in 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.950
 partitions starting at the nape and 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.880
 forming partitions of 2 centimeters to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.880
 throughout the section 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.670
 apply step 2 of cream riz before 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.030
 for hair dyed or for hair 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.560
 natural according to hair condition 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.530
 leaving a separation of one centimeter 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.550
 and middle of the scalp 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 distribute the product throughout 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.500
 all the hair avoiding the root 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.100
 then comb gently with a 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.890
 Wide tooth comb using tension 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.900
 mean make sure there is enough 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.900
 product in the hair at all times 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.530
 works the hair with temperature 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.780
 environment and does not cover it with a towel or 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.050
 use the dryer or another source of 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.050
 hot 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.430
 I took some lock of hair from the part 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.650
 central between the crown and the nape of 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.120
 be possible lock by area parietal 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.459
 crown and neck 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.030
 in a network of a strand of hair around 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.030
 of your index finger 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.990
 If the hair keeps its tangled shape 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.390
 it is completely worked 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.620
 if the curl opens the hair needs 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.620
 extra time 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.310
 it is possible that in specific cases there 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.520
 have to repeat the process again 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.350
 function of the time the work finished 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.370
 rinse the hair between 5 and 7 minutes 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.370
 With warm water 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.269
 Keep your hair as straight as possible 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.269
 during the rinsing 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.140
 Once the hair is rinsed , the 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.750
 dryer and fingers to dry 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.730
 you have to leave between 10 and 20 per 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.990
 a hundred percent moisture to proceed with smoothing 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.850
 With the iron 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.360
 comb and section the hair in 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.670
 partitions in the form of tea start by the 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.950
 nape I took sections of half a centimeter 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.109
 never wider than the iron 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.209
 keep the iron at least one 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.960
 distance of a centimeter and a half to 2 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.580
 cm of the scalp start close to 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.909
 the root 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.310
 treat half of the hair lock 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:34.150
 press slide and repeat twice 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.460
 up to a total of two seconds per area 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.909
 then go to the next section and 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.280
 Repeat the process at the tips 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:47.750
 180 degree maximum iron temperature 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.180
 celsius or 356 degrees fahrenheit in 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.099
 Extremely porous hairs are 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.409
 Advise drying the hair with the dryer 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.409
 well smooth and do not use the iron 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.940
 payne the hair gently with a comb 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.949
 of wide teeth apply step 3 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.490
 neutralizing either directly from the 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.770
 bottle or with bolt and palentina starting 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.419
 by the neck and forming partitions of 2 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.419
 centimeters along the section 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.470
 saturates homogeneously the hair of 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.360
 the roots to the tips 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.300
 comb the hair with a tooth comb 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.550
 widths while distributing step 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.330
 3 homogeneously throughout the 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.380
 hair leave on for 5 minutes and 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.200
 rinse for another 5 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.280
 in case of hair or especially 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.100
 sensitized is recommended to apply 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.380
 plus conditioner deep impact between 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.380
 step 3 and step 4 of the process 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.310
 apply step 4 evenly 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.320
 all the hair this conditioner that 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.630
 rinses us leaves the hair healthy and 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.830
 bright while keeping it 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.830
 hydrated for longer 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.230
 Do not wash your hair during the first 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.230
 48 hours
