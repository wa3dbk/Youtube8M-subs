you my other bike review that is
currently<00:00:09.269> available<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.710> Schwinn<00:00:10.950> focus

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
which is right behind me okay so I'm

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.770 
which is right behind me okay so I'm
going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.700> make<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.940> comparisons<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
going to make the comparisons of the

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.500 
going to make the comparisons of the
difference<00:00:22.080> between<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:23.130> Schwinns<00:00:23.490> here

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
difference between the Schwinns here

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.780 
difference between the Schwinns here
but<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.870> is<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.140> Schwinn<00:00:25.410> Varsity<00:00:25.790> 1200

the<00:00:46.800> brakes<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.309> I'm<00:00:47.999> not<00:00:48.179> sure<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.420> kind<00:00:48.510> of

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the brakes are I'm not sure what kind of

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.119 
the brakes are I'm not sure what kind of
brakes<00:00:48.839> they're<00:00:49.019> they're<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.289> Shimano

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
brakes they're they're all Shimano

brakes they're they're all Shimano
components<00:00:50.429> really<00:00:51.420> says<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.140> tech<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.559> here

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
components really says our tech on here

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.720 
components really says our tech on here
but<00:00:54.350> anyhow<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.589> is<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> difference<00:00:56.280> between

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
but anyhow there is a difference between

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.719 
but anyhow there is a difference between
this<00:00:57.510> bike<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.309> the<00:01:00.170> focus<00:01:01.170> over<00:01:01.409> here<00:01:01.699> okay

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
this bike and the focus over here okay

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.650 
this bike and the focus over here okay
and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.329> differences<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:04.880> the<00:01:05.880> shifters<00:01:06.360> at

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
and the differences are the shifters at

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.470 
and the differences are the shifters at
the<00:01:06.780> top<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.460> these<00:01:08.460> shifters<00:01:08.910> here<00:01:09.240> are

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
the top here these shifters here are

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.980 
the top here these shifters here are
flat<00:01:11.300> shifters<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:12.390> don't<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> name<00:01:12.960> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
flat shifters I don't know the name of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.360 
flat shifters I don't know the name of
them<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.410> know<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.680> some<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.980> you<00:01:14.040> guys<00:01:14.130> like

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
them I know you some of you guys like

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.560 
them I know you some of you guys like
yeah<00:01:14.550> I<00:01:14.580> know<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> name<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.120> those<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.360> anyhow

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
yeah I know the name of those but anyhow

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600 
yeah I know the name of those but anyhow
I<00:01:15.750> don't<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.320> haven't<00:01:17.250> seen<00:01:17.370> this<00:01:17.460> particular

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
I don't I haven't seen this particular

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.900 
I don't I haven't seen this particular
shifter<00:01:18.270> before<00:01:18.980> but<00:01:19.980> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.370> how<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.520> shift

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
shifter before but this is how you shift

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.780 
shifter before but this is how you shift
it<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:22.790> shift<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.530> up<00:01:25.530> shift<00:01:25.950> here

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.890 

resistance<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.150> highest<00:01:30.450> level<00:01:30.660> resistance

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
resistance the highest level resistance

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.770 
resistance the highest level resistance
is<00:01:31.260> number<00:01:31.530> 3<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.890> downshift<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.780> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
is number 3 here and to downshift it to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.610 
is number 3 here and to downshift it to
an<00:01:36.990> easier<00:01:37.470> resistance<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.670> top<00:01:39.260> so<00:01:40.260> and

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
an easier resistance is this top so and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.790 
an easier resistance is this top so and
the<00:01:41.370> handles<00:01:41.760> are<00:01:41.850> flat<00:01:42.260> so<00:01:43.260> let's<00:01:43.440> go<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
the handles are flat so let's go to the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.510 
the handles are flat so let's go to the
focus<00:01:44.160> take<00:01:44.400> a<00:01:44.430> look<00:01:44.580> at<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.730> focus<00:01:46.430> see<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
focus take a look at the focus see the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.050 
focus take a look at the focus see the
difference

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
difference

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.920 
difference
thumb<00:01:48.600> shifters<00:01:49.110> right<00:01:49.440> here<00:01:50.300> up<00:01:51.300> down

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
thumb shifters right here up down

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.300 
thumb shifters right here up down
resistance<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:54.290> then<00:01:55.290> your<00:01:55.470> handlebars<00:01:55.950> are

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
resistance and then your handlebars are

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.480 
resistance and then your handlebars are
drop<00:01:56.880> handlebars<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.800> your<00:01:58.890> brakes<00:01:59.160> are<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
drop handlebars so your brakes are in a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.980 
drop handlebars so your brakes are in a
different<00:01:59.820> position<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.360> your<00:02:00.510> brakes<00:02:00.810> or

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
different position to your brakes or

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.590 
different position to your brakes or
hanging<00:02:01.320> downward<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:03.770> opposed<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.920> being

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
hanging downward as opposed to being

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.709 
hanging downward as opposed to being
horizontal<00:02:06.600> brakes<00:02:08.209> okay<00:02:09.209> now<00:02:09.359> looking<00:02:09.629> at

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:09.719 
horizontal brakes okay now looking at

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:13.760 
horizontal brakes okay now looking at
the<00:02:09.810> actual<00:02:10.229> brakes<00:02:10.969> here

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the actual brakes here

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.170 
the actual brakes here
see<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.860> brakes<00:02:17.489> kind<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.970> little

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
see the brakes kind of it's a little

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.000 
see the brakes kind of it's a little
wide<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.500> if<00:02:20.590> you're<00:02:20.709> looking<00:02:20.800> at

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
wide so if you're looking at

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.120 
wide so if you're looking at
aerodynamics<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:22.060> might<00:02:23.020> be<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.560> little<00:02:23.890> wide

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
aerodynamics that might be a little wide

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.410 
aerodynamics that might be a little wide
for<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.550> always<00:02:24.670> change<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.120> brake

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
for you can always change out your brake

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.660 
for you can always change out your brake
components<00:02:25.620> your<00:02:26.620> tires<00:02:26.920> your<00:02:27.220> handlebars

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
components your tires your handlebars

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.370 
components your tires your handlebars
you<00:02:27.819> can<00:02:27.910> always<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.239> but<00:02:29.080> here's<00:02:29.319> a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
you can always do that but here's a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.940 
you can always do that but here's a
comparison<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:30.160> brake<00:02:30.510> size<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.560> focus

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
comparison the brake size to the focus

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.500 
comparison the brake size to the focus
you<00:02:33.100> see<00:02:33.280> how<00:02:33.340> much<00:02:33.520> smaller<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.940> focus<00:02:34.150> is

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
you see how much smaller the focus is

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.550 
you see how much smaller the focus is
it's<00:02:34.720> tight<00:02:36.360> which<00:02:37.360> makes<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:38.110> little<00:02:38.350> bit

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
it's tight which makes for a little bit

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.229 
it's tight which makes for a little bit
faster<00:02:39.010> bike<00:02:39.250> because<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.000> aerodynamics

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
faster bike because of the aerodynamics

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.940 
faster bike because of the aerodynamics
of<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.050> brakes<00:02:41.319> being<00:02:41.620> thinner<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.950> but

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
of the brakes being thinner so but

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.590 
of the brakes being thinner so but
comparing<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.640> wise<00:02:45.819> everything<00:02:46.209> else

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
comparing it wise everything else

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.059 
comparing it wise everything else
everything<00:02:47.019> else<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> same<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.890> bike

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
everything else is the same the bike

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.309 
everything else is the same the bike
ride<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.640> same<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.540> actual<00:02:49.870> stopping

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
ride is the same the actual stopping

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.490 
ride is the same the actual stopping
power<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.709> brakes<00:02:50.980> are<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.310> same<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
power of the brakes are the same the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.309 
power of the brakes are the same the
seat<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.069> same<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.959> good<00:02:56.140> quality

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
seat is the same it's a good quality

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.270 
seat is the same it's a good quality
seat<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.630> solid<00:02:59.140> feeling<00:02:59.410> bike<00:02:59.769> it's<00:03:00.010> just

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
seat it's a solid feeling bike it's just

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.830 
seat it's a solid feeling bike it's just
that<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.760> handlebars<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.360> brakes<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
that the handlebars and the brakes the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.309 
that the handlebars and the brakes the
only<00:03:02.019> big<00:03:02.170> difference<00:03:02.500> between<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.890> two<00:03:03.069> so

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
only big difference between the two so

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.570 
only big difference between the two so
chain<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.739> same<00:03:05.950> everything's<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.549> same

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
chain is the same everything's the same

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.330 
chain is the same everything's the same
it's<00:03:06.970> really<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.420> same<00:03:07.600> components<00:03:08.290> -<00:03:09.190> those

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
it's really the same components - those

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.430 
it's really the same components - those
handlebars<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.090> then<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.690> brakes<00:03:10.959> being<00:03:11.319> a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
handlebars and then the brakes being a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.770 
handlebars and then the brakes being a
little<00:03:11.680> wider<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:13.209> really<00:03:13.390> depends<00:03:13.690> on

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
little wider so it really depends on

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.580 
little wider so it really depends on
what<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.019> want<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.200> do<00:03:14.319> if<00:03:14.470> you're<00:03:14.560> looking
