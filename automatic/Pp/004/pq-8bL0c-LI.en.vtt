00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.669
 One day, Lars Christiansen was seriously ill 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.089
 that she does not even get out of her 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:15.009
 only the clock does not vary as the goals vary 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.009
 funded vote 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.320
 why can we see each other? 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.390
 Bochum - Borussia Dortmund has with 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.130
 to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490
 I'm back very well 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.680
 trading can not have everything elections you have to have over the county area 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.340
 cutscenes 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.640
 and then starts for us 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.900
 Instead, the affected should be the best at first 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.850
 accordingly, the rents 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.350
 Carefully dry "stand at the snow line 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.549
 can play on the built up good handball 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.660
 Klose shot then stopped 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.010
 Aral had once again pushed his limits together and Schumacher 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 I have already driven a fallen tree 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 from Michael we 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.690
 this required 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.480
 Fla 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.940
 we need the MEDIUS 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.209
 slowly 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.519
 I will be back soon 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:17.549
 No in a year Nanu in India the liberals 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.839
 TTT is 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.489
 I thought I las 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.559
 4 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.129
 But I think some Niemann higher revenue from more 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.780
 and after all acted like 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.379
 first go 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.219
 we have 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.519
 after the Irish have 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.519
 after about a year he is not Minden 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.559
 I am that he 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.119
 and I came here to get medicine for my parents 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.729
 Jose Sharks does not claim 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.370
 my honey medicine picture an elegantly styled quick help 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.739
 should partner Brown Bear and leave a leaf firmly in with the medicine around 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.909
 the throat 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.599
 it is difficult 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.599
 Bruni will go with her and help her cards 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.999
 and so did the surprise team 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 the city disappear 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.369
 practice with the module 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.269
 this shows 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.219
 What do you mean 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.229
 it finally comes 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.399
 he is only some time the CENIT 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:48.539
 that does not matter that's 1 you had to lick because instead of wearing it 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:52.410
 and for the first time in his life, Brownlee was frustrated 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.269
 a 1 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.229
 this is likely 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.849
 We have to have something like this with heuristic things 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.989
 it would be sad 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.999
 freshly fortified, rarer Sundermann made on the last days 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.999
 have to 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.469
 No 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.889
 with in the team 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.240
 with the next 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.340
 Oliver h 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.340
 I have to make it to the club 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.560
 In late trading the company would be weaker to say goodbye 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.400
 promised each other 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.400
 this is exciting 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.649
 Bund country town and sensory LTM clock was able to return to the snow 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.699
 because we want to change that 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.669
 the songs are going to have
