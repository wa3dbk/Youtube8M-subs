00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.469
 you always have this ipad video 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.469
 I wish I have 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.619
 but I want to lose in the bag 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.020
 had not 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.630
 I believe that many people have that 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.099
 and that's what's up front that's it 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.740
 you can also have nice ones here 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.770
 here his phone or bag like that 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.010
 stick that one here pen 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.809
 notepad gets that is 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.100
 We quickly give the age 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.230
 Do it now if so 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.309
 is expensive if you buy it and it is 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.280
 not too difficult what of the 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.260
 explanation here twice the part so 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.940
 on the one hand a front side back 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.100
 and inside front side back 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.879
 logically and then once the bag 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.440
 So two bags I have it now 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.940
 ever prepared a page 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.949
 I flow with birds three 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.400
 theoretically you can also do two pages 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.189
 would flow with volume 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.799
 this page where that is then open 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.369
 now sewn at the beginning and although here of 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.290
 tweak to tweak that it stated in the year 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.240
 if you want you can now too 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.520
 already your bend here with 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.420
 Armies or the late accept both 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.659
 variants possible 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.009
 you do that once for the front page 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.869
 and once for the back we then 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.020
 Now we have this patch 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.630
 front pockets 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.020
 not as good as the good ones 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.039
 so go I have the bag right 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.170
 Sewn right and folds apart 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.270
 and then i have the scar here 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.429
 ironed out and once staked the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.030
 bag means to you 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.530
 then I would put it in here once 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.499
 break it here on my front part 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.189
 So talk to this part 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:03.100
 works that is forward is here only 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.450
 on the front against logically 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.460
 weismain temple break i'm leaving now 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.899
 I'm down with a seam now 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.569
 I can also different you 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.230
 Departments do whatever it takes 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.130
 I'm stuck now now this approaching 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.650
 and then it will also 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.180
 the ipad bag actually already 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.260
 I can do that in one 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.770
 step of a sewing machine show in the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.520
 Theory is so that I am now the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.400
 outside on the outside put it 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.580
 since on the inside for the purpose 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.780
 is really up to the seam and cheer 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.180
 so to speak, once the page and once 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.520
 the side and vice turns my 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.130
 walls opening free oh yes I have to 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.690
 Himself declared at the land opening 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.140
 that I am free and best of course 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.930
 here on the inside and then 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.950
 The whole thing and training are disturbed 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.410
 on the other side 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.150
 and if I'm not here with one now 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.310
 Velcro work or with printing 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.990
 I have to do that before now 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.010
 an ebook is everything again 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.240
 described what must be and that is 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.800
 even the principle 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.610
 these bags is not even that way 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.610
 hard so i have to aim the front once 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.880
 stitched seams and curtains of the theory shown 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.970
 I have more here from now on 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.000
 now off so front page 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:36.850
 Front can I now still 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.850
 already stuck and the market further 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.689
 short, that all sets volume 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.719
 I have a little shorter flow 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:53.329
 Tailored helps and does too 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:56.030
 no thick down should be so 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:01.129
 nice around the round 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.629
 also square cut the volume 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:10.129
 stopped there you really have to 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:13.329
 Push bit makes it easy to 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.329
 up to the other side 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.070
 now the other side is sewn like 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.949
 it will have shown you to them 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.560
 and is yes then just slipped pure 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.199
 that is the sleep and so pack the 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.840
 inside take that off here now 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.150
 Music leave the walls opening for 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.280
 overthrow the whole and then comes the 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.320
 inside pocket in here and then the 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.530
 Ding already done that's really 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.449
 a very simple story like that 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.180
 Now we have the other side here 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.630
 also sewn now shorten this whole 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.030
 Open iPad bag through these countries 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.320
 the smaller the walls opening the more 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.000
 but less music does make a difference 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.070
 Of course with flats flows the more 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.580
 trickier it is here through the whole 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.580
 to get 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.820
 so and now I have here, so to speak 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.680
 My walls are opening in the same way 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:33.169
 feed I push in here now 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.070
 and then something like that will happen 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.530
 a bag of trance 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.400
 iron out everything clean and can 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.080
 if necessary, quilt at the bottom 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.800
 so i may here my lap times 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.840
 earlier so slow and a bag of it 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.730
 then I have mine here too 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.020
 Sleep then I 'm doing mine here 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.460
 press buttons resp 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.960
 I have attached it here before 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.880
 describe the ebook now mine 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.280
 second story on it or make 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.190
 button can also make it in the buttonhole 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.350
 and sew it on or tie up 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.290
 so it is important if the opening in the 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.620
 inside pocket and then have fun after 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.620
 to take
