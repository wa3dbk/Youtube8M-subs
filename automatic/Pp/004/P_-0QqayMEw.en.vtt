00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.880
 well first very happy to do with 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.210
 You kind regards and if 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.690
 taking advantage of the holidays a little bit to 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.240
 enjoy with the family 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.769
 take a little bit of sun too and 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 no good 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.020
 feeling feels like it has been a stone 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 a very good experience the first 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.689
 six months have been good and thanks to 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.689
 god I had the most matches 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.009
 to grow as a person 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.760
 before starting with more as sports 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:42.000
 we were seeing in that you too 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.670
 as it raised like the looks because 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.739
 many this television did 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.239
 interviews already made him a small 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 story about who was christopher 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.210
 and I imagine that a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.390
 Costa Rican in his s always calls the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.390
 Attention 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.490
 and when I started playing 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.460
 the media looked pretty interested in 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.370
 work and 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.860
 they spent several days 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.920
 to see a little more about costa rica and 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.330
 about people then out there singles 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.610
 I'm in a 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.310
 in the pages of a newspaper and some 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.310
 nice constant interviews 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.690
 It has been special 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 of the personal 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.909
 and to show a little bit also and 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.619
 take out the name of view see as that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.210
 Costa Ricans are booming already 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.720
 in Sweden like football 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.190
 Costa Rican high level seen in jane 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.750
 sweden because they are going to be also us 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.100
 I was commenting that being here is the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.600
 mcdonald and that is not so bad anymore they are not 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.050
 the players that are more referents of the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.050
 soccer of ya 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.190
 the constant license and then it has 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.790
 liked there in Swedish football and 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.510
 jonathan who is a great player very 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.390
 admired and speak also defender who 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:06.940
 is a great reference where he plays and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.000
 good of all in reality that with all 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.090
 the teams talk very well about him and it's 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.170
 nice to know that we know guys and that 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 we started few then 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.870
 what are the qualities that the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.280
 Costa Rican footballer to be 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.320
 also adapt to Swedish football 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.060
 because we have seen that in football 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.680
 Turkey is not also because good 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.420
 we see now that there are not elongated 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.910
 has a lot of participation and randall 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.350
 azofeifa in other teams do not have 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.209
 a lot of participation elsewhere 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.790
 Europe but in Swedish football they are 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.050
 you very regular you mcdonald and 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.050
 up to the same sensors 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.650
 in football the thing 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.550
 to the Swedes 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.890
 do not feel that maybe 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.420
 He likes the way you play 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.410
 Well, it's like being happy when it comes to playing 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.090
 there 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.660
 football is very fast and strong 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.660
 so 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.130
 when 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.770
 deliver everything on the court and I've 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.710
 strived to them 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.640
 they leave their admiration saying that of 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.640
 sanction them 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.320
 the speed of the speed they have 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.370
 the Costa Rican soccer players 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.660
 then it is what most calls you the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.530
 attention to those of the gaps to the fight 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.510
 and the delivery that 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.020
 on the court because there is the point being 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.690
 the quick I think I do not ask 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.640
 that here in fact before training 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.010
 during the matches are being played 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.900
 the courts for the same to make a 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.140
 position of faster and with less pauses 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.190
 but if they really like the sacrifice, 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.780
 deliver 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.320
 I really like the technique also of 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.320
 tico player
