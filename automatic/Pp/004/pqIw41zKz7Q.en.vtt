 it's finally the 12th of 20 euros at the top 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.440
 of his selection you will put the number 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.049
 of isbn lightning bolani were 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.549
 non-starters a few days ago but 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.170
 it's because of the terrain that's it 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.220
 no later than last Wednesday in 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.240
 the big handicap of the sleeve have 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.369
 because of heavy rains 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.450
 the ground had become deep him 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.830
 it's a specialist of good soil 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.250
 why was declared 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.110
 flat rate 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 he finds the sand on this occasion 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.259
 he has already done well on this surface in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.630
 imposing itself especially on the psf of 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.009
 whipped it turns around the pot the it 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.880
 has aligned the good rankings since the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.470
 beginning of the year in the big handicaps 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.390
 he inherited a good string number they 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.590
 are taken away with maxime guyon should 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.930
 logically play a very good role there has 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 priori it's a good base game a 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.200
 other base of the game is the number 9 jo 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.939
 you go there you're giovanni sterns followers of the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.630
 psf he is a great specialist of 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.430
 sand for him there is a point 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200
 of questioning it's the distance he has 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.060
 never been seen beyond 2000 meters there 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.799
 will therefore approach the 2500 meters for the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 first time last year then place 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.290
 he makes his return took of 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.149
 good 4th place in the event that can 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.899
 serve as a reference on August 4 last 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.270
 Bishop's Bridge Award 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.579
 he is lengthened if he adapts to this 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.110
 distance this very good finisher seems 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.299
 also able to play a whole 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.219
 first role in third position 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.020
 selection you placed the number 8 mr 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.270
 smart I imagine that the shape of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.960
 boarders of nicolas bullshit you have 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.640
 a website 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.200
 so cantons I know over years 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.849
 nicolas coloris that presents for less 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.619
 of 5 of its residents in this quinté 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.940
 and this smart mr had been acquired at 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.740
 claim in June for his debut 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.820
 for his new entourage is there 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.020
 ac de claude bodin he took good 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.790
 fifth place in the quinté reference 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.050
 the lengthening of the distance does not 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.540
 should not disturb him at all 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.100
 opposite and he seems able to him 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
 also to interfere in the good 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.310
 combination last he finished 5th 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.080
 he may be able to do a little better 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.910
 this time we were talking about coaches 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.990
 shape with Nicolas colors and there the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.010
 green rate sensor that's 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.720
 France training will have 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.230
 also very fit this summer on the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.760
 Normandy coast 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.810
 yes he did a very good meeting in 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.660
 winning the big handicap 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.550
 from deauville with 14 and twists such 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.020
 strike is a model of constancy it is 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.280
 has references on the turf but 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.420
 also on the sand last 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.370
 he returned to victory 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.440
 it was certainly at the lower level in 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.790
 claim them but his form is sure he 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.870
 has a regular chance for the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.010
 victory his room for maneuver is 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.810
 rather small but I think he 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.670
 should again play a good role the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.320
 aimed at beautiful fifth place 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.880
 position the special it's this is 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.640
 other than the title holder mr this 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.440
 year 63 kg a lot of gold weight a year 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.480
 past he won so this quinté he 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.590
 was worth 36 since its value a 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.450
 been significantly revised upward is 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.580
 now in 43 but he stays on a 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.870
 third encouraging place for the 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.310
 victory too it will not be 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.600
 obviously obvious but watch out for him 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.950
 it is a great specialist sand it 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.270
 transcends this kind of area 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.470
 as you said the addict to 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.210
 the training great shape that of 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.000
 nicolas collery and I think it takes 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.380
 not to ban it far from there I see it 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.640
 well take a nice place so much 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.070
 he gets on well with antoine hamelin 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.820
 that the noises are rather favorable 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.620
 during his last morning exercises 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.030
 in our land minute j bowman had 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.100
 on the phone etienne landers who 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.740
 5 March this number and if the 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.150
 listen right now the horse comes 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.160
 to make a victorious comeback 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.880
 after a long absence 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.420
 is what he should have mounted 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.580
 this course 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:56.880
 yeah the first race but he 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:03.990
 had some work behind him he's 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.880
 really too good and therefore the 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.520
 handicapper accredit it a value of 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:17.840
 38 you think it's competitive to 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:20.449
 this value there must be run in progress 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.739
 this is one of mine I had to 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.030
 you enjoy his form because 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:30.260
 it is a horse remained fragile and 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.580
 salon styled only on the rarest and 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.800
 this race without you will give the time 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.800
 for the continuation of the program in combat goes 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.699
 good florian march and 10 won for his 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.320
 victorious return you did not place 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.910
 in eighteen horses no it's a 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.320
 needed to make choices needed in 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.370
 keep eight he certainly won for his 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.660
 to return to the sands of olonne but it was 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.930
 a test reserved for thomann people 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.340
 rider there the lot seems superior in 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.990
 value 38 his room to maneuver me 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.669
 seems rather reduced even though there he is 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.060
 in form as evidenced by his return 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.250
 victorious 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.530
 I think his margin is reduced I the 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.400
 see more finished 5/6 than fight 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.850
 actively for the very first 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.030
 seats 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.950
 perfect flourish we will not miss the 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.510
 chocolate from the last day of 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.010
 deauville meeting it will be in the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.180
 fourth the price of meautry the de 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.400
 gammarth a resident of henri-alex 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.780
 pantall that confirmed in soft ground 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.820
 he had finished second in this group 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.080
 iii last year last in the 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.090
 price of mauritius gheest he was attacking 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.380
 in strong part it falls back significantly 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.729
 of category I think he should 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.780
 to play a very first role he deserves 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.190
 in any case to reconnect with the 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.770
 victory on 402 gammarth 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.479
 thank you very much, thank you all for 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.930
 following us during this meeting 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.639
 deauville 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.430
 we will now find ourselves on 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.770
 Parisian racetracks we leave with 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.270
 selection and recommends good game 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.270
 game to all and good end of meeting
