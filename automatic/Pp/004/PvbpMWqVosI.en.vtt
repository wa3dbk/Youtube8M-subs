00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
today we're making a teleportation

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:06.710 
today we're making a teleportation
chamber

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.679 

the<00:01:07.720> first<00:01:08.020> step<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.619> to<00:01:09.159> take<00:01:09.340> your<00:01:09.689> poster

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
the first step is to take your poster

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.620 
the first step is to take your poster
your<00:01:11.049> foam-core<00:01:11.500> poster<00:01:11.950> board<00:01:12.189> and<00:01:12.540> cut<00:01:13.540> it

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
your foam-core poster board and cut it

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.109 
your foam-core poster board and cut it
evenly<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.590> can<00:01:14.909> tape<00:01:15.909> them

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
evenly so that you can tape them

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.929 
evenly so that you can tape them
together<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.630> stack<00:01:17.200> them<00:01:17.590> now<00:01:18.520> when<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.729> did

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
together and stack them now when I did

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.779 
together and stack them now when I did
my<00:01:19.119> tower<00:01:19.420> I<00:01:19.630> sack<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.320> just<00:01:20.649> just<00:01:21.280> above<00:01:21.549> my

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
my tower I sack it just just above my

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.460 
my tower I sack it just just above my
head<00:01:21.939> maybe<00:01:22.149> about<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.450> half<00:01:22.539> a<00:01:22.689> foot<00:01:22.840> above<00:01:23.110> my

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
head maybe about a half a foot above my

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.850 
head maybe about a half a foot above my
head<00:01:24.149> then<00:01:25.149> take<00:01:25.990> them<00:01:26.140> all<00:01:26.320> together<00:01:26.500> make

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
head then take them all together make

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.669 
head then take them all together make
sure<00:01:26.890> they're<00:01:27.189> really<00:01:27.490> nice<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.060> secure<00:01:28.679> we

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
sure they're really nice and secure we

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.800 
sure they're really nice and secure we
don't<00:01:29.860> want<00:01:30.009> them<00:01:30.100> like<00:01:30.250> wobbly<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.479> all<00:01:31.600> that

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
don't want them like wobbly and all that

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.399 
don't want them like wobbly and all that
so<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:33.220> next<00:01:33.399> step<00:01:33.670> would<00:01:33.789> be<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.000> take<00:01:34.409> medium

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
so the next step would be to take medium

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.210 
so the next step would be to take medium
thickness<00:01:35.770> cardboard<00:01:36.640> strips<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.860> hot<00:01:38.860> glue

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.320 
thickness cardboard strips and hot glue
them<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.789> where<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.299> duct<00:01:40.539> tape<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:45.330> then

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.649
