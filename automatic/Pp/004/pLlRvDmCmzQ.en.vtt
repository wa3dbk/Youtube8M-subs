 and make a totally different game 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.360
 although it was the first day also 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.130
 because all the parties are different 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.380

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.970
 important very the intention that we have

 of the idea of ​​the program 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.220
 of trying to be as balanced as 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.620
 in defense and attack but you have to 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.870
 rescue that is something that we have a 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.329
 difficult game now also comes a 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.030
 gift in favor of a lot of hierarchy to play 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.680
 of respect but we do our 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.239
 work we have the players with 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.980
 hierarchy to like soccer what 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.960

 the way we are working 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.680
 and 0 today keep me in mind of 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.120

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.940
 a pride is a big responsibility 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.760
 which I have already had and of carrier 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.880
 tighten in other clubs then it 's something 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.920
 that really fills me with pride 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.320
 full to continue working each 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.260
