00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
of shadow 2 it's important that we have

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.570 
of shadow 2 it's important that we have
the<00:01:30.110> quality<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.890> music<00:01:31.009> but<00:01:31.310> we<00:01:31.429> also

the quality of the music but we also

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.620 
the quality of the music but we also
have<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.000> kind<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.420> huge<00:01:33.520> expressive<00:01:34.630> themes

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
have this kind of huge expressive themes

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.080 
have this kind of huge expressive themes
that<00:01:36.079> players<00:01:36.350> can<00:01:36.530> really<00:01:36.860> attached<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.340> that

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
that players can really attached to that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.550 
that players can really attached to that
they<00:01:38.270> associate<00:01:38.780> with<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.079> world<00:01:39.289> and<00:01:39.439> with

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
they associate with the world and with

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.930 
they associate with the world and with
the<00:01:39.649> character

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.850 

so<00:01:44.940> what<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.690> often<00:01:46.080> send<00:01:46.320> Oscar

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
so what we do is we often send Oscar

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.830 
so what we do is we often send Oscar
storyboards<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.970> send<00:01:48.210> Oscar<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.660> game

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
storyboards we send Oscar the game

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.040 
storyboards we send Oscar the game
itself<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.470> send<00:01:49.710> him<00:01:49.800> cutscenes<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:51.720> sent<00:01:51.960> him

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
itself we send him cutscenes we sent him

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.630 
itself we send him cutscenes we sent him
sequences<00:01:52.650> whole<00:01:52.830> sequence<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.490> him<00:01:53.580> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
sequences whole sequence is for him to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.970 
sequences whole sequence is for him to
score<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.840> work<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.050> closely<00:01:55.260> with<00:01:55.590> him<00:01:55.860> we

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
score we work very closely with him we

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.040 
score we work very closely with him we
think<00:01:56.220> it's<00:01:56.370> very<00:01:56.520> important<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.090> has<00:01:57.390> total

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
think it's very important that has total

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.530 
think it's very important that has total
access<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.560> game<00:01:58.880> without<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.300> don't

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
access to the game without it I don't

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020 
access to the game without it I don't
think<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> composer<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.850> to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
think of a composer can really get to

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.280 
think of a composer can really get to
the<00:02:03.060> heart<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.230> soul<00:02:04.440> of<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.800> game<00:02:04.980> I
