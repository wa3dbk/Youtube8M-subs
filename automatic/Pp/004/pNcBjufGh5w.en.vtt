they<00:01:10.110> actually<00:01:10.850> make<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.060> pretty<00:01:12.450> brainless

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
they actually make it pretty brainless

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.830

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
because normally they would be fairly

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.789 
because normally they would be fairly

you know that it's ready and it was that

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.090 
you know that it's ready and it was that
simple<00:04:49.090> almost<00:04:50.090> like<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.360> did<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:50.630> by<00:04:50.780> itself

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
simple almost like it did it by itself

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.210 
simple almost like it did it by itself
really<00:04:52.100> easy<00:04:52.250> so<00:04:52.550> that's<00:04:53.330> how<00:04:53.480> that<00:04:53.540> works<00:04:54.220> as

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
really easy so that's how that works as

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.890 
really easy so that's how that works as
you<00:04:55.700> go<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:55.880> in<00:04:56.030> levels<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.540> get<00:04:56.690> higher

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
you go up in levels you get higher

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.430 
you go up in levels you get higher
chains<00:04:58.330> this<00:04:59.330> really<00:04:59.750> applies<00:05:00.110> for<00:05:02.440> assassins

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
chains this really applies for assassins

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.960 
chains this really applies for assassins
who<00:05:03.560> have<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.770> lot<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.040> different<00:05:04.400> chain<00:05:04.610> skills

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
who have a lot of different chain skills

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.830 
who have a lot of different chain skills
and<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:06.830> think<00:05:07.130> Sorcerer's<00:05:08.120> also<00:05:08.450> have<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.630> lot

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
and I think Sorcerer's also have a lot

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.310 
and I think Sorcerer's also have a lot
of<00:05:08.870> different<00:05:09.170> chain<00:05:09.350> skills<00:05:09.940> so<00:05:11.170> those<00:05:12.170> are

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
of different chain skills so those are

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.190 
of different chain skills so those are
the<00:05:12.380> two<00:05:12.470> classes<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:13.250> you'll<00:05:13.370> want<00:05:13.550> to

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
the two classes that you'll want to

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.330 
the two classes that you'll want to
really<00:05:15.200> pay<00:05:15.410> attention<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:16.040> when<00:05:16.220> you're

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
really pay attention to when you're

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.290 
really pay attention to when you're
fighting<00:05:16.550> because<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:17.000> have<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.150> lot<00:05:17.270> of

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
fighting because you have a lot of

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.510 
fighting because you have a lot of
different<00:05:17.600> options<00:05:17.960> at<00:05:18.080> your<00:05:18.200> disposal

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
different options at your disposal

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.590 
different options at your disposal
other<00:05:20.520> than<00:05:20.699> that<00:05:20.789> I'll<00:05:21.000> go<00:05:21.150> ahead<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.360> get
