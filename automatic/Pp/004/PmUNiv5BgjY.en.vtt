00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.770
 yet all schools not only French-speaking Switzerland the question is 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.940
 currently and debated whether to support back do make 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 knowledge of acquired yet healthy 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.660
 tragically gone 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.310
 or whether to try to reach the children's development a 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.200
 ideal development flourishing 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.030
 and in fact it is a debate that is the most terrible we exhaust ourselves 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.260
 the ball 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
 all pedagogues for children 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.910
 but we know that the purpose of the school is to transmit 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.910
 knowledge 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.180
 every night such a virtual machine units 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.150
 there was a lot of value doing things in fact things for the 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.420
 pleasure to do them 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.270
 we learned for the pleasure of learning for the pleasure of meeting each other for the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 pleasure to make modeling make theater right now 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760
 good dynamic 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.850
 they want reassuring who can through the materials that this is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.670
 true that it works 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 for marc mark I did a school 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.390
 For victory 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480
 I am very happy 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.600
 in Paris 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.640
 according to the insee the rise 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.470
 practice means 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 with psg 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.159
 this time 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.459
 while the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.619
