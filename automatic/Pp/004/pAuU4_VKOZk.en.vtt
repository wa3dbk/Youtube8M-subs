00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.960 
forward and then kick it out
so<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.060> should<00:01:50.240> just<00:01:50.390> go<00:01:50.750> oh<00:01:51.730> my<00:01:52.730> bad

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
so then you should just go oh my bad

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.880 
so then you should just go oh my bad
like<00:01:53.540> that<00:01:55.000> something<00:01:56.020> until<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.050> get<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:57.410> and

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
like that something until you get it and

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.520 
like that something until you get it and
then<00:01:58.100> once<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.370> get<00:01:58.520> those<00:01:58.670> like<00:01:59.110> just<00:02:00.110> try

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
then once you get those like just try

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.680 
then once you get those like just try
them<00:02:00.980> I<00:02:01.250> guess<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.700> learned<00:02:02.330> them<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:02.570> my

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
them I guess I learned them with my

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.120 
them I guess I learned them with my
Forks<00:02:02.930> backwards<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:03.470> then<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.650> realized<00:02:04.010> it

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
Forks backwards but then I realized it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.030 
Forks backwards but then I realized it
was<00:02:04.160> super<00:02:04.460> cheap<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.630> then<00:02:05.810> turn<00:02:06.650> it<00:02:06.680> forward

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
was super cheap so then turn it forward

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.680 
was super cheap so then turn it forward
I<00:02:07.340> guess<00:02:07.790> it's<00:02:07.970> trying<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.210> learn<00:02:08.330> with<00:02:08.510> your

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
I guess it's trying to learn with your

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.810 
I guess it's trying to learn with your
horse<00:02:09.649> backwards<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.430> don't<00:02:10.580> get<00:02:10.640> too<00:02:10.700> used

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
horse backwards but don't get too used

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.080 
horse backwards but don't get too used
to<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.180> turn<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.050> forwards<00:02:12.350> after<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.800> while

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
to it turn it forwards after in a while

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.460 
to it turn it forwards after in a while
but<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.270> ride<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> hundred<00:02:14.780> millimeter<00:02:15.200> wheels

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
but I ride a hundred millimeter wheels

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.990 
but I ride a hundred millimeter wheels
it<00:02:15.590> probably<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:15.920> really<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.340> lot<00:02:16.520> easier<00:02:16.760> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
it probably is really a lot easier to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.570 
it probably is really a lot easier to
ride<00:02:17.240> one<00:02:17.390> times<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:19.400> probably

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
ride one times but it's probably

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.110 
ride one times but it's probably
personal<00:02:19.940> preference<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:22.010> yeah<00:02:22.280> that's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
personal preference so yeah that's

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.370 
personal preference so yeah that's
pretty<00:02:23.300> much<00:02:23.540> how<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.690> put<00:02:23.900> un<00:02:24.020> whip<00:02:24.200> if<00:02:24.320> you

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
pretty much how to put un whip if you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.470 
pretty much how to put un whip if you
have<00:02:24.500> any<00:02:24.590> questions<00:02:24.950> comment<00:02:25.730> below<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.210> just
