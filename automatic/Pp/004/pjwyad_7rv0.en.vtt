and<00:04:34.430> this<00:04:34.550> is<00:04:34.699> like<00:04:34.940> considered<00:04:35.870> to<00:04:35.990> be<00:04:36.080> really

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
and this is like considered to be really

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.890 
and this is like considered to be really
racy<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.889> really<00:04:37.070> cool<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.270> kid<00:04:38.509> is<00:04:38.660> kind

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
racy and really cool so this kid is kind

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.439 
racy and really cool so this kid is kind
of<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.169> you<00:04:39.620> know<00:04:39.650> he's<00:04:39.860> 17<00:04:40.460> he<00:04:40.940> wants<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.300> look

of a you know he's 17 he wants to look

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.749 
of a you know he's 17 he wants to look
cool<00:04:41.509> he<00:04:41.930> wants<00:04:42.139> to<00:04:42.229> go<00:04:42.350> fast<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.250> he<00:04:43.340> wants<00:04:43.699> to

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
cool he wants to go fast and he wants to

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.909 
cool he wants to go fast and he wants to
have<00:04:43.850> style<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.509> I<00:04:44.750> think<00:04:45.050> everybody<00:04:45.620> puts

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
have style so I think everybody puts

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.680 
have style so I think everybody puts
their<00:04:46.160> own<00:04:46.610> little<00:04:46.820> touch<00:04:47.090> in<00:04:47.240> their<00:04:47.360> scooter

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
their own little touch in their scooter

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:57.159 
their own little touch in their scooter
for<00:04:48.259> sure<00:04:55.270> well<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.300> think<00:04:56.510> there's<00:04:56.780> two<00:04:56.840> train

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
for sure well I think there's two train

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.930 
for sure well I think there's two train
of<00:04:57.289> thoughts<00:04:57.470> one<00:04:58.070> is<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.340> doesn't<00:04:58.490> go<00:04:58.669> as<00:04:58.699> fast

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
of thoughts one is it doesn't go as fast

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.460 
of thoughts one is it doesn't go as fast
as<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.210> motorcycle<00:04:59.449> so<00:04:59.900> you'll<00:05:00.050> never<00:05:00.260> be

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
as a motorcycle so you'll never be

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.050 
as a motorcycle so you'll never be
traveling<00:05:01.070> as<00:05:01.220> fast<00:05:01.340> as<00:05:01.580> you<00:05:01.669> can<00:05:01.850> on<00:05:02.030> a

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
traveling as fast as you can on a

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.420 
traveling as fast as you can on a
motorcycle<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:03.500> could<00:05:03.680> think<00:05:03.949> if<00:05:04.220> you

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
motorcycle so you could think if you

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.219 
motorcycle so you could think if you
were<00:05:04.699> to<00:05:04.880> crash<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.510> wouldn't<00:05:05.780> be<00:05:05.870> going<00:05:05.990> as

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
were to crash you wouldn't be going as

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.260 
were to crash you wouldn't be going as
fast<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:07.070> on<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.250> other<00:05:07.340> hand<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.880> braking

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
fast but on the other hand the braking

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.469 
fast but on the other hand the braking
is<00:05:08.510> not<00:05:08.840> as<00:05:09.820> technologically<00:05:10.820> advanced<00:05:11.360> as

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
is not as technologically advanced as

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.270 
is not as technologically advanced as
nice<00:05:11.750> new<00:05:11.930> motorcycle<00:05:12.410> braking<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.039> if<00:05:13.160> the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
nice new motorcycle braking is so if the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.850 
nice new motorcycle braking is so if the
braking<00:05:13.550> is<00:05:13.610> not<00:05:13.789> as<00:05:13.880> good<00:05:14.030> so<00:05:14.590> two<00:05:15.590> trains

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
braking is not as good so two trains

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:25.390 
braking is not as good so two trains
have<00:05:15.979> thought<00:05:16.130> there<00:05:23.470> well<00:05:24.470> any<00:05:24.830> Vespa<00:05:25.280> as

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
have thought there well any Vespa as

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.439 
have thought there well any Vespa as
long<00:05:25.550> as<00:05:25.669> it's<00:05:25.820> in<00:05:25.880> good<00:05:26.030> shape<00:05:26.090> has<00:05:26.419> been

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
long as it's in good shape has been

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.469 
long as it's in good shape has been
taken<00:05:26.930> care<00:05:26.960> of<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.410> a<00:05:27.440> good<00:05:27.620> scooter<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:28.010> buy

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
taken care of is a good scooter to buy

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.200 
just outrageously expensive so we put on
a<00:06:28.680> boat<00:06:28.920> so<00:06:29.190> by<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.370> time<00:06:29.520> the<00:06:29.640> boat<00:06:29.880> gets<00:06:30.150> here

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
a boat so by the time the boat gets here

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.960 
a boat so by the time the boat gets here
gets<00:06:30.930> everything<00:06:31.170> you<00:06:31.470> know<00:06:31.560> so<00:06:31.830> takes<00:06:32.790> a

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
gets everything you know so takes a

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.610 
gets everything you know so takes a
while<00:06:33.120> to<00:06:35.060> fly<00:06:36.060> stuff<00:06:36.270> you'd<00:06:37.080> have<00:06:37.230> to<00:06:37.320> order

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
while to fly stuff you'd have to order

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.890 
while to fly stuff you'd have to order
so<00:06:38.010> much<00:06:38.190> stuff<00:06:38.460> in<00:06:38.940> order<00:06:39.180> to<00:06:39.300> make<00:06:39.420> the

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
so much stuff in order to make the

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.570 
so much stuff in order to make the
freight<00:06:40.260> because<00:06:40.950> it<00:06:41.040> would<00:06:41.160> be<00:06:41.280> here<00:06:41.490> and

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
freight because it would be here and

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.700 
freight because it would be here and
like<00:06:41.730> you<00:06:41.940> know<00:06:42.060> three<00:06:42.420> four<00:06:42.450> days<00:06:42.780> so<00:06:43.350> it's

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
like you know three four days so it's

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.190 
like you know three four days so it's
just<00:06:43.950> it's<00:06:44.910> like<00:06:45.030> three<00:06:45.510> times<00:06:45.750> the<00:06:45.960> amun<00:06:46.170> e

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
just it's like three times the amun e

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.710 
just it's like three times the amun e
that<00:06:46.530> it<00:06:46.620> is<00:06:46.770> -<00:06:46.980> we<00:06:47.850> usually<00:06:48.180> spend<00:06:48.330> all<00:06:48.540> of<00:06:48.570> our

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
that it is - we usually spend all of our

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.760 
that it is - we usually spend all of our
money<00:06:48.780> on<00:06:49.080> parts<00:06:49.380> so<00:06:49.440> we<00:06:49.530> don't<00:06:49.650> have

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
money on parts so we don't have

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.710 
money on parts so we don't have
something<00:06:50.100> left<00:06:50.310> over<00:06:50.730> to<00:06:51.270> spend<00:06:51.510> for

something left over to spend for

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.030 
something left over to spend for
