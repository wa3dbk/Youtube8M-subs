00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.530
 dead 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.920
 yes, when we founded the school in 1995 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.309
 we really wanted a school 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.660
 founding for all children for highly gifted 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.610
 for the severely disabled 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.860
 one can also say for the hard-talented 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.480
 and highly gifted there was the concept of 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.640
 Inclusion in the school landscape 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.260
 actually not yet in North Rhine 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.589
 Westphalia, however, had the common 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.780
 teaching was possible in all 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.940
 elementary schools and we did that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.119
 we have just taken children in the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.430
 first class very different 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.470
 Origin among other things also children 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.979
 with disability that just by the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.200
 various recording committees 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.300
 had gone and thus to children 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.960
 had been made with disabilities 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.679
 we wanted to try school life with 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.770
 all children and have the same 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:36.470
 a class started and then on 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.860
 led that class then twelfth 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.630
 became class and was dismissed and 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.030
 Many of the children in those days 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.299
 First class are loyal to us 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.240
 stayed until the last day of school and 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.619
 just have one we would say today 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.619
 including school visits 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.250
 Inclusion is now something in today 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.990
 Experts would say something new what 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.180
 to say what they are 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.140
 integrative school trials and 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.390
 educational attempts replaces 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.340
 Integration is something strange 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.340
 what is different is ushered in 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.550
 something normal inklusion assumes 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.720
 that all children are different 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.500
 and all children are inclusive, so to speak 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.910
 and all belong together and so shall in 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.310
 an inclusive school just actually 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.560
 it may be possible that all children 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.280
 be there very different talent 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.650
 if you can do it like that 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.600
 many schools think that's on 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.610
 should be a school location 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.890
 then should a sprengel also 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.420
 Children belong to these children all in 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.550
 The elementary school is going and not 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.930
 be separated into different 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.700
 school forms the question of 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.670
 diversity and variety the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.950
 actually makes the design question 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.080
 to an exciting task for the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.590
 small children in middle school age 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.650
 but also in older ones in the older ones 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.900
 she would not be quite old 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.420
 simple and straight we have noticed that 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.550
 especially in the upper classes, that's it 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.180
 not so easy because many of ours 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.940
 Colleagues the good 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.590
 studied people are training 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.800
 At all universities, they have a very good job 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.600
 Oriented are not so easy 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.920
 Access to this question 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.830
 humanity in diversity as designed 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.680
 a highly scientific one 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.750
 teach everyone something like this 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.790
 a person can have one 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.890
 disability a human without one 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.840
 disability a human with one 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.120
 talent on the one hand 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.000
 example in practical or social 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.670
 a human 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.160
 with an intellectual 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.310
 scientific talent and that 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.490
 in between so to speak what to find 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.120
 conducive to children and adolescents 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.769
 what you have in common as a human being too 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.769
 want to experience each other 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.800
 that is not easy and it is 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.250
 Teach the task of us, so to speak 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.350
 again and again school to reshape 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.860
 that there is something for everyone 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:36.480
 in the Disability Convention 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.280
 it understood the feeling of building so 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.110
 to have the feeling of belonging to 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.020
 to be able to participate in society 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.900
 is actually what we are about as 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:54.630
 one can achieve that everyone the feeling 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.770
 I belong to it and there you can 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.650
 Imagine being there very much 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.540
 But it also always has to differentiate 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.720
 create a mood for an atmosphere 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.900
 must succeed in school for all 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.900
 can
