00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.440
 Good guys, it's doing at least 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.800
 for the moment the last maintenance was 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.710
 planned for the mega which is the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.770
 revitalization of the headlamps already 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 I have already dismantled the reflector 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.850
 main I'm not mistaken, how to do this? 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.789
 perfect and it is also plastic neither 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.320
 has as it does a meta metalization 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:33.690
 A celebration in the case is a little light. 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.210
 runny serve her sister despite this 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.360
 bluish aspect it turns on a yellow 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.420
 but more like the tide of the two 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.930
 There's a lot of foggy headlights out there. 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.910
 new also in front of the car 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.149
 one of the key is to use the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.449
 originals even though it actually 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.920
 and the small pieces that make up the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.809
 inner part of the lighthouse 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:10.290
 besides the other side that I just 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:12.210
 I'll show you and I'll show you the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.799
 Reflector on the side you want on the side 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.640
 right is what was in the best state 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.590
 notice that it has some marks 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.259
 yellowish deviations and here we have 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.360
 did not really need to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.100
 revitalization although this here 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.650
 When you put it there you do not understand. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.670
 very wear and now on the side 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:44.460
 left side the motor is pretty ugly 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:48.540
 opaque that had chrome on top 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:55.110
 slightly attenuated the appearance of the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:59.969
 lighthouse tim also really ugly 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.770
 we need a good reputation and 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.820
 Let's see if it works because if 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 sure will be a very affordable price and 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.730
 will give a new face to the front of the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.460
 car to dismantle is relatively 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.200
 simple 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:23.470
 A little annoying, you have to take it out here. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:26.320
 the side supports rock and two of the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.660
 side of this side here does not feel this 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.440
 screw and pull the regulating motor 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.150
 of the headlights that it comes out good 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.590
 will the spotlight and we for you 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.750
 how does it get after dismantling 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.490
 ready replanted is out 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.860
 quickly we take off feel 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:48.640
 difficulty more difficult to take 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.980
 this species without breaking it is also 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.410
 rather hard to take it all in taking 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.630
 here because when you go looking before 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 go for the really crohn process 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.220
 it will is a kind of star is 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.440
 anything under the devil 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.830
 anything that is not resistant to 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:16.480
 this matter there the sound has to 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.440
 let the sun only increase the spotlight here O 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.440
 very simple 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.600
 the engine continues the clock engine you 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:36.250
 It will only fit here. 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:48.450
 neither of these two here and goes to that 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:53.620
 plastic part sindplast ready so 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:57.550
 that goes screwed so takes the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.220
 regulating motor because it reflects a 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.250
 bit the side he leaves now for us 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.530
 these plastic parts here are 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.650
 it is necessary to disassemble this plate in 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.320
 it is under pressure then the key 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.630
 crack you download here click here 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.359
 This plate straight and carefully you pull 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.310
 This is all plastic own lead 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.940
 O 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.700
 I got there to do the convention. 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:29.070
 A nice hug, I caught the guys. 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:32.090
 reflectors were good but 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.090
 could have gotten better 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:45.740
 if there is still an olympic policy 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:48.740
 or lighthouse I started to mount next to the 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.740
 right 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.190
 I'll show it to you guys. 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.190
 How did you stay? 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.660
 both little headlights 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.849
 Ball show now just put in the car 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.530
 I also took advantage of the last guess 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:36.639
 What can not you see so much? 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:39.520
 well but I have an aquino cleaning on 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.580
 headlamp accommodation and stayed at zero 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.699
 kilometer is also dark it will not 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.990
 to give to see how it was better 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.990
 no king 9 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.680
 the wait is the cake cherry was 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.240
 missing now is riding three like me 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.969
 I'm back to show 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.870
 ready, the secrecy of the works was 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.560
 completed 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:17.560
 everything I set up to give a 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:20.759
 carbon footprint on the bumper 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.759
 tournament in right 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.270
 remains to know 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.580
 the optical assembly and became 0 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:02.210
 that's it once Zia maintenance 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:02.210
 successfully held the meng√£o a hug
