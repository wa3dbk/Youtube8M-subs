00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.759
 21st 10 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.079
 Temporary first ever 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.789
 Transferred funds to a recent financial market 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.439
 Many times are short 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.890
 Bring a photographer 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.989
 After all, I said that about Tokyo 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.520
 Though it is a suburb of Tokyo 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.460
 It is a Bunkyo Ward man who was born 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.569
 Then play ten songs 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.189
 After all my best 4 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.079
 I can take a picture of myself 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.610
 It is said that there is necessity 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.440
 People who are in Tokyo, for example, have rated my photos 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.609
 As for the photograph of taking 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.890
 Some robots are overheating 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.340
 I can get an evaluation, but the next year I went abroad was overwhelmingly 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.610
 Rated a faraway photo 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.620
 So by photographing work Tokyo in Tokyo 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.910
 The more you go 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.510
 Evaluation abroad 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.970
 Because you can get 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.970
 For me 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.690
 The schedule is also decided 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.990
 Because I'm narrow from the photographer's 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.990
 I think I can get anything 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.320
 Because i am 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.920
 But with a good reason 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.940
 Even before this 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.480
 Because I decided to say 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.300
 It is troubled to say that it is the decisive factor of Toho Hosono 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.550
 Then it's a decent standard 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.800
 I love photography catena after all 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.570
 Not the top of the 7th 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.460
 Swinging around my own novelty 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.830
 Minister of State 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.950
 Who can get anything 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.950
 I was out of the ps in the Netherlands 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.350
 Dancing- 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.350
 We are delivering even under this situation 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 I try not to make a level 1 match 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.030
 House of Representatives Election Right 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.090
 Basic knowledge 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.190
 Shown in the same town 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.260
 Greenpeace
