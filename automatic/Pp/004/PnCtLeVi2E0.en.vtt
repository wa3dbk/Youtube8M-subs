00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.090
 people today on my test drive 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.670
 I found myself in front of a factor 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.330
 two and two liters 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.969
 pass to see 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.150
 there were about 200 horsepower not exactly 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.000
 occasion 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.420
 I can say I went to him 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.240
 from 110 kilometers the machine behaves 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.470
 general difference 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.670
 I 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.890
 used to ride ford focus 2 restyling 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.100
 counting moved 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.050
 no discomfort 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.520
 only improved car is high 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 what a great review 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 sit down 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.290
 convenient clip 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.000
 true 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.800
 runs what 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.970
 may of course need to get used much 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.730
 a lot of electronics 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.420
 all parts electronic brake slightly 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.420
 unwonted 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.750
 still 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.400
 minus of course in the horn the surest cant 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.210
 from their model in the city 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 poorly cleaned 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.050
 on the suspension to say 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.030
 fly I would of course on the cops need 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.270
 slow down again 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.270
 region 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.510
 asses 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.510
 rear jumps 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.130
 And so the speed of course in the car is not 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.180
 there is no rumbles 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.180
 going to yourself or 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.400
 great for a moment 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.120
 of course today it snowed failed 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.120
 should pump 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.110
 what I managed to say immediately gave as 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.110
 good and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.440
 heated seats are very cool 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.700
 filtration 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.310
 heated seats are much better than focus 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 not generally relies 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.300
 10 count included ten minutes wait 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.770
 while it is heated here right away 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.770
 still heated bitch 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.890
 box not 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.940
 in general, absolutely switches 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.940
 then when is it better 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.010
 so in general, all subscribe
