year to this year terms of the design is
huge<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.559> restructured<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> course<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
huge we restructured the course to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.119 
huge we restructured the course to
address<00:00:40.020> some<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> issues<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.800> we've

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
address some of the issues that we've

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.160 
address some of the issues that we've
had<00:00:41.309> over<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> years<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:42.300> basically<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.809> full

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
had over the years but basically a full

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.130 
had over the years but basically a full
a<00:00:43.649> snake<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> whole<00:00:45.000> hill<00:00:45.239> gives<00:00:45.750> us<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
a snake down the whole hill gives us a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
a snake down the whole hill gives us a
little<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.530> better<00:00:46.680> speed<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.640> throw<00:00:47.879> out

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
little bit better speed just throw out

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.920 
little bit better speed just throw out
the<00:00:48.059> whole<00:00:48.210> Hill<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.570> won't<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> be

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the whole Hill we won't have to be

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.990 
the whole Hill we won't have to be
breaking<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.649> peddling<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.460> should<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.760> flow

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
breaking or peddling it should just flow

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
breaking or peddling it should just flow
a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.300> nicer<00:00:51.840> first<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.590> give<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
a little nicer first of all give that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.380 
a little nicer first of all give that
person<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.340> lot<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> these<00:00:53.640> ideas<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.300> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
person a lot of these ideas that you
