00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920 
vehicle and and hopefully I'll do that I
know<00:01:56.730> James<00:01:57.060> has<00:01:57.240> been<00:01:57.360> doing<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.690> little<00:01:57.810> bit

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
know James has been doing a little bit

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
know James has been doing a little bit
tough<00:01:58.230> but<00:01:58.440> things<00:01:59.220> are<00:01:59.370> starting<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.700> change

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
tough but things are starting to change

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149 
tough but things are starting to change
there<00:02:00.300> and<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.870> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.010> new

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
there and and I think that the new

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.500 
there and and I think that the new
chassis<00:02:02.580> will<00:02:02.730> certainly<00:02:03.030> help<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.420> that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
chassis will certainly help in that

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.930 
chassis will certainly help in that
respect<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.920> what's<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> timeframe<00:02:05.340> for

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
respect so what's the timeframe for

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.119 
respect so what's the timeframe for
restoring<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:06.960> 18<00:02:07.260> car<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.680> putting<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.039> in

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
restoring the 18 car and putting it in

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.089 
restoring the 18 car and putting it in
the<00:02:08.250> museum<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.970> your<00:02:09.720> other<00:02:09.869> old<00:02:10.110> cars<00:02:10.379> well

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the museum with your other old cars well

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.320 
the museum with your other old cars well
look<00:02:11.220> there's<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> little<00:02:11.670> bit<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.879> time<00:02:12.030> left

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
look there's a little bit of time left

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.030 
look there's a little bit of time left
obviously<00:02:12.780> depending<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.349> how<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.590> next

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
obviously depending on how the next

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.949 
obviously depending on how the next
couple<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.580> race<00:02:14.700> movies<00:02:15.090> go<00:02:15.269> but<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:15.900> will
