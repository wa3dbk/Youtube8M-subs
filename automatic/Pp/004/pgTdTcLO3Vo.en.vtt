00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
I use the foul mainly because it's not

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
I use the foul mainly because it's not
as<00:00:36.030> used<00:00:36.270> gun<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.719> has<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.079> cool

as used gun and it has a really cool

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.850 
as used gun and it has a really cool
reload<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.700> uh<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.840> i<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
reload and it uh it i just like the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.139 
reload and it uh it i just like the
morgut<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> gun<00:00:41.550> better<00:00:41.760> looks<00:00:41.969> more

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
morgut the gun better looks more

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.170

futuristic<00:00:43.129> but<00:00:44.129> i<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.610> pretty<00:00:44.760> happy<00:00:44.850> with

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
futuristic but i was pretty happy with

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.250 
futuristic but i was pretty happy with
this<00:00:45.300> PlayStation<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this PlayStation and I think this one is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
this PlayStation and I think this one is
a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.770> less<00:00:49.829> talky<00:00:50.100> than<00:00:50.399> than<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
a little less talky than than the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.150 
a little less talky than than the
original<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> original<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.949> mainly

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
original or the original was mainly

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.670 
original or the original was mainly
call-outs<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:54.329> here's<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> standoff<00:00:55.469> game

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
call-outs but here's a standoff game

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.130 
call-outs but here's a standoff game
