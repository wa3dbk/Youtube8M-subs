00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it moves while it's being used so you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180

other<00:02:26.760> than<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:28.790> another<00:02:29.790> question<00:02:30.210> is<00:02:30.480> on

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
other than that another question is on

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.040 
other than that another question is on
the<00:02:31.310> hextech<00:02:32.310> cord<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.570> item<00:02:33.900> you

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
the hextech cord that is the item you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.740 
the hextech cord that is the item you
get<00:02:34.290> at<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:35.100> start<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.580> game<00:02:35.790> when<00:02:36.660> you

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
get at the start of the game when you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.680 
get at the start of the game when you
play<00:02:36.930> victor<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:38.460> item<00:02:38.760> um<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.570> you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
play victor and this item um if you

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.630 
play victor and this item um if you
don't<00:02:39.720> know<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.290> be<00:02:40.440> upgraded<00:02:40.590> into<00:02:41.310> three

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
don't know can be upgraded into three

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.420 
don't know can be upgraded into three
different<00:02:41.850> things<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.440> each<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.130> these<00:02:44.370> three

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
different things and each of these three

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.430 
different things and each of these three
things<00:02:44.670> will<00:02:45.510> enhance<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.320> your

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
things will enhance one of your

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.430 
things will enhance one of your
abilities<00:02:46.890> now<00:02:47.730> what<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> said<00:02:48.420> before<00:02:48.570> was<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
abilities now what I said before was you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.180 
abilities now what I said before was you
should<00:02:50.210> get<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.360> one<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.870> enhances<00:02:52.500> your<00:02:52.530> Q

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
should get the one that enhances your Q

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.900 
should get the one that enhances your Q
and<00:02:53.460> your<00:02:54.120> Q<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.750> power<00:02:55.650> transfer<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and your Q is a power transfer and the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.300 
and your Q is a power transfer and the
upgraded<00:02:57.570> hextech<00:02:58.410> core<00:02:58.650> would<00:02:58.890> be<00:02:59.040> called

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
upgraded hextech core would be called

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.500 
upgraded hextech core would be called
augment<00:02:59.760> power<00:02:59.970> um<00:03:01.160> however<00:03:02.160> after<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:03.030> lot<00:03:03.480> of

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
augment power um however after a lot of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.620 
augment power um however after a lot of
playing<00:03:03.840> around<00:03:03.960> I've<00:03:04.440> realized<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.630> power

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
playing around I've realized that power

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.070 
playing around I've realized that power
transfer<00:03:07.280> although<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.240> does<00:03:09.630> come<00:03:09.930> in

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
transfer although it is it does come in

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.340 
transfer although it is it does come in
handy<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.620> find<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.610> um<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.750> should<00:03:12.810> either

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
handy I find that um you should either

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.290 
handy I find that um you should either
choose<00:03:14.300> depending<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.510> your<00:03:15.840> situation<00:03:17.300> like

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
choose depending on your situation like

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.229 
choose depending on your situation like
if<00:03:18.510> there's<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.870> lot<00:03:19.170> more<00:03:19.640> melee<00:03:20.640> champions

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
if there's a lot more melee champions

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.970 
if there's a lot more melee champions
you<00:03:21.480> should<00:03:21.660> go<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:22.080> all<00:03:22.260> men<00:03:22.470> gravity

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
you should go for all men gravity

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.400 
you should go for all men gravity
because<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.209> really<00:03:24.480> freezes<00:03:24.930> them<00:03:25.080> in<00:03:25.200> place

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
because it really freezes them in place

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.140 
because it really freezes them in place
and<00:03:25.650> they<00:03:25.830> have<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.100> get<00:03:26.250> close<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.489> attack<00:03:26.940> you

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and they have to get close to attack you

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.560 
and they have to get close to attack you
and<00:03:27.770> a<00:03:28.770> lot<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.489> times<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.330> want<00:03:30.510> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
and a lot of times if you just want to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.790 
and a lot of times if you just want to
deal<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> bunch<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.320> damage<00:03:31.770> um<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:33.440> often<00:03:34.440> go

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
deal a bunch of damage um I often go

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.870 
deal a bunch of damage um I often go
with<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.690> death<00:03:36.690> ray<00:03:37.280> one<00:03:38.280> which<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:38.580> called

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
with the death ray one which is called

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.590 
with the death ray one which is called
augment<00:03:39.420> death<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.830> just<00:03:41.100> increases<00:03:42.060> your

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
augment death and it just increases your

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.900 
augment death and it just increases your
damage<00:03:43.170> by<00:03:43.950> thirty<00:03:44.220> percent<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:46.459> 45<00:03:47.459> ability

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
damage by thirty percent and 45 ability

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.310 
damage by thirty percent and 45 ability
power<00:03:48.090> which<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:49.370> pretty<00:03:50.370> much<00:03:51.320> destroys

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
power which can pretty much destroys

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.710 
power which can pretty much destroys
people<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.400> team<00:03:53.610> fights<00:03:53.880> especially<00:03:54.150> when

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
people in team fights especially when

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.970 
people in team fights especially when
you<00:03:54.840> have<00:03:55.050> your<00:03:56.450> chaos<00:03:57.450> storm<00:03:57.750> going<00:03:58.019> but

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
you have your chaos storm going but

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.870 
you have your chaos storm going but
other<00:03:59.640> than<00:03:59.850> that<00:03:59.910> I<00:04:00.209> mean<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:02.130> augment<00:04:02.580> power

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
other than that I mean the augment power

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.690 
other than that I mean the augment power
one<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.810> not<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.200> useful<00:04:04.620> all<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.220> does<00:04:05.370> is

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
one it's not that useful all it does is

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.699 
one it's not that useful all it does is
it<00:04:05.940> increases<00:04:06.690> your<00:04:06.810> movement<00:04:07.050> speed<00:04:07.320> by

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
it increases your movement speed by

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.560 
it increases your movement speed by
thirty<00:04:07.980> percent<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.970> gives<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.330> like<00:04:09.540> a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
thirty percent and it gives you like a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.620 
thirty percent and it gives you like a
little<00:04:09.810> bit<00:04:10.019> of<00:04:10.190> AP<00:04:11.190> some<00:04:11.640> health

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
little bit of AP some health

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.350 
little bit of AP some health
three<00:04:12.840> gin<00:04:13.080> which<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.470> man<00:04:13.910> it's<00:04:14.910> more<00:04:15.120> for

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
three gin which is man it's more for

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.380 
three gin which is man it's more for
survivability<00:04:16.670> now<00:04:17.670> we're<00:04:17.820> going<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.060> use<00:04:18.239> it

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
survivability now we're going to use it

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.260 
survivability now we're going to use it
if<00:04:18.570> you're<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:19.459> losing<00:04:20.459> really<00:04:20.700> badly<00:04:20.940> and

ganks so yeah and other than that I mean
he<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.480> such<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:33.900> huge<00:04:35.450> damage<00:04:36.450> output<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.410> he's

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
he is such a huge damage output and he's

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.050 
he is such a huge damage output and he's
so<00:04:38.130> fun<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.430> play<00:04:39.710> another<00:04:40.710> thing<00:04:40.980> about<00:04:41.670> I

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
so fun to play another thing about I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.210 
so fun to play another thing about I
said<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:42.600> earlier<00:04:42.780> his<00:04:43.320> death<00:04:43.590> ray<00:04:43.830> which<00:04:44.070> is

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
said this earlier his death ray which is

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
said this earlier his death ray which is
basically<00:04:44.610> on<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.420> a<00:04:46.430> laser<00:04:47.430> beam<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.210> you

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
basically on this a laser beam and you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.020 
basically on this a laser beam and you
can<00:04:48.780> pretty<00:04:49.080> much<00:04:49.170> decide<00:04:50.070> where<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.790> laser

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
can pretty much decide where the laser

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.780 
can pretty much decide where the laser
beam<00:04:51.330> goes<00:04:51.600> i<00:04:51.900> said<00:04:52.710> earlier<00:04:52.920> in<00:04:53.370> my<00:04:53.580> review

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
beam goes i said earlier in my review

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.850 
beam goes i said earlier in my review
video<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.720> um<00:04:55.910> it's<00:04:56.990> kind<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.080> unwieldy<00:04:58.680> and

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
what you see in this gameplay while I'm

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.430 
what you see in this gameplay while I'm
landing<00:06:17.880> with<00:06:18.030> siren<00:06:18.450> each<00:06:18.810> time<00:06:19.080> I<00:06:19.110> hit<00:06:19.350> him

landing with siren each time I hit him
barely<00:06:19.740> it<00:06:20.400> deals<00:06:20.580> just<00:06:20.880> a<00:06:20.970> little<00:06:21.180> bit<00:06:21.300> of

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
barely it deals just a little bit of

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.719 
barely it deals just a little bit of
damn

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
damn

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.089

but<00:06:21.969> over<00:06:22.300> time<00:06:22.539> each<00:06:22.960> time<00:06:22.990> I<00:06:23.289> hit<00:06:23.529> him<00:06:23.620> it

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
but over time each time I hit him it

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.450 
but over time each time I hit him it
takes<00:06:24.759> them<00:06:24.939> down<00:06:24.969> more<00:06:25.960> and<00:06:26.110> more<00:06:26.319> and<00:06:26.680> what<00:06:27.430> I

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
takes them down more and more and what I

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.390 
takes them down more and more and what I
usually<00:06:27.669> do<00:06:27.999> in<00:06:28.120> Lane<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.629> um<00:06:29.139> again<00:06:30.129> down<00:06:30.370> a

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
usually do in Lane is um again down a

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.659 
usually do in Lane is um again down a
half<00:06:30.729> HP<00:06:31.089> and<00:06:31.569> then<00:06:32.379> ice<00:06:32.529> pop<00:06:32.979> the<00:06:33.129> chaos<00:06:33.400> storm

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
half HP and then ice pop the chaos storm

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.939 
half HP and then ice pop the chaos storm
and<00:06:33.939> everything<00:06:34.870> gravity<00:06:35.409> field<00:06:35.710> and<00:06:35.860> he's

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
and everything gravity field and he's

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.939 
and everything gravity field and he's
stunned<00:06:36.249> in<00:06:36.430> dead<00:06:36.669> okay<00:06:37.599> I<00:06:37.629> think<00:06:37.779> the<00:06:38.169> time<00:06:38.919> is

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
stunned in dead okay I think the time is

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.059 
stunned in dead okay I think the time is
running<00:06:39.430> out<00:06:39.550> so<00:06:39.839> that's<00:06:40.839> about<00:06:41.050> it<00:06:41.229> subscribe

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
running out so that's about it subscribe

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:46.020 
running out so that's about it subscribe
and<00:06:42.339> I'll<00:06:43.089> see<00:06:43.150> you<00:06:43.839> guys<00:06:43.900> later
