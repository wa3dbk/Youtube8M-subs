00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.920
 save people 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.030
 I'm in front of a gas station, I 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.090
 I will once again make the test consumption 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.110
 of my thesis because I wanted to see 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.770
 free field 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.080
 so I decided to do it one more time here 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:26.429
 I was in the middle of it today. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.409
 change because I'm going to use the video so 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.570
 that I passed I present to you here 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:36.000
 but I think she did a day 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:41.840
 thank you just a minute as 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.840
 spoken just now and has committed to 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.019
 Hague 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.679
 the president while 28 in mine 3 and 23 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.679
 in additive 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:08.790
 so now it's just adding up while she 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.180
 did this made of new mount that this fashion 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.369
 I'm a guy that I talk a little 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.770
 But she's for you and now with 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.229
 by the end of 2015 when 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 even though slowly raining all 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.799
 days 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.740
 I'm going to wash the pot today to stay 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.030
 quiet and good - looking 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:38.259
 and it is one that actually happens already 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.820
 happened to me I do not know if it's normal and 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.030
 It sounds like a strange noise in the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.619
 motor when they have high rotation floor 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.759
 two months of use 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.679
 but only with and 2nd and 3rd more contains 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.070
 alda sÃ£o paulo I think it is a motor of 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:59.000
 Consulating hitting an act is very strange. 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:01.810
 I was talking about the bird masters but nothing that 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.630
 hinder her power nothing that comes 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.100
 disrupt the performance of the bike you do not 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.850
 it's lethal it 's very important that I did 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.700
 this test of consumption was the acceleration 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.989
 that in the last test of consumption that I 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.890
 I was walking the average of 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.600
 60 km hour speed 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.560
 now in this test of consumption 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.830
 I actually did several top speed one 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.500
 tank then so I really 15 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.260
 sport explore a little know how 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.359
 is that you are against the amendment 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.600
 I do not know how the result of this 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:45.079
 instead she rolled 401 beautiful man is 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.390
 with a president if I do not know which one 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.810
 her performance but I believe that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.209
 not far from what was expected or not 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.989
 either for those who left the carbureted motorcycle 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.359
 the same will be 125 carburette and took the street 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.850
 principal electronic advisor 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.240
 I was very surprised at the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.300
 performance or consumption performance 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.490
 why the injection is almost the same 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.740
 Please, she will only send the 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.380
 gasoline that needs to be 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.740
 so that makes the bike look good 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.560
 economic very same economic well 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.900
 Arriving home I'll beat the calculations. 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.310
 A little more in the cabin in the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.510
 mind I think we want is to have 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.540
 done the 29 once more completed 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.080
 So this guys give you a hug and even 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.080
 next
