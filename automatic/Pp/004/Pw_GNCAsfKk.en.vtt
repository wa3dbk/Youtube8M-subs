 squares any other sizes 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.830
 rectangle initially 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.830

 generally have the name and spaceship and go 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:56.019
 necessary boat plan when generally more 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:01.619
 the racing car looks like everything 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:07.860
 now turned this corner 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:07.860
 turn off so that we have left 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780
 that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.369
 turned back from this side also 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.369
 only to this 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.470
 that is, you see we found a center with 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.470
 this side also 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.380
 only 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:53.630
 center but now found all this 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:55.210
 the workpiece we turn over and this one 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.270
 bottom edge 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.369
 we turn on this center 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.079
 generally you can not do it but for 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.670
 convenience now show on one 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.500
 Thais side he's different in a different way 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.500
 it will be absolutely the same with us 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.340
 here 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.769
 so that we got here see how 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:30.370
 so here it turns out we will 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:36.670
 convenient wrap now examine about and 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:39.569
 You see how we hijacker so that you 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.569
 teach 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.860
 here I didn't turn over either 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.040
 you can just here neatly like this 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.040
 here 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.170
 also also an even sense in general 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.890

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:13.170
 This is how we came out with a restaurant chain 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:16.260

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.980
 one of the parties any because we have 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.370
 all the same sound sides are turned on 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.370
