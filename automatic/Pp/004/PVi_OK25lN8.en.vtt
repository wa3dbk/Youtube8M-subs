your hands on me that I react at that

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.560 
your hands on me that I react at that
time<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.980> i'll<00:02:49.190> be<00:02:49.400> demonstrating<00:02:49.760> some<00:02:50.450> of

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
time so i'll be demonstrating some of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.080 
time so i'll be demonstrating some of
those<00:02:50.690> techniques<00:02:51.200> today<00:02:51.650> we<00:02:52.580> have<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.760> risk

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
those techniques today we have a risk

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.059 
those techniques today we have a risk
grab<00:02:54.370> okay<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.209> most<00:02:57.019> people<00:02:57.470> they<00:02:57.769> would

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
grab okay so on most people they would

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.210 
grab okay so on most people they would
in<00:02:58.730> other<00:02:59.030> systems<00:02:59.450> try<00:03:00.050> now<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.380> manipulate

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
in other systems try now to manipulate

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.729 
in other systems try now to manipulate
the<00:03:01.400> joint<00:03:01.700> what<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.239> try<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.660> do<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.440> change

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
the joint what I try to do is to change

thinking up top by striking down low he

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.390 
thinking up top by striking down low he
immediately<00:03:17.090> complies<00:03:17.930> loosens<00:03:18.829> his<00:03:19.040> grip
