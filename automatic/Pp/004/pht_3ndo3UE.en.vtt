00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.550
 only one year has passed since the release of 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.080
 creed 2 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.670
 but the numerous feedbacks received from the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.770
 users regarding the previous chapter 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.720
 have allowed codemasters to 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.190
 speed up development and 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.020
 make numerous decisions that 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.690
 could prove decisive for the 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.280
 screaming autosport success for 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 start we have a return to 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.059
 mechanics adopted in the first chapter 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.470
 closer to the simulation and more 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.720
 focus on the differences in 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.340
 ease of constraints to do this 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.770
 codemasters has actively collaborated 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.990
 with numerous industry experts such as 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.210
 metn the touring championship winner 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.800
 and autosport magazine magazine that has 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.790
 provided many details on 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.740
 Technical specifications of the vehicles 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.860
 available disciplines are touring 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.050
 endurance wheels uncovered tunnel street e 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.520
 finally the unlockable grid mode 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.320
 only after reaching the third 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.960
 level of experience in all others 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.610
 modality once completed 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.830
 goals related to a sponsor in 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.820
 particular it will be possible to stipulate a 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.770
 new contract with another each 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.509
 type of race differs very well 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.399
 especially for the different driveability 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.229
 of vehicles in wheel mode 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.819
 discoveries for example we will run speed 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.319
 higher the smaller is missing 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.869
 contact with opponents could 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.340
 make us lose stability in competitions 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.259
 more aggressive as in the mode 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.910
 street instead the bumps are almost 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.530
 inevitable also because of the way 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.869
 rather aggressive that it still carries 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.399
 with some defect 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.289
 it often happens to see different 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.430
 vehicles to tag along and provoke 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.750
 accidents and making it difficult to overtake 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.270
 the choice to land grid 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.410
 autosport on the urgent pc is due to 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.959
 a series of questions purely 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.819
 techniques the title uses a version 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.590
 very advanced and refined of the le guen already 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.020
 the engine that accompanies the series of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.849
 shouted from the first chapter talent already in 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.800
 has been optimized to xbox 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.430
 360 and ps3 offering the best 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.390
 performance right on these machines 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.730
 codemasters has also performed very well 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.500
 PC optimization work thanks 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.989
 cooperation with intent is rendered 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.849
 grid autosport a performing title either 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.340
 on higher-end hardware is on 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.680
 those less powerful 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.810
 having tried the pc version of the game 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.010
 we can confidently confirm the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.349
 goodness of the work done 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.940
 screams autosport fact around 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.190
 also beautifully solutions that 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.870
 raised keeping the trend stable and 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.900
 guarantor in a fluid gaming experience 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.000
 and engaging despite its limitations 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.709
 and videogame panorama in which it is inserted 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.660
 the new grid still manages to make the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.190
 his beautiful figure with a vast number of 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660
 vehicles well made and with 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.530
 important improvements from the point of 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.319
 view of physics 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.599
 in this regard it is good to point out the 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.670
 presence of structural damage 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.440
 can be activated through specific option a 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.329
 visual level however also without 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.329
 activate this option you will notice the 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.769
 damage to the car body 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.599
 also with regard to the tracks 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.829
 grid autosport and is rich and well 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.450
 differentiated 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.489
 more than 100 will be present 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.349
 tracks of bisin 22 settings 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.340
 different to set up a campaign 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.989
 it was also extremely vast 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.030
 introduced the interior view much 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.980
 requested by the fans that nevertheless puts in 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.989
 highlight the little care with which they have been 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.769
 made the interior of the vehicle 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.019
 it is not a defect 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.670
 particularly significant but seen 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.319
 the general traffic impact is a pity 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.850
 that these details were not 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.079
 cared for 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.850
 finally remains a point in favor of the 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.769
 sound compartment that counts on a good one 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.630
 sound reproduction of different engines 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.840
 of the cars and the pleasant music of the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.840
 menu 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.970
 the third chapter of the grid series yes 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.530
 it distinguishes above all for the novelties 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.660
 introduced in the career with 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.949
 multiple disciplines with present and the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.510
 also freedom of choice given on 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.070
 player in dealing with singles 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.630
 challenges 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.710
 the developers however did not want to 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.110
 make a centered title 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.490
 only on single players but 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.990
 they wanted to expand the sector 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.639
 multiplayer with a series of 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.940
 possibility that they offered as much 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.410
 freedom even in online mode 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.120
 among the most important innovations we have 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.410
 the introduction of clubs that can 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.389
 be founded by any player 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.250
 to host your friends up to a 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.960
 maximum of 200 participants per 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.530
 complete the objectives together 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.479
 dedicated 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.039
 there is no lack of course 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.990
 vehicle customizations 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.460
 in fact we will be able to change the livery 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.320
 of our car with numerous 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.729
 options including the form or lo 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.889
 stencil to create drawings 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.600
 details the color scheme from 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.490
 apply the various parts of the vehicle 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.039
 the type of wheels the number on the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.570
 the sponsor is the choice of the 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.370
 sponsor naturally influences i 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.960
 earnings and goals unlocked with 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.310
 the race 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.110
 once you have made your own 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.280
 personalization will be possible 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.590
 share it with other users 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.000
 through the race net platform that 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.979
 also allows comparison with 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.870
 statistics of other players 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.130
 another novelty compared to the past is the 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.229
 possibility to create playlists 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.910

 own rules always getting gods 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.760
 credits with which it is possible 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.110
 buy not see with 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.699
 if during the career in fact the 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.979
 readings if they are made available 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.270
 from our team in the multiplayer will be the 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.070
 player to choose which car 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.930
 buy and use them in 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.250
 competitions can accumulate points 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.220
 experience to improve them 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.380
 performance using at present it 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.610
 same vehicle however the costs of 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.470
 maintenance at some point 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.790
 force the player to choose if 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.750
 his investments are greater 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.370
 buying a new vehicle will be possible 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.139
 however sell your vehicle or

 change with the money earned 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.720
 during the competitions all options 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.220
 very appreciable and that make

 autosport focuses mainly on content 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.490
 rather than brute force

 of the graphic impact the title 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.789
