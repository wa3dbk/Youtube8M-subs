00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.710 

I<00:04:07.450> think<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.200> best<00:04:09.240> moment<00:04:10.240> was<00:04:10.270> this<00:04:10.540> last

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
I think the best moment was this last

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.970 
I think the best moment was this last
one<00:04:10.960> 2004<00:04:11.970> because<00:04:12.970> we<00:04:13.660> had<00:04:13.840> lost<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.770> last

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
one 2004 because we had lost the last

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.800 
one 2004 because we had lost the last
Olympics<00:04:15.520> we<00:04:15.670> had<00:04:15.760> lost<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.180> last<00:04:16.330> World<00:04:16.600> Cup

Olympics we had lost the last World Cup

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.050 
Olympics we had lost the last World Cup

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.380 
and for all of us that had been on the
team<00:04:19.209> for<00:04:19.269> so<00:04:19.600> long<00:04:19.780> Mia<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.799> brandy<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.910> joy

and<00:04:22.420> Christine<00:04:23.140> we<00:04:23.290> knew<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.500> was<00:04:23.590> our<00:04:23.710> last

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
and Christine we knew it was our last

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.700 
and Christine we knew it was our last
time<00:04:24.130> playing<00:04:24.400> together<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.230> we<00:04:26.410> wanted

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
time playing together and so we wanted

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.380 
time playing together and so we wanted
to<00:04:26.920> go<00:04:27.160> out<00:04:27.190> on<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.550> right<00:04:27.640> note<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:28.330> to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
to go out on the right note and so to

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.570 
to go out on the right note and so to
win<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:28.750> gold<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.530> we<00:04:29.680> played<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.890> very<00:04:30.250> very

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
win that gold and we played a very very

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.220 
win that gold and we played a very very
good<00:04:30.820> Brazil<00:04:31.240> team<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.690> thankfully<00:04:32.080> had

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
good Brazil team that thankfully had

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.550 
good Brazil team that thankfully had
never<00:04:32.440> have<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.740> play<00:04:32.890> again<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.140> think<00:04:35.260> that

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
never have to play again so I think that

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.320 
never have to play again so I think that
was<00:04:35.710> probably<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.190> most<00:04:36.460> special<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:37.030> and

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
was probably the most special and and

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.390 
was probably the most special and and
just<00:04:37.570> having<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.230> know<00:04:38.680> being<00:04:38.890> blessed<00:04:39.190> to

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
just having you know being blessed to
