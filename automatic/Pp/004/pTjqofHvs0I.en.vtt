00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.219
 What is empires talents doing today? 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.400
 no gameplay but with one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.160
 trailer and that is about the new 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.650
 call of duty and more specifically about the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.710
 extension mode some of you will be yes 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.869
 the rumors have already heard that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.240
 there should be an alien mode so 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.359
 Similar to the zombie mode, yes 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.149
 should not be true yet 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.070
 but now it's just that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.829
 trailer got over just this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.140
 Mode and yes the brave in any case 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.730
 not withheld and me will become yours 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 What are you thinking about? 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 The game mode can be the one with zombies 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.530
 keep up or maybe it will be quite 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.329
 unlike zombies, customers do not become different 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.809
 based but similar to that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.059
 survival mode from mw 3 instead of 2 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.590
 comments are interesting for me and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.149
 Now have fun with the trailer and us 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.940
 see you soon with a new one 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.940
 video potter row of new lenz wants 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.740
 world chunks become 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.020
 around the concerned 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.530
 wrong 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.030
 No 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.030
 This is 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.560
 it is over 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.069
 respect
