exhaust<00:00:48.179> fumes<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.879> more<00:00:51.059> efficient

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
exhaust fumes so a little more efficient

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.099

you<00:00:59.249> know<00:00:59.339> submicron<00:00:59.999> particles<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.969> I<00:01:03.199> could

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you know submicron particles so I could

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.980 
you know submicron particles so I could
start<00:01:04.440> here<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.739> basically<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.840> open<00:01:06.840> up

in my filters a little bit dirty
a<00:02:34.190> few<00:02:35.190> particles<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.660> does<00:02:36.959> filter<00:02:37.410> air

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
a few particles it does filter air

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.580 
a few particles it does filter air
directly<00:02:38.100> from<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.000> outside<00:02:39.480> fresh<00:02:40.350> air

coming<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.400> addition<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:43.650> know

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
coming in in addition to you know

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.470

filtering<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> air<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.670> recirculation<00:02:45.300> mode

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
filtering the air and recirculation mode

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.110 
filtering the air and recirculation mode
and<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> CT<00:02:46.769> also<00:02:47.130> has<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> dust<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
and then the CT also has a dust and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.220 
and then the CT also has a dust and
pollen<00:02:48.570> mode<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.850> special<00:02:51.380> mode<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:54.050> put<00:02:55.050> the

pollen mode that special mode to put the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.620

system<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.739> recirculation<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.790> basically

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
system on recirculation and basically

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.900 
system on recirculation and basically
try<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.930> more<00:02:58.380> rapidly<00:02:58.830> remove<00:02:59.280> dust<00:02:59.700> and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
try to more rapidly remove dust and

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.750 
try to more rapidly remove dust and
pollen<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:01.019> have<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.100> replacement<00:03:02.340> filter

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.900 
pollen so have the replacement filter
here<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:04.800> know<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> lexus

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910

original<00:03:07.459> lexus<00:03:08.459> filter<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.690> replacement<00:03:10.200> I

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
original lexus filter the replacement I

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.740 
original lexus filter the replacement I
got<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.769> from<00:03:10.980> Napa<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.640> maybe<00:03:12.209> not<00:03:12.329> as

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
got it from Napa is maybe not as

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.259 
got it from Napa is maybe not as
high-quality<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.070> may<00:03:14.549> end<00:03:14.700> up<00:03:14.790> changing<00:03:15.239> it

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
high-quality so I may end up changing it

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.960 
high-quality so I may end up changing it
out<00:03:15.390> again<00:03:15.750> but<00:03:16.500> I'm<00:03:16.829> not<00:03:16.980> sure<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.820> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
out again but I'm not sure of the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.449 
out again but I'm not sure of the
quality<00:03:18.390> however<00:03:19.019> if<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.709> has<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.130> special

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
quality however if this has the special

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.810 
quality however if this has the special
properties<00:03:20.910> with<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.269> electric<00:03:22.200> layer<00:03:22.980> so

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
properties with the electric layer so

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.060 
properties with the electric layer so
you<00:03:24.420> know<00:03:24.510> they<00:03:24.630> also<00:03:24.750> makes<00:03:25.079> some<00:03:25.410> filters

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you know they also makes some filters

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.180 
you know they also makes some filters
with<00:03:26.250> carbon<00:03:26.970> layers<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.860> you<00:03:28.860> know<00:03:28.950> several

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
with carbon layers and you know several

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.240 
with carbon layers and you know several
different<00:03:29.310> layers<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.680> I'll<00:03:31.680> definitely<00:03:31.980> be

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
different layers so I'll definitely be

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.890 
different layers so I'll definitely be
checking<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.850> do<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> lot<00:03:33.209> more<00:03:33.239> research<00:03:33.540> on

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
checking and do a lot more research on

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.600 
checking and do a lot more research on
making<00:03:34.320> sure<00:03:34.440> I'm<00:03:34.560> getting<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.890> good<00:03:35.040> filter<00:03:35.310> or
