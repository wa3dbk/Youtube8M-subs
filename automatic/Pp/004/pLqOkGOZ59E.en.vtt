that me and my friend Adam of court over

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.960 
that me and my friend Adam of court over
the<00:00:15.299> past<00:00:15.540> few<00:00:16.170> years<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:17.070> been<00:00:17.250> raining<00:00:17.550> for

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the past few years it's been raining for

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.220 
the past few years it's been raining for
the<00:00:18.720> past<00:00:19.369> three<00:00:20.369> days<00:00:20.399> so<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.899> river<00:00:22.110> is

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
the past three days so the river is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.560 
the past three days so the river is
going<00:00:22.349> to<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.529> holding<00:00:22.739> a<00:00:22.919> lot<00:00:23.099> of<00:00:23.189> color<00:00:23.570> which

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
going to be holding a lot of color which

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.839 
going to be holding a lot of color which
is<00:00:24.599> good<00:00:24.989> because<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:26.160> fact<00:00:26.399> that<00:00:26.489> the<00:00:26.610> court

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
is good because the fact that the court

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.210 
is good because the fact that the court
can't<00:00:27.180> see<00:00:27.419> the<00:00:27.630> surface<00:00:28.110> what's<00:00:28.680> outside<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
can't see the surface what's outside and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
can't see the surface what's outside and
surface<00:00:29.579> gives<00:00:29.849> them<00:00:29.970> confidence<00:00:30.349> to<00:00:31.349> come

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
surface gives them confidence to come

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.670 
surface gives them confidence to come
out<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.649> the<00:00:31.739> snakes<00:00:33.110> whereas<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
out on the snakes whereas when the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.680 
out on the snakes whereas when the
waters<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.489> through<00:00:37.550> they<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:39.060> people

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
waters see through they can see people

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.210 
waters see through they can see people
walking<00:00:39.780> past<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.470> they<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.680> swim<00:00:40.920> straight

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
walking past and they just swim straight

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.010 
walking past and they just swim straight
off<00:00:41.400> like<00:00:41.730> they've<00:00:41.880> done<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> past<00:00:42.240> ok<00:00:42.960> so

this<00:01:54.420> small<00:01:54.689> tip<00:01:54.930> won't<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.200> able<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this small tip won't be able to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.750 
this small tip won't be able to
distinguish<00:01:55.860> between<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.310> current<00:01:56.580> and

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
distinguish between the current and

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.690 
distinguish between the current and
actual<00:01:57.630> bias<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.170> i<00:01:58.439> think<00:01:59.010> this<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.340> will<00:01:59.549> do

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
actual bias so i think this one will do

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.219 
actual bias so i think this one will do
a<00:01:59.729> lot<00:01:59.850> better<00:01:59.970> tomorrow<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:00.750> more

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
a lot better tomorrow because more

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.999 
a lot better tomorrow because more

once<00:04:04.200> you've<00:04:04.349> cut<00:04:04.560> caught<00:04:04.889> a<00:04:05.389> fish<00:04:06.389> that

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
once you've cut caught a fish that

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.240 
once you've cut caught a fish that
disturbs<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.260> swim<00:04:07.470> usually<00:04:07.889> the<00:04:07.980> fish

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
disturbs the swim usually the fish

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.429 
disturbs the swim usually the fish
coffee<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.989> could<00:04:10.169> have<00:04:10.260> totally

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
coffee and so that could have totally

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.819 
coffee and so that could have totally
ruin<00:04:10.739> my<00:04:10.859> chances<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:11.639> you<00:04:12.599> know<00:04:12.750> stick<00:04:13.709> with

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
ruin my chances but you know stick with

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.259 
ruin my chances but you know stick with
it<00:04:14.930> probably<00:04:15.930> down<00:04:16.049> there<00:04:16.079> for<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.380> few<00:04:16.560> hours

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
it probably down there for a few hours

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.330 
it probably down there for a few hours
try<00:04:18.269> some<00:04:18.449> different<00:04:18.570> baits<00:04:19.250> probably<00:04:20.250> give

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
try some different baits probably give

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.730 
try some different baits probably give
this<00:04:20.459> from<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.729> rest<00:04:21.349> just<00:04:22.349> trying<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.650> get

those cart now as soon as the fish in

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:28.790 
those cart now as soon as the fish in
here<00:04:27.599> I've<00:04:27.720> never<00:04:27.840> seen<00:04:28.110> luncheon<00:04:28.530> meat<00:04:28.710> in

their lives I've switched over to sweet

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.399 
their lives I've switched over to sweet
corn<00:04:31.590> because<00:04:32.280> I've<00:04:32.699> been<00:04:33.199> fishing<00:04:34.199> this

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
years ago they they know what it is but

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.020 
years ago they they know what it is but
I've<00:04:40.740> been<00:04:40.860> loose<00:04:41.070> feeding<00:04:41.460> some<00:04:41.669> of<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:41.849> ham

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
I've been loose feeding some of that ham

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.000 
I've been loose feeding some of that ham
into<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.599> places<00:04:43.560> where<00:04:43.680> I'm<00:04:43.770> fishing

a long reign period carries a lot of

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.980 
a long reign period carries a lot of
color<00:05:01.669> obviously<00:05:01.970> got<00:05:02.360> some<00:05:02.509> gets<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.870> lot

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
color obviously got some gets a lot

color obviously got some gets a lot
deeper<00:05:03.699> now<00:05:04.699> this<00:05:04.759> is<00:05:04.849> such<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.150> small<00:05:05.360> River

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
deeper now this is such a small River

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.809 
deeper now this is such a small River
that<00:05:05.900> pulls<00:05:06.770> like<00:05:06.979> this<00:05:07.160> i<00:05:07.340> cut<00:05:07.520> off<00:05:07.610> other

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
that pulls like this i cut off other

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.430 
that pulls like this i cut off other
side<00:05:08.060> by<00:05:08.240> shallow<00:05:08.479> parts<00:05:08.900> which<00:05:09.050> stop<00:05:09.349> the

side by shallow parts which stop the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.529 
side by shallow parts which stop the
fish<00:05:09.620> from<00:05:09.800> getting<00:05:10.550> out<00:05:10.639> which<00:05:10.849> is<00:05:10.880> usually

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
fish from getting out which is usually

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.600 
fish from getting out which is usually
why<00:05:11.660> I<00:05:11.690> catch<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.139> fish<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.830> same<00:05:13.039> fish<00:05:13.310> over

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
why I catch the fish the same fish over

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.460 
why I catch the fish the same fish over
and<00:05:13.729> over<00:05:13.819> again<00:05:14.060> like<00:05:14.780> that<00:05:15.020> job<00:05:15.289> I've

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
and over again like that job I've

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.719 
and over again like that job I've
probably<00:05:15.650> caught<00:05:15.949> maybe<00:05:16.190> three<00:05:16.460> or<00:05:16.490> four

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
probably caught maybe three or four

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.499 
probably caught maybe three or four
times<00:05:17.440> which<00:05:18.440> is<00:05:18.530> kind<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.830> sad<00:05:18.889> but<00:05:19.330> seeing<00:05:20.330> as

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
times which is kind of sad but seeing as

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.120 
times which is kind of sad but seeing as
the<00:05:20.840> cop<00:05:21.110> could<00:05:21.380> have<00:05:21.530> got<00:05:21.650> out<00:05:21.680> when<00:05:21.919> it<00:05:22.039> was

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
the cop could have got out when it was

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.490 
the cop could have got out when it was
