00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.190
 welcome to ray of fist as I 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.420
 you presented the rucksack to the rules 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.730
 38 2005 so this bag is a reference 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.230
 because it weighs only 650 grams 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.880
 for a volume of 38 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.910
 so these are pretty features 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.370
 exceptional for a bag intended for 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.190
 reins to the trail that can possibly 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.530
 also suitable for hiking at the 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.680
 day so what explains 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.289
 performances this is the search the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.579
 maximum savings of achievement of 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:43.429
 materials so power than the belt 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.069
 is widely open to Grasse pass 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.379
 belt two ip pages which are 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:51.109
 removable so still a little bit 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.120
 more than that we have a bone 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.760
 upholstered which has no nature to 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.710
 inside which also explains its 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.749
 lightness 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.109
 the models that are rather film and then 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:07.790
 we use many pockets 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:11.420
 in mesh so a pocket in locks on the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.170
 on which ip with them also 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.990
 small zipped pocket underneath and then 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.030
 a wick pocket on the side all of 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.110
 each side one on the front knowing 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.570
 than inside so we have a 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.840
 main compartment with a pocket 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.840
 water and an outflow of losses 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:42.020
 we also have accessory doors to 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.930
 each side with 4 clamping slopes 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.909
 which are quite practical 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.490
 so we really have a bag that is the 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:54.369
 times bulky with many 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.420
 pockets so very functional of course 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.959
 the straps are adjustable 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.909
 we have a chest strap with a 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.429
 little whistle of relief so he goes 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.459
 appear to carry the bag very 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.679
 stable whether it's walking and in 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.690
 also running to give you a 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.720
