like this blaster I can't find money
philosoph<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.309> besides<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.570> when<00:00:12.690> you

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
philosoph this besides that and when you

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.169 
philosoph this besides that and when you
fire<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.080> kind<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.650> bumps<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.099> your<00:00:14.250> shot<00:00:14.580> kind

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.460 
fire it kind of bumps up your shot kind
of<00:00:15.240> screwing<00:00:15.570> up<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:15.900> eventually<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.410> a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
of screwing up but eventually it's a

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.660 
of screwing up but eventually it's a
learning<00:00:16.770> curve<00:00:16.949> you'll<00:00:17.190> eventually<00:00:17.369> get

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
learning curve you'll eventually get

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.689 
learning curve you'll eventually get
used<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.090> after<00:00:18.270> deskey<00:00:18.840> use<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.490> don't

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
used to after deskey use and I don't

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.250 
used to after deskey use and I don't
have<00:00:20.850> much<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> problem<00:00:21.570> with<00:00:21.689> accuracy

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
have much of a problem with accuracy

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.620 
have much of a problem with accuracy
anymore<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.730> actually<00:00:24.029> quite<00:00:24.150> decent

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
anymore and it's actually quite decent

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
anymore and it's actually quite decent
it's<00:00:24.779> kind<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.080> like<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.410> knight<00:00:25.980> finder<00:00:26.340> I'd

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it's kind of like a knight finder I'd

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.890 
it's kind of like a knight finder I'd
have<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.789> say<00:00:26.939> when<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> actually<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.840> down

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
have to say when you actually get down

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800 
have to say when you actually get down
the<00:00:28.260> accuracy<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.760> candle<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the accuracy so the candle is not the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.999 
the accuracy so the candle is not the
most<00:00:30.960> comfortable<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
most comfortable it's kind of like a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.020 
most comfortable it's kind of like a
square-shaped

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
square-shaped

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.870 
square-shaped
which<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> huge<00:00:33.899> fan<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.219> still

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
excellent for the handle to slam tower

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.549 
excellent for the handle to slam tower
handle<00:00:41.790> there's<00:00:42.300> no<00:00:42.719> trigger<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.260> which

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
then spins does a full rotation

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.510 
then spins does a full rotation
ratcheting<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.379> pretty<00:00:58.590> cool<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.280> load

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
ratcheting is pretty cool and you load

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.090 
ratcheting is pretty cool and you load
it<00:00:59.699> by<00:00:59.789> putting<00:01:00.230> these<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.469> darts<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
it by putting these little darts in the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
it by putting these little darts in the
front<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> little<00:01:02.670> boom<00:01:03.090> co<00:01:03.300> darts<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
front there a little boom co darts and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.660 
front there a little boom co darts and
there<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.140> smaller<00:01:04.530> than<00:01:04.739> Earth<00:01:04.920> darts<00:01:05.369> in

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
there are smaller than Earth darts in

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.030 
there are smaller than Earth darts in
diameter<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.229> they're<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.920> they're

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
diameter but they're I think they're

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560 
diameter but they're I think they're
about<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> same<00:01:08.580> length<00:01:08.760> i'll<00:01:09.030> go<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.330> wood

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
about the same length i'll go get wood

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.000 
about the same length i'll go get wood
got<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.080> compare<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.710> guys<00:01:13.010> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
got one and compare it to you guys you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980 
got one and compare it to you guys you
can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> length<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.540> starts<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
can see the length or this starts a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.789 
can see the length or this starts a
little<00:01:16.110> longer

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
little longer

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
little longer
it's<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:17.460> diameter<00:01:18.680> easily<00:01:19.680> smaller<00:01:20.479> genious

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it's our diameter easily smaller genious

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.300 
it's our diameter easily smaller genious
look<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.990> pushing<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.530> holds<00:01:22.979> eight<00:01:23.130> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
look if I pushing in holds eight of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
look if I pushing in holds eight of
these<00:01:23.430> boom<00:01:23.640> co<00:01:23.850> darts<00:01:24.240> gets<00:01:24.810> Rangers<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.409> 70

these boom co darts gets Rangers of 70

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
these boom co darts gets Rangers of 70
feet<00:01:25.950> tested<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.270> does<00:01:27.450> work<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> comes

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
feet tested it does work and it comes

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
feet tested it does work and it comes
with<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.409> little<00:01:28.740> so-called<00:01:29.610> shield<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.210> here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
with a little so-called shield on here

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
with a little so-called shield on here
that's<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> pop-up<00:01:31.200> shield<00:01:31.500> which<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.829> really

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that's the pop-up shield which I really

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
that's the pop-up shield which I really
think<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:32.670> cool<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.450> can't<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
think it's really cool but I can't see a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.560 
think it's really cool but I can't see a
really<00:01:34.409> useful<00:01:34.979> purpose<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.759> darkus<00:01:36.240> was<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
really useful purpose and darkus was to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.660 
really useful purpose and darkus was to
stick<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.560> let's<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.799> stop<00:01:38.250> talking

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
stick to it so let's just stop talking
