the<00:01:19.830> future<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> ever<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.820> me<00:01:21.000> jumping

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the future if you ever see me jumping

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.230 
the future if you ever see me jumping
and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.290> randomly<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:23.520> almost<00:01:24.000> for

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and then I like randomly like almost for

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.210 
and then I like randomly like almost for
no<00:01:24.360> reason<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.229> ground<00:01:25.470> pound<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
no reason if I do the ground pound the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
no reason if I do the ground pound the
only<00:01:26.520> reason<00:01:26.850> why<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
only reason why I do that is because the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.749 
only reason why I do that is because the
L<00:01:28.200> button<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.009> controller<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> really

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
L button on this controller is really

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
L button on this controller is really
sensitive<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.590> barely<00:01:31.890> touch<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
sensitive and if I just barely touch it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.550 
sensitive and if I just barely touch it
down<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.820> it'll<00:01:33.210> use<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.689> attack<00:01:34.049> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
down at all it'll use that attack so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.530 
down at all it'll use that attack so
yeah

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
yeah

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.760 
yeah
you<00:01:36.540> ain't<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.869> keep<00:01:37.079> moving<00:01:37.350> along<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you ain't just keep moving along the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.890 
you ain't just keep moving along the
tail<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.430> dodge<00:01:39.329> these<00:01:39.659> crushers

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
tail and dodge these crushers

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.900 
tail and dodge these crushers
and<00:01:42.350> right<00:01:42.770> after<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.340> course<00:01:43.370> is<00:01:43.790> going

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
and right after this of course is going

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.600 
and right after this of course is going
to<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:44.210> more<00:01:44.590> shard<00:01:45.590> collecting<00:01:46.190> so<00:01:46.400> there's

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
to be more shard collecting so there's

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.250 
to be more shard collecting so there's
gonna<00:01:46.700> be<00:01:46.790> more<00:01:47.030> music<00:01:47.420> for<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:47.750> don't<00:01:48.110> worry

that's<00:01:55.430> just<00:01:55.760> how<00:01:55.880> sensitive<00:01:56.300> is<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.810> is

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
that's just how sensitive is it it is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.460 
that's just how sensitive is it it is
it's<00:01:57.200> just<00:01:57.440> weird<00:01:58.780> save<00:01:59.780> those<00:02:00.050> ones<00:02:00.290> for

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
so here's number four and this one is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.070 
so here's number four and this one is
just<00:02:13.070> plain<00:02:13.760> easy<00:02:14.270> there's<00:02:14.690> nothing

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
just plain easy there's nothing

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
challenging about this one the only

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.270 
challenging about this one the only
thing<00:02:16.820> challenging<00:02:17.810> about<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.980> just

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
thing challenging about this is just

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.190 
thing challenging about this is just
touching<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.360> heart<00:02:20.570> itself<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.140> just

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
touching the heart itself and just

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.960 
touching the heart itself and just
picking<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.680> up<00:02:21.770> because<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.280> appears<00:02:22.760> like

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
picking it up because it appears like

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.800 
picking it up because it appears like
right<00:02:23.210> above<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.810> death<00:02:24.740> pit<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:26.300> could<00:02:26.540> kick

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
right above the death pit it could kick

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.030 
right above the death pit it could kick
him<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:28.460> you<00:02:28.670> come<00:02:28.790> right<00:02:28.970> back<00:02:29.120> up<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.450> bones
