00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.850 
to play this game yeah there it is and
this<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.350> I'll<00:02:37.560> put<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:39.260> alright<00:02:40.260> so

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
this one I'll put it there alright so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.450 
this one I'll put it there alright so
this<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.370> windows<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.650> seems<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.190> little<00:02:44.280> bit

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
this is windows so it seems a little bit

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.760 
this is windows so it seems a little bit
laggy<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:45.030> but<00:02:45.900> maybe<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.320> because<00:02:46.440> it's

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
laggy this but maybe it's because it's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.020 
laggy this but maybe it's because it's
far<00:02:47.010> away<00:02:47.100> or<00:02:47.580> maybe<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.240> because<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:50.030> don't

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
far away or maybe it's because I don't

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.180 
far away or maybe it's because I don't

remote desktop needs to be like made for
full<00:03:39.209> screen<00:03:39.570> somehow<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.320> there<00:03:40.800> needs<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.100> be

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
full screen somehow so there needs to be

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.580 
full screen somehow so there needs to be
some<00:03:41.400> kind<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:42.020> armor<00:03:43.020> some<00:03:43.260> different
