 38-year-old Ukrainian Vladimir Klitschko and 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.500
 35-year-old Bulgarian Kubrata Puleva 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.449
 it is worth noting that the bullet refused 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 pay the applicant these fees for iso 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.090
 w b &amp; w white so kana for him 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.070
 there was only a belt dinner a duel barely 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.260
 had time to begin and the first thing that viewers 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.760
 saw in the frame it was a clinch and a referee 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 tony wax fight back in the first half 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.630
 the round made a couple of comments about 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.160
 clinch 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.780
 the first significant blow of the battle was struck by a bullet 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.309
 catching jab vladimir who 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.309
 tried to hold his attack 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.079
 after some time, the cool was again inflicted 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.730
 two jabs in the body the first seconds of the battle 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.230
 Kubrata could act jab 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.230
 more successful than you could imagine 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.879
 but at the beginning 2 minutes of the battle is already Vladimir 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.289
 Klitschko demonstrated his skill 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.210
 act with your front hand 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.559
 hard left hook eventually became the key 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 a blow of the whole duel 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.100
 evidence rose not without effort but to all 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.700
 his views made it clear that not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700
 impressed 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.120
 immediately after that he reappeared 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.010
 on the flooring but as the replay showed 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.380
 Vladimir did not put him a single clean 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.910
 hitting klitschko's left hand slid along 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.890
 bullet chin and then began 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.510
 roll back but on the whole 2 sometimes 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.250
 he became the result of the first after 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.619
 whose bullets have not fully recovered 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 for the remaining time vladimir succeeded 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.070
 hold a few accurate from the window 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.070
 send an opponent to the deck, he more 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.630
 failed for a break Bulgarian boxer 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.000
 fully recovered and the second round 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.800
 like the first one started juicy jaba further 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.750
 a shootout of jabs followed and 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.830
 the outcome of the first minute of the round Klitschko inflicted 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.899
 right forehand 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:54.660
 Overall, the second round turned out to be not rich in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:56.729
 events third round and shootout again 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.250
 jabs recycle vladimir klitschko 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.960
 jab is almost impossible but bullet 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.050
 at times did this competition 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.910
 competitive but jab is only part 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.130
 big game and when vladimir klitschko 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.840
 connected other painting tools 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.790
 the wallpaper changed dramatically ceased to be 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.980
 competitive klitschko inflicts the most powerful 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.350
 forehand after which the bullets barely 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.510
 kept on his feet and 15 seconds later 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.220
 the entrance is already very familiar bullet 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.180
 were you a hook which creates quite 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.180
 spectacular knockdown 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.659
 unlike the first round the nickname after 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.670
 knockdown behaves more actively and tries 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.439
 to develop success Vladimir inflicted several 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.810
 hard kicks but continue the series 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.760
 knockdowns he fails after such 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.230
 events of the previous round was difficult 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.329
 expect any success from the bullets 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.250
 but the fourth round of the Bulgarian boxer 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.109
 started with very good attacks striking 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.090
 on the right and then on the left along this 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.950
 three-minute boxers exchanged successful 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.989
 attacks and in general this round turned out 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.939
 surprisingly competitive takes into account 3 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.269
 traveling on the flooring who made 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.269
 cool 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.280
 fifth round started tough yet 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.909
 champion for a split second bullet was 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.989
 shocked 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:16.060
 but quickly recovered a little more than 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.129
 a minute before the end of the kubrat bullet holds 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.500
 successful attack similar to the one that he 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.239
 succeeded in the previous round in response to 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.859
 This is Vladimir Klitschko used his 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.500
 the most formidable weapon in this fight 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.180
 the left hook because the bullets fell was 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.859
 it is clear that he will not rise 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.870
 but we must pay tribute to the strong-willed 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.209
 Qubrat qualities he tried to do it 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.159
 moreover, it should be noted that 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.780
 after three knockdowns he did not give up 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.209
 continued to attack and render 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.159
 champions resistance Vladimir Klitschko 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.049
 doesn't often use the left hook but 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.209
 when using a rival account 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.010
 tight probably before this fight boxer and 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.900
 his team discovered vulnerability 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.970
 u either before this blow and vladimir 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.979
 paid special attention to this component 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.530
 which ultimately led to a spectacular victory 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.329
 the outcome of the battle was a confident victory over 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.489
 rival who previously entered into 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.919
 top 3 strongest of his weight and did not have 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.629
 defeats worth noting that in the past 5 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.669
 fights klitschko won four times 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.530
 rivals who dubai with him did not have 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.229
 over the years of defeat 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.479
 championship which lasts since 2006 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:16.209
 Vladimir Klitschko selected 7 digits of the graph 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:18.190
 defeat Vladimir Klitschko 17 times 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.810
 defended his world champion title 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.810
 heavyweight and for this indicator 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.810
 second only to larry holmes 20 defenses and 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.550
 joe luis 25 title defenders beyond that he 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.050
 not once again confirmed 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.120
 championship status but also status 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.240
 the strongest heavyweight on planet a 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.650
 also one of the strongest boxers in the world 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.570
 according to shock statistics lumps box 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.599
 Klitschko struck 17 power strikes 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.710
 scorch 15 quantity difference 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.840
 insignificant but in the case of Vladimir 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.350
 Klitschko is quality and gravity 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.330
 hitting about these components 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.630
 his weight category is not yet 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.630
 equal
