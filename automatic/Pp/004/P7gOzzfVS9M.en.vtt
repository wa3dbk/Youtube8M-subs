00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.269 
in my previous video I dyed it red and
it<00:00:26.939> didn't<00:00:27.330> really<00:00:27.539> turn<00:00:27.930> out<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.109> great<00:00:28.800> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it didn't really turn out that great so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.930 
it didn't really turn out that great so
I<00:00:29.580> used<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.599> Jen<00:00:31.520> dark<00:00:32.520> brown<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.890> diet<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.790> its

natural color which is well that brown
almost<00:00:38.879> black<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.140> how<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.410> turned<00:00:40.680> out

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
almost black so that's how it turned out

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.000 
almost black so that's how it turned out
so<00:00:41.390> at<00:00:42.390> least<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.760> has<00:00:44.760> been<00:00:44.969> taken<00:00:45.270> care<00:00:45.480> of

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.610 
well that's about it so I'm still
hanging<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.230> there<00:02:21.870> I'm<00:02:22.870> pretty<00:02:23.140> confident

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
hanging in there I'm pretty confident

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.559 
hanging in there I'm pretty confident
that<00:02:23.830> they're<00:02:24.130> gonna<00:02:24.280> look<00:02:24.489> nice<00:02:24.730> whenever<00:02:25.299> I

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
that they're gonna look nice whenever I

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.690 
that they're gonna look nice whenever I
get<00:02:25.840> there<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:26.860> i<00:02:26.890> think<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.489> journey

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
get there but i think that the journey

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.660 
get there but i think that the journey
is<00:02:27.940> going<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.269> be<00:02:28.420> very<00:02:28.450> long<00:02:29.110> especially<00:02:29.709> with

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
is going to be very long especially with

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.830 
is going to be very long especially with
these<00:02:30.850> little<00:02:31.120> twists<00:02:31.900> in<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.410> front<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
these little twists in the front on the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.270 
these little twists in the front on the
sides<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.920> hair<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:37.349> coyly<00:02:38.349> not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
on the sides I don't know why and the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.830 
on the sides I don't know why and the
