00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
one it's a left-hander and what's

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.860 
one it's a left-hander and what's
interesting<00:00:39.760> about<00:00:40.030> this<00:00:40.240> is<00:00:40.300> it's<00:00:40.510> very

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
interesting about this is it's very

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.050 
interesting about this is it's very
similar<00:00:41.230> on<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.830> exit<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.370> Turkey<00:00:42.790> isn't<00:00:42.970> it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
similar on the exit to Turkey isn't it

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.280 
similar on the exit to Turkey isn't it
reminds<00:00:43.300> me<00:00:43.360> so<00:00:43.600> much<00:00:43.660> then<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:44.080> way<00:00:44.170> it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
reminds me so much then the way it

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.930 
reminds me so much then the way it
sweeps<00:00:44.800> down<00:00:44.920> hill<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.400> right<00:00:45.460> we've<00:00:45.820> been

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
sweeps down hill to the right we've been

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.100 
sweeps down hill to the right we've been
down<00:00:46.060> to<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.270> right-hander<00:00:46.660> this<00:00:46.810> is<00:00:46.960> where

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
down to the right-hander this is where

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.540 
down to the right-hander this is where
you've<00:00:47.230> really<00:00:47.440> got<00:00:47.560> your<00:00:47.680> DRS<00:00:48.070> open<00:00:48.400> it's

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
you've really got your DRS open it's

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.460 
you've really got your DRS open it's
very<00:00:48.820> very<00:00:49.120> tempting<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.600> keep<00:00:49.840> it<00:00:49.960> open<00:00:50.050> too

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
very very tempting to keep it open too

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.140 
very very tempting to keep it open too
long<00:00:50.500> into<00:00:50.950> that<00:00:51.070> corner<00:00:51.280> really<00:00:51.640> unsettling

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
long into that corner really unsettling

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.270 
long into that corner really unsettling
to<00:00:52.300> this<00:00:52.420> sequence<00:00:52.810> here<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.830> in<00:00:53.980> two<00:00:54.130> three

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
eight and nine a bit more of the same

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.999 
eight and nine a bit more of the same
again<00:01:10.329> reminiscent<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.079> turkey<00:01:11.530> then<00:01:11.829> we're

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
again reminiscent of turkey then we're

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.279 
again reminiscent of turkey then we're
dropping<00:01:12.369> down<00:01:12.609> hill<00:01:12.909> out<00:01:13.090> of<00:01:13.270> ten<00:01:13.539> towards

dropping down hill out of ten towards
the<00:01:14.409> left<00:01:14.619> hand<00:01:14.920> hairpin<00:01:15.280> loads<00:01:15.609> of<00:01:15.820> grand

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
stands on the right and the left this is

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.739 
stands on the right and the left this is
a<00:01:17.679> bit<00:01:17.979> like<00:01:18.159> Abu<00:01:18.490> Dhabi's<00:01:18.820> hairpin<00:01:19.270> but<00:01:19.630> it's

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:19.749 
a bit like Abu Dhabi's hairpin but it's

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.270 
a bit like Abu Dhabi's hairpin but it's
also<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:20.049> bit<00:01:20.200> like<00:01:20.380> Montreal<00:01:20.679> in<00:01:21.039> reverse

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
also a bit like Montreal in reverse

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.349 
also a bit like Montreal in reverse
because<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.579> go<00:01:21.700> around<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:21.999> the<00:01:22.030> left<00:01:22.119> hand

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
because you go around to the left hand

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.700 
because you go around to the left hand
side<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.840> then<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.109> course<00:01:23.140> out<00:01:23.469> of<00:01:23.619> the

side and then of course out of the
hairpin<00:01:24.009> onto<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:24.369> long<00:01:24.670> straight<00:01:24.999> this<00:01:25.390> is

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
hairpin onto this long straight this is

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.209 
hairpin onto this long straight this is
where<00:01:25.659> DRS<00:01:26.200> will<00:01:26.439> be<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.740> race<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:26.920> though

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
where DRS will be in the race and though

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:28.800 
where DRS will be in the race and though
you<00:01:27.249> plenty<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.700> overtaking<00:01:27.999> here<00:01:28.390> now<00:01:28.630> this

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
you plenty of overtaking here now this

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.959 
you plenty of overtaking here now this
is<00:01:29.020> such<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.380> huge<00:01:29.679> straight<00:01:30.039> as<00:01:30.189> awesome<00:01:30.820> but

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
is such a huge straight as awesome but

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.910 
is such a huge straight as awesome but
it's<00:01:31.210> really<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.780> conundrum<00:01:32.170> for<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.499> drivers

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
it's really a conundrum for the drivers

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.260 
it's really a conundrum for the drivers
to<00:01:33.069> whether<00:01:33.219> or<00:01:33.310> not<00:01:33.340> set<00:01:33.609> up<00:01:33.700> for<00:01:33.729> qualifying

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
to whether or not set up for qualifying

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.459 
to whether or not set up for qualifying
for<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.569> race<00:01:34.749> you<00:01:34.869> can<00:01:34.990> get<00:01:35.079> a<00:01:35.109> huge

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
for the race you can get a huge

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.950 
for the race you can get a huge
advantage<00:01:35.619> with<00:01:36.249> top<00:01:36.789> speed<00:01:37.090> there<00:01:37.329> another

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
advantage with top speed there another

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.389 
advantage with top speed there another
hairpin<00:01:38.380> at<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.619> end<00:01:38.770> then<00:01:38.979> so<00:01:39.189> great

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
hairpin at the end then so great

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.770 
hairpin at the end then so great
opportunity<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:39.969> go<00:01:40.060> on<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.270> inside<00:01:40.539> or<00:01:40.749> the

that's another tricky isn't it really
tight<00:01:53.710> technically<00:01:54.579> me<00:01:54.729> losing<00:01:54.969> it<00:01:55.179> there

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
tight technically me losing it there

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.270 
tight technically me losing it there
yeah<00:01:55.569> you<00:01:56.229> made<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.409> mistake<00:01:56.560> how<00:01:56.920> many<00:01:57.069> times

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
yeah you made a mistake how many times

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.649 
yeah you made a mistake how many times
you've<00:01:57.460> driven<00:01:57.670> this<00:01:57.880> circuit<00:01:58.240> anyway

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
you've driven this circuit anyway

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.239 
you've driven this circuit anyway
following<00:01:59.079> up<00:01:59.200> on<00:01:59.319> this<00:01:59.530> although<00:02:00.130> the

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249 
following up on this although the

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:01.800 
following up on this although the
approach<00:02:00.549> speed<00:02:00.819> is<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:00.969> lot<00:02:01.179> lower<00:02:01.329> it's

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
approach speed is a lot lower it's

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.879 
approach speed is a lot lower it's
something<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.109> reminds<00:02:02.319> me<00:02:02.439> a<00:02:02.469> lot<00:02:02.829> of

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
something that reminds me a lot of

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.830 
something that reminds me a lot of
turkey<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:03.999> triple<00:02:04.299> a<00:02:04.359> bag<00:02:04.569> sir

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
turkey that triple a bag sir

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.599 
turkey that triple a bag sir
right-hander<00:02:05.619> there's<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.859> really<00:02:06.399> really

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
right-hander there's a really really

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.160 
right-hander there's a really really
nice<00:02:06.880> part<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:07.359> track<00:02:07.539> one<00:02:07.659> of<00:02:07.749> my<00:02:07.840> favorite

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
nice part the track one of my favorite

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.630 
nice part the track one of my favorite
parts<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.590> track<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.979> think<00:02:09.220> through<00:02:09.429> these

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
parts of the track I think through these

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.580 
parts of the track I think through these
these<00:02:10.149> are<00:02:10.209> latter<00:02:10.690> corners<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.200> can<00:02:11.260> find

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
these are latter corners you can find

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.340 
these are latter corners you can find
drivers<00:02:11.890> locking<00:02:12.190> up<00:02:12.310> left<00:02:12.520> right<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.820> center

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
drivers locking up left right and center

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.150 
drivers locking up left right and center
it's<00:02:14.350> going<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.500> be<00:02:14.590> pretty<00:02:14.680> tough<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:15.070> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
it's going to be pretty tough on the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.309 
it's going to be pretty tough on the
tires<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.730> go<00:02:15.880> tell<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.150> turn<00:02:16.330> 19

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
tires so go tell you turn 19

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.470 
tires so go tell you turn 19
is<00:02:17.379> another<00:02:17.650> left<00:02:18.189> followed<00:02:18.459> by<00:02:18.579> another<00:02:18.849> left

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
is another left followed by another left

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.199 
is another left followed by another left
to<00:02:20.379> turn<00:02:20.980> 20<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.579> onto<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.760> pit<00:02:21.999> straight

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
to turn 20 and onto the pit straight

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.780 
to turn 20 and onto the pit straight
again<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.689> that<00:02:23.079> is<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.319> lap<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.889> Austin<00:02:24.579> Texas

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
again and that is a lap of Austin Texas

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.270 
again and that is a lap of Austin Texas
and<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.840> me<00:02:26.049> Steve<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.709> seems<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.249> a

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and to me Steve it seems like a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.610 
and to me Steve it seems like a
combination<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.389> it's<00:02:28.870> obviously<00:02:29.139> home<00:02:29.349> until

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
combination of it's obviously home until

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.640 
combination of it's obviously home until
coat<00:02:29.829> rack<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.249> very<00:02:30.519> very<00:02:30.819> similar<00:02:31.120> to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
coat rack it's very very similar to

coat rack it's very very similar to
imparts<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.709> Turkey<00:02:33.249> there's<00:02:33.579> a<00:02:33.670> little<00:02:33.819> bit

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
imparts to Turkey there's a little bit

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.339 
imparts to Turkey there's a little bit
of<00:02:34.060> silver<00:02:34.359> stone<00:02:34.629> in<00:02:34.750> there<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.959> little<00:02:35.109> bit

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
of silver stone in there a little bit

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.289 
of silver stone in there a little bit
possibly<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.069> career<00:02:36.459> towards<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:37.000> end<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.239> the

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
possibly a career towards the end of the

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.119 
possibly a career towards the end of the
lap<00:02:37.510> fascinating<00:02:38.319> track<00:02:38.530> very<00:02:38.739> much<00:02:38.889> so<00:02:38.950> I

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
lap fascinating track very much so I

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.470 
lap fascinating track very much so I
mean<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.430> was<00:02:39.819> looking<00:02:40.060> forward<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.299> driving

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
mean I was looking forward to driving

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.240 
mean I was looking forward to driving
this<00:02:40.719> circuit<00:02:41.170> not<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.560> was<00:02:41.650> wondering

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
this circuit not but I was wondering

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.860 
this circuit not but I was wondering
about<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.670> actual<00:02:42.790> quality<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.659> track

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
about the actual quality of the track

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.000 
about the actual quality of the track
whether<00:02:44.109> or<00:02:44.230> not<00:02:44.290> would<00:02:44.409> be<00:02:44.500> enjoyable<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
whether or not would be enjoyable to

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.159 
whether or not would be enjoyable to
drive<00:02:45.040> I've<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:46.269> enjoyed<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:46.749> circuit

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:47.169 
drive I've really enjoyed that circuit

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.629 
drive I've really enjoyed that circuit
so<00:02:47.319> it's<00:02:47.469> a<00:02:47.560> great<00:02:47.769> great<00:02:48.099> addition<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.549> the

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
so it's a great great addition to the

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.480 
so it's a great great addition to the
calendar<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.419> year
