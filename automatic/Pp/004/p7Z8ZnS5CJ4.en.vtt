00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
like an intricate updo so I wanted to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
come up with something that I thought

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.400 
come up with something that I thought
would<00:00:17.369> be<00:00:17.430> easy<00:00:17.820> simple<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.720> fast<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.289> I

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
would be easy simple and fast and I

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.050 
would be easy simple and fast and I
think<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.830> I've<00:00:19.920> done<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.820> was

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
think that I've done that this was

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.670 
think that I've done that this was
inspired<00:00:21.449> by<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.750> White<00:00:21.990> Queen<00:00:22.170> which<00:00:22.500> was<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
inspired by the White Queen which was a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.650 
inspired by the White Queen which was a
mini-series<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.430> stars<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.240> lot<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.600> you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
mini-series on stars I know a lot of you

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.050 
mini-series on stars I know a lot of you
guys<00:00:24.779> watched<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.619> liked<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.699> it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
guys watched it and liked it so it

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.700 
guys watched it and liked it so it
definitely<00:00:27.240> has<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> medieval<00:00:28.320> esque

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
definitely has a medieval esque

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470

feeling<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
feeling to it but I think that it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.359 
feeling to it but I think that it
translates<00:00:30.810> pretty<00:00:31.199> well<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.619> modern<00:00:32.040> women

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
translates pretty well on modern women

now<00:00:50.810> I'm<00:00:50.960> going<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.170> divide<00:00:51.320> my<00:00:51.710> hair<00:00:51.740> into<00:00:52.010> two

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
pieces but there's going to be more hair

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.170 
pieces but there's going to be more hair
in<00:00:54.500> this<00:00:54.620> top<00:00:54.950> section<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.610> less<00:00:55.850> in<00:00:56.060> the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
in this top section and less in the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.330 
in this top section and less in the
other<00:00:56.330> side<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.990> with<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.650> underside<00:00:58.160> I'm

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
other side and with the underside I'm

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.280 
other side and with the underside I'm
going<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.640> split<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.090> in<00:00:59.210> two<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.480> create<00:00:59.840> two

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
going to split it in two and create two

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.840 
going to split it in two and create two
more<00:01:00.530> rope<00:01:00.770> braids

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.460 

when<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:09.880> finish<00:01:10.270> braiding<00:01:10.540> I<00:01:10.780> decided<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.350> run

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
when I finish braiding I decided to run

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.020 
when I finish braiding I decided to run
a<00:01:11.500> curling<00:01:11.920> iron<00:01:12.070> through<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.520> rest<00:01:12.700> of<00:01:12.880> my

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
a curling iron through the rest of my

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.270 
a curling iron through the rest of my
hair<00:01:13.350> obviously<00:01:14.350> this<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.680> an<00:01:14.800> optional<00:01:15.220> step

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
hair obviously this is an optional step

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.130 
hair obviously this is an optional step
but<00:01:15.550> I<00:01:15.790> definitely<00:01:16.060> felt<00:01:16.659> like<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.930> curl

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
but I definitely felt like the curl

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.460 
but I definitely felt like the curl
added<00:01:17.560> something<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.159> hairstyle<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
added something to the hairstyle this

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.499 
added something to the hairstyle this
ribbon<00:01:20.860> came<00:01:21.070> from<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.400> local<00:01:21.549> drugstore<00:01:21.940> and

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
ribbon came from a local drugstore and

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.330 
ribbon came from a local drugstore and
it's<00:01:22.690> meant<00:01:22.930> for<00:01:22.990> wrapping<00:01:23.470> presents<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.159> it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
it's meant for wrapping presents so it's

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.830 
it's meant for wrapping presents so it's
not<00:01:24.460> really<00:01:24.759> expensive<00:01:25.180> at<00:01:25.450> all<00:01:25.540> but<00:01:25.810> I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840
