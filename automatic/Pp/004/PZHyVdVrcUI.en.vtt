00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
production tax etc to you but you can

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.970 
production tax etc to you but you can
increase<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.840> tariffs<00:02:22.200> they<00:02:22.350> pay<00:02:22.560> for<00:02:22.950> a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
increase the tariffs they pay for a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.440 
50 power for five percent tariff
increase<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.010> then<00:02:29.790> you've<00:02:29.910> squeezed<00:02:30.209> more

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
increase and then you've squeezed more

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.699 
increase and then you've squeezed more
and<00:02:30.630> more<00:02:30.750> money<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.169> of<00:02:31.199> your<00:02:31.470> colonies<00:02:32.449> but

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
and more money out of your colonies but

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.260 
and more money out of your colonies but
it's<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.799> slight<00:02:35.010> drawback<00:02:35.220> for<00:02:35.669> that

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
it's a slight drawback for that
