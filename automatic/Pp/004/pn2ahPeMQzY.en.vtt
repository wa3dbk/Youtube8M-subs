00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
through the double layers of fabric as

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.550 
through the double layers of fabric as
well<00:02:13.910> as<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.150> tissue<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:14.870> come<00:02:15.110> out<00:02:15.290> on

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
well as the tissue and we come out on

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.430 
well as the tissue and we come out on
the<00:02:15.590> opposite<00:02:16.280> side<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.790> dot<00:02:17.260> from<00:02:18.260> where

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
the opposite side of the dot from where

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.840 
the opposite side of the dot from where
we<00:02:18.560> started<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.310> pull<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.700> needle

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
we started and we pull the needle

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.640 
we started and we pull the needle
through<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.720> we<00:02:20.810> make<00:02:20.990> sure<00:02:21.020> our<00:02:21.200> threads

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
through and we make sure our threads

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.750 
through and we make sure our threads
don't<00:02:21.920> get<00:02:22.220> tangled<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:24.500> find<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.250> we've

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
don't get tangled and we find that we've

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.059 
don't get tangled and we find that we've
made<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.390> loop<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.110> it's<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.410> like<00:02:27.530> looping

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
made a loop so it's just like looping

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.710 
made a loop so it's just like looping
the<00:02:28.190> loop<00:02:28.540> with<00:02:29.540> our<00:02:29.750> sewing<00:02:30.020> thread<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.660> then

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
the loop with our sewing thread and then

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.650 
the loop with our sewing thread and then
we<00:02:33.260> take<00:02:33.440> our<00:02:33.620> scissors<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:34.880> cut<00:02:35.209> this

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
we take our scissors and we cut this

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.620 
we take our scissors and we cut this
this<00:02:36.230> thread<00:02:36.590> off<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.220> again<00:02:38.060> we<00:02:38.239> leave<00:02:38.450> about

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
this thread off and again we leave about

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.650 
this thread off and again we leave about
a<00:02:38.780> 10<00:02:39.170> centimeter<00:02:40.010> length<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:41.030> and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
a 10 centimeter length like that and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.259 
a 10 centimeter length like that and
that's<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.200> it's<00:02:42.590> as<00:02:42.739> simple<00:02:42.800> as<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
that's it it's as simple as that on the

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.449 
that's it it's as simple as that on the
back<00:02:44.480> on<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.870> other<00:02:45.019> side<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.920> looks<00:02:46.130> like

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
back on the other side it looks like

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.479 
back on the other side it looks like
this<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:48.470> looks<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.890> you've<00:02:49.040> made<00:02:49.250> two

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
this it looks like you've made two

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.940 
this it looks like you've made two
stitches<00:02:50.050> so<00:02:51.050> what<00:02:51.200> we're<00:02:51.320> going<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.560> do<00:02:51.739> next

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
stitches so what we're going to do next

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.740 
stitches so what we're going to do next
is<00:02:52.459> take<00:02:53.060> out<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.569> pins<00:02:54.670> from<00:02:55.670> our<00:02:55.910> from<00:02:56.630> our

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
is take out the pins from our from our

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.320 
is take out the pins from our from our
pattern<00:02:57.200> piece<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.190> remove<00:02:58.640> all<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.910> pins

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
pattern piece so you remove all the pins

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.670 
pattern piece so you remove all the pins
and<00:03:00.700> then<00:03:02.950> we<00:03:03.950> take<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.430> tissue<00:03:04.730> away<00:03:05.680> from

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
and then we take the tissue away from

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.770 
and then we take the tissue away from
the<00:03:07.069> material<00:03:09.700> which<00:03:10.700> means<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.480> will

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
the material which means we will

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.319 
the material which means we will
probably<00:03:12.050> tear<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.709> tissue<00:03:12.950> where<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.610> this

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
probably tear the tissue where this this

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.090 
probably tear the tissue where this this
little<00:03:14.540> tail<00:03:14.900> attack<00:03:15.200> stitch<00:03:15.470> has<00:03:15.650> been<00:03:15.860> made

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
little tail attack stitch has been made

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.319 
little tail attack stitch has been made
will<00:03:16.459> probably<00:03:16.970> make<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.420> little<00:03:17.840> hole<00:03:19.329> little

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
will probably make a little hole little

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.530 
will probably make a little hole little
tear<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:22.100> paper<00:03:22.549> pattern<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:23.299> that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
tear in the paper pattern but that

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.319 
tear in the paper pattern but that
doesn't<00:03:23.959> matter<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:25.489> then<00:03:25.730> we<00:03:25.820> do<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.000> same

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
doesn't matter and then we do the same

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.860 
doesn't matter and then we do the same
to<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.660> one<00:03:26.810> at<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:26.989> bottom<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.870> and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
to the one at the bottom like that and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.729 
to the one at the bottom like that and
we're<00:03:33.019> left<00:03:33.230> with<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:35.019> what<00:03:36.019> we<00:03:36.200> need<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.500> do

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
we're left with this what we need to do

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.890 
we're left with this what we need to do
is<00:03:37.070> then<00:03:37.459> split<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.570> two<00:03:38.920> person<00:03:39.920> pieces<00:03:40.900> so

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
is then split the two person pieces so

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.780 
is then split the two person pieces so
we'll<00:03:42.170> we're<00:03:42.890> going<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.070> take<00:03:43.310> your<00:03:43.489> part

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
we'll we're going to take your part

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.150 
we'll we're going to take your part
because<00:03:44.269> but<00:03:44.720> we've<00:03:45.200> got<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.500> do<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:46.010> make

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
because but we've got to do that to make

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.940 
because but we've got to do that to make
our<00:03:46.430> pocket<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.480> I'm<00:03:47.690> pulling<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.260> material

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
our pocket so I'm pulling the material

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.390 
our pocket so I'm pulling the material
apart<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:50.660> as<00:03:50.959> far<00:03:51.200> as<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.590> loop<00:03:51.799> will<00:03:52.100> allow

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
apart for as far as the loop will allow

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.270 
apart for as far as the loop will allow
me<00:03:53.170> not<00:03:54.170> putting<00:03:54.440> it<00:03:54.530> too<00:03:54.680> much<00:03:54.920> because<00:03:55.160> we

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
me not putting it too much because we

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.770 
me not putting it too much because we
don't<00:03:55.579> want<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.120> whole<00:03:56.299> thing<00:03:56.329> to<00:03:56.570> come

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
don't want the whole thing to come

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.050 
don't want the whole thing to come
unraveled<00:03:56.959> and<00:03:57.709> then<00:03:58.280> we<00:03:58.400> take<00:03:58.579> our<00:03:58.820> scissors

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
unraveled and then we take our scissors

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.280 
unraveled and then we take our scissors
and<00:03:59.570> we<00:04:00.320> cut<00:04:00.680> through<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.340> middle<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.940> the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
and we cut through the middle of the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.740 
and we cut through the middle of the
tack<00:04:03.290> between<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.459> two<00:04:04.730> layers<00:04:05.239> of<00:04:05.390> fabric

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
tack between the two layers of fabric

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.620 
tack between the two layers of fabric
and<00:04:06.109> we<00:04:06.680> do<00:04:06.799> that<00:04:07.010> on<00:04:07.370> both<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.700> our<00:04:08.000> pattern<00:04:08.390> on

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
and we do that on both of our pattern on

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.110 
and we do that on both of our pattern on
both<00:04:08.989> of<00:04:09.019> our<00:04:09.260> tailors<00:04:10.250> hacksaw<00:04:10.549> all<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.940> time

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
both of our tailors hacksaw all the time

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.849 
both of our tailors hacksaw all the time
attacks<00:04:11.480> for<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:11.989> pattern<00:04:12.350> please<00:04:12.560> whatever

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
attacks for that pattern please whatever

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.469 
attacks for that pattern please whatever
it<00:04:13.100> is<00:04:13.600> you're<00:04:14.600> marking<00:04:15.140> up<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:16.519> is<00:04:17.030> done

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.140 
and you can see now what the tail attack
looks<00:04:20.030> like<00:04:20.299> on<00:04:20.570> this
