an<00:04:10.049> eastbound<00:04:10.290> turn<00:04:10.950> on<00:04:11.190> one<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:11.970> these

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
an eastbound turn on one of these

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.089 
an eastbound turn on one of these
service<00:04:12.450> routes<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:12.840> on<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.109> north<00:04:13.290> mark<00:04:13.980> oh

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
service routes just on the north mark oh

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.009 
service routes just on the north mark oh
no<00:04:14.220> I'm<00:04:14.370> not<00:04:14.489> sure<00:04:14.670> if<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.849> can<00:04:15.000> hear<00:04:15.239> me<00:04:15.389> but

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
circling a familiar area and he seems to

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.170 
circling a familiar area and he seems to
be<00:04:21.660> circling<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.710> same<00:04:22.979> area<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.789> way<00:04:23.940> is

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
be circling the same area in a way is

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.240 
be circling the same area in a way is
there<00:04:24.660> any<00:04:24.960> way<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.410> they<00:04:25.710> could<00:04:25.889> put<00:04:26.099> down

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
there any way that they could put down

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.270 
there any way that they could put down
the<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.970> spike<00:04:27.240> strips<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.990> possibly<00:04:28.740> you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
the the spike strips to possibly you

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.300 
the the spike strips to possibly you
know<00:04:29.310> stop<00:04:29.729> him<00:04:29.970> at<00:04:30.120> some<00:04:30.330> point<00:04:30.830> well<00:04:31.830> sure<00:04:32.070> if

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
know stop him at some point well sure if

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.520 
know stop him at some point well sure if
they<00:04:32.490> establish<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> pattern<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.690> direction

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
they establish a pattern of direction

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.170 
they establish a pattern of direction
that<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.800> guy<00:04:34.979> seems<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.520> be<00:04:35.580> frequenting

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
that this guy seems to be frequenting

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.719 
that this guy seems to be frequenting
that<00:04:36.599> they<00:04:37.200> might<00:04:37.440> be<00:04:37.590> able<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.830> do<00:04:38.039> that<00:04:38.250> you

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
that they might be able to do that you

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.310 
that they might be able to do that you
know<00:04:38.849> for<00:04:38.880> example<00:04:39.120> he's<00:04:39.599> been<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:39.870> 109<00:04:40.289> a

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
know for example he's been on 109 a

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.779 
know for example he's been on 109 a
couple<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.770> times<00:04:40.950> he's<00:04:41.130> been<00:04:41.160> on<00:04:41.370> Imperial

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
couple of times he's been on Imperial

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.190 
couple of times he's been on Imperial
Highway<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.120> couple<00:04:42.419> of<00:04:42.510> times<00:04:42.750> he's<00:04:42.930> been<00:04:42.960> on

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
Highway a couple of times he's been on

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.810 
Highway a couple of times he's been on
Central<00:04:43.590> he's<00:04:43.710> been<00:04:43.860> on<00:04:43.950> Avalon<00:04:44.370> traveling

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
Central he's been on Avalon traveling

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.520 
Central he's been on Avalon traveling
north<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.180> southbound<00:04:45.599> so<00:04:45.750> yeah<00:04:45.900> if<00:04:46.260> they<00:04:46.440> are

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
north of southbound so yeah if they are

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.200 
north of southbound so yeah if they are
able<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.860> establish<00:04:47.099> some<00:04:47.580> sort<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.910> pattern

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
able to establish some sort of a pattern

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.400 
able to establish some sort of a pattern
in<00:04:48.330> his<00:04:48.479> driving<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.990> they're<00:04:49.080> able<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.289> get

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
in his driving and they're able to get

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.830 
in his driving and they're able to get
ahead<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.710> him<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.010> kind<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.580> see<00:04:51.300> which<00:04:51.510> way

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
ahead of him and kind of see which way

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.779 
ahead of him and kind of see which way
he<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:52.289> going<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:52.950> mean<00:04:53.099> yeah<00:04:53.460> they<00:04:53.610> might

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
he is going I mean yeah they might

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.670 
he is going I mean yeah they might
conceivably<00:04:54.419> lay<00:04:54.750> down<00:04:54.930> some<00:04:55.110> spike<00:04:55.380> strips

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
conceivably lay down some spike strips

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.110 
conceivably lay down some spike strips
and<00:04:55.860> get<00:04:55.950> ahead<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.220> them<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.550> made<00:04:56.970> those

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and get ahead of them and made those

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.270 
and get ahead of them and made those
down<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.539> begin<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.289> process<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.770> disabling

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
down and begin the process of disabling

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.370 
down and begin the process of disabling
the<00:04:59.400> car<00:04:59.640> so<00:04:59.940> far<00:04:59.969> we<00:05:00.780> have<00:05:01.020> not<00:05:01.229> seen<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.650> but

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
the car so far we have not seen that but

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.440 
the car so far we have not seen that but
you<00:05:02.590> would<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:03.310> would<00:05:03.490> assume<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.060> at<00:05:04.330> this

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
you would you would assume that at this

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.630 
you would you would assume that at this
point<00:05:04.690> given<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.560> fact<00:05:05.740> that<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:05.980> pursuit

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
point given the fact that this pursuit

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.250 
point given the fact that this pursuit
had<00:05:06.790> not<00:05:06.970> left<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.390> general<00:05:07.780> vicinity<00:05:07.870> that

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
had not left the general vicinity that

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.960 
had not left the general vicinity that
they<00:05:08.500> might<00:05:08.680> be<00:05:08.800> setting<00:05:09.010> up<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.250> do<00:05:09.370> just<00:05:09.640> that

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
they might be setting up to do just that

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.210 
they might be setting up to do just that
so<00:05:10.030> we<00:05:10.990> will<00:05:11.080> try<00:05:11.230> and<00:05:11.350> get<00:05:11.530> some<00:05:11.800> sort<00:05:12.160> of

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
so we will try and get some sort of

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.970 
so we will try and get some sort of
confirmation<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:12.970> see<00:05:13.900> if<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.230> in<00:05:14.530> fact<00:05:14.560> does

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
confirmation to see if that in fact does

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.560 
confirmation to see if that in fact does
happen<00:05:15.370> but<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.790> will<00:05:15.970> send<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.300> back<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.450> you

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
happen but I will send it back to you

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.540
