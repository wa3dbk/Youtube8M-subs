00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.610 
in the yard in his arms I think people
going<00:04:11.959> through<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.560> kind<00:04:12.950> of<00:04:13.069> catastrophic

going through this kind of catastrophic

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.449 
going through this kind of catastrophic
situation<00:04:17.290> perhaps<00:04:18.290> they<00:04:18.530> tend<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:19.010> think<00:04:19.220> as

I did that my situation is unique I'm

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.330 
I did that my situation is unique I'm
not<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:23.840> sure<00:04:23.870> that<00:04:24.080> that's<00:04:24.410> true<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:25.280> think

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
not so sure that that's true I think

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.060 
not so sure that that's true I think
there<00:04:25.970> are<00:04:26.000> more<00:04:26.389> things<00:04:26.720> in<00:04:27.020> common<00:04:27.080> than<00:04:27.620> not

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
there are more things in common than not

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.300 
there are more things in common than not
in<00:04:28.250> common<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.930> think<00:04:30.229> there's<00:04:30.770> much<00:04:31.070> to

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
in common and so I think there's much to

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.900 
in common and so I think there's much to
be<00:04:31.460> gained<00:04:32.260> from<00:04:33.260> knowing<00:04:34.010> what<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.400> expect

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
be gained from knowing what to expect

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.320 
be gained from knowing what to expect
when<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:35.750> receive<00:04:36.410> that<00:04:36.680> kind<00:04:36.979> of<00:04:37.330> diagnosis

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
when you receive that kind of diagnosis

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.090 
when you receive that kind of diagnosis
your<00:04:39.169> world<00:04:40.130> is<00:04:40.639> turned<00:04:41.180> upside<00:04:41.330> down<00:04:42.100> just

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
your world is turned upside down just

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.250 
your world is turned upside down just
instantly<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:45.440> first<00:04:46.660> emotional<00:04:47.660> reaction

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
instantly the first emotional reaction

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.840 
instantly the first emotional reaction
is<00:04:48.770> at<00:04:49.550> least<00:04:49.789> for<00:04:50.060> me<00:04:50.620> was<00:04:51.620> overwhelming<00:04:52.460> fear

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
is at least for me was overwhelming fear

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.840 
is at least for me was overwhelming fear
and<00:04:53.690> I<00:04:54.139> just<00:04:54.500> remember<00:04:55.070> feeling<00:04:55.340> as<00:04:55.669> though

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
and I just remember feeling as though

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.300 
and I just remember feeling as though
the<00:04:56.030> top<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.570> my<00:04:56.720> head<00:04:57.080> was<00:04:57.800> going<00:04:58.039> to<00:04:58.160> explode

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
the top of my head was going to explode

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.810 
the top of my head was going to explode
I<00:04:58.970> could<00:04:59.150> actually<00:04:59.360> feel<00:04:59.960> heat<00:05:00.440> at<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.430> top<00:05:01.669> of

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
I could actually feel heat at the top of

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.909 
I could actually feel heat at the top of
my<00:05:01.940> head<00:05:02.150> like<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.479> top<00:05:02.750> would<00:05:03.020> just<00:05:03.410> blow

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
my head like the top would just blow

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.480 
my head like the top would just blow
away<00:05:04.479> kind<00:05:05.479> of<00:05:05.539> funny<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:06.110> was<00:05:06.590> stretching<00:05:07.310> to

go<00:05:07.580> for<00:05:07.789> a<00:05:07.820> run<00:05:08.000> that'll<00:05:08.930> teach<00:05:09.080> me<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:11.330> I<00:05:11.389> felt

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
go for a run that'll teach me and I felt

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.640 
go for a run that'll teach me and I felt
this<00:05:11.750> big<00:05:11.960> lump

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
thrown into this really almost

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.690 
thrown into this really almost
physically<00:05:25.430> parallel<00:05:25.880> world

from one 30-second phone call to another
I<00:05:34.490> really<00:05:35.490> felt<00:05:35.790> that<00:05:36.060> I<00:05:36.510> would<00:05:36.900> survive<00:05:37.380> that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
I really felt that I would survive that

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.840 
I really felt that I would survive that
procedure<00:05:38.180> however<00:05:39.180> I<00:05:39.810> also<00:05:40.260> knew<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:41.070> I

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
procedure however I also knew that I

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.480 
procedure however I also knew that I
could<00:05:42.060> reduce<00:05:42.420> my<00:05:42.720> anxiety<00:05:43.040> by<00:05:44.040> making

could reduce my anxiety by making
preparations<00:05:45.300> for<00:05:46.280> various<00:05:47.280> scenarios<00:05:47.670> that

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
preparations for various scenarios that

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.540 
preparations for various scenarios that
might<00:05:48.420> occur<00:05:48.810> but<00:05:49.080> then<00:05:49.320> I<00:05:49.350> really<00:05:49.860> quickly

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
might occur but then I really quickly

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.300 
might occur but then I really quickly
moved<00:05:50.760> into<00:05:50.970> a<00:05:51.060> survival<00:05:51.720> mode<00:05:52.050> I<00:05:52.380> found<00:05:53.100> that

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
moved into a survival mode I found that
