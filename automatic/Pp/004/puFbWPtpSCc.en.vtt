again<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.879> can<00:03:20.030> see<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:20.300> this<00:03:20.390> channel<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.930> said

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
again you can see on this channel I said

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.080 
again you can see on this channel I said
there<00:03:21.830> are<00:03:21.920> two<00:03:21.980> types<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.489> expansions

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
there are two types of expansions

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.500 
there are two types of expansions
there's<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.660> kind<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.319> actually<00:03:25.300> keeps<00:03:26.300> the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
there's the kind that actually keeps the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.210 
there's the kind that actually keeps the
mechanic<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.379> original<00:03:27.860> mechanic

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
mechanic the original mechanic

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.890 
mechanic the original mechanic
consistent<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:28.970> just<00:03:29.120> expands<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.750> and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
consistent and just expands it and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.600 
consistent and just expands it and
there's<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.620> kind<00:03:30.920> that<00:03:31.190> actually<00:03:31.580> changes

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
there's the kind that actually changes

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.089 
there's the kind that actually changes
in<00:03:32.360> alters<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.080> original<00:03:33.410> mechanic<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:33.950> adds

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
in alters the original mechanic and adds

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.470 
in alters the original mechanic and adds
new<00:03:34.370> ones<00:03:34.599> korma<00:03:35.599> gettin<00:03:35.900> is<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:37.209> former<00:03:38.209> it's

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
new ones korma gettin is the former it's

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.320 
new ones korma gettin is the former it's
the<00:03:38.720> one<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.700> expands<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.880> game<00:03:41.060> by

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
the one that just expands the game by

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.699 
the one that just expands the game by
giving<00:03:41.599> you<00:03:41.690> more<00:03:41.870> creatures<00:03:42.110> more<00:03:42.470> spells

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
giving you more creatures more spells

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.039 
giving you more creatures more spells
more<00:03:43.310> variety<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.060> actually<00:03:44.599> correcting<00:03:45.019> a

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
more variety and actually correcting a

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.780 
more variety and actually correcting a
couple<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.590> things<00:03:45.830> that<00:03:46.340> were<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.489> little

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
couple of things that were a little

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.530 
couple of things that were a little
wonky<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.390> base<00:03:47.510> game<00:03:48.130> gladiator<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.549> the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
wonky in the base game gladiator is the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.979 
wonky in the base game gladiator is the
former<00:03:51.440> know<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.310> latter<00:03:52.580> it's<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.810> latter

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
former know the latter it's the latter

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.630 
former know the latter it's the latter
kind<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.530> expansion<00:03:55.069> where<00:03:55.220> there's<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.519> new

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
kind of expansion where there's a new

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.509 
kind of expansion where there's a new
mechanic<00:03:55.819> as<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.360> see<00:03:56.569> in<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.870> locking<00:03:57.519> the

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
mechanic as you see in the locking the

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.030 
mechanic as you see in the locking the
idea<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.569> having<00:03:59.780> certain<00:04:00.319> dice<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.829> lock

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
idea of having certain dice that lock

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.860 
idea of having certain dice that lock
into<00:04:01.250> place<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:01.849> has<00:04:02.299> an<00:04:02.420> effect<00:04:02.510> until

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
into place and that has an effect until

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.470 
into place and that has an effect until
that<00:04:03.110> lock<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.500> removed<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:03.950> for<00:04:04.790> someone<00:04:05.329> who

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
that lock is removed and for someone who

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.750 
that lock is removed and for someone who
has<00:04:05.630> played<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:06.319> heck<00:04:06.799> of<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.010> lot<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.190> warriors

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
has played a heck of a lot of warriors

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.000 
has played a heck of a lot of warriors
having<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.720> new<00:04:08.840> mechanic<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.440> throw<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:09.829> there

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
having a new mechanic to throw in there

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.150 
having a new mechanic to throw in there
is<00:04:10.220> probably<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.150> welcome<00:04:11.510> change<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:12.160> love

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
is probably a welcome change I love

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.670 
is probably a welcome change I love
warriors<00:04:13.940> i<00:04:14.120> love<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.540> base<00:04:14.660> game<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.260> i<00:04:15.560> have

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
warriors i love the base game and i have

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.289 
warriors i love the base game and i have
said<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.010> if<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.220> like<00:04:16.459> warriors<00:04:17.000> if<00:04:17.209> it

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
said that if you like warriors if it

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.909 
said that if you like warriors if it

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
gives you more of what makes quarry errs

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.810 
gives you more of what makes quarry errs
enjoyable<00:04:30.530> so<00:04:30.770> if<00:04:30.919> you<00:04:31.010> enjoyed<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.490> you

enjoyable so if you enjoyed it you
should<00:04:31.970> go<00:04:32.090> pick<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.300> up<00:04:32.479> klavier<00:04:33.260> is<00:04:33.440> one<00:04:33.680> of

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
should go pick it up klavier is one of

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.320 
should go pick it up klavier is one of
those<00:04:33.889> games<00:04:34.100> where<00:04:34.340> yeah<00:04:35.000> you<00:04:35.180> know<00:04:35.270> you

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
those games where yeah you know you

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.029 
those games where yeah you know you
could<00:04:35.600> take<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:35.900> or<00:04:35.990> leave<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.139> if<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.710> really

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
could take it or leave it if you really

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.320 
could take it or leave it if you really
want<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.340> try<00:04:37.460> something<00:04:37.669> different<00:04:37.789> with

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
want to try something different with

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.210 
want to try something different with
warriors<00:04:38.810> then<00:04:39.320> it's<00:04:39.500> worth<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.860> look<00:04:40.010> because

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
warriors then it's worth a look because

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.060 
warriors then it's worth a look because
the<00:04:40.490> locking<00:04:40.850> mechanism<00:04:41.030> is<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:42.050> fun<00:04:42.440> mechanism

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
the locking mechanism is a fun mechanism

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.120 
the locking mechanism is a fun mechanism
it<00:04:43.250> really<00:04:43.850> actually<00:04:44.539> makes<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.680> little<00:04:45.919> bit

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
it really actually makes it a little bit

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.520 
it really actually makes it a little bit
more<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:47.000> thing<00:04:47.330> key<00:04:47.510> strategy<00:04:48.080> game<00:04:48.289> than

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
more of a thing key strategy game than

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.279 
more of a thing key strategy game than
the<00:04:48.620> base<00:04:48.830> quarters<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.810> because<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.930> locking

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
the base quarters is because the locking

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.450 
the base quarters is because the locking
mechanism<00:04:52.000> really<00:04:53.000> has<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:54.070> having<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.190> think

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
mechanism really has you having to think

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.700 
mechanism really has you having to think
about<00:04:55.700> what<00:04:56.300> other<00:04:56.539> characters<00:04:57.260> what<00:04:57.560> other

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
about what other characters what other

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.060 
about what other characters what other
players<00:04:58.070> have<00:04:58.370> in<00:04:58.669> play<00:04:58.940> what<00:04:59.630> their<00:05:00.070> lock

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
players have in play what their lock

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.279 
players have in play what their lock
ability<00:05:01.700> is<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.270> how<00:05:02.419> your<00:05:02.750> role<00:05:03.080> might

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
ability is and how your role might

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.010 
ability is and how your role might
affect<00:05:03.740> them<00:05:03.950> or<00:05:04.160> benefit<00:05:04.700> them<00:05:04.910> how<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:05.840> might

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
affect them or benefit them how it might

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.350 
affect them or benefit them how it might
buff<00:05:06.349> their<00:05:06.620> characters<00:05:07.160> or<00:05:07.430> hurt<00:05:07.729> your<00:05:07.910> your

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
buff their characters or hurt your your
