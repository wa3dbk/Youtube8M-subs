00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.020
 great rom that is based on a 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.750
 official round this in a frame gÃ¼ero 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.000
 official but has the peculiarity of 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.500
 that has been a tune tuneada and about 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.710
 everything has been literal that is to say they have 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.600
 removed much of the trash or of the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.900
 trash that the roms stoxx of 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.910
 samsung I am going to quote of course the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.000
 source where I got it from and it's htc 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.140
 mania the post of htc man ya os what 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.769
 I show you on screen what I have right now 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.269
 here that is James and sincerely for 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.370
 me is one of the best options 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.860
 Currently to install on the samsung 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.070
 galaxy s3 here you have the base on the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.950
 which is built 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.240
 this is the code of the base on which 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.240
 we have this rom right now 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.829
 the model would be for Spain 'though 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.930
 Can use for any other country 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:15.430
 also of course we are talking about 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.210
 android 4.3 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.090
 and the light version we only have it 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.659
 with the ph that is to say the csc has it for 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.609
 Spain 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.170
 we also have the full version that 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.480
 We can download it from here from the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.490
 page 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.460
 and here it gives us a list of all the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.640
 applications that have been removed from 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.590
 is this rom that in the case that we 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.300
 We want to install it, we only have to 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.220
 give the link and download it 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.660
 install it in our terminal the truth 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.440
 that is a good job here we have 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.440
 some catch 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.990
 is where we can download it if we want 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.720
 install another kernel and of course 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.910
 we also have some options 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.000
 additional as are installing the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:06.390
 launcher of ls 5 galaxy s 5 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.770
 install the naut 2 keyboard that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.280
 we also have it here 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.690
 to download it at the foot we have it 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.160
 this would be installed through the recovery 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.450
 good do not stop reading everything that puts 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
 here because the truth is that it has a lot 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.620
 crumb and it has nothing to waste 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.620
 well let's see this rom live 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.709
 the truth that is completely this that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.120
 we do not see anything that is not stock except 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.670
 some modifications that I have 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.310
 done because I have already installed the modules 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.250
 expo etc to change it then the one of the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.140
 battery some things not the app 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.840
 settings to change them from country to 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.959
 some applications etc but good 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.849
 the truth that comes with what 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.530
 essential 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.510
 the ideal of this rom is that we 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.180
 we have a stock breaker that works 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.500
 really well we have the security of 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.959
 that we are not going to have any kind of 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.090
 problem and we also have the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.160
 option to install those things that 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.170
 we want to say is like a 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.209
 stock meeting but without all that crap 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.430
 that takes the stock breaks and of course 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.099
 the great advantage that we are talking about 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.620
 of an android version 4.3 if we 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.440
 let's bring the device here 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.650
 we have that it's about android and the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.720
 living 4.3 and here we have the version of 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.720
 kernel and the compilation number 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.430
 also from the baseband that would be the 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.430
 modem or radio 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.849
 As you can see, it does not carry added 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.580
 Additional menus is completely stock 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.739
 as I say of course bring as we have 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.720
 seen right now we go again here the 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.710
 core menu tab that already comes with 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.870
 android 43 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.350
 and what I have done has been to install 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.330
 the keyboard of the car because it has 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.400
 also the numbers up here that the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.370
 true that they come in handy when it comes to 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.230
 enter numeric characters 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.480
 we can download that as I said 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.680
 before from the htc mania page where 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.200
 I leave the link so you can read 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.299
 download the rom and absolutely everything 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.269
 about this great rom the camera 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.320
 it works of death that is to say it is very very 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.320
 well it's very fast 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.199
 as you can see it is very fast 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.199
 also the burst mode 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.850
 and I can not say more that it works very 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.890
 very light very fast and the truth that 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.320
 it's worth trying for all 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.350
 those that especially want a rom 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.600
 stock but with the lightness of having 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.980
 removed as I say all that crap with 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.320
 I do not mean that there are no roms 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.760
 very good because there are also 100 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.860
 today in boat there are 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.750
 slim rom cetera there are many rom are 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.550
 very good but above all for those 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.560
 you want a stock rom do not you want 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.710
 complicate life and want something light 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.020
 and fast and passed very very very stock here 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.150
 you have a very good option one of the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.440
 last bases and with a very support 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.110
 good the truth that I have tried 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.420
 for a week and it goes great 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.830
 good friends, well, if you liked it 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.060
