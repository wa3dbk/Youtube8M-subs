but<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.570> went<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.020> got<00:04:06.170> some<00:04:06.350> two-by-fours<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:07.690> I

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
but I went I got some two-by-fours and I

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.460

got some some kick plating and I just
remade<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.160> bracket<00:04:13.519> I<00:04:13.670> just<00:04:13.910> remade<00:04:14.209> it

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
cleans it up makes it look a little

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.760 
cleans it up makes it look a little
nicer<00:04:20.630> plus<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:21.350> makes<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.859> sturdier<00:04:22.220> which<00:04:22.400> is
