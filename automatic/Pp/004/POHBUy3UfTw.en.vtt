00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.130
 room 2000 giuseppe agozzino silvio good 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.740
 tel matteo parma we are here with a video 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.380
 dedicated guide flow a support a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.259
 desk side monitor as you see 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.020
 now let's proceed with the installation of the 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.510
 lipstick that allows you to manage the 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.030
 all also announcing wrongly 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.489
 your work plan 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.989
 how you will appreciate the installation 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.899
 of the same is really really a lot 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.670
 simple we remind you of the presence of 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.320
 keys needed to proceed with the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.999
 balloon directly in the woods of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.920
 sales we leave them anyway 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.469
 an official application by the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.149
 ema miller see you later yes 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.449
 then right now we are staring 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.159
 at the desk our clamp col 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.839
 club as you wish 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.199
 very simply with a key a 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.850
 allen with this type of clamp yes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.070
 can make a position 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.200
 the operation directly above 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 of the desk without having to go down to the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.330
 below the table top 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.040
 this is the cover the clamp then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.020
 it simply goes to thread the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.190
 monitor support arm 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.250
 anchor point this time 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.040
 we are mounting the white version 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.190
 inside the arm is a spring 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.930
 which is set up simple mini a 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.420
 single point regarding weight 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.850
 of your monitor is adjusted in 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.790
 this point through the same 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:51.980
 Allen wrench we gave for 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:53.810
 fixing to the desk as you can 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.560
 appreciate we can easily a 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.690
 manage the installation quickly 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.390
 easy and obviously we can adjust 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.960
 the inclination and the depth of the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.400
 your discs lighter than the point 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.490
 of anchorage that in this case precisely 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.900
 consider as the desk side 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.150
 regarding the installation of 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.459
 let's do a quick demon like that 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.770
 panel in this case we have precisely 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.270
 a hook that as easily 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.880
 prefer going to include both the wait 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.990
 one hundred we can 75 years old weight 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.340
 just use attacks weighs 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.330
 standard on most monitors 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.760
 now on the market 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.400
 so those are one hundred percent both 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.800
 lighter than they were against 75 75 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.350
 we can lowered the pro vote 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.840
 manage its depth as easily 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.300
 visible so we have a perfect one 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.900
 management skills regarding 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.510
 the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.950
 our data reading point like 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.390
 similar we have succeeded 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.489
 quietly raise it to lower it 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.870
 change the depth and rotation 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.230
 extended at the time for example 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.470
 you want to go to pivot rs the whole e 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:06.170
 let's go now to make you appreciate the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.390
 last details let's allow a 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.579
 easy to understand even for how much 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.920
 regards the passing of keys 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.890
 so we can keep it that way 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.840
 ordered the work plan for both 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.430
 as regards the position of the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.650
 monitoring of the accessories also 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.190
 in fact we showed in the boxing 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.980
 the possibility of going to manage a 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.230
 notebook holder and a tablet holder always 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.900
 with this support regarding 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.180
 the possibility of having an extra 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.430
 compared to the previous solution in 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.069
 this case we have the management of 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.099
 current and any video signal 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.829
 directly inside the structure 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.389
 as you can see in the lower part 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.370
 of the arm we have that essentially 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:55.950
 the hollow area where precisely inside 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.069
 we can even conceal it better than before 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.280
 here our electric leader in cable 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.260
 having said that the dedicated video mounted 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.330
 let's say it ends so gentle not boxing 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.700
 we've already shown it for how long 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.060
 concerns replacement, for example 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.470
 replacement of a monitor with a tablet e 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.090
 let's close with this in 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.400
 installation calatino for how much 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.590
 concerns against ease 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.200
 possibly to adapt the betis 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.000
 monitor always on the medium of support 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.800
 now it's all because of the attention you 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.389
 it is now ne follow us on the firm country to the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.220
 info point all the social channels that 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.940
 find an miles that thank you 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.919
 for the attention 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.550
 it comes from giuseppe the little boys matteo
