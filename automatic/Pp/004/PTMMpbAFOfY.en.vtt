mystery<00:02:47.220> dungeon<00:02:47.310> yes<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:47.940> not<00:02:48.060> a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
mystery dungeon yes it's not a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.020 
mystery dungeon yes it's not a
mainstream<00:02:48.450> game<00:02:49.020> but<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.489> second

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
mainstream game but it is the second

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.290 
mainstream game but it is the second
closest<00:02:51.480> thing<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> mainstream<00:02:53.550> game<00:02:54.060> or

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
the first closest thing I think to the

the first closest thing I think to the
mainstream<00:02:56.160> game<00:02:56.610> that's<00:02:56.970> not<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.450> mainstream

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
mainstream game that's not a mainstream

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.830 
mainstream game that's not a mainstream
game<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.220> here's<00:02:59.880> what<00:03:00.060> actually<00:03:00.420> happened

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
they did was they announced it I think

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.440 
they did was they announced it I think
mid-2012<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.510> think<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.320> then<00:03:40.980> they<00:03:41.820> actually

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
mid-2012 I think and then they actually

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.050 
mid-2012 I think and then they actually
it<00:03:42.600> actually<00:03:42.959> got<00:03:43.019> released<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.820> japan<00:03:44.820> in

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
it actually got released in japan in

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.350 
it actually got released in japan in
december<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.440> month<00:03:46.650> later<00:03:47.060> they<00:03:48.060> put

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
december and in the month later they put

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.569 
december and in the month later they put
out<00:03:48.510> pokemon<00:03:49.290> X&amp;Y<00:03:49.530> they<00:03:49.890> announced<00:03:50.220> port

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
out pokemon X&amp;Y they announced port

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.770 
out pokemon X&amp;Y they announced port
monix<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.030> why<00:03:51.090> that's<00:03:51.239> what<00:03:51.450> i<00:03:51.480> thought<00:03:51.630> they

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
monix and why that's what i thought they

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.690 
monix and why that's what i thought they
would<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:51.989> for<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.170> game<00:03:52.500> though<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:52.950> I

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
would do for this game though so I

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.190 
would do for this game though so I
thought<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:53.970> know<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.510> at<00:03:54.720> least<00:03:54.750> get<00:03:55.110> in

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
thought you know that at least get in

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.960 
thought you know that at least get in
Japan<00:03:55.530> first<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.040> maybe<00:03:56.340> we<00:03:56.670> would<00:03:56.790> see<00:03:56.940> a

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
Japan first and maybe we would see a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.930 
Japan first and maybe we would see a
reveal<00:03:57.350> October<00:03:58.350> or<00:03:58.590> November<00:03:58.940> obviously

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
reveal October or November obviously

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.340 
reveal October or November obviously
right<00:04:00.150> now<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.510> looks<00:04:00.570> like<00:04:00.870> that's<00:04:00.989> going<00:04:01.230> to

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
right now it looks like that's going to

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.670 
right now it looks like that's going to
happen<00:04:01.440> sooner<00:04:02.160> than<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.579> um<00:04:03.170> but<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.560> was

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
happen sooner than that um but it was

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.199 
happen sooner than that um but it was
just<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.010> know<00:04:05.130> kind<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.370> coinciding<00:04:06.000> but

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
just you know kind of coinciding but

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.530 
just you know kind of coinciding but
previous<00:04:06.870> games<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:08.130> know<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.540> bread

i<00:04:38.400> kind<00:04:38.669> of<00:04:38.730> thought<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:38.970> for<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.330> while<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.810> I

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
i kind of thought that for a while and I

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.820 
i kind of thought that for a while and I
kind<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.080> missed<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.410> quite<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> few<00:04:40.680> times

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
kind of missed that quite a few times

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.060 
kind of missed that quite a few times
but<00:04:41.280> now<00:04:41.490> my<00:04:42.389> you<00:04:42.900> know<00:04:43.020> mindset<00:04:43.740> has<00:04:43.800> kind<00:04:44.010> of

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
but now my you know mindset has kind of

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.409 
but now my you know mindset has kind of
changed<00:04:44.130> with<00:04:44.639> all<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.910> new<00:04:45.060> stuff<00:04:45.120> we've

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
changed with all the new stuff we've

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.330 
changed with all the new stuff we've
done<00:04:45.450> in<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.810> past<00:04:45.930> 24<00:04:46.380> hours<00:04:46.440> plus<00:04:46.950> of<00:04:47.190> how

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
done in the past 24 hours plus of how

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.629 
done in the past 24 hours plus of how
you<00:04:47.669> know<00:04:47.760> they've<00:04:47.910> actually<00:04:48.120> done<00:04:48.510> other

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
most a month the next mainstream game is

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.409 
most a month the next mainstream game is
going<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.520> be<00:04:59.580> out<00:04:59.760> and<00:04:59.880> that's<00:04:59.940> why<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.180> want<00:05:00.389> to
