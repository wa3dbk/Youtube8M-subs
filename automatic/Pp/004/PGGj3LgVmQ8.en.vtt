00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.830 
so actually I have two versions here
because<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.730> my<00:00:29.880> subscribers<00:00:30.060> asked<00:00:30.720> me

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
because one of my subscribers asked me

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.179 
because one of my subscribers asked me
to<00:00:30.929> build<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.260> song<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.590> storms<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to build the song of storms with a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.490 
to build the song of storms with a
bassline<00:00:32.940> now<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.750> no<00:00:33.899> bassline<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
bassline now there is no bassline in the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520 
bassline now there is no bassline in the
original<00:00:34.920> song<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.280> storms<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.930> well<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.170> tried

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
original song of storms but well I tried

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.810 
original song of storms but well I tried
it<00:00:37.649> out<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.430> liked<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
it out and actually really liked it a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.220 
it out and actually really liked it a
lot<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.270> we're<00:00:39.360> gonna<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.690> listen<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
lot so we're gonna first listen to the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.389 
lot so we're gonna first listen to the
original<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.129> we're<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
original one and then we're going to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.580 
original one and then we're going to
listen<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> bass<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.930> let's<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.379> this

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
listen to the bass one so let's do this

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:56.240 
listen to the bass one so let's do this
series<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.539> click<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
series and click and there we have it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.319 
series and click and there we have it
now<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.399> might<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.699> thinking<00:00:56.820> that's<00:00:57.149> pretty

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
now you might be thinking that's pretty

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.459 
now you might be thinking that's pretty
small<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> original<00:00:58.170> song<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
small because the original song of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.990 
small because the original song of
storms<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:58.920> four<00:00:59.190> minutes<00:00:59.309> long<00:00:59.520> but

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
storms it's like four minutes long but

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.760 
storms it's like four minutes long but
if<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.449> listen<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.170> song<00:01:01.469> it's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
if you actually listen to the song it's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
if you actually listen to the song it's
probably<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> actually<00:01:03.539> is

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
probably just it's well it actually is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
probably just it's well it actually is
literally<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.650> same<00:01:04.949> notes<00:01:05.250> playing

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
literally just these same notes playing

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.160 
literally just these same notes playing
over<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.880> over<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:06.630> some<00:01:06.869> parts

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
over and over in there are some parts

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.840 
over and over in there are some parts
where<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:07.619> seconds<00:01:08.100> off<00:01:08.250> where<00:01:08.610> up

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
different notes for like two seconds but

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.730 
different notes for like two seconds but
if<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> listen<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> whole<00:01:13.470> thing<00:01:13.500> is

build when I do the tutorial on it if
you<00:01:41.310> really<00:01:41.550> don't<00:01:41.850> want<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.210> base<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:42.690> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you really don't want the base all you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.270 
you really don't want the base all you
have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.440> skip<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> notes<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
have to do is just skip the notes that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
have to do is just skip the notes that
have<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> base<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.060> them<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.540> every<00:01:45.750> time

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
have the base on them because every time

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.080 
have the base on them because every time
I<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.140> bases<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:47.310> Knobloch<00:01:47.640> tutorials

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
I do my bases with my Knobloch tutorials

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.580 
I do my bases with my Knobloch tutorials
I<00:01:48.180> changed<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> number<00:01:48.930> color<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.350> green

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
I changed the number color to green

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.280 
I changed the number color to green
green<00:01:49.890> means<00:01:50.640> double<00:01:51.000> base<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:51.930> red

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
green means double base and if I do red

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.889 
green means double base and if I do red
red<00:01:52.619> means<00:01:52.920> click<00:01:53.310> stuff<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.300> so<00:01:54.780> it's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
red means click stuff like that so it's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.389 
red means click stuff like that so it's
very<00:01:55.050> easy<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> follow<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.040> said<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
very easy to follow and like I said you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.649 
very easy to follow and like I said you
can<00:01:56.520> put<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:56.940> into<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.180> loop<00:01:57.360> cuz<00:01:57.509> it's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
can put this thing into a loop cuz it's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.780 
can put this thing into a loop cuz it's
literally<00:01:58.050> like<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> same<00:01:58.590> notes<00:01:58.950> over<00:01:59.759> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
literally like the same notes over and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.450 
literally like the same notes over and
over<00:02:00.360> again<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.800> what<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.190> got

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
over again and you know what I just got

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
over again and you know what I just got
a<00:02:02.899> devilish<00:02:03.899> idea<00:02:04.200> okay<00:02:04.409> let's<00:02:04.649> let's<00:02:04.920> try

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
a devilish idea okay let's let's try

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.139 
a devilish idea okay let's let's try
this<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.340> want<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.520> try<00:02:05.670> something<00:02:05.910> here

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
this I want to try something here

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:48.100 
this I want to try something here
actually<00:02:06.300> hold<00:02:06.690> on<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:07.320> let's<00:02:07.560> try<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.800> okay

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.180 

that's<00:02:49.110> not<00:02:49.320> okay<00:02:49.560> we're<00:02:49.890> done<00:02:50.040> we're<00:02:50.160> done

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that's not okay we're done we're done

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.340 
that's not okay we're done we're done
we're<00:02:50.370> done<00:02:50.430> we'll<00:02:50.670> listen<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.090> okay<00:02:51.350> there

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
we're done we'll listen to it okay there

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.819 
we're done we'll listen to it okay there
we<00:02:52.500> go

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
we go

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:53.960 
we go
but<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.190> actually<00:02:53.400> sounds<00:02:53.670> pretty<00:02:53.850> good

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
but that actually sounds pretty good

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.060 
but that actually sounds pretty good
when<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.180> go<00:02:54.299> from<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.920> kind<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.980> like

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
when you go from the kind of like

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.890 
when you go from the kind of like
high-pitched<00:02:56.430> piano<00:02:56.850> over<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.450> piano<00:02:57.750> and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
high-pitched piano over to the piano and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.440 
high-pitched piano over to the piano and
bass<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.560> wouldn't<00:02:59.100> redo<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.880> this<00:03:00.150> though

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
bass I wouldn't redo it like this though

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.880 
bass I wouldn't redo it like this though
I<00:03:00.480> think<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.959> sounded<00:03:01.260> bad<00:03:01.380> want<00:03:01.650> someone

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
I think that sounded bad want someone

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.979 
I think that sounded bad want someone
back<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> other<00:03:02.579> side<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.570> when<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.780> just

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
back to the other side but when you just

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.120 
back to the other side but when you just
have<00:03:04.079> one<00:03:04.260> side<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.620> into<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.920> side

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
have one side going into that side

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.770 
have one side going into that side
actually<00:03:05.459> sounded<00:03:05.790> pretty<00:03:05.940> cool<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.630> yeah
