00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.140
 we 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.240
 we can also choose to visit this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.740
 exhibition looks into one 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.300
 color at once which allows for 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.020
 come back several times and very well 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.270
 see the tables 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.210
 for example here you can choose the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.730
 red color since we at this beautiful 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.150
 japan damman screen with this red 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.980
 very deep a red blood of beef that 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.460
 serves basically to highlight the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 natural patterns and animals that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 bonnard painted on this screen so 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.850
 red color of life color of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.629
 happiness also in the tradition is to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.210
 Far East 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.609
 this very positive vision very 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:03.000
 luminous world and that we can follow 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:01:05.759
 from picture to picture that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.260
 incandescent oil lamp which 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.090
 burn here on the lunch table 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.060
 are reunited family members 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.100
 but it's obviously this color is 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.800
 very very pushed very hard it's because 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.120
 that it also indicates state of mind and 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.300
 detention may be between 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.220
 characters is a force that is a 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.750
 inner strength rather than the strength of the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.030
 simply reflects a flame 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.400
 we can see that bonnart chosen 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.470
 precisely the vocabulary of color 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.470
 to go beyond reality 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.770
 the red tablecloth that still exists in 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.590
 the house of cannet the table top 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.810
 red was probably chosen by 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.940
 bonnart because it was also a 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.370
 color that highlights well the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.820
 items laid on but at the same time 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.290
 it's a kind of continuity of a 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.110
 table to another we will find this 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.760
 red tablecloth that will serve as a background 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.140
 sometimes a little more 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.300
 realistic and then sometimes in a way 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.670
 quite extravagant as montage 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.260
 of red that occurs in the table and 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.290
 its red spots is very important 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.630
 since it leads us to look at the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.060
 other colors at von arx color 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.970
 do not fill the drawing she us 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.970
 just point out the point of attention 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.850
 there are always very red spots 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.740
 important in his compositions here the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.630
 red task and lets in she is 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.530
 also centers and by this little vase 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.360
 and again we see it with a nuance 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.850
 different in the background in their 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.290
 presentation of a painting so this red 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.930
 who jumps out at us 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.730
 tells us the foreground but already 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.710
 almost an intermediate plan is also 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.810
 a flat since it is one of his 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.120
 two fireplaces and that's the red task 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.290
 which almost tells us the limit to 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.620
 beyond this red spot 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.500
 something intangible is happening 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.790
 since we are in the reflection we can 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.410
 start with red but we can 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 continue also with the green the green 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.000
 is extremely present in this 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.680
 japonizing section with also this 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.190
 presentation made for the first 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.620
 times around picking apples 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.320
 who represents the orchard of the property 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.120
 family of the great spear so here the 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.610
 demonstration is flagrant and one is 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.370
 dipped in the glasses of bonnart that 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.890
 are nuanced greens 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.690
 two thousand other colors so we see 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.849
 there is a lot of yellow there are 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.040
 whites there are the same orange trees that 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.110
 pierces and then at the time with the ridges 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.620
 reds at the site that showcases the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.620
 green color 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.700
 bonnart settles in 2010 to discover the 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.010
 craft at the beginning of the 20th century and will end 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.260
 by buying a house in cannet where there 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.790
 it will take root more but it is 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.730
 completely fascinated by the light 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.950
 mediterranean by the mediterranean this 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.810
 yellow which is introduced everywhere in the 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.739
 noon which is the day of light which 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.020
 is yellow from the dazzle also from the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.789
 vegetation a little burned by the sun and 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.570
 in the yellow ones always slips a 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.550
 from two ultraviolet blue that 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.350
 also introduces a small note of 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.050
 melancholy sometimes in his compositions 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.210
 very bright here is the case especially 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.509
 with the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.330
 the opposition with the yellow of the mimosa is 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:45.970
 Obviously there was touched glass 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.740
 finally all the colors are present 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.050
 but we see that they are dosed 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.210
 way least do not get confused in 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.400
 our vision is to build 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.069
 despite all a form of perspectives 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.259
 since there we look through the 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.880
 large canopy of the workshop so when 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.130
 the lights will be made we can 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.550
 to bring up that emotion that arises from 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.729
 his paintings that tells us about the life of 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.500
 the disappearance of the feelings of 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.030
 contradictions and especially of that 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.070
 the eye of what the brain can 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.430
 store what we can remember from our 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.360
 lives of our lives on everything that art 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.130
 can express for for all and that's 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.949
 this is what we hope to share here 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.050
 with the audience in this exhibition 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.889
 it is this emotion that is carried by 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.889
 the colors of happiness 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.180
 no
