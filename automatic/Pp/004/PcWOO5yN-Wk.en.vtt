00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
when you record a movie with your GoPro

when you record a movie with your GoPro
hero3<00:00:09.610> I<00:00:10.150> have<00:00:11.050> the<00:00:11.200> black<00:00:11.470> edition<00:00:11.710> I<00:00:11.950> don't

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.220 
hero3 I have the black edition I don't

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.860 
hero3 I have the black edition I don't
know<00:00:12.430> if<00:00:12.580> it's<00:00:12.760> for<00:00:12.910> the<00:00:13.000> other<00:00:13.180> editions<00:00:13.750> as

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
know if it's for the other editions as

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.550 
know if it's for the other editions as
well<00:00:14.170> but<00:00:14.470> for<00:00:15.130> my<00:00:15.309> it<00:00:15.370> is<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:16.780> those<00:00:16.990> files

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
well but for my it is what those files

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.450 
well but for my it is what those files
are<00:00:17.950> at<00:00:18.130> ehm<00:00:19.199> forget<00:00:20.199> those<00:00:20.380> they<00:00:20.920> just<00:00:21.220> have

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
are at ehm forget those they just have

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.080 
are at ehm forget those they just have
metadata<00:00:22.270> and<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.830> I<00:00:24.279> believe<00:00:24.940> the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
metadata and it's I believe the

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.540 
metadata and it's I believe the
thumbnail<00:00:25.570> for<00:00:26.050> editing<00:00:26.410> programs<00:00:26.890> so<00:00:27.340> we

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
thumbnail for editing programs so we

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.120 
thumbnail for editing programs so we
don't<00:00:27.880> really<00:00:28.060> need<00:00:28.330> that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
don't really need that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.299 
don't really need that
however<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:31.180> Dolf<00:00:31.559> lr<00:00:32.559> fee<00:00:33.100> file<00:00:35.129> that<00:00:36.129> is

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
however the Dolf lr fee file that is

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.479 
however the Dolf lr fee file that is
actually<00:00:36.819> kind<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.120> useful<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.710> many

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
actually kind of useful because many

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.840 
actually kind of useful because many
people<00:00:39.670> don't<00:00:40.120> have<00:00:40.389> really<00:00:40.690> fast<00:00:41.019> computers

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
people don't have really fast computers

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.879 
people don't have really fast computers
some<00:00:42.850> of<00:00:42.940> you<00:00:43.059> do<00:00:43.269> but<00:00:43.569> the<00:00:43.989> majority<00:00:44.289> don't

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:44.889 
some of you do but the majority don't

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:48.559 
some of you do but the majority don't
have<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.670> capability<00:00:46.269> to<00:00:46.299> as<00:00:46.569> real<00:00:47.499> HD

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:48.569 
have the capability to as real HD

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.979 
have the capability to as real HD
material<00:00:49.569> fluidly<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.739> what<00:00:51.159> they<00:00:51.309> did<00:00:51.609> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
material fluidly so what they did is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.569 
material fluidly so what they did is
that<00:00:52.989> when<00:00:53.829> you've<00:00:54.069> got<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.909> main<00:00:55.089> movie<00:00:55.539> here

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that when you've got the main movie here

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.349 
that when you've got the main movie here
it<00:00:57.579> makes<00:00:57.999> a<00:00:58.510> small<00:00:59.019> one<00:00:59.379> as<00:00:59.559> well<00:01:00.269> at<00:01:01.269> the

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
it makes a small one as well at the

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.419 
it makes a small one as well at the
moment<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:01.690> can't<00:01:01.869> see<00:01:02.079> it<00:01:02.199> because<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:03.190> has<00:01:03.399> a

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
moment you can't see it because it has a

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.790 
moment you can't see it because it has a
weird<00:01:03.789> extension<00:01:04.420> that<00:01:04.629> windows<00:01:05.140> does<00:01:05.410> not

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
weird extension that windows does not

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.900 
weird extension that windows does not
understand<00:01:06.310> or<00:01:06.610> make<00:01:07.060> for<00:01:07.300> that<00:01:07.450> matter<00:01:08.910> but

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
understand or make for that matter but

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.350 
understand or make for that matter but
when<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.360> place<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.810> in<00:01:10.870> another<00:01:11.110> folder<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
when you place it in another folder the

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.030 
when you place it in another folder the

especially when you calibrate it or try
to<00:02:10.450> make<00:02:10.599> fluid<00:02:11.049> cuts<00:02:11.349> it

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to make fluid cuts it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.170 
to make fluid cuts it
