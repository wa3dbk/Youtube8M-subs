00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello and and also to a new dot 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:13.080
 Presentation of me today by the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:15.139
 Amazon condor 15,000 1 she is still standing 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.260
 A dealer 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:26.820
 collapsed converted from the ls 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:31.260
 13 of the motto has not really 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 is made fell on the ls 13 changed 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:40.190
 probably the shine away though 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.610
 then we look at the device mania 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.950
 First of all, you have to connect to van t Hof 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.950
 refuel and test 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.520
 Today is a bit disgusting here 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.520
 the map 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 I see the hand in front of it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 in front of the eyes no more work than the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.530
 walk to the yard 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.570
 fight back a few Eckdaten 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.570
 to the machine say but first 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.730
 filled up and then almost show 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.280
 costs and 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.260
 a look of entertaining a day is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.880
 also with it 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:54.680
 Then let's have a look at what's in it 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.680
 You can spend three thirds on we are 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.310
 businessman the field 23 and look us 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.310
 on 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.110
 what does this machine cost good question 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.580
 57,500 have one and they cost 210 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.450
 euro on the day what can be inside 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.450
 unfortunately not there 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.469
 8000 liters says good stop 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:08.960
 wheat barley rape fight grass kicks 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:12.590
 mostly sugar beet 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.590
 yes and that was it 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.410
 a Catholic 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.859
 it was said that it is on the map 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.859
 there are slight problems 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.629
 with the press that he partially 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.629
 has misfires 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.140
 I'm going to now also still the same 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.140
 let's see 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.340
 then something opens up 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.740
 We have selected the seeds on 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:26.460
 Switched on and still have to 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.460
 reduce 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.940
 tempomat in and 17 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:50.249
 but I have to say honestly I see 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:52.969
 not that the machine is somewhere 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.969
 has misfires 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.790
 the working width is of course enormous 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:43.509
 ok it was also thought that in 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.509
 reverse gear no drill is possible 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.539
 I still make the trail for you and there 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.110
 and then 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.880
 I will not mine my last 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.800
 last an idea for you 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.720
 finish that has the mainzer 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.830
 probably with a look at times 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.830
 whether I again get over it 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.199
 3 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.570
 these are these misfires good that me 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.770
 but again the track drove 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:36.620
 but i think if you have the time 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:39.330
 Saves with such a large working width 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.360
 then they're not coming to the tenant 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.660
 on 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.660
 or 2 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.950
 if you like 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:56.870
 he probably has to be from johns editor 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:07:00.670
 Somehow something to the map be that 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.670
 because it can not be separated 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:10.319
 on the west board game is supposed to be right 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.949
 he had to work the back 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.949
 have misfires 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:20.789
 No 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.789
 there is fresh 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.649
 as soon as a pretty thing i am 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:33.959
 I came 

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:44.029
 I get out of filthy textures she has 

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:44.029
 unfortunately can not jump high 

00:07:46.459 --> 00:08:00.869
 all collisions are beautiful and otherwise 

00:07:57.079 --> 00:08:03.959
 I would say that fits the beautiful 

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:05.549
 Work done and reported it to me 

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:06.629
 I am a picture for watching you wish 

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:08.429
 a beautiful Sunday 

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:10.889
 or what day, whatever 

00:08:08.429 --> 00:08:13.849
 have if you look at the video 

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:13.849
 today we have sunday 

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:18.319
 and see you
