you<00:00:36.430> must<00:00:36.670> do<00:00:37.270> some<00:00:37.600> basic<00:00:38.559> technique<00:00:39.250> and<00:00:40.059> the

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
you must do some basic technique and the

you must do some basic technique and the
basic<00:00:40.660> training<00:00:41.170> is<00:00:41.890> very<00:00:42.190> important<00:00:42.879> without

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
basic training is very important without

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.939 
basic training is very important without
the<00:00:43.989> basics<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.800> cannot<00:00:45.329> use<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.570> typhoon<00:00:46.989> so

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
the basics you cannot use the typhoon so

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.710 
the basics you cannot use the typhoon so
the<00:00:48.909> technique<00:00:49.780> is<00:00:49.960> taught<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:51.220> basic<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:52.390> the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
the technique is taught the basic is the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.369 
the technique is taught the basic is the
stress<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.739> make<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:54.339> can<00:00:54.760> do<00:00:54.970> this<00:00:55.180> job<00:00:55.449> so

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
stress to make you can do this job so

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.530 
stress to make you can do this job so
it's<00:00:56.559> very<00:00:56.769> important<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.519> run<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.180> basic

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:31.930 

twist<00:01:15.690> right<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.460> twist<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.970> our<00:01:18.770> mirror

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.920 

right

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
right

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.690 
right
middle

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.980 

yeah

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
yeah

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.040 
yeah
right

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
right

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.359 
right
Oh

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.889 

but<00:01:51.909> also<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.329> can<00:01:52.539> do<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:53.109> double<00:01:53.289> yarn<00:01:53.770> pom

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
but also you can do the double yarn pom

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.050 
but also you can do the double yarn pom
so<00:01:55.899> this<00:01:56.079> is<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.320> lot<00:01:56.469> of<00:01:56.500> different<00:01:56.979> still<00:01:57.880> go

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
so this is a lot of different still go

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.380 
so this is a lot of different still go
there<00:01:58.119> left<00:01:58.630> but<00:01:58.960> if<00:01:59.049> you<00:01:59.170> clean<00:01:59.380> up<00:02:00.329> go<00:02:01.329> to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
there left but if you clean up go to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.859 
there left but if you clean up go to
right<00:02:01.979> top<00:02:03.149> put<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.179> mirror<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.619> this<00:02:06.869> put

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
right top put the mirror and this put

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.630 
right top put the mirror and this put
the<00:02:07.990> sky<00:02:08.940> hold<00:02:09.940> on

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:28.339 

left<00:02:16.830> right

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.430 

come<00:02:29.349> here<00:02:30.099> this<00:02:30.340> way<00:02:30.750> or<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.810> way

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
come here this way or this way

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.759 
come here this way or this way
it's<00:02:33.430> an<00:02:33.549> idea<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.209> twisted<00:02:34.959> arm<00:02:35.319> let's

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
it's an idea like a twisted arm let's

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.050 
it's an idea like a twisted arm let's
start<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.670> twist<00:02:37.000> hands<00:02:37.409> like<00:02:38.409> a<00:02:38.819> squeeze<00:02:39.819> the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
start the twist hands like a squeeze the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.550 
start the twist hands like a squeeze the
power

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.250 

that's<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.400> one<00:02:43.550> basics<00:02:43.970> answer<00:02:44.810> also<00:02:45.080> you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
that's the one basics answer also you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.610 
that's the one basics answer also you
can<00:02:45.530> add<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.740> home<00:02:45.980> shake<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.940> spill<00:02:47.270> okay<00:02:47.720> so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
can add a home shake in a spill okay so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.830 
can add a home shake in a spill okay so
when<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:48.920> shake<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.520> spill<00:02:49.819> when<00:02:50.420> shaking

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
when you shake in a spill when shaking

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.470 
when you shake in a spill when shaking
spill<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.709> thinking<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.550> like<00:02:52.730> afforded<00:02:53.330> an

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
spill to thinking you like afforded an

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.940 
spill to thinking you like afforded an
arm<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:54.709> shake<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.200> kind<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:57.500> shaking

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
arm to shake so get this kind of shaking

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.840 
arm to shake so get this kind of shaking
power<00:02:58.540> using<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.750> gravity<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.640> is

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
power using the gravity so this is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.809 
power using the gravity so this is
whenever<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.630> catch<00:03:02.959> his<00:03:03.319> arm<00:03:03.530> just<00:03:03.819> thinking

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
whenever you catch his arm just thinking

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.300 
whenever you catch his arm just thinking
you<00:03:05.360> are<00:03:05.510> doing<00:03:05.870> you're<00:03:06.080> shaking<00:03:06.620> spare<00:03:06.920> basic

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
you are doing you're shaking spare basic

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.880 
you are doing you're shaking spare basic
exercise
