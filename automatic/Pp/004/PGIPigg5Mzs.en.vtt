it's<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.059> missing<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.600> front<00:00:46.010> if

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.550 

and<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:57.430> our<00:00:57.580> real<00:00:57.820> one<00:00:58.090> it's<00:00:58.390> just<00:00:58.780> one<00:00:59.080> solid

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
and on our real one it's just one solid

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.540 
and on our real one it's just one solid
piece

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.320 

okay<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:03.610> you<00:01:03.880> can<00:01:04.000> see<00:01:04.030> both<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.510> one<00:01:04.660> frame

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
okay so you can see both in one frame

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.800 
okay so you can see both in one frame
that's<00:01:07.330> better<00:01:07.630> yeah<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:10.000> um<00:01:10.240> that's<00:01:10.660> probably

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
that's better yeah so um that's probably

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.730 
that's better yeah so um that's probably
the<00:01:11.020> best<00:01:11.230> way<00:01:11.410> that<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.620> can<00:01:11.680> tell<00:01:13.740> apart

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
the best way that you can tell apart

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.310 
the best way that you can tell apart
from<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:18.360> there's<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.450> bit<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.630> silver<00:01:20.200> at<00:01:20.260> the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
from that there's a bit of silver at the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.890 
from that there's a bit of silver at the
bottom<00:01:20.620> in<00:01:21.010> photos<00:01:21.550> of<00:01:21.760> this<00:01:21.880> one<00:01:22.150> it's<00:01:22.630> really

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
bottom in photos of this one it's really

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.360 
bottom in photos of this one it's really
hard<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.200> tell<00:01:23.440> because<00:01:23.680> it's<00:01:23.950> still<00:01:24.130> showing

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
hard to tell because it's still showing

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.050 
hard to tell because it's still showing
you<00:01:24.520> down<00:01:24.670> there

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
you down there

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.280 
you down there
but<00:01:25.660> um<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.320> distinctly<00:01:26.950> silver<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:29.020> um

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
but um it is distinctly silver it's um

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.770 
but um it is distinctly silver it's um
it's<00:01:29.650> definitely<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.460> piece<00:01:31.000> of<00:01:31.180> silver<00:01:31.540> metal

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
it's definitely a piece of silver metal

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.900 
it's definitely a piece of silver metal
I<00:01:31.840> think<00:01:32.170> this<00:01:32.800> one<00:01:33.009> might<00:01:33.220> be<00:01:33.250> black<00:01:33.610> metal

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
I think this one might be black metal

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.870 
I think this one might be black metal
I'm<00:01:34.360> not<00:01:34.630> sure<00:01:34.869> but<00:01:35.229> it's<00:01:35.380> um<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.550> very

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
I'm not sure but it's um it is very

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.810 
I'm not sure but it's um it is very
close<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.990> lights<00:01:38.259> on<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.650> real<00:01:38.860> one<00:01:39.100> well
