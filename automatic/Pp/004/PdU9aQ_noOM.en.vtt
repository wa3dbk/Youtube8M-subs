00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
wait for it to warm up again

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.459 
wait for it to warm up again
that's<00:03:07.939> what<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.329> get<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.719> a<00:03:08.810> manual<00:03:09.139> machine

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:09.469 
that's what you get in a manual machine

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.599 
that's what you get in a manual machine
so<00:03:09.680> if<00:03:09.769> you<00:03:09.889> think<00:03:10.099> you're<00:03:10.189> going<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.370> be<00:03:10.489> doing

sorry no no 50 51 50 a millimeter and so
it's<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.849> different<00:03:23.180> sized<00:03:23.329> basket<00:03:24.049> everything

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
it's a different sized basket everything

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.740 
it's a different sized basket everything
about<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:24.829> a<00:03:24.919> little<00:03:25.009> bit<00:03:25.220> smaller<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:26.030> it's

about it's a little bit smaller and it's
the<00:03:26.900> only<00:03:27.109> machine<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.680> know<00:03:27.829> of<00:03:28.159> instead

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
the only machine that I know of instead

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.759 
the only machine that I know of instead
of<00:03:29.150> going<00:03:29.329> like<00:03:29.359> this<00:03:29.629> to<00:03:29.930> crank<00:03:30.199> to<00:03:30.349> put<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.620> on

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
of going like this to crank to put it on

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.759 
of going like this to crank to put it on
you<00:03:31.129> go<00:03:31.280> just<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.609> opposite<00:03:32.109> yeah<00:03:33.109> it<00:03:33.530> kind<00:03:33.709> of

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
you go just the opposite yeah it kind of

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.319 
you go just the opposite yeah it kind of
messes<00:03:34.099> with<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> little<00:03:34.549> bit<00:03:34.699> yeah<00:03:35.150> it

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
messes with you a little bit yeah it

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.449 
messes with you a little bit yeah it
messes<00:03:35.509> with<00:03:35.659> you<00:03:35.900> what<00:03:36.680> do<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.829> get<00:03:37.189> as<00:03:37.430> far

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
messes with you what do you get as far

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.199 
messes with you what do you get as far

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:58.009 
there it took me some work to get there

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.670 
there it took me some work to get there
and<00:03:58.269> unless<00:03:59.269> you<00:03:59.479> work<00:03:59.930> with<00:03:59.959> this<00:04:00.259> for<00:04:00.439> a<00:04:00.500> long

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
and unless you work with this for a long

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.830 
and unless you work with this for a long
time<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:01.219> isn't<00:04:01.489> going<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:02.000> be<00:04:02.150> every<00:04:02.389> shot<00:04:02.599> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
time it isn't going to be every shot the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.319 
time it isn't going to be every shot the
same<00:04:03.049> it's<00:04:03.590> not<00:04:03.739> consistent<00:04:04.159> and<00:04:04.549> I<00:04:05.060> think

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
same it's not consistent and I think

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.509 
same it's not consistent and I think
also<00:04:05.509> the<00:04:05.959> other<00:04:06.139> element<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.979> is<00:04:07.219> what<00:04:07.370> we've

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
also the other element to is what we've

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.939 
also the other element to is what we've
noticed<00:04:07.699> is<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.259> these<00:04:09.259> guys<00:04:09.469> respond

right-handed but I didn't it was hard to

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.369 
right-handed but I didn't it was hard to
get<00:05:08.569> a<00:05:08.599> good<00:05:09.159> good<00:05:10.189> FOMA<00:05:10.969> yeah<00:05:11.750> I<00:05:11.990> had<00:05:12.169> trouble

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
get a good good FOMA yeah I had trouble

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.369 
get a good good FOMA yeah I had trouble
it's<00:05:12.889> also<00:05:13.069> really<00:05:13.520> powerful<00:05:13.960> it's<00:05:14.960> got<00:05:15.139> three

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
it's also really powerful it's got three

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.459 
it's also really powerful it's got three
holes<00:05:15.650> yeah<00:05:16.189> so<00:05:16.759> it's<00:05:17.419> really<00:05:17.719> powerful<00:05:18.319> so<00:05:18.439> I

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
holes yeah so it's really powerful so I

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.619 
holes yeah so it's really powerful so I
think<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:18.889> have<00:05:19.069> to<00:05:19.219> learn<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:19.610> like<00:05:19.789> harness

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
think you have to learn to like harness

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.360 
think you have to learn to like harness
it<00:05:20.779> a<00:05:20.840> little<00:05:21.020> bit<00:05:21.229> and<00:05:21.439> some<00:05:21.889> people<00:05:22.189> have

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
it a little bit and some people have

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.100 
it a little bit and some people have
