00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.439
 on the side that we are going to prepare today is 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.280
 the round with passes for it we go to 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.260
 need 200 grams of whipping cream 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.530
 225 grams of semi-skimmed milk 2 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.970
 yolks 50 grams of cane honey raisins and 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.859
 I was good 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.380
 Well, nothing the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.829
 is to take the raisins more or less the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.849
 amount of passes that one wants and I 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.790
 I put two good handfuls in a bowl and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.470
 covered lightly with romney we can 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.650
 also use cane rum but I 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.079
 I used rum honey because it's sweeter and 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.480
 we let it soak the raisins better than a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.610
 day for another and nothing started with the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.340
 frozen 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.390
 we put the milk in a saucepan add 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.670
 the cane honey 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.489
 that I use 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.949
 one that they sell in mercadona that are 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.320
 calling this lady of Carmen 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.500
 that's the honey you can get 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.500
 perfectly in mercadona and that's what 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.470
 put on low heat to heat in the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.270
 fire while we are separating the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.590
 clear of the buds because we're going to 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.229
 use only the yolks of the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.670
 we can keep them clear for 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.680
 make meringue and to do any 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.490
 type of sponge cake to make 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.000
 many things 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.880
 well we assemble the cream we assemble the cream 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.800
 just without sugar and without anything and once 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.630
 let's have the whipped cream we're going to 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.850
 put in the refrigerator so you do not 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.840
 lose the cold until we go to 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.840
 use 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.620
 And we already have the whipped cream ready and 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.620
 refrigerator to store it 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.320
 that is our milk with honey that is 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.360
 has warmed up has not come to boil 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.060
 just the shit melted with the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.420
 law and without ceasing to remove we add the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.900
 yolk that we have there prepared 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.110
 and that mixture we're going to take to the fire 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.240
 slow fire so you're a little bit 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.369
 that comes to boil when the cream is 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.950
 a little thick we remove from the fire and 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.560
 we let it cool completely when that 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.709
 mix is ​​cold completely we're going to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.690
 flirt with the whipped cream we will go 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.530
 linking with a spatula movements 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.920
 soft envelopes so that the cream does not 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.620
 lose a lot of its volume always something of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.930
 volume will lose but against less 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.959
 Well, it starts with me, well, better for the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.459
 final ice cream and that's our mix that 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.910
 We're going to take it to the refrigerator 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.430
 we're going to have four hours for it to be 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.819
 very cold and after four hours 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.879
 we assembled our our refrigerator 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.159
 we've had the juve 24 hours in 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.099
 the refrigerator we assemble the refrigerator 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.670
 we put it to work and when 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.769
 working we are adding the mixture 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.950
 by the opening that has in the part 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:05.269
 superior the mixture that we have added 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:09.450
 raisins without rum only raisins 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:13.670
 that are soaked and have absorbed 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.849
 the rum that mixture we're going to have 45 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.629
 minutes more or less keeping ibai 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.910
 have several moments that I caught with the 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.989
 camera so you can see how the lover goes 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.989
 when little by little 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.490
 where will go see how it is changing 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.210
 of texture as it goes from a mass 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.780
 liquid to a more solid mass with a 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.780
 body 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.860
 and after 45 minutes one hour or more 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.440
 least since we only have to put 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.220
 that ice cream in a container 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.860
 and take it to the freezer that reposes 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.800
 about two hours so that that ice cream 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.850
 have a little more body 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.770
 of the very rich rich taste is a 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.090
 recipe that I saw 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.120
 in the broth blog of the market of each 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.670
 neighborhood and from the first moment that 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.769
 lives on ice cream I saw your recipe I knew that I 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:24.090
 I was going to like that it's going to be a recipe 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.050
 wonderful and so born I only os 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.849
 I encourage you to try it 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.979
 there are well sides ready for 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.440
 save it and that 's my side after 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.099
 the 2 hours of rest in the freezer 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.789
 an ice cream very rich of flavor nothing 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.949
 nothing cloyingly sweet and the 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.340
 rum is hardly noticeable so I encourage you to 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.340
 you try it
