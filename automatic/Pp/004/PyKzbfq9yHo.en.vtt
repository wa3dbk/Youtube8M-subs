00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.820 
this can go straight into our other dish
which<00:02:26.150> should<00:02:26.330> be<00:02:26.450> metal<00:02:26.690> by<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:26.990> way<00:02:27.170> what

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
which should be metal by the way what

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.020 
which should be metal by the way what
I'm<00:02:27.890> going<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.070> do<00:02:28.160> now<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.370> get<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.580> bit<00:02:28.910> of

I'm going to do now is get a bit of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.000 
I'm going to do now is get a bit of
olive<00:02:29.180> oil<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.660> there<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:33.290> massage<00:02:33.770> that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
olive oil on there just massage that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.600 
olive oil on there just massage that
around<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:41.720> will<00:02:41.840> kind<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.050> help<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
around that will kind of help the

well done types

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.910 
well done types
so<00:03:22.730> I'll<00:03:22.790> just<00:03:22.910> watch<00:03:23.090> in<00:03:23.269> my<00:03:23.360> hands<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:23.920> that's

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
so I'll just watch in my hands so that's

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.110 
so I'll just watch in my hands so that's
been<00:03:25.160> seasoned<00:03:25.610> nicely

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
been seasoned nicely

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.300

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
I'm simply now going to move to the next

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.430 
I'm simply now going to move to the next
stage<00:03:28.519> which<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.940> getting<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.330> into<00:03:29.900> our<00:03:30.170> pan

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
stage which is getting it into our pan

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.390 
stage which is getting it into our pan
so<00:03:31.430> here<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:31.700> go<00:03:31.850> I've<00:03:32.300> got<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.510> nice<00:03:32.890> metal<00:03:33.890> oven

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
so here we go I've got a nice metal oven

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.120 
so here we go I've got a nice metal oven
tray<00:03:35.260> mentals<00:03:36.260> going<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.470> be<00:03:36.560> better<00:03:36.769> than<00:03:36.980> a

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
tray mentals going to be better than a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.310 
tray mentals going to be better than a
ceramic<00:03:37.640> or<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.820> glass<00:03:38.120> one

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
ceramic or a glass one

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.170 
ceramic or a glass one
I'm<00:03:40.320> not<00:03:40.470> adding<00:03:40.620> any<00:03:40.920> more<00:03:41.010> oil<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:42.150> I

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
I'm not adding any more oil to it like I

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.000 
I'm not adding any more oil to it like I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
nice thick piece of fat on there you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.250 
nice thick piece of fat on there you
probably<00:03:47.640> want<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.910> put<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.090> rack<00:03:48.360> in<00:03:48.570> here<00:03:48.810> put

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
probably want to put a rack in here put

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.240 
probably want to put a rack in here put
that<00:03:49.290> on<00:03:49.440> then<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.550> will<00:03:51.260> drip<00:03:52.260> down<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.890> keep

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
that on then it will drip down and keep

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.000 
that on then it will drip down and keep
it<00:03:53.370> nice<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.550> moist<00:03:53.880> all<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.870> way<00:03:54.960> through<00:03:55.230> so

going to so so simple in the oven like I
say<00:04:44.100> bit<00:04:44.310> more<00:04:44.490> of<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.610> mathematics<00:04:45.180> less<00:04:45.360> than

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
say bit more of a mathematics less than

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.710 
say bit more of a mathematics less than
anything<00:04:45.810> else<00:04:47.090> let's<00:04:48.090> take<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> look<00:04:48.540> at<00:04:48.600> that

anything else let's take a look at that

00:04:48.720 --> 00:05:12.240 
anything else let's take a look at that
when<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.930> comes<00:04:49.050> out

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250

okay there we go that's straight out the
oven<00:05:14.830> that's<00:05:15.730> feeding<00:05:15.880> my<00:05:16.060> oven<00:05:16.240> for<00:05:16.420> an<00:05:16.660> hour

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
oven that's feeding my oven for an hour

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.600 
oven that's feeding my oven for an hour
our<00:05:17.380> five<00:05:17.710> minutes<00:05:18.630> wanting<00:05:19.630> to<00:05:19.720> do<00:05:19.870> now

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
our five minutes wanting to do now

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.820 
our five minutes wanting to do now
get<00:05:21.610> some<00:05:21.790> foil<00:05:22.090> paper<00:05:22.500> aluminium<00:05:25.830> just

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
get some foil paper aluminium just

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.600 
get some foil paper aluminium just
loosely<00:05:27.280> cover<00:05:27.970> that<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:30.010> let<00:05:30.160> it<00:05:30.280> rest<00:05:30.460> for

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610

about ten or fifteen minutes like that

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.020 
about ten or fifteen minutes like that
that<00:05:34.540> way<00:05:34.720> all<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.080> juices<00:05:35.410> will<00:05:35.590> kind<00:05:35.800> of

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
that way all the juices will kind of

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.520 
that way all the juices will kind of
settle<00:05:37.030> and<00:05:37.330> do<00:05:37.480> their<00:05:37.690> thing<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.200> it<00:05:38.350> will<00:05:38.440> be

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
settle and do their thing and it will be

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.450 
settle and do their thing and it will be
nice<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:38.740> moist

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
nice and moist

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.040 
nice and moist
then<00:05:39.760> we'll<00:05:39.910> take<00:05:40.090> a<00:05:40.150> look<00:05:40.390> at<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:40.840> we'll

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
then we'll take a look at it and we'll

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.890 
then we'll take a look at it and we'll
cut<00:05:41.290> it<00:05:42.420> okay<00:05:43.420> let's<00:05:43.690> take<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:43.870> look<00:05:45.810> it's<00:05:46.810> about

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
cut it okay let's take a look it's about

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.400 
cut it okay let's take a look it's about
20<00:05:47.560> minutes<00:05:47.680> or<00:05:48.010> so<00:05:48.600> that's<00:05:49.600> nicely<00:05:49.870> sort<00:05:50.320> of

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
20 minutes or so that's nicely sort of

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.140 
20 minutes or so that's nicely sort of
kind<00:05:50.620> of<00:05:50.680> got<00:05:51.010> itself<00:05:51.280> together<00:05:51.640> again<00:05:51.940> now

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
kind of got itself together again now

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.970 
kind of got itself together again now
what<00:05:53.080> I'm<00:05:53.200> going<00:05:53.290> to<00:05:53.380> do<00:05:53.470> now<00:05:53.620> to<00:05:53.680> get<00:05:53.860> that

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
what I'm going to do now to get that

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.500 
what I'm going to do now to get that
onto<00:05:54.190> a<00:05:54.250> chopping<00:05:54.430> board<00:05:54.760> and<00:05:54.970> I'll<00:05:55.210> slice<00:05:55.450> it

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
onto a chopping board and I'll slice it

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.430 
onto a chopping board and I'll slice it
up<00:05:55.780> that's<00:05:56.320> it<00:05:57.570> so<00:05:58.570> then<00:05:58.690> we<00:05:58.780> have<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:58.990> look<00:05:59.320> at

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
up that's it so then we have it look at

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.060 
up that's it so then we have it look at
that<00:06:02.520> beautifully<00:06:03.520> moist<00:06:04.590> slightly<00:06:05.590> very<00:06:05.830> the
