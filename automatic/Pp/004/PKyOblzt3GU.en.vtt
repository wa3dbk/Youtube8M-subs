how am I gonna know well generally we
start<00:00:29.970> pulling<00:00:30.179> some<00:00:30.359> measurements<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:30.810> we

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
start pulling some measurements so we

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.990 
start pulling some measurements so we
can<00:00:31.050> cut<00:00:31.230> some<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> Ruan<00:00:31.949> uh-huh<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.910> then

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
can cut some of the Ruan uh-huh and then

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.490 
can cut some of the Ruan uh-huh and then
after<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.660> would<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:34.170> would<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.440> ahead

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
after that we would we would go ahead

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.310 
after that we would we would go ahead
and<00:00:34.620> staple<00:00:35.010> them<00:00:35.070> down<00:00:35.340> oh<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:37.020> create<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and staple them down oh you create a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.729 
and staple them down oh you create a
pattern<00:00:37.700> absolutely<00:00:38.730> Wow<00:00:39.290> without<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.530> we

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
pattern absolutely Wow without this we

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.280 
pattern absolutely Wow without this we
can't<00:00:40.980> cut<00:00:41.219> anything<00:00:41.600> this<00:00:42.600> makes<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
can't cut anything this makes all the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.990 
can't cut anything this makes all the
difference<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> world<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.579> allows<00:00:44.969> us

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
difference in the world this allows us

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.869 
difference in the world this allows us
to<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:46.010> exactly<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> overhangs<00:00:47.640> gotta

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to know exactly what the overhangs gotta

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.850 
to know exactly what the overhangs gotta
be<00:00:48.090> where<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.320> where<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> seams

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
be where it's got to be where the seams

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
be where it's got to be where the seams
have<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.399> where<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> sinks<00:00:51.000> gonna<00:00:51.210> be

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
have got to be where the sinks gonna be

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.090 
have got to be where the sinks gonna be
everything<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.289> know<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.920> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
everything so now I know that this is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
everything so now I know that this is
where<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.489> seam<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
where one seam is going to with with the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.110 
where one seam is going to with with the
granite<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:56.070> could<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> decision<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
granite now could I make a decision to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.760 
granite now could I make a decision to
have<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.420> seen<00:00:57.660> go<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.020> way<00:00:58.199> well<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.649> all

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
have my seen go this way well that all

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.959 
have my seen go this way well that all
depends<00:00:59.100> an<00:00:59.219> installment<00:00:59.670> you've<00:00:59.789> selected

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
depends an installment you've selected

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
depends an installment you've selected
and<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> reason<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> because<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and the reason that is because of the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
and the reason that is because of the
Vantage<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> materials<00:01:02.969> themselves<00:01:03.120> ah

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
Vantage of the materials themselves ah

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.050 
Vantage of the materials themselves ah
okay<00:01:04.439> now<00:01:04.860> why<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.369> use<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.880> particular

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
okay now why do you use this particular

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
okay now why do you use this particular
material<00:01:07.020> well<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.350> choose<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.770> material

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
material well we choose this material

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
material well we choose this material
over<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> other<00:01:09.000> materials<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
over a lot of the other materials that a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.990 
over a lot of the other materials that a
lot<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> other<00:01:10.560> shops<00:01:10.830> use<00:01:11.130> only<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> fact

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
lot of other shops use only for the fact

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
lot of other shops use only for the fact
that<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.240> more<00:01:12.450> durable<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.320> gives<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that it's more durable it gives you a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830 
that it's more durable it gives you a
longer<00:01:13.890> straighter<00:01:14.430> run<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> do

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
longer straighter run you can do

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.330 
longer straighter run you can do
overhangs<00:01:16.290> better<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.220> won't

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
overhangs better with it and they won't

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
overhangs better with it and they won't
flex<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.240> won't<00:01:18.360> break<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.720> in

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
flex and then it won't break down in

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.210 
flex and then it won't break down in
water<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> they'll<00:01:19.560> last<00:01:19.770> throughout<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
water and they'll last throughout the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
water and they'll last throughout the
whole<00:01:20.430> project<00:01:20.670> okay<00:01:21.659> now<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.650> want<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
whole project okay now what if I want to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.310 
whole project okay now what if I want to
make<00:01:23.040> any<00:01:23.220> changes<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.119> point<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> lot<00:01:25.170> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
make any changes at this point a lot of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.899 
make any changes at this point a lot of
times<00:01:25.500> you'll<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.830> people<00:01:26.520> want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> have

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
times you'll see people want to have

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.789 
times you'll see people want to have
some<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> an<00:01:27.540> overhang<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.439> right

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
some kind of an overhang over here right

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.260 
some kind of an overhang over here right
so<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> breakfast<00:01:30.240> bar

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so that they can have a breakfast bar

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.530 
stay true to form
they'll<00:01:41.009> stay<00:01:41.189> straight<00:01:41.579> they'll<00:01:42.240> keep<00:01:42.420> the
