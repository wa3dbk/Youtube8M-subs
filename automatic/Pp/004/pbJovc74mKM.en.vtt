00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.290
 he is more or less in the middle nor 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.090
 far behind and not far ahead and there 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:35.180
 is also worth every single more mounted 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:37.910
 in the first moment it will happen and it is 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.800
 of the illegal extraction of 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.930
 this front is hitting well look here 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.740
 strong on the road is the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.240
 strong to hit faster but later 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.810
 this to do all the movements in the 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.720
 day 4 at the same time but will have to 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.420
 nothing bad the population will come back I hope 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.269
 play and I hope in front of some have 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.269
 after the cushioning of the ball 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.840
 is the pedal positioning frontside jorge 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.210
 wedge is whole so a little up 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.649
 of the sheikh a little more in the middle and up 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.229
 here on the bridge 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.229
 I hit the glass eye 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.110
 the first steps with pop the dnit is the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.880
 next place your feet here 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.280
 That front foot that is the pec you do not 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.690
 will do anything with it will only take the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.110
 who can leave him right in the corner to 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.409
 facilitate the maneuver behind 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.799
 leave it straight and late afternoon leaves the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.140
 mouse to beat you kicking him well 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.090
 to that direction far behind your 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.090
 body is more or less like this 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.400
 then I'll teach you the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.690
 first steps there a flip is 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.030
 people will put their foot forward and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.970
 leave it well on bread well on tip 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.030
 knows half a foot only inside the shape well in the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.420
 half of the sheik skateboard and the back foot to 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.940
 people make it right on the tip too 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.730
 There, just squat, hit the eye and kick it. 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.430
 the foot forward and the same side 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.180
 Time for you to make the skate spin two 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.989
 times 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.989
 This is Felipe. 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.920
 jorge y find the cull because by 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.900
 more pulls out loudest speaker impute 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.900
 to get this done 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.590
 confident 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.590
 I went to turn 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.000
 after the same way 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.190
 Just come and say she's dead. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.770
 provided that the result 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.470
 Let's do this, confess to comply. 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.470
 Forget about talking enough there, pawn. 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.320
 it's just 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.660
 now voted some tips we were 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.440
 A certain fear of the end of you is going to vote 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.440
 against the pec 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.270
 I do not know how to kick 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:13.400
 operates in front here is as if it were 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:15.470
 flip will do it and if the object is a 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.500
 stone in the clip shooting game 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.920
 at the same time if country can go 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.420
 to the show that will already have the side either 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.420
 dilma decided to vote for a new 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:36.460
 flip is a mixture of maneuver it is 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:40.600
 a show of the 360 ​​along with the cold does not 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:44.140
 warm will do this here to gave me 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.930
 flip was made behind 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:52.150
 no, it was not in the middle was too much to 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.350
 car much more at the tip being made by 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.110
 front 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.860
 it was as if it were to end the 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.430
 leg movement will hit back 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.110
 kicking in the front will do the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.780
 otherwise it will stay there 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.070
 mike leigh cajias with legs and 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.070
 I know hot it's going to spin 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.419
 the company but even so you go 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.280
 put the foot in the opposite adverse veloso in 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.889
 2000 only that has ahead 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.889
 river thais green river 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.800
 and tomorrow is the following at the same time 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.680
 candy 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.050
 take the foot of the pen in portugal be already 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.220
 will be in place because the population of the 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.530
 time pulls everything to kill with edicts we saw 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.159
 real-time clients 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.909
 the concept is with respect to the mattoso 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:56.330
 at the same time we went to the mall 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:06:00.009
 and the quality of farofa and then think 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.009
 not europe 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.330
 then the first step is the position in 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.330
 up the spirit 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.740
 Flemish is a word that you do not 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.379
 have to hit the eye 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.919
 You have to drag your foot in the 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:25.530
 here is focus on the Brazilian 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:33.479
 here the movement here drags in that 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:35.689
 sense is the base and back in that 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.689
 movement 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:50.180
 to take a posthumous front foot 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:54.389
 I positioned it as if it were a flip 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:58.949
 engage behind the front base and 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:07:02.430
 behind goes well at this point that I noticed was 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:05.550
 knocking and kicking him even in the 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:09.259
 diagonal yes while beating spiral 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:12.259
 stone hot fronts will generate revolt is 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.259
