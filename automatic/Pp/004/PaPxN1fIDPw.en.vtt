00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
seven bear natural surprisingly the bear

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.170 
seven bear natural surprisingly the bear
satin<00:03:29.830> has<00:03:30.190> been<00:03:30.370> showing<00:03:30.550> up<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.850> little<00:03:31.030> bit

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
satin has been showing up a little bit

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.180 
satin has been showing up a little bit
darker<00:03:31.600> on<00:03:31.630> my<00:03:31.870> skin<00:03:32.140> tone<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.980> think

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
darker on my skin tone and I think

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.740 
darker on my skin tone and I think
that's<00:03:33.370> because<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.820> has<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.030> bit<00:03:34.360> more<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.660> a

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
that's because it has a bit more of a

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.170 
that's because it has a bit more of a
cooler<00:03:35.020> undertone<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.190> love<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.940> all

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
were coming across I noticed was that

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.050 
were coming across I noticed was that
the<00:05:20.290> foundation<00:05:20.860> wasn't<00:05:21.310> staying<00:05:21.580> on<00:05:21.880> the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
the foundation wasn't staying on the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.440 
the foundation wasn't staying on the
nose<00:05:22.240> very<00:05:22.540> well<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.620> what<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.040> actually<00:05:24.580> have

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
nose very well so what I actually have

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.530 
nose very well so what I actually have
found<00:05:25.810> is<00:05:26.140> that<00:05:26.170> I<00:05:26.860> don't<00:05:27.010> really<00:05:27.610> apply<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.180> lot

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
found is that I don't really apply a lot

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.110 
found is that I don't really apply a lot
of<00:05:28.690> foundation<00:05:29.200> to<00:05:29.320> my<00:05:29.440> nose<00:05:29.650> area<00:05:30.100> instead<00:05:31.060> I

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
of foundation to my nose area instead I

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.240 
of foundation to my nose area instead I
go<00:05:31.540> in<00:05:31.720> with<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:31.990> correcting<00:05:32.410> concealer<00:05:32.590> and

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
go in with the correcting concealer and

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.310 
go in with the correcting concealer and
I<00:05:33.580> think<00:05:33.910> that<00:05:34.180> because<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.630> concealer<00:05:35.200> is

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
I think that because the concealer is

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.050 
I think that because the concealer is
just<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.650> little<00:05:35.860> bit<00:05:35.980> thicker<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.580> just<00:05:36.820> works

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
just a little bit thicker it just works

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.750 
just a little bit thicker it just works
a<00:05:37.270> little<00:05:37.390> bit<00:05:37.600> better<00:05:37.660> on<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.169> nose<00:05:38.380> area<00:05:38.919> to

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
a little bit better on the nose area to

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.909 
a little bit better on the nose area to
set<00:05:40.030> all<00:05:40.210> of<00:05:40.330> that<00:05:40.540> I<00:05:40.750> have<00:05:40.960> mixed<00:05:41.320> my<00:05:41.530> summer

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
set all of that I have mixed my summer

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.220 
set all of that I have mixed my summer
bisque<00:05:42.250> powder<00:05:42.580> concealer<00:05:42.850> with<00:05:43.450> my<00:05:43.720> powder

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
bisque powder concealer with my powder

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.380 
bisque powder concealer with my powder
foundation<00:05:44.890> from<00:05:45.100> bare<00:05:45.310> minerals<00:05:45.669> the<00:05:46.180> only

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
foundation from bare minerals the only

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.360 
foundation from bare minerals the only
reason<00:05:46.750> I'm<00:05:46.900> mixing<00:05:47.260> my<00:05:47.320> foundation<00:05:48.130> is

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
reason I'm mixing my foundation is

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.250 
reason I'm mixing my foundation is
because<00:05:48.790> the<00:05:49.030> summer<00:05:49.240> this<00:05:49.510> is<00:05:49.780> a<00:05:49.840> little<00:05:50.140> bit

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
because the summer this is a little bit

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.680 
because the summer this is a little bit
too<00:05:50.470> light<00:05:50.740> for<00:05:50.770> me<00:05:51.160> right<00:05:51.340> now<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.820> this<00:05:52.480> is<00:05:52.660> a

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
too light for me right now and this is a

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.840 
too light for me right now and this is a
tip<00:05:52.990> that<00:05:53.020> I<00:05:53.169> give<00:05:53.260> people<00:05:53.440> if<00:05:54.400> your<00:05:54.610> powder

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
tip that I give people if your powder

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.430 
tip that I give people if your powder
concealer<00:05:55.090> is<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.630> little<00:05:55.930> bit<00:05:56.050> too<00:05:56.200> light<00:05:56.410> for

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
concealer is a little bit too light for

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.740 
concealer is a little bit too light for
you<00:05:56.890> mix<00:05:57.130> a<00:05:57.280> bit<00:05:57.430> of<00:05:57.520> your<00:05:57.640> foundation<00:05:57.880> into<00:05:58.570> it

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
you mix a bit of your foundation into it

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.400 
you mix a bit of your foundation into it
and<00:05:58.930> it<00:05:59.440> will<00:05:59.500> help<00:05:59.560> to<00:05:59.950> darken<00:06:00.340> up<00:06:00.490> the

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
and it will help to darken up the

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.900 
and it will help to darken up the
overall<00:06:02.410> look<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:02.980> the<00:06:03.160> actual<00:06:03.490> product

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
overall look and the actual product

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.390 
overall look and the actual product
itself<00:06:04.140> so<00:06:05.140> this<00:06:05.500> was<00:06:05.710> really<00:06:05.919> the<00:06:06.220> big

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
itself so this was really the big

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.430 
itself so this was really the big
turning<00:06:06.790> point<00:06:07.060> for<00:06:07.270> me<00:06:07.390> as<00:06:07.630> you<00:06:07.960> guys<00:06:08.140> know<00:06:08.410> I

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
original foundation just didn't seem to

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.740 
original foundation just didn't seem to
work<00:06:19.930> well<00:06:19.960> alongside<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:21.190> bare<00:06:21.400> skin<00:06:21.750> after

bell I think again the turning point for

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.570 
bell I think again the turning point for
me<00:06:54.940> was<00:06:54.970> kind<00:06:55.570> of<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:56.260> the<00:06:56.290> two<00:06:56.920> concealers

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
me was kind of the the two concealers

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.760 
me was kind of the the two concealers
that<00:06:57.850> I've<00:06:58.000> that<00:06:58.360> I've<00:06:58.480> kind<00:06:58.720> of<00:06:58.780> alternated

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
that I've that I've kind of alternated

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.040 
that I've that I've kind of alternated
with<00:06:59.980> the<00:07:00.340> correcting<00:07:01.030> concealer<00:07:01.210> itself

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
with the correcting concealer itself

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.710 
with the correcting concealer itself
just<00:07:02.830> helps<00:07:03.130> to<00:07:03.190> give<00:07:03.430> me<00:07:03.580> extra<00:07:03.910> coverage<00:07:04.510> and
