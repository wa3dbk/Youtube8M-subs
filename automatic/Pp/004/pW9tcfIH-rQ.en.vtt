plant foods slow-release plant food now
I'm<00:00:56.790> not<00:00:57.000> adding<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> either<00:00:57.720> one<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> those

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
I'm not adding it either one of those

I'm not adding it either one of those
but<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.820> only<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:01.010> sometimes<00:01:02.010> i<00:01:02.250> use

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
but that's only because sometimes i use

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.660 
but that's only because sometimes i use
this<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.150> carnivorous<00:01:03.449> plant<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
this for my carnivorous plant and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.700 
this for my carnivorous plant and
they're<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.509> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.869> fussy<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.259> what

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710

that<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> pot<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> specific<00:01:12.900> plant<00:01:13.439> then

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that in a pot for a specific plant then

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
that in a pot for a specific plant then
I'll<00:01:13.770> add<00:01:13.979> those<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> soil<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
I'll add those just to that soil that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.420 
I'll add those just to that soil that
I'm<00:01:15.630> putting

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
I'm putting

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.710 
I'm putting

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
pacific plan but so now just for the

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:39.800 
pacific plan but so now just for the
basic

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.880 

and<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.950> about<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.600> 20<00:01:42.600> gallon<00:01:42.930> tub<00:01:43.470> too

dry out faster you'll have to keep up on

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.440 
dry out faster you'll have to keep up on
your<00:02:32.770> watering<00:02:33.190> unless<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:33.790> add<00:02:34.000> some<00:02:34.030> of

your watering unless you add some of

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:44.940 
your watering unless you add some of
those<00:02:34.830> crystals<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.920> we<00:02:36.280> were

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950

and<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:04.920> keep<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.610> garage<00:03:05.819> and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and I just keep this in the garage and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.410 
and I just keep this in the garage and
come<00:03:06.840> out<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.050> use<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.440> as<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.709> knead<00:03:07.740> and
