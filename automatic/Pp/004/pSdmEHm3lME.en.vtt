00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 that the physical beauty genre banks 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.740
 said but we are on twitter for a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.060
 new video a small ad a 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.030
 little bit flash a little bit a job 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.469
 who came so this friends this is 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 an image that dean hormones has posted on 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.859
 twitter of the new inventory of the 1.9 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.420
 as they probably knew there a 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.869
 taker is going to be there as a drummer gates 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.460
 all that pvp combat update 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.410
 in fact and so suddenly they came 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.880
 so down logically it means 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.599
 that he will make you novelties a lot 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.160
 on the pvp 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.570
 the pdp it is necessary to know that it is some 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.890
 thing that was changed to the last 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.910
 times long ago I'm very 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.129
 glad I think it was with 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.239
 the appearance of potions puts so that's it 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.370
 so we can see quite a lot of things 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.140
 singular in this inventory already everything 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.280
 we just see that person 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.600
 is upside down actually it's the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.129
 particularity of the sorbonne diner 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 sorbonne you have to know that this is a 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.629
 minecraft developer and it turns out 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.699
 that this one 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.960
 this one knew how to skin upside down actually 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.730
 it is the peculiarity of leonard 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.320
 Benin what is in the air we see 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.699
 so here different types of arrows 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.800
 classic fesch palace of course the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.510
 arrows the nomad the habit of seeing and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.129
 we also see arrows a little bit 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.600
 weird 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 everything suggests that this one did it 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 I present this one the arrow of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.200
 slow of this lot but this one is the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 fire arrow and this one anyway a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.020
 little bit special I do not know at all 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.450
 if she will no doubt recall with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.590
 gold it will be quite expensive she looks 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.330
 pretty low of this arrow 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.530
 imagine if I do not know at all 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.700
 it is one that is just a 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.299
 picture did not say anything else on it 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.710
 but I think I think it's okay it could 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.930
 to be an arrow for example that you 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 shoot that will be super fast and they 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.810
 go straight for example new 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.880
 team all right who is very tall and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 that he very quickly and who at the limit face 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 more damage since actually done 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 sniper or something like that it could 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.180
 to be nice 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 and then two separate groups the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.579
 new arrows here the darian bow 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.450
 bow special but you will tell me 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.960
 but then he has worked on this 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.030
 case 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.670
 when he will shoot the normal sidi bow 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.539
 now at 1.9 transmarck and wax 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.890
 with 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.850
 what arrow will be launched that she 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.380
 was looking for what's going to be an arrow 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.909
 gold we make poison we will do so 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.530
 it's not at all and well I think 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.719
 that I have the answer friends and this 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.869
 answer comes thanks to this karkwa the 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.399
 shackles is an object well it's very 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.110
 long as the case what exists in 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.690
 the graphic files of minecraft 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.410
 in texture pack files 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.819
 it's been a very, very long time 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.629
 added we'll do it they tried to 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.400
 to add it but in fact finally 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.480
 finally I do not really know what 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.739
 happened but it did not have a big 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.209
 success or so they do not have it 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.769
 add I do not know what happened 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.730
 passed between world is well done i'm going 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.750
 explain to you a little bit 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.989
 running arrows on tires 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.310
 new 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.739
 in any case I think it's going to happen 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.329
 like that imagine I'm still 9 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.980
 I have a bow and arrows normal she 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.090
 is there how quickly I take 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.410
 can shoot arrows totally 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.209
 normally but if I have flashes 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.769
 special and that I did I sleep badly 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.739
 which ones I'm going to shoot I'm going to shoot 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.120
 normal arrows on the other hand if I have a 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.069
 a quarter that I put it in the ground 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.840
 special for the quiver and that I put 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.640
 my special buttocks just the clap and 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.200
 well his special arrows at least be 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.459
 withdraw let's imagine now that I 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.660
 change his arrows there I do not want more 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.160
 to advance fiery arrows but I 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.390
 want to shoot poison arrows and 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.319
 well I'm going to put my buttocks of poison 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.510
 in there and I'll pull you out of 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.760
 arrows and 2 3 just have good 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.810
 maybe the quiver will be kraft to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.790
 bout then maybe he'll be 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.019
 I do not know we can take it in 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.220
 fortresses or dungeons 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.780
 I wish it was profitable 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.950
 personally but probably with me 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.540
 do not know me that you have sticks of 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.010
 wood or leave no spider or without 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.989
 also doubt cowhide 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.389
 we do not know too much yet 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.700
 the moment the leaves will be of course 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.769
 kraft table I think with with 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.480
 potions and stuff like that well we 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.250
 also another one which has this look 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.389
 not talked about the case we'll talk about this 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.310
 city ​​by a I think it's not at all 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.110
 french such dramas 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.209
 you understood me people and well that 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.760
 this is the slogan I think of the shield the 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.890
 wish shield my shield 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.540
 in your opinion the shield how is this 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.590
 that it could be used again a 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.650
 once I'm going to tell you about life 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.110
 thermal encounter who will fight and 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.040
 well imagine someone who adjusts 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.450
 one and to do it and who are fighting 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.459
 less expensive than another one can do 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.980
 two things with this engine make typing 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.319
 his opponent did a parade and 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.500
 well separated big pro 9 is far less 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.540
 that people how pomx however 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.040
 however if he has a shield in this 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.590
 be here if he's a wooden shield by 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.209
 example well when he wants to do 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.220
 that he will have with his summer at the party this 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.769
 do a parade how 1.87 old 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.330
 saxon well exceed and well his hand 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.500
 left will come up with an animation 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.209
 very simple the first time we go 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.590
 see the left hand 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.570
 watch out the left hand will happen 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.459
 before he will take the shot that he 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570
 were meant on the shield 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.250
 so that is to say that the left hand is going 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.570
 wear the shield will arrive the wind the 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.979
 bouquet it will arrive in front instead 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.210
 of summer in place of the parade and 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.320
 slap in the place of that arras you 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.210
 will have an even more powerful parry 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.889
 it's thanks to the shield and the more 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.840
 shield and in luxurious materials 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.760
 the more he will be effective 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.020
 we can also expect to survive from 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.910
 day so for the shields so by 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.090
 example protection that allows us to 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.590
 better take the shots but take 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.210
 general courses or protection against 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.740
 the for useful protection against 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.760
 explosions or turn if they 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.990
 would allow you for example perhaps 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.340
 to kick back in front of a 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.080
 some charge of returning costs or 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.350
 to return part of the comfort 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.490
 as a merchant makes tent on an armor 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.289
 so that could be very, very 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.410
 very nice of the future all that it has 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.070
 really future I think the pvp 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.539
 is really being 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.430
 revolutionary is a good thing I 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.440
 think it's a good thing and me 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.030
 frankly I like it I like it 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.979
 Baby will be parts that will be 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.820
 very nice and I push this effect classified 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.650
 the games I 'm going to do on valves 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.600
 hilali and game we're going to do on 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.940
 vanilla friends are going to take a shot of 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.169
 young if it's going to be very very very cool 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.729
 frankly i have axis i can not wait to see 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.310
 there a taker it will be very nice 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.930
 so here we have the fan art so I 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.889
 it's not a word anymore 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.270
 trading day this is it really 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.150
 someone who made his shields 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.080
 he said do it could be a 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.940
 new craft a wooden shield a 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.020
 good customer stone to my client do 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.310
 and gold and a diamond shield 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.630
 it is true that it could look like 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.550
 I have a lot of wooden shields 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.960
 is looped empire for example which are 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.460
 very nice so after these two there are 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.600
 a little less original forget about in 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.760
 diamond stands out slightly the 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.430
 others is rather nice but here after 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.900
 the design all depends on the steps of 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.490
 textures but the design of the pack of 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.470
 normal textures it's not the most 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.640
 important I want to say and so of the 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.590
 group has for example you could have 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.030
 just a dd parade with shields in 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.960
 way to be like this finally short I 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.600
 just wanted to show you that because 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.520
 it's a pretty interesting thing @ 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.330
 manu crafting by the way do not hesitate to 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.940
 follow me on twitter 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.980
 @ physics team it's really really 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.450
 useful for me that you want to be proud 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.970
 because it allows me much more 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.380
 easily communicate with you me in 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.310
 made it clear on twitter I do not care 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.540
 the number of subscribers I liked 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.100
 really good day I do not even know the 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.330
 all my games currently no idea 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.250
 the number of subscribers I have on twitter 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.480
 what I just know is that it's 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.740
 still more convenient for you 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.360
 to speak simply 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.950
 yes a little detail music I you 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.420
 advise to go watch the video which the 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.500
 link is a microphone and also in the 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.550
 description of one if you are on 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.660
 smartphone or tablet you can 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.190
 click in the description it works 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.030
 very well 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.380
 I advise you to go see this link 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.900
 because in fact it's a vision that 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.430
 I had done he did not have too much 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.140
 a long time but more is actually this 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.180
 video was just about five things 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.350
 that he could be in the 1.9 he's 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.570
 finds that two of them and a 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.310
 normally they'll be there it's at 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.940
 that the arrows with the arrows 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.260
 potions and brassai be and fashion 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.550
 british it will probably be there too 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.840
 good good good news because 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.700
 dina lohan is working on it 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.500
 a lot he says on twitter actually 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.960
 he is trying to work on course 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.120
 I think about the regulation of modes 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.130
 so that could be very very cool 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.240
 So, do not forget to massacre this 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.860
 like button if you liked it 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.750
 and then subscribe if you want 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.220
 more do not hesitate to share this 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.570
 video also to send it to your stocks 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.520
 for them to see that there's plenty to 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:16.680
