now<00:01:53.490> we're<00:01:53.880> following<00:01:54.270> everything<00:01:54.509> through

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840

Yoda<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.320> point<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.890> view<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:56.969> really

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
Yoda is point of view which was really

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.719 
Yoda is point of view which was really
neat<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:58.070> there<00:01:59.070> were<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> few<00:01:59.460> things

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
neat because there were a few things

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.880 
neat because there were a few things
that<00:01:59.909> didn't<00:02:00.509> quite<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:00.899> sense<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.649> shizuru

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that didn't quite make sense in shizuru

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.179 
that didn't quite make sense in shizuru
side<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> story<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.540> now<00:02:03.890> brought<00:02:04.890> some

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
side of the story that now brought some

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.100 
side of the story that now brought some
light<00:02:05.369> into<00:02:05.610> effect<00:02:06.000> when<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.299> saw<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.049> through

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
light into effect when we saw it through

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.350 
light into effect when we saw it through
your<00:02:07.469> eyes<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.610> only<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.119> get

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
your eyes and you can only really get

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600 
your eyes and you can only really get
the<00:02:09.539> entire<00:02:09.840> story<00:02:10.319> by<00:02:10.950> watching<00:02:11.459> both

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the entire story by watching both

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.830 
the entire story by watching both
episodes<00:02:12.120> because<00:02:12.239> basically<00:02:12.930> both<00:02:13.050> episodes

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
episodes because basically both episodes

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.750 
episodes because basically both episodes
are<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.349> exact<00:02:14.680> same<00:02:14.709> storyline<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.640> we're
