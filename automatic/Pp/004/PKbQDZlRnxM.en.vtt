00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.510
 recipe just click here 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.279
 go back to our sheep we 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.000
 let's make a delicious guacamole 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.380
 home made 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.090
 for this recipe you are going to have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160
 need two really good lawyers 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.340
 ripe a tomato that we will peeled 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.279
 a target or a new onion a 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.770
 garlic clove a little bit of tabasco from 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.230
 lemon juice with salt and pepper and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.969
 that's all we start 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.100
 naturally by our lawyers 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.520
 so we cut them in half while turning 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 around the nucleus 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.360
 we recover the two parts and for 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.129
 remove the little trick kernel one shot 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.100
 knife in it we turn and that 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.010
 then take off we will take 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.530
 directly with a spoon and we're going 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.230
 able to put in a large container 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.730
 all the flesh of our lawyer is crushed 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.270
 then our lawyer using a 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.979
 fork 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.960
 and we will add the juice of half a lemon 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.640
 always the same technique for those who 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 do not know yet we're going to crash 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.659
 our knife in lemon 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.409
 which allows us to guide the juice well 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.630
 lemon then the interest all 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.189
 simply add lemon juice to 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 the lawyer is to stop the oxidation 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.780
 then cut your tomatoes and remove 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.220
 the pips using a spoon to 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:39.090
 soup and we will cut the flesh into small 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.549
 dice add your half tomatoes to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.950
 the lawyer and we go to the cutting of the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.689
 weird here like we cut it a 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.090
 first time in two years we do 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.470
 several cuts in the direction of the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.470
 length without going to the heels 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.399
 then several cuts horizontally 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.640
 and we will finish with one last cut 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.780
 vertical 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.310
 you noticed it's just 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.079
 the same technique as for carving a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 onion here and it's really about having some 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.539
 very very hungry pieces and if you 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.970
 really want to have pieces 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.800
 even more hungry take your knife to 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.870
 tomorrow 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.390
 and we're going to come and chop the last ones 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.040
 pieces we add to the rest of the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.530
 preparation and we will finish our of 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.140
 cuts with lie so always the same 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.650
 several cuts in the vertical then 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.720
 cutouts horizontally and for 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.100
 finish we just chopped with our 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.110
 knife to avoid having pieces 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.010
 a little too big and uncomfortable 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.890
 stuffy 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.320
 add the garlic clove add a few 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.090
 drops of tabasco 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.710
 mix well and it's ready but 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.870
 attention for tabasco no but you're 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.190
 not too much at first favorite rather taste 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.890
 and if you need it 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.940
 add years we are also a small 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.910
 little salt and a little pepper 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.800
 we will be able to mix and you come from 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.480
 reality a delicious guacamole makes 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.520
 house that you will be able to taste 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.540
 with small corn chips or even 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.410
 better with toast 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.410
