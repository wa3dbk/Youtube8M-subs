00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.960
 very good everyone is collaborating with 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.960
 good aunt of kylie with ne-yo 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.750
 Exactly I have here the zombie zombie dude 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.750
 and you have blades instead of a knife 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.310
 and now zombies as clever as you 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.380
 I'm going to cut the meat a little bit and 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.380
 make sure he is not dead 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.180
 in short and today we are going to do level 2 of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.579
 ditch also known as the most 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.579
 boring and more bland the game we started 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.420
 basically there are masses of rotten meat 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.420
 what do you have to load 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.019
 and that you know and apart is the most 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.130
 small of the game and boring is very 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.280
 boring 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.510
 the filter that is already boring is not 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.100
 boring 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.100
 down that list 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 you knew the address that I took to 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.890
 discover that the bodies that are here 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.080
 on the beach that appears on the beach in 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.119
 this game can not be killed when in 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.670
 when in 2004 when you kill them you go 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.220
 they give 200 pesetas 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.899
 If you get 200 pesetas, well, I do not know if 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.030
 200 arrived, they lent money if the 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.600
 they killed from here can not jump through 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:35.280
 of the shots 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:38.370
 Well, I have a balita ball or 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.390
 fuck with him 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.390
 we are in the second 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.130
 you have a stigma you have a steak map 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.100
 Actually I think it's going to pay 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.780
 with me because he just called stigma 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.620
 we should call him properly 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.620
 stigma 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.159
 oh god oh god because there are so many because 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.009
 there's so because there's an alexei because there's 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.479
 a unique because there is so much name and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.479
 because I know why I achieved so much achievement 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.940
 something to catch around here if there is a fish and 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.290
 the fish do not seem in story mode 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.290
 but they only appear here 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.980
 if you load it, give you a briefcase 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.650
 weapons which will come in handy 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.350
 basically they are several cool weapons for 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.350
 the end of the episode for the next 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.940
 episode we'll go with gun I hope and for 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.790
 at least I do not air validated habitat 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.019
 good opens the door itself clear 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.019
 by the way you have been stuck 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.989
 and here they have removed half of the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.569
 because life will not play well ok 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.780
 sure because I have the maximum green and 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.780
 the rest 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.680
 I do not see much sense in this room 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.609
 do not 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.660
 but here they are not in the head 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.140
 I say it again 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.140
 is 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.650
 anyway 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.920
 92 felt these doors why why 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.920
 they're here 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.560
 level 2 ditch and kill again the 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.560
 ix as we say in the episode 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.770
 we are not charging you up to 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.840
 points we did not know the two 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.740
 we have the gray quarterback 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.570
 I used skin 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.500
 and there we have a spirit look at what mode 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.500
 look straight 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.170
 and it's that easy and we just loaded up 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.800
 all the bugs of this level 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.260
 let's go for the monedita 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.870
 unless there is a pc in the area where 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.560
 is the newspaper do you know where is 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.560
 I'll put 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.020
 again it was perfect condition 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:23.850
 it's not so periodic 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.419
 and these people who do not know the game of 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:33.350
 memory no but there are some pieces of weapons 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.350
 of people and 22 gun ammunition 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.560
 let me break the same coin is not this 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.480
 I will break the highway 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.860
 in the middle 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.590
 but if I 'm not in the middle 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.699
 It is you who looks at the map we are a 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.699
 little as separate you know 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.009
 anyway 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.639
 I do not 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.020
 but you have to break it with all the 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.180
 force because if one does not deserve the 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.180
 penalty is moral worth is moral 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.919
 takes 90 90 400 of precision 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:20.870
 but it has won me in pasta enjoy it 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.870
 noticing 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:30.080
 efe 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:32.249
 I just got two whitham shotguns 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.469
 at level 4 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:36.469
 and another level 5 precision rifle 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.720
 I can not afford it 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.260
 two 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.260
 que 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:57.810
 it puts me level 2 is getting to level 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.970
 3 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.370
 you are lying to me you are not thin 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.009
 finally say goodbye to our 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.719
 viewers 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.809
 well we still have not died to any 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:17.330
 time but quiet to get things to 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:19.779
 your time you'll see if until another 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.779
