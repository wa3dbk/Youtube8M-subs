00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.270
 bah 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello I will explain how 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.520
 sew the side inserts of the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.290
 poppy dress I assembled the 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.750
 seams of the poles of the party 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 superior of the poppy dress that is 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.820
 in jersey so I start with placed 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:28.019
 but my patches in law against the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.539
 side of the tank top I use my 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.330
 clip to hold tissues together 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.970
 and I come to place my assembly and I 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.740
 sting along the edge 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.490
 geoffrey as the pins 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.180
 I come on dive 2 mm from the edge on the 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.860
 cotton part to solidify 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.690
 more 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.500
 then when this assembly is complete 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:06.550
 I will place in cotton inserts 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.680
 against the opposite part in jersey I 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.790
 perform the same operation I assemble to 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.300
 using my purposes 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.300
 and I come to sew along or that edge 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.300
 play on also pick the other side 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.520
 I superimpose the junction of my two 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.880
 jersey cultures in the middle of my 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.990
 cotton inserts and I realize a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.990
 holding stitch at 5 mm from the edge 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.640
 we 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.510
 Yes 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.409
 that's how I form the side of my 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.590
 tank tops and 7 yokes gives a 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.259
 little ease to pop here is the result 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.200
 with another fabric when one has 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.649
 assembled the yoke on both sides of the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.649
 longshoreman
