00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.639 
rest in between each round active rest
could<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.100> anything<00:00:41.250> from<00:00:41.460> running<00:00:41.969> sprints

two<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> half<00:00:57.870> three<00:00:57.989> mile<00:00:58.199> back<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.710> would

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
two and a half three mile back it would

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.500 
two and a half three mile back it would
take<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> would<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.550> equivalent<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.059> probably

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
take it would be equivalent to probably

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.380 
take it would be equivalent to probably
about<00:01:00.780> three<00:01:01.170> seven-minute<00:01:01.770> miles<00:01:01.949> yeah<00:01:02.640> Wow

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
first what I do here well let me

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.980 
first what I do here well let me
actually<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.360> demonstrate<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.900> her

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
actually can I demonstrate with her

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.410 
actually can I demonstrate with her
first<00:01:10.229> good<00:01:10.950> idea<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
first good idea this is just this is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.770 
first good idea this is just this is
just<00:01:12.450> an<00:01:12.840> example<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:14.220> say<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.820> round<00:01:15.119> at<00:01:15.630> this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
just an example of say one round at this

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
just an example of say one round at this
one<00:01:16.020> round<00:01:16.229> will<00:01:16.590> start<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.979> something<00:01:17.430> slow

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
one round will start out something slow

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.460 
one round will start out something slow
this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> gonna<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.780> does<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> works

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this is gonna what this does is it works

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
this is gonna what this does is it works
on<00:01:19.650> our<00:01:19.770> hand<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.070> eye<00:01:20.130> coordination<00:01:20.450> it's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
on our hand and eye coordination it's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.149 
on our hand and eye coordination it's
also<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.720> full<00:01:21.990> body<00:01:22.200> workout<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.830> she<00:01:22.950> got

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
also a full body workout because she got

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
also a full body workout because she got
resistance<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.330> we'll<00:01:24.479> start<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:24.869> just

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
resistance so we'll start out with just

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.980 
resistance so we'll start out with just
like<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.409> jab<00:01:25.710> cross<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.640> two

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.510 

okay<00:01:31.990> break<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.710> then<00:01:32.890> now<00:01:33.040> we're<00:01:33.190> gonna<00:01:33.280> go

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
okay break and then now we're gonna go

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.310 
okay break and then now we're gonna go
to<00:01:33.550> light<00:01:33.850> some<00:01:34.060> hooks<00:01:34.330> which<00:01:34.600> works<00:01:34.960> on<00:01:35.140> herb

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
to light some hooks which works on herb

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.440 
to light some hooks which works on herb
leaks<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.860> her<00:01:35.980> core<00:01:36.220> muscles<00:01:36.700> took<00:01:37.300> with

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
leaks and her core muscles took with

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.280 

and<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.299> just<00:03:52.480> one<00:03:52.629> of<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.810> things<00:03:53.019> that

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
and this is just one of the things that

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.580 
and this is just one of the things that
you<00:03:53.409> can<00:03:53.620> do<00:03:53.799> in<00:03:53.950> between<00:03:54.310> rounds<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.780> at<00:03:56.409> any

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
you can do in between rounds and at any

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.050 
you can do in between rounds and at any
rate<00:03:56.830> basically<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.730> have<00:03:57.909> the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
rate basically you just have the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.699 
rate basically you just have the
different<00:03:58.420> stations<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.200> work<00:03:59.409> through

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
different stations that you work through

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.530 
different stations that you work through
so<00:03:59.950> it's<00:04:00.129> circuits<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:00.640> through<00:04:00.879> you<00:04:01.180> can<00:04:01.360> see

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
so it's circuits you through you can see

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.860 
so it's circuits you through you can see
you<00:04:02.049> can<00:04:02.200> see<00:04:02.409> how<00:04:02.440> much<00:04:02.739> energy<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:04.750> can

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
you can see how much energy that you can

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.449 
you can see how much energy that you can
see<00:04:04.989> how<00:04:05.049> much<00:04:05.260> energy<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.799> takes<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:06.370> that

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
see how much energy that takes and that

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.170 
see how much energy that takes and that
was<00:04:06.610> like<00:04:06.819> all<00:04:07.060> of<00:04:07.209> six<00:04:07.599> seconds<00:04:08.019> right

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
was like all of six seconds right

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.119 
was like all of six seconds right
minutes<00:04:10.180> at<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.540> time<00:04:10.750> well<00:04:11.319> not<00:04:11.620> just<00:04:11.680> this

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
minutes at a time well not just this

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.589 
minutes at a time well not just this
this<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.610> just<00:04:12.819> something<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.299> can<00:04:13.480> do

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
this is just something that you can do

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.819 
this is just something that you can do
in<00:04:13.720> between<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:14.290> we<00:04:14.440> have<00:04:14.560> designated

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
in between so we have designated

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.500 
in between so we have designated
stations<00:04:15.579> we<00:04:15.730> have<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.060> heavy<00:04:16.239> bag

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
stations we have the heavy bag

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.900 
stations we have the heavy bag
horizontal<00:04:17.440> bag<00:04:17.590> speed<00:04:18.130> bag<00:04:18.370> you're

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
horizontal bag speed bag you're

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.310 
horizontal bag speed bag you're
basically<00:04:19.180> working<00:04:19.389> on<00:04:19.660> your<00:04:19.810> speed<00:04:20.079> and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
basically working on your speed and

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.930 
basically working on your speed and
agility<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.949> you're<00:04:21.070> developing<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.729> over

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
agility and you're developing it over

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.120 
agility and you're developing it over
time<00:04:22.150> so<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:23.050> imagine<00:04:23.500> over<00:04:23.590> time<00:04:23.740> would

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
time so and I imagine over time would

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.040 
time so and I imagine over time would
this<00:04:24.220> actually<00:04:24.280> help<00:04:24.850> somebody<00:04:25.090> with<00:04:25.900> their
