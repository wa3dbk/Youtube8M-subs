a<00:04:41.650> great<00:04:42.130> rivalry<00:04:42.340> sets<00:04:43.270> up<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.450> great

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
a great rivalry sets up a great

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.600 
a great rivalry sets up a great
semifinal<00:04:44.260> matchup<00:04:44.440> well<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.070> certainly<00:04:45.220> does

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
semifinal matchup well it certainly does

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.670 
semifinal matchup well it certainly does
and<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:46.120> this<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.450> where<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.930> old<00:04:47.080> cliches

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
and and this is where the old cliches

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.710 
and and this is where the old cliches
like<00:04:47.710> three<00:04:48.520> freshmen<00:04:49.030> players<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.570> your

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
like three freshmen players in your

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.710 
like three freshmen players in your
rotation<00:04:50.350> and<00:04:50.530> playing<00:04:51.160> your<00:04:51.700> third<00:04:52.120> game<00:04:52.480> I

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
rotation and playing your third game I

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.520 
rotation and playing your third game I
think<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.290> is<00:04:53.530> going<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.890> wear<00:04:54.400> down

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
think this is going to wear down

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.230 
think this is going to wear down
delaware<00:04:56.530> Drexel<00:04:57.460> they've<00:04:57.850> got<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
delaware Drexel they've got the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.390 
delaware Drexel they've got the
experience<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:58.990> think<00:04:59.020> Drexel<00:04:59.740> runs<00:04:59.950> away<00:05:00.190> with

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
experience I think Drexel runs away with

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.620 
experience I think Drexel runs away with
it<00:05:01.320> Drexel<00:05:02.320> to<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.560> championship<00:05:03.160> game<00:05:03.630> and

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
it Drexel to the championship game and

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.020 
it Drexel to the championship game and
then<00:05:04.750> at<00:05:04.870> four-thirty<00:05:05.470> Sunday<00:05:06.010> not<00:05:06.640> that<00:05:06.850> this

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
then at four-thirty Sunday not that this

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.470 
then at four-thirty Sunday not that this

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
three games in three weeks certainly VCU

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.310
