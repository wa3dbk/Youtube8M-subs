and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.710> did<00:01:08.189> sevens<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.700> well<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and I did sevens as well but I think the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.679 
and I did sevens as well but I think the
whole<00:01:11.159> lining<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.820> half<00:01:12.000> against<00:01:12.479> another

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
whole lining up at half against another

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.399 
whole lining up at half against another
nation<00:01:13.140> singing<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:14.070> anthem<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.820> their

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
nation singing your anthem in in their

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
nation singing your anthem in in their
home<00:01:16.409> stadium<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.100> guess<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.490> front<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.759> their

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
home stadium I guess in front of their

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
home stadium I guess in front of their
fans<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.390> quite<00:01:19.790> quite<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:20.880> experience<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
fans is quite quite an experience and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.740 
fans is quite quite an experience and
definitely<00:01:22.680> gets<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.060> mindset<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.600> play

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
number one book so far is probably

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.600 
number one book so far is probably
Malcolm<00:01:41.909> Malcolm<00:01:42.420> Gladwell's<00:01:43.170> outliers

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
Malcolm Malcolm Gladwell's outliers

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
Malcolm Malcolm Gladwell's outliers
she's<00:01:44.610> probably<00:01:44.790> my<00:01:45.000> number<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.689> far<00:01:45.899> how

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
she's probably my number one so far how

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.730 
she's probably my number one so far how
well<00:01:47.040> he<00:01:47.159> has<00:01:47.280> four<00:01:47.549> books<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.750> mean<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> just

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
well he has four books and I mean I just

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.399 
well he has four books and I mean I just
like<00:01:50.009> reading<00:01:50.430> different<00:01:50.610> opinions<00:01:51.149> on

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
like reading different opinions on

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.539 
like reading different opinions on
social<00:01:52.409> economics<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.009> stuff<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.369> so

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
social economics and stuff like that so

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.420 
social economics and stuff like that so
I<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.570> didn't<00:01:54.990> enjoy<00:01:55.259> his<00:01:55.799> views<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.280> it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
I really didn't enjoy his views on it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.639 
I really didn't enjoy his views on it
and<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:56.640> outliers<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.659> good<00:01:58.439> book

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and I think outliers is just a good book

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.050 
and I think outliers is just a good book
for<00:01:58.680> anybody<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.490> because<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.880> just

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
for anybody really because it's just

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.209 
for anybody really because it's just
different<00:02:00.930> stories<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.439> success<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.009> how

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
different stories of success and how

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.030 
different stories of success and how
people<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.670> come<00:02:02.880> into<00:02:03.119> success<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:04.799> yet<00:02:05.009> i

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
people do come into success so not yet i

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.220 
people do come into success so not yet i
