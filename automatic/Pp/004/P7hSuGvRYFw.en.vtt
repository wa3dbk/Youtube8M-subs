366<00:00:08.970> i<00:00:09.120> -<00:00:09.710> and<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> computer<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
366 i - and this is a computer that I

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.990 
366 i - and this is a computer that I
finally<00:00:13.559> got<00:00:13.830> fixed

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
finally got fixed

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.769 
finally got fixed
I<00:00:15.560> fixed<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.650> yesterday<00:00:16.859> half<00:00:17.779> because

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
I fixed it yesterday half because

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.570 
I fixed it yesterday half because
yesterday<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> got<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> RAM<00:00:19.890> stick<00:00:22.580> showing

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
yesterday I got the RAM stick showing

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.920 
yesterday I got the RAM stick showing
you<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:23.939> gonna<00:00:24.060> show<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:24.600> proof

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
you I'm gonna show you a little proof

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.630 
you I'm gonna show you a little proof
here<00:00:26.300> yep<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.480> running<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.320> 128<00:00:29.279> megabytes

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
here yep this running with 128 megabytes

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.020 
here yep this running with 128 megabytes
of<00:00:30.150> RAM<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.949> yes<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.730> could<00:00:33.000> go<00:00:33.210> up<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.480> 256<00:00:35.030> I'd

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
of RAM and yes it could go up to 256 I'd

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.299 
of RAM and yes it could go up to 256 I'd
rather<00:00:36.329> use<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> 128<00:00:37.380> stick<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
rather use a 128 stick because of the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.970 
rather use a 128 stick because of the
hard<00:00:38.940> drive<00:00:39.149> space<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.260> still<00:00:40.800> got

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
hard drive space because it still got

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
hard drive space because it still got
the<00:00:41.070> 4<00:00:41.250> gig<00:00:41.460> hard<00:00:41.760> drive<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.250> fact<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.910> also

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the 4 gig hard drive and in fact I also

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.950 
the 4 gig hard drive and in fact I also
got<00:00:45.809> something<00:00:46.260> special<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.960> Ethernet

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
got something special for it Ethernet

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.479 
got something special for it Ethernet
mode<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.710> that's<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.340> Linksys<00:00:52.489> which

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
mode and that's right a Linksys which

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
mode and that's right a Linksys which
was<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.969> also<00:00:54.149> compatible<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:55.670> m<00:00:56.670> e<00:00:56.969> NT<00:00:57.480> 4.0

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
was it's also compatible with m e NT 4.0

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.340 
was it's also compatible with m e NT 4.0
Windows<00:00:58.770> 2000<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.489> Windows<00:00:59.579> XP<00:01:00.140> it's<00:01:01.140> only

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
Windows 2000 and Windows XP it's only

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.590 
Windows 2000 and Windows XP it's only
compatible<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.010> 98<00:01:02.579> SC<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.239> had<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
compatible with 98 SC and I had that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.850 
compatible with 98 SC and I had that
with<00:01:03.809> cd-rom<00:01:04.350> drive<00:01:04.680> which<00:01:05.460> already<00:01:05.880> does<00:01:06.860> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
with cd-rom drive which already does in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.469 
with cd-rom drive which already does in
a<00:01:08.100> process<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.760> two<00:01:08.909> hundred<00:01:08.939> megahertz

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
a process of what two hundred megahertz

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.149 
a process of what two hundred megahertz
are<00:01:09.840> above<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.960> minimum<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.470> 16

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
are above and the minimum of 16

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.969 
are above and the minimum of 16
megabytes<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.790> RAM<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:17.790> pretty<00:01:18.090> good

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
megabytes of RAM so that's pretty good

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.170 
megabytes of RAM so that's pretty good
so<00:01:19.979> anytime<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> hook<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
so anytime I want to hook it up to the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.690 
so anytime I want to hook it up to the
internet<00:01:21.570> or<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.930> bring<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.229> any<00:01:22.380> other<00:01:22.530> room

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.880 

it<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.850> simple<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.330> install<00:01:27.570> too

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.640 

it<00:01:32.460> only<00:01:32.610> goes<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> thousand<00:01:33.720> megabits<00:01:34.229> per

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it only goes a thousand megabits per

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.810 
it only goes a thousand megabits per
second<00:01:36.200> it's<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.320> gigabit<00:01:37.860> each<00:01:38.280> network

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
second it's a gigabit each network

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.750 
second it's a gigabit each network
adapter<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> has<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:43.080> real<00:01:43.920> attack<00:01:44.220> chip<00:01:44.550> on
