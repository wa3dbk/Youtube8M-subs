the<00:00:00.780> ADC<00:00:01.530> object<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.190> pure<00:00:02.610> data<00:00:02.850> is

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
the ADC object in pure data is

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.579 
the ADC object in pure data is
essentially<00:00:03.570> taking<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.080> sound<00:00:04.319> from<00:00:04.529> the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
essentially taking in sound from the

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.680 
essentially taking in sound from the
microphone<00:00:04.730> so<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.000> can<00:00:06.660> put<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.319> an<00:00:07.740> object<00:00:08.130> at

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
microphone so I can put in an object at

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.310 
microphone so I can put in an object at
ADC<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.929> tilde<00:00:10.860> because<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.340> deals<00:00:11.519> with<00:00:11.639> sounds

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
ADC a tilde because it deals with sounds

if<00:00:13.429> you<00:00:14.429> look<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> ADC<00:00:15.330> help<00:00:15.599> menu<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.049> well

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
if you look at the ADC help menu as well

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.439 
if you look at the ADC help menu as well
the<00:00:16.650> help<00:00:16.859> patch<00:00:17.039> comes<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.550> you'll<00:00:18.060> see<00:00:18.270> that

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the help patch comes up you'll see that

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.720 
the help patch comes up you'll see that
we<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.439> few<00:00:19.740> options<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.369> terms<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
we have a few options here in terms of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.580 
we have a few options here in terms of
the<00:00:20.939> amount<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.689> channels<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.320> bring

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the amount of channels that we can bring

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.259 
the amount of channels that we can bring
in<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:23.670> only<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:23.970> you've<00:00:24.090> got<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
in that's really only if you've got a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.509 
in that's really only if you've got a
sophisticated<00:00:25.050> sound<00:00:25.439> card<00:00:25.710> generally

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
sophisticated sound card generally

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.189 
sophisticated sound card generally
speaking<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:27.119> will<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.449> take<00:00:27.630> from<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.019> left

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
speaking we will just take from the left

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
speaking we will just take from the left
channel<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:29.099> will<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.400> feed<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.760> into

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
channel and we will just feed it into

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.389 
channel and we will just feed it into
some<00:00:30.330> kind<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.720> other<00:00:31.109> object<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:32.160> show<00:00:32.340> you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
some kind of other object to show you

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.799 
some kind of other object to show you
the<00:00:32.610> type<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.820> sound<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.329> comes<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the type of sound that comes in from the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.900 
the type of sound that comes in from the
ADC<00:00:34.110> let's<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.860> create<00:00:35.160> an<00:00:35.280> array<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.850> I'm

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
ADC let's just create an array so I'm

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.510 
ADC let's just create an array so I'm
just<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> go<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> menu<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
just going to go up to the menu here and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.729 
just going to go up to the menu here and
just<00:00:38.520> go<00:00:38.670> array<00:00:39.090> I'll<00:00:39.780> leave<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.200> array<00:00:40.440> one

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
just go array I'll leave it as array one

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.940 
just go array I'll leave it as array one
change<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> Bezier<00:00:41.730> curve<00:00:42.000> click<00:00:42.809> OK<00:00:43.200> we'll

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
change it to Bezier curve click OK we'll

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.889 
change it to Bezier curve click OK we'll
drag<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.370> over<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.149> also<00:00:45.329> we'll<00:00:45.719> just

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
drag that over here and also we'll just

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.100 
drag that over here and also we'll just
use<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.440> tandem<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.129> tab<00:00:47.399> right

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
use that in tandem with the tab right

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.389 
use that in tandem with the tab right
object<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:50.100> tab<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:50.610> array<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.399> we'll

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
object so tab right array one and we'll

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.090 
object so tab right array one and we'll
set<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.820> metro<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.600> well<00:00:54.920> just<00:00:55.920> so

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
set up a metro on that as well just so

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880 
set up a metro on that as well just so
that<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.690> continuously<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:58.620> what's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that we can continuously see what's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
that we can continuously see what's
happening<00:00:59.280> give<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> Metro<00:01:00.629> object<00:01:01.109> an

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
happening give the Metro object an

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.139 
happening give the Metro object an
initial<00:01:01.320> argument<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.039> 100<00:01:02.370> milliseconds<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
initial argument of 100 milliseconds and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.700 
initial argument of 100 milliseconds and
we're<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> bang<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> tab<00:01:04.680> right

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
we're just going to bang the tab right

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.270 
we're just going to bang the tab right
array<00:01:05.689> arthas<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.810> bright<00:01:07.020> object<00:01:07.130> that<00:01:08.130> was

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
array arthas a bright object that was

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.200 
array arthas a bright object that was
feeding<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.909> output<00:01:09.090> from<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> ADC<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> keep

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
feeding the output from the ADC so keep

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600 
feeding the output from the ADC so keep
an<00:01:12.360> eye<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.200> array<00:01:13.439> let's<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
an eye on the array let's see if that

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.200 
an eye on the array let's see if that
thing<00:01:14.729> happens<00:01:15.090> there<00:01:15.350> one<00:01:16.880> remember<00:01:17.880> also<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
thing happens there one remember also to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.749 
thing happens there one remember also to
switch<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> audio<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.950> main<00:01:20.400> window

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
switch on the audio on your main window

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.050 
switch on the audio on your main window
so<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.930> there's<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.380> bit<00:01:22.500> of

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
so we can see there's a little bit of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.010 
so we can see there's a little bit of
thr<00:01:24.060> coming<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.600> through<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
thr coming in there through the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
thr coming in there through the
microphone<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> make<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.850> bit

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
microphone just to make it a little bit

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
microphone just to make it a little bit
bigger<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.540> see<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> ADC<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.770> my

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
bigger you can see that the ADC are my

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.429 
bigger you can see that the ADC are my
array<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.369> often<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:31.259> very

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
array one often it just is very very

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.249 
array one often it just is very very
slight<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.520> oftentimes<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.810> just

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
slight so oftentimes what we do is just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
slight so oftentimes what we do is just
boost<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> signal<00:01:35.280> coming<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.610> from<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> ADC

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
boost the signal coming in from the ADC

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.469 
boost the signal coming in from the ADC
and<00:01:36.890> we<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.250> by<00:01:38.520> inserting<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and we do that by inserting a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.590 
and we do that by inserting a
multiplication<00:01:40.320> object<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.520> wave<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
multiplication object so a wave that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.510 
multiplication object so a wave that
we're<00:01:42.720> multiplying<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.409> or<00:01:43.590> boosting<00:01:43.979> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we're multiplying here or boosting so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.539 
we're multiplying here or boosting so
it's<00:01:44.899> asterisks<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.049> tilde<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:47.369> we'll

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it's asterisks and tilde and then we'll

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.639 
it's asterisks and tilde and then we'll
multiply<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.000> by<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.390> number<00:01:48.750> 10<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> good

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
multiply it by some number 10 is a good

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
multiply it by some number 10 is a good
number<00:01:49.799> gives<00:01:50.310> us<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.460> good<00:01:50.790> strong<00:01:51.240> kind<00:01:51.540> of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
number gives us a good strong kind of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
number gives us a good strong kind of
signal<00:01:51.960> coming<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.470> into<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> actual

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
signal coming in then into the actual

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
signal coming in then into the actual
array<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> see

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
array that we can see so we can see

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
array that we can see so we can see
there<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> big<00:01:55.740> difference<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.310> yeah<00:01:56.729> ten

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
there a big difference there yeah ten

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.620 
there a big difference there yeah ten
suited<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.729> said<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> beginning<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
suited so as I said at the beginning of

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.959 
suited so as I said at the beginning of
the<00:02:00.719> tutorial<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:01.979> sure<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.820> you've

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the tutorial make sure that if you've

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.670 
the tutorial make sure that if you've
got<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.329> sophisticated<00:02:03.630> sound<00:02:04.290> carriage

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
got a more sophisticated sound carriage

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.810 
got a more sophisticated sound carriage
you<00:02:04.829> might<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.460> different

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you might have a lot of different

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.399 
you might have a lot of different
channels<00:02:06.180> coming<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.540> through<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.869> check

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
channels coming in through here check

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.020 
channels coming in through here check
the<00:02:07.530> health<00:02:07.710> menu<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.129> ADC<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.879> health

patch<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.479> will<00:02:09.599> show<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.810> how<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.170> that

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
patch that will show you how to do that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.540 
patch that will show you how to do that
