00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.750
 factors influencing metabolism 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.910
 cells then we will we 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.610
 tap on a particular example for 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.189
 see what are the external factors 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.720
 that vary the chemical reactions 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.110
 which takes place inside the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.480
 cell 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.070
 for that we will work on 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.320
 eggs glen the odelein these are 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.119
 unicellular plants, that is to say 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.310
 composed of a single cell that I have 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.790
 represented here since these are 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.770
 plants 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.680
 these cells are delimited by a 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.930
 wall then a membrane it has a 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.730
 nucleus these are eukaryotic cells and 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.800
 especially in the eagles n there is a big 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.289
 chloroplasts that occupy the majority 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.239
 of the cytoplasm so here they are 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.859
 represented rather roughly I have them 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.589
 represented in small then in 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:53.170
 the experience I'm going to present 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.140
 were grown in a medium the glen 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.079
 of culture that provides them with water and 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.399
 only mineral salts this 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.769
 culture was done in two conditions 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.720
 be dark what is this 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.980
 is shown to the left either at the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 light here on the right we placed so d 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.370
 ugly nose we observed their 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.410
 possible developments during 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.990
 a few days so we realize 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.370
 here on day 1 is here on day 3 we get 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.530
 reports that in the dark 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.140
 the eagles they have multiplied little 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.400
 between day 1 and day 3 we have 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.350
 about the same number 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.350
 whereas in the light they are 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.270
 much more multiplied so there is a 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.130
 different cell multiplication this 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.560
 which means that the metabolism of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.540
 eggs glen in the dark is not the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.550
 same as in the light actually here these 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.520
 plant cells are able to 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.590
 make a chemical reaction that you 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:55.510
 have heard talk called the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:56.320
 photo synthesis when it makes 7 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.410
 photosynthesis 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.360
 she uses light energy to 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.150
 produce their organic materials and 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.890
 so multiply in the absence of 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.420
 light they are not able to 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.519
 carry out photosynthesis because it's their 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.220
 lacks the necessary energy and therefore 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.240
 they multiply little unless we 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.890
 provide them not only 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.570
 water and mineral salts but 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.870
 also organic matter by 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.270
 example of glucose in this case there if we 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.640
 grow seeds in the dark with 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.830
 with mineral salts and glucose 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.020
 then we will observe a multiplication 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.780
 much more important between day 1 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.760
 and day 3 in other words we can say 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.450
 that according to the medium the metabolism 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.900
 cell is different the environment 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.040
 cells influence their metabolism 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.580
 here in the cell example 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.160
 vegetable 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.140
 it's the presence of light or at 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.430
 contrary darkness that was the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.860
 varying factor in the environment 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.420
 according to the cell type if we pass 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.270
 in mushrooms if you go to 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.470
 animals we will find the influence of 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.690
 environmental factors 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.520
 not necessarily light but others 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.290
 environmental factors for example the 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.510
 presence of certain gases or presence 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.610
 certain nutrients will influence 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.660
 again the chemical reactions 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.660
 in the cells
