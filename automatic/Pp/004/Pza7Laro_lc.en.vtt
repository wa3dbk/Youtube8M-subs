giant<00:02:14.370> cannons<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.300> needed<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.660> put<00:02:15.810> them

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
giant cannons I just needed to put them

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.800 
giant cannons I just needed to put them
on<00:02:16.140> because<00:02:16.319> violence<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.849> purpose<00:02:18.420> for

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
on because violence is the purpose for

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.040 
on because violence is the purpose for
all<00:02:18.840> sentient<00:02:19.530> beings<00:02:19.709> now<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.670> kidding

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
all sentient beings now I'm just kidding

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.759 
all sentient beings now I'm just kidding
I'm<00:02:22.050> being<00:02:22.319> weird

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
I'm being weird

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.030 
I'm being weird
and<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:25.080> guy's<00:02:25.260> backwards<00:02:25.680> actually<00:02:25.830> I

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and this guy's backwards actually I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.509 
and this guy's backwards actually I
wanted<00:02:26.370> him<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.550> be<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.239> little<00:02:28.110> bit<00:02:28.200> more

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
wanted him to be a little bit more

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.949 
wanted him to be a little bit more
different<00:02:29.519> from<00:02:29.819> him<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.239> he's<00:02:30.390> backwards

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
different from him so he's backwards

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.690 
different from him so he's backwards
kind<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.590> looks<00:02:31.739> these<00:02:32.190> are<00:02:32.370> supposed<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.640> be

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
kind of looks these are supposed to be

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.259 
kind of looks these are supposed to be
treads<00:02:33.030> by<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.360> way<00:02:34.280> imaginations<00:02:35.280> kind<00:02:36.180> of

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
treads by the way imaginations kind of

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.150 
treads by the way imaginations kind of
skewered<00:02:36.660> there<00:02:37.549> anyways<00:02:38.549> on<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
skewered there anyways on to the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.500 
skewered there anyways on to the
transformation<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.459> one<00:02:41.640> because<00:02:41.910> they<00:02:42.030> do

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
transformation of one because they do

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.300 
transformation of one because they do
exactly<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.170> same<00:02:43.200> type<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.680> transformation

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
exactly the same type of transformation

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.759 
exactly the same type of transformation
they<00:02:45.299> just<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.660> different<00:02:45.690> pieces<00:02:46.410> and

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
they just have different pieces and

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.370 
they just have different pieces and
different<00:02:47.130> their<00:02:47.940> concept<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> same<00:02:48.569> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
different their concept is the same the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.259 
different their concept is the same the
pieces<00:02:49.739> are<00:02:49.860> different<00:02:50.010> because<00:02:50.280> I'm<00:02:50.549> not

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
pieces are different because I'm not

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.509 
pieces are different because I'm not
really<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.750> much<00:02:51.959> as<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.250> these

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
really that much as you can see these

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.500 
really that much as you can see these
are<00:02:53.760> simple<00:02:54.150> Clippy<00:02:54.510> joints<00:02:54.870> Clippy<00:02:55.860> um

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
are simple Clippy joints Clippy um

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.410 
are simple Clippy joints Clippy um
simple<00:02:57.510> click<00:02:57.690> joints<00:02:58.880> yeah<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:00.239> a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
simple click joints yeah and that's a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.750 
simple click joints yeah and that's a
horizontal<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:01.709> joint<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.280> remember<00:03:02.730> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
horizontal like joint and remember a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.520 
horizontal like joint and remember a
stud<00:03:03.090> friction<00:03:03.599> right<00:03:04.079> here<00:03:05.750> if<00:03:06.750> you've<00:03:07.200> been

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
stud friction right here if you've been

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.229 
stud friction right here if you've been
following<00:03:07.709> or<00:03:08.160> not<00:03:08.370> I'll<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.970> reiterate

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
following or not I'll just reiterate

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.509 
following or not I'll just reiterate
stud<00:03:10.200> friction<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.739> it's<00:03:11.010> when<00:03:11.400> you

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
stud friction to you it's when you

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.229 
stud friction to you it's when you
sandwich

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
sandwich

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.500 
sandwich
studs<00:03:12.900> together<00:03:13.700> two<00:03:14.700> bricks<00:03:14.910> together<00:03:15.120> and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
studs together two bricks together and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.890 
studs together two bricks together and
once<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.290> will<00:03:16.500> combine<00:03:17.220> into<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.900> horizontal

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
once that will combine into a horizontal

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.210 
once that will combine into a horizontal
or<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.380> vertical<00:03:20.150> thud<00:03:21.150> friction<00:03:22.139> joint<00:03:22.590> and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
or a vertical thud friction joint and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.900 
or a vertical thud friction joint and
also<00:03:24.120> here<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.930> his<00:03:25.350> hips<00:03:25.620> these<00:03:26.519> things

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
also here on his hips these things

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.390 
also here on his hips these things
actually<00:03:27.389> move<00:03:27.750> up<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.859> that's<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.370> later

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
actually move up but that's for later

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.479 
actually move up but that's for later
and<00:03:30.410> for<00:03:31.410> now<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.680> looks<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.370> see

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
and for now it looks like that it's see

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.160 
and for now it looks like that it's see
it's<00:03:32.639> really<00:03:32.790> simple<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.450> hope<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:34.019> make

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
it's really simple I hope you can make

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.910 
it's really simple I hope you can make
that<00:03:34.350> -<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:35.060> mean<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:36.269> it's<00:03:37.109> simple<00:03:37.560> but

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
that - I mean it's it's simple but

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.120 
that - I mean it's it's simple but
effective<00:03:38.540> his<00:03:39.540> head<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:40.170> from<00:03:40.410> behind<00:03:40.709> and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
effective his head was from behind and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.110 
effective his head was from behind and
actually<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.239> need<00:03:42.359> to<00:03:42.510> spin<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.959> around<00:03:44.120> just

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
actually you need to spin it around just

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.569 
actually you need to spin it around just
to<00:03:45.299> make<00:03:45.450> him<00:03:45.569> taller<00:03:45.750> hey<00:03:46.049> my<00:03:46.980> guys<00:03:47.160> need<00:03:47.400> some

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
to make him taller hey my guys need some

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.610 
to make him taller hey my guys need some
style<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.660> make<00:03:48.810> him<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.139> longer<00:03:49.350> neck

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
style to just make him a longer neck

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.379 
style to just make him a longer neck
that's<00:03:49.799> not<00:03:50.010> his<00:03:50.160> head<00:03:50.340> that's<00:03:50.579> his<00:03:50.970> face<00:03:51.209> up

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
that's not his head that's his face up

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:58.160 
that's not his head that's his face up
there<00:03:51.569> and<00:03:52.370> he<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.549> done<00:03:53.910> some<00:03:56.780> balance<00:03:57.780> issues

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
there and he is done some balance issues

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.970 
there and he is done some balance issues
but<00:03:58.410> just<00:03:58.980> put<00:03:59.160> his<00:03:59.250> arms<00:03:59.549> out<00:03:59.700> so<00:04:00.120> he<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:01.769> works

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
but just put his arms out so he it works

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.030 
but just put his arms out so he it works
out<00:04:02.160> like<00:04:02.400> hey<00:04:02.790> dude<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.269> need<00:04:03.329> some<00:04:03.569> money

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
out like hey dude I need some money

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.830 
out like hey dude I need some money
pose<00:04:06.049> next<00:04:07.049> is<00:04:07.530> feedback<00:04:08.400> it's<00:04:09.329> just<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.630> same

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
pose next is feedback it's just the same

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.839 
pose next is feedback it's just the same
but<00:04:10.079> he's<00:04:10.169> just<00:04:10.799> backwards<00:04:11.130> in<00:04:11.430> vehicle<00:04:11.819> mode

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
but he's just backwards in vehicle mode

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.599 
but he's just backwards in vehicle mode
I<00:04:12.299> have<00:04:12.900> different<00:04:13.410> vehicle<00:04:13.889> modes<00:04:14.069> but<00:04:14.370> they

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
I have different vehicle modes but they

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.759 
I have different vehicle modes but they
just<00:04:14.760> don't<00:04:14.940> look<00:04:15.150> right<00:04:15.389> and<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.959> meant<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.739> to

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
just don't look right and I meant it to

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.240 
just don't look right and I meant it to
be<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.099> way<00:04:18.019> feedbacks<00:04:19.019> legs<00:04:19.409> are<00:04:19.680> going

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
be this way feedbacks legs are going

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.659 
be this way feedbacks legs are going
outside

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.330 

rotated<00:04:24.669> backwards<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.770> as<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.979> may<00:04:27.129> know

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
rotated backwards and as you may know

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.200 
rotated backwards and as you may know
he's<00:04:28.090> double-jointed<00:04:29.310> that's<00:04:30.310> because<00:04:30.819> he

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
he's double-jointed that's because he

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.409 
he's double-jointed that's because he
turns<00:04:31.389> around<00:04:32.310> yeah<00:04:33.310> that's<00:04:33.610> right<00:04:33.849> the

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
turns around yeah that's right the

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.040 
turns around yeah that's right the
concept<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.409> sideswipe<00:04:35.789> sunstreaker

universe mold is brought you by here as
well<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:41.710> don't<00:04:41.889> really<00:04:42.099> know<00:04:42.879> if<00:04:42.909> they're

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
well you don't really know if they're

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.390 
well you don't really know if they're
gonna<00:04:43.509> catch<00:04:43.750> on<00:04:43.990> but<00:04:44.229> it's<00:04:44.800> not<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:45.039> counter

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
gonna catch on but it's not a counter
