00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.839

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.970
 but good because this is going to 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.789
 facilitate a little bit what has been 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.450
 this not while they have not chosen a 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.600

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.260
 Wow nice 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.259
 God has achieved this in less than one 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.479
 minute so good I hope that 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.150
 share just kill two and go 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.040
 we build so goodbye and good now 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.509

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.759
 good as they saw earlier just was 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.560
 to complete the challenge and that already said 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.289
 wey completes this challenge that you try 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.509
 that you prove that it perez and good therefore this 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.390
 let's play a game well a 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.220
 game to see to win her with 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.750
 time not with time and resting a 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.179
 little but good at the end of accounts 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.470
 the massera system was to do that challenge and 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.179
 Well I'm going to ask you to go to your 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.700
 video that I'm going to leave here in the 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.020
 description to be told that what 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.899
 we complete not that we have completed your 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 challenge and that we are true pro and 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.670
 good now as I said then I'm going to 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.350
 play is this little game that 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.569
 I hope it works well for me not to leave 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.270
 so bad and who goes super exists as 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.890
 as we usually play or that is that 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.239
 that I think was good for me 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.009
 good things to begin with they touched me 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.120
 good things and what I 'm going to do is 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.370
 put that here 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.370
 and this and this 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.110
 and now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.799
 rich 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.629
 Realize reality 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.160
 God seriously 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.680
 It's really going to touch me 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.150
 in zero has three 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.370
 God, but I can take advantage of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 take that to start killing 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.060
 kill kill me 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.240
 of killing to pass a parameter he was killed 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.480
 behind 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.500
 god god or god god and I will be matrix in 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.960
 less than a minute and I think this 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.130
 it can also be palencia 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.130
 To remember 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.420
 etc 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.700
 raw material about god seriously what 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.370
 why why is this 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.750
 split the truth then this I believe 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.200
 which also counts as for charlene 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.850
 to believe is three and well let's 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.650
 try to win the game then I'm going to 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.060
 we did the challenger for second 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.450
 consecutive time then let's try 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.110
 the beyond there are no more left 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.110
 because I do not know where the platform 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:33.240
 and what I 'm going to do is put this here 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.810
 ok ok 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.810
 p 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.430
 It was 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:49.010
 I'm going forward I hope that nobody if you 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.620
 can you say I 'm going to answer them to 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.849
 no one is expertly going to the end 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.500
 It matters who wants to respond in these 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.959
 precise moments that we are recording and 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.760
 remember that people say they do not want 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.760
 know what is your personal life 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.019
 with how many allow the night I go 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.140
 believe me how many blacks do not care 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.140
 how many black andes today are black 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.970
 and I'm going to kill this 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.970
 10 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.440
 nothing left over from being killed 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.440
 and I think not 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.120
 one 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.750

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.660
 okay 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.320
 although I do not think 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.289
 dead dead 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.390

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.190
