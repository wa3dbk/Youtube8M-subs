 Oh, now it's the race to claim the whole table . 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.860
 Overall, the athletes are a little bit crying, 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.620
 It's a comparison. In that case, the Shin Dynasty waited a little while for the student temper . 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.989

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.629
 Control is the distance that beoleojyeo'm doing rather as the distance 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.069
 The resilience is important to the relationship I've seen up to 3 days 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.629
 Look. 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:38.230

 4 Park Soo-young tops the finish line 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.359
 It really was the last part of the business, it was just fierce

 This is not what it is now most of what I did not overlap . 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:11.139
 Despite the fact that the narrator is now in the back of the 211 business , 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.069
 I've been up for two weeks. 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:18.159

 It 's important to get out . 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.150
 The players wonak skill is rattling expensive if such should not deserved

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.879
 So here's the last drive 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:45.470
 Three souls of four players physically shed Japanese sake fell
