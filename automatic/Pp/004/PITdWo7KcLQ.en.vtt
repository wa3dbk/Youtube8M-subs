of<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:08.900> one<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:10.250> why<00:03:10.490> do<00:03:10.550> we<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:10.970> that

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
of this one and why do we do that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.230 
of this one and why do we do that
because<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:12.080> know<00:03:12.110> where<00:03:12.820> reserve<00:03:13.820> members

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
because you know where reserve members

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.640 
because you know where reserve members
and<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.630> paid<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.960> three<00:03:15.110> hundred<00:03:15.350> dollars

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
and we paid the three hundred dollars

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.960 
and we paid the three hundred dollars
and<00:03:15.770> really<00:03:15.950> like<00:03:16.040> damn<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.400> it's<00:03:16.850> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
and really like damn it it's a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.820 
and really like damn it it's a
15-percent<00:03:17.660> barrel<00:03:17.960> aged<00:03:18.080> beer<00:03:18.380> from<00:03:18.590> three

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
15-percent barrel aged beer from three

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.800 
15-percent barrel aged beer from three
Floyd<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.370> brewery<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:19.850> think<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.270> think

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
Floyd to the brewery and I think I think

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.750 
Floyd to the brewery and I think I think
that's<00:03:20.990> what<00:03:21.170> they<00:03:21.230> were<00:03:21.320> thinking<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.700> I

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
that's what they were thinking and I

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.340 
that's what they were thinking and I
can't<00:03:23.060> hold<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.330> against<00:03:23.810> them<00:03:23.989> because

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
can't hold that against them because

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.229 
can't hold that against them because
from<00:03:24.770> what<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:24.920> can<00:03:25.070> tell<00:03:25.130> it's<00:03:25.580> basically<00:03:25.910> all

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
from what I can tell it's basically all

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.090 
from what I can tell it's basically all
gone<00:03:26.540> from<00:03:27.020> you<00:03:27.200> can't<00:03:27.410> buy<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.620> anymore<00:03:27.860> it

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
gone from you can't buy it anymore it

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.250 
gone from you can't buy it anymore it
was<00:03:28.220> all<00:03:28.550> sold<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:29.120> think<00:03:29.600> they<00:03:29.690> probably<00:03:29.900> made

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
was all sold I think they probably made

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.420 
was all sold I think they probably made
a<00:03:30.320> lot<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.680> this<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:31.040> think<00:03:31.100> there<00:03:31.310> was<00:03:31.400> probably

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
a lot of this I think there was probably

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.370 
a lot of this I think there was probably
a<00:03:31.700> big<00:03:31.910> financial<00:03:32.180> investment<00:03:33.020> into<00:03:33.260> this

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
a big financial investment into this

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.290 
a big financial investment into this

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.900 
year and a bourbon barrel fruit and
everything<00:03:39.470> that's<00:03:39.560> that's<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:40.010> big<00:03:40.370> sell<00:03:40.730> it's

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
everything that's that's a big sell it's

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.030 
everything that's that's a big sell it's
an<00:03:41.000> expensive<00:03:41.330> endeavor<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.530> can't<00:03:42.920> imagine

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
an expensive endeavor so I can't imagine

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.590 
an expensive endeavor so I can't imagine
they<00:03:43.430> wanted<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.760> take<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.030> on<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.150> chin<00:03:44.239> too

they wanted to take it on the chin too

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.500 
they wanted to take it on the chin too
bad<00:03:44.780> they<00:03:44.989> probably<00:03:45.260> made<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.650> lot<00:03:45.770> of<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.190> one

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
bad they probably made a lot of this one

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.490 
bad they probably made a lot of this one
they<00:03:47.510> knew<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.840> was<00:03:47.900> going<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.170> sell<00:03:48.350> because

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
they knew it was going to sell because

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.900 
they knew it was going to sell because
