a days and cat is not a very

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.640 
a days and cat is not a very
sophisticated<00:00:11.179> cat<00:00:12.500> depending<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
sophisticated cat depending of the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.970 
sophisticated cat depending of the
vegetable<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.059> shape<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.990> cat<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.800> be

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
vegetable the shape of the cat can be

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.090 
vegetable the shape of the cat can be
either<00:00:17.190> square<00:00:17.820> triangle<00:00:18.810> Halfmoon<00:00:19.800> shaped

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
either square triangle Halfmoon shaped

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.019 
either square triangle Halfmoon shaped
circle<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.859> idea<00:00:23.310> really<00:00:23.699> is

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
circle and so on so the idea really is

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.630 
circle and so on so the idea really is
to<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.689> everything<00:00:25.289> small<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> two

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
to have everything small up to two

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820 
to have everything small up to two
millimeters<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> rectangle<00:00:28.470> or<00:00:28.619> for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
millimeters for the rectangle or for

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.150 
millimeters for the rectangle or for
long<00:00:29.070> shapes<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:30.869> could<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.140> square<00:00:31.650> up<00:00:31.859> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
long shapes and it could be square up to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.330 
long shapes and it could be square up to
a<00:00:32.189> centimeter<00:00:32.780> now<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.170> idea<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
a centimeter now the idea really is to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
a centimeter now the idea really is to
have<00:00:35.700> everything<00:00:36.239> feeding<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.250> tablespoon

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
have everything feeding a tablespoon

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.790 
have everything feeding a tablespoon
when<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.520> eat<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.879> soup<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.379> have

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
when you eat your soup so here I have

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.220 
when you eat your soup so here I have

going to stick together and it's going

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.930 
going to stick together and it's going
to<00:06:45.180> cut<00:06:45.330> into<00:06:45.450> many<00:06:45.810> small<00:06:46.170> pieces<00:06:46.700> the<00:06:47.700> pieces

such<00:07:16.590> as<00:07:16.830> potent<00:07:17.310> scripty<00:07:17.640> batter

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
such as potent scripty batter

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.710 
such as potent scripty batter
so<00:07:18.810> the<00:07:19.290> shape<00:07:19.620> of<00:07:19.830> the<00:07:20.010> pigeon<00:07:20.520> will<00:07:20.910> be<00:07:21.150> round

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
so the shape of the pigeon will be round

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.780 
so the shape of the pigeon will be round
because<00:07:22.500> of<00:07:22.560> the<00:07:22.800> shape<00:07:23.040> of<00:07:23.250> the<00:07:23.310> green<00:07:23.580> beans

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790 
because of the shape of the green beans

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.690 
because of the shape of the green beans
so<00:07:24.030> take<00:07:24.540> a<00:07:24.570> few<00:07:24.870> green<00:07:25.110> beans<00:07:25.380> maybe<00:07:25.680> a<00:07:25.800> couple
