00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
all right well Durant are very defensive

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.870 
all right well Durant are very defensive
Pokemon<00:06:13.529> not<00:06:14.460> very<00:06:14.669> good<00:06:14.819> at<00:06:14.940> attack<00:06:15.900> but<00:06:16.880> very

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
Pokemon not very good at attack but very

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.149 
Pokemon not very good at attack but very
defensive<00:06:18.389> and<00:06:18.539> I<00:06:20.659> mean<00:06:21.659> just<00:06:21.840> look<00:06:21.930> at<00:06:22.050> these

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
defensive and I mean just look at these

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.100 
defensive and I mean just look at these
pincers<00:06:23.159> that<00:06:23.849> looks<00:06:24.150> kind<00:06:24.389> of<00:06:24.449> scary<00:06:24.960> and

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
pincers that looks kind of scary and

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.360 
pincers that looks kind of scary and
look<00:06:25.229> like<00:06:25.380> it<00:06:25.560> could<00:06:25.680> be<00:06:25.770> going<00:06:25.949> an<00:06:26.099> attack

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
look like it could be going an attack

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.670 
look like it could be going an attack
but<00:06:27.349> not<00:06:28.349> according<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.949> that<00:06:29.159> move<00:06:30.150> damage

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
but not according to that move damage

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.700 
but not according to that move damage
right<00:06:31.680> here<00:06:32.539> see<00:06:33.539> the<00:06:33.690> highest<00:06:34.020> thing<00:06:34.590> you

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
right here see the highest thing you

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:41.439 
right here see the highest thing you
learn<00:06:34.949> is<00:06:35.099> like<00:06:35.219> 80<00:06:38.810> but<00:06:39.810> Durant<00:06:40.469> obviously

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
learn is like 80 but Durant obviously

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:50.839 
learn is like 80 but Durant obviously
leaves<00:06:42.449> so<00:06:44.419> there's<00:06:45.419> that<00:06:48.740> let's<00:06:49.740> see<00:06:49.979> alright

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:50.849 
leaves so there's that let's see alright

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.559 
leaves so there's that let's see alright
it<00:06:51.180> had<00:06:51.419> said<00:06:51.810> in<00:06:52.080> the<00:06:52.199> pokedex<00:06:52.710> entries<00:06:53.219> and

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 
it had said in the pokedex entries and

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.350 
it had said in the pokedex entries and
it<00:06:54.569> makes<00:06:54.870> sense<00:06:55.110> that<00:06:55.729> their<00:06:56.729> main<00:06:56.880> enemies

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
it makes sense that their main enemies

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.860 
it makes sense that their main enemies
hate<00:06:57.690> more

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
hate more

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.350 
hate more
I<00:06:59.930> can<00:07:00.470> get<00:07:00.680> that<00:07:00.860> because<00:07:01.130> I<00:07:01.160> hate<00:07:01.610> more<00:07:01.850> as<00:07:02.150> an

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
I can get that because I hate more as an

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.450 
I can get that because I hate more as an
anteater<00:07:02.780> and<00:07:02.930> they<00:07:03.680> are<00:07:03.830> ant<00:07:04.040> it's<00:07:04.310> almost
