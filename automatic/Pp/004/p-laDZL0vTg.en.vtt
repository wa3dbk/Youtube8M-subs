 since its introduction lada priora 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.200
 constantly improved appeared 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.869
 new options evolved technology 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.230
 however it's time for quality 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.230
 jump 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.510
 albeit in the framework of the same body 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 Meet the restyled priora with 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.630
 recognizable silhouette and brand new 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.630
 salon 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.510
 one of the most important issues that 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.460
 ask many buyers choosing 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.250
 car even on average price 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.589
 segment how plastic is trimmed 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.469
 interior so now in prior 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.409
 used innovative type material 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.080
 soft bow lovers expensive electronics 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.850
 he is familiar with the phone cases and other 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.920
 gadgets 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.020
 soft bow is plastic that looks like 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.380
 how soft automotive skin is good 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.929
 however, he has increased 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.880
 Scratch resistance specifically for 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.100
 new material was developed and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.440
 original drawing embossing taiga 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.110
 you yourself can see how much 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.590
 As a result, the car interior has changed 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.149
 and of course it's hard not to notice 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.720
 7-inch multimedia touchscreen 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.300
 systems 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.869
 here everything corresponds to the highest 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.030
 level in its class is not only yusb 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.539
 port but also wireless protocol 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.940
 bluetooth 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.069
 however, it should be noted that this option 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.649
 as the maintenance of the course 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.300
 Stability and additional side 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.910
 airbags 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.160
 and here new headlights with running lights and 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.770
 rear LED lights come in 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.619
 standard complete with new 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.860
 reinforced door bumpers 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.800
 and improved noise insulation sit down at 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.739
 steering wheel and adjust the driver's seat 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.650
 the seat got a more developed side 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.470
 support as well as new more reliable 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.930
 mechanism and adjustments to the right of 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.420
 the driver is located armrest 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.420
 special ergonomic shape 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.140
 Well, it's time to go to the dynamic 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.140
 dough 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.739
 we start the engine and get under way 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.409
 thanks to completely recycled 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.840
 the intake system of the moment shelf expanded into 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.299
 low speed side 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.790
 conditions provides sure 100 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.819
 suddenly sharp turns steering 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.189
 management of the matter is that on the deluxe version 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.730
 electromechanical amplifier installed 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.950
 and shortened steering rack with 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.530
 gear ratio 3 1 instead of four a 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.319
 pass the most difficult 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.459
 turns allows the course system 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.590
 sustainability 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.299
 Well, for those who speed 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.609
 prefers to maneuver 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.379
 measured and comfortable designed 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.780
 cruise control system 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.120
 enough with the steering column 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.459
 switch to set the required 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.219
 speed and you can take your foot off the pedal 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.669
 gas is an irreplaceable option in the distant 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:25.459
 trips still want to note that quite 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:28.010
 should soon appear and mechanical 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.709
 cable gearbox 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.449
 driven as well as relevant option 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.449
 as a preheater 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.120
 but AvtoVAZ engineer are not going to 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.459
 stop there 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.159
 some versions new lada priora 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.430
 will also get a robotic box 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:52.040
 gear changes agree that all 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.500
 these innovations significantly increase 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.280
 the pleasure of owning it 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.280
 by car
