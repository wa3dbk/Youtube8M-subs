specifically a shape called the wacky

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.410 
specifically a shape called the wacky
crawler<00:01:13.260> 5-inch<00:01:13.920> wacky<00:01:14.310> crawler<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.270> when

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
crawler 5-inch wacky crawler and when

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.440 
crawler 5-inch wacky crawler and when
you<00:01:15.509> take<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.869> gulp<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.560> pack<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
you take this gulp out of this pack and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.800 
you take this gulp out of this pack and
it<00:01:18.450> smells<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:18.930> good<00:01:19.259> let<00:01:19.439> me<00:01:19.500> tell<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> oh

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
it smells really good let me tell you oh

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
it smells really good let me tell you oh
it<00:01:21.810> smells<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.049> good<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.640> look<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.939> this

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it smells so good if you look at this

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.780 
it smells so good if you look at this
bait<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.409> what<00:01:25.619> makes<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.280> wet<00:01:26.460> noodle

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
bait this is what makes the wet noodle

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.630 
bait this is what makes the wet noodle
magic<00:01:27.479> look<00:01:28.409> at<00:01:28.530> gulp<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:29.490> at

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
magic look at gulp and if you look at

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.140 
magic look at gulp and if you look at
gulp<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.180> wet<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.650> flimsy<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.610> its

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
gulp it's wet and it's flimsy and its

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.870 
gulp it's wet and it's flimsy and its
really<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.900> soggy<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.619> shaky<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
really kind of soggy and shaky and the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.660 
really kind of soggy and shaky and the
reason<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> does<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:37.860> gulp<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
reason it does that is because gulp is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.179 
reason it does that is because gulp is
not<00:01:39.060> plastic<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> normal<00:01:40.619> plastic<00:01:40.829> bait

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
not plastic with a normal plastic bait

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.270 
not plastic with a normal plastic bait
it's<00:01:41.400> stiff<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.420> gulp<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.049> plastic<00:01:43.290> so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
it's stiff but gulp is not plastic so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880 
it's stiff but gulp is not plastic so
we're<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.030> gulp<00:01:45.390> worm<00:01:45.890> we're

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
we're going to get that gulp worm we're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.649 
we're going to get that gulp worm we're
going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> put<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.460> our<00:01:47.579> little<00:01:47.880> tiny<00:01:48.240> split

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
going to put it on our little tiny split

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.539
