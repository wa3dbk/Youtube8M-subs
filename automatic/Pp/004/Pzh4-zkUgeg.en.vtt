00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.280
 hi friends how are you today we are going to 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.289
 have a lot of fun knitting this point 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.310
 very beautiful that is called mountains and 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:21.630
 valleys look how nice this is very easy 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.109
 it's only four laps and they have 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 to mount multiples of nine points 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.270
 and add four points at the end the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.120
 first round is very simple 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.570
 we're just going to knit all the stitches 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.570
 Reverse 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.770
 return number 2 here 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.320
 Let's start by knitting 3 points 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.320
 right to start the round 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:04.080
 and here we start the reason to repeat 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.380
 the sequence of points a loop 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.750
 a right 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.090
 two rights we passed a point we weave a 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.799
 right and we return the one that we passed without 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.310
 knitting knit two points together 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.310
 straight 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.479
 we weave again two rights 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.710
 a loop 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:38.760
 and a right and we repeat everything 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.760
 from the lazada then a loop 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.090
 all rights 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.680
 we return the point that we passed without 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.090
 to knit 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.090
 we knit 2 stitches points of right 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.630
 two rights 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.850
 a loop 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.390
 a right and the last point that we 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.670
 We'll knit it right 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.100
 turn number 3 again one turn 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.100
 very simple simply all of reverse 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.319
 ready 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.090
 return number 4 and last return 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.150
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.989
 start weaving two rights to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.989
 start the round 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.860
 and now if we start the sequence of 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.080
 points to repeat a loop 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.100
 1 and 2 rights 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.200
 we passed a point without weaving we weave a 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.040
 right and we passed the one that we do not weave 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.840
 over the right after we left two 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.840
 points together of right 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:15.230
 again two rights and two a loop 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:19.930
 and a right and we repeat loop we weave 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:24.340
 one and we weave two rights 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:28.520
 we slide a point we weave the one that follows 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:33.670
 we passed the one we did not weave and then 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.670
 we knit two stitches together from right 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.940
 we weave one and we weave two rights 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.420
 a loop we weave a right and these 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.250
 two that we have left over 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.630
 straight 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.600
 and that was it, we finished our point 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.090
 well how nice 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.330
 in fact it has texture rises very 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.860
 beautiful the mountains, I hope that 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.190
 have had a good time today 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.170
 take care, thank you very much for accompanying me and 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.170
 see you here very soon goodbye
