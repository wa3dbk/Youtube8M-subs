00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
cycle of burning through the wood we're

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.880 
cycle of burning through the wood we're
down<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.520> got<00:00:17.670> some<00:00:17.910> calls<00:00:18.240> there<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.439> I'm

down to we got some calls there so I'm
getting<00:00:20.160> ready<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.580> load<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.060> stove<00:00:21.680> what

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
getting ready to load this stove what

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.429 
getting ready to load this stove what
you<00:00:22.859> want<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> be<00:00:23.310> aware<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.640> our<00:00:24.119> grates<00:00:25.019> come

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
you want to be aware of our grates come

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.720 
you want to be aware of our grates come
in<00:00:25.590> two<00:00:25.920> pieces<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.930> they<00:00:27.930> don't<00:00:28.199> run<00:00:28.730> totally

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
in two pieces and they don't run totally

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.440 
in two pieces and they don't run totally
from<00:00:30.060> front<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.510> back<00:00:31.550> that's<00:00:32.550> designed<00:00:33.180> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
from front to back that's designed that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.139 
from front to back that's designed that
way<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.200> even<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> lot<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.910> ash

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
way so that even if you get a lot of ash

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.810 
way so that even if you get a lot of ash
built<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:38.070> airflow<00:00:38.340> up

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
built up in here you get some airflow up

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.959 
built up in here you get some airflow up
through<00:00:39.149> those<00:00:39.360> grates<00:00:39.860> but<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> maintaining

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
through those grates but in maintaining

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.440 
through those grates but in maintaining
the<00:00:42.360> grates<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> firebox<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.810 
the grates and the firebox I I want to
move<00:00:45.660> these<00:00:45.930> grates<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.620> opening<00:00:47.340> back<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
move these grates that opening back and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479 
move these grates that opening back and
forth<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.780> rarely<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.500> keep<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.980> opening

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
it through a complete cycle but you can

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.790 
it through a complete cycle but you can
take<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.239> tool<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.310> put<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.880> between

those calls are getting getting pretty
good<00:02:48.799> in<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.010> induction<00:02:49.370> fans<00:02:49.820> only<00:02:50.090> been<00:02:50.360> on

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
good in that induction fans only been on

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.720 
good in that induction fans only been on
for<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:52.250> very<00:02:52.519> short<00:02:52.610> period<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.360> time<00:02:53.420> so

that's<00:02:55.730> just<00:02:55.910> some<00:02:56.120> general<00:02:56.980> here's<00:02:57.980> how<00:02:58.160> you

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
that's just some general here's how you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.840 
that's just some general here's how you
operate<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:59.090> unit<00:02:59.540> I<00:03:00.430> keep<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.580> little

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
operate this unit I keep a little

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.280 
operate this unit I keep a little
airspace<00:03:02.620> usually<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.730> middle<00:03:05.290> between

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
airspace usually in the middle between

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.930 
airspace usually in the middle between
the<00:03:06.769> two<00:03:06.799> grates<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:08.799> burn<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.829> lot<00:03:10.100> of<00:03:10.250> ash<00:03:10.519> and

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the two grates I burn a lot of ash and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.830 
the two grates I burn a lot of ash and
ash<00:03:11.780> wood<00:03:12.200> by<00:03:13.190> its<00:03:13.370> name<00:03:13.640> turns<00:03:14.030> into<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.450> lot<00:03:14.690> of

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
ash wood by its name turns into a lot of

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.569 
ash wood by its name turns into a lot of
ash<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.140> get<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> lot<00:03:15.500> more<00:03:15.530> ash<00:03:15.920> than<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.430> do

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
ash you get a lot more ash than you do

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.500 
ash you get a lot more ash than you do
coals<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:18.170> ash<00:03:18.440> can<00:03:19.220> tend<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.760> clog<00:03:20.239> up

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
coals and the ash can tend to clog up

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.780 
coals and the ash can tend to clog up
the<00:03:20.540> grates<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.739> depending<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.250> what<00:03:22.400> kind<00:03:22.459> of

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the grates so depending on what kind of

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.990 
the grates so depending on what kind of
wood<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.420> need<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.890> look<00:03:25.190> at<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.910> and

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
wood you need to to look at it and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.030 
wood you need to to look at it and
analyze<00:03:26.239> what<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.049> need<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.380> do<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:27.799> as<00:03:27.920> you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
analyze what you need to do but as you

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.630 
analyze what you need to do but as you
can<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.370> got<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.640> lot<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:29.209> lot<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.780> coals

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
can see I got a lot a lot of coals

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.800 
can see I got a lot a lot of coals
picking<00:03:31.640> back<00:03:31.790> up<00:03:31.850> they're<00:03:32.269> going<00:03:32.510> pretty

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
picking back up they're going pretty

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.979 
picking back up they're going pretty
good<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:34.360> now<00:03:35.360> I'm<00:03:35.480> going<00:03:35.570> to<00:03:35.630> show<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:35.870> a

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
good so now I'm going to show you a

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.020 
good so now I'm going to show you a
technique<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.620> use<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:38.060> load<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.690> stove<00:03:39.380> I<00:03:40.030> like

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
technique I use to load the stove I like

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.750 
technique I use to load the stove I like
to<00:03:41.180> put<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.750> couple<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.590> pieces<00:03:42.860> about<00:03:43.519> like

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
to put a couple of pieces about like

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
to put a couple of pieces about like
this<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.980> do<00:03:46.040> am<00:03:46.310> at<00:03:46.459> an<00:03:46.610> angle

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.500 

then<00:03:50.819> when<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.450> come<00:03:51.810> back<00:03:52.020> in<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:53.480> load<00:03:54.480> my

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
then when I come back in and load my

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.619 
then when I come back in and load my
other<00:03:54.930> would<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.709> can<00:03:56.610> put<00:03:56.790> my<00:03:56.940> other<00:03:57.120> wood<00:03:57.450> on

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
other would I can put my other wood on

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:10.100 
other would I can put my other wood on
top<00:03:57.660> on<00:03:58.200> that<00:04:06.920> get<00:04:07.920> my<00:04:08.130> other<00:04:08.310> would<00:04:08.930> paint<00:04:09.930> on

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
top on that get my other would paint on

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.309 
top on that get my other would paint on
the<00:04:10.290> top<00:04:10.590> there<00:04:11.010> hopefully<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:11.640> can<00:04:12.110> you<00:04:13.110> can

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
the top there hopefully you can you can

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:21.050 
the top there hopefully you can you can
see<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:16.220> but<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.459> gives<00:04:17.700> me<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:19.700> little<00:04:20.700> air

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
see that but that gives me a little air

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.430 
see that but that gives me a little air
space<00:04:21.540> here<00:04:22.460> between<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:24.540> bottom<00:04:24.930> wood<00:04:25.139> and

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
space here between the bottom wood and

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.980 
space here between the bottom wood and
the<00:04:26.070> top<00:04:26.280> wood<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.729> as<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:26.970> can<00:04:27.150> see<00:04:27.419> already

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
the top wood and as you can see already

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.690 
the top wood and as you can see already
I<00:04:28.830> got<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> flame<00:04:30.530> kickin<00:04:31.530> up<00:04:31.680> here<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:34.700> that's

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
I got a flame kickin up here and that's

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.150 
I got a flame kickin up here and that's
going<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.060> help<00:04:36.360> keep<00:04:36.780> all<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:38.479> ash<00:04:40.160> from

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
going to help keep all the ash from

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.580 
going to help keep all the ash from
blocking<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.850> grates<00:04:42.180> up<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:43.350> going<00:04:43.530> to

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
blocking the grates up and it's going to

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.950 
blocking the grates up and it's going to
keep<00:04:43.889> some<00:04:44.160> airspace<00:04:44.729> so<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.240> my<00:04:45.419> wood<00:04:45.750> up

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
keep some airspace so that my wood up

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.360 
keep some airspace so that my wood up
above<00:04:46.320> here<00:04:46.800> can<00:04:47.460> get<00:04:47.669> going<00:04:48.090> good<00:04:49.070> once<00:04:50.070> I

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
above here can get going good once I

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.020 
above here can get going good once I
have<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.300> wood<00:04:51.540> going<00:04:52.370> it's<00:04:53.370> not<00:04:53.639> going<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.880> be

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
have the wood going it's not going to be

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.560 
have the wood going it's not going to be
an<00:04:54.150> issue<00:04:54.330> keeping<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.110> going<00:04:56.060> but<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.180> key<00:04:57.389> is

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
an issue keeping it going but the key is

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.110 
an issue keeping it going but the key is
a<00:04:57.600> lot<00:04:57.840> of<00:04:57.960> people<00:04:58.260> load<00:04:58.530> would<00:04:58.860> they<00:04:59.580> throw<00:04:59.880> it

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
a lot of people load would they throw it

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.650 
a lot of people load would they throw it
all<00:05:00.270> in<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.630> bottom<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.200> they<00:05:01.800> block<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:03.150> air

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
all in the bottom and they block the air

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.940 
all in the bottom and they block the air
passage<00:05:04.500> from<00:05:05.010> getting<00:05:05.370> through<00:05:06.229> if<00:05:07.229> you<00:05:07.710> use

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
passage from getting through if you use

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.300 
passage from getting through if you use
a<00:05:07.979> little<00:05:08.370> bit<00:05:08.639> of<00:05:08.700> this<00:05:08.940> technique<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:10.800> can

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
a little bit of this technique it can

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.900 
a little bit of this technique it can
help<00:05:11.729> you<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.120> want<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.389> analyze<00:05:13.910> what's

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
help you you want to analyze what's

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.690 
help you you want to analyze what's
going<00:05:15.300> on<00:05:15.479> with<00:05:15.750> your<00:05:15.900> stove<00:05:16.289> as<00:05:16.590> as<00:05:17.250> you<00:05:17.550> get

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
going on with your stove as as you get

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.879 
going on with your stove as as you get
more<00:05:17.910> familiar<00:05:18.240> with<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:18.870> you'll<00:05:19.320> find<00:05:19.650> what

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
more familiar with it you'll find what

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.640 
more familiar with it you'll find what
works<00:05:20.130> for<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.610> but<00:05:21.169> a<00:05:22.490> lot<00:05:23.490> of<00:05:23.520> times<00:05:23.850> people

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
works for you but a lot of times people

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.460 
works for you but a lot of times people
don't<00:05:26.090> understand<00:05:27.090> what<00:05:27.750> they're<00:05:27.960> doing<00:05:28.289> when

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
don't understand what they're doing when

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.760 
don't understand what they're doing when
they<00:05:28.620> just<00:05:28.919> throw<00:05:29.700> a<00:05:29.729> bunch<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.210> wood<00:05:30.419> in<00:05:30.770> and

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
they just throw a bunch of wood in and

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.730 
they just throw a bunch of wood in and
force<00:05:32.340> all<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.820> stuff<00:05:33.090> down<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:34.320> cover

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
force all the stuff down to to cover

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.089 
force all the stuff down to to cover
