00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.820
 Today we show you a game and that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.490
 is the name of the first fruit garden and that is 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.379
 by haber and that is already from two 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.960
 years that's handy with it 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.900
 learn colors and shapes a bit 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.180
 can and that is for one to four 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.310
 player thought i'll show you now 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.840
 once everything is part of the game 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 and then we play a round 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.329
 we have four different fruit trees there 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.200
 once we have red apples green apples 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:43.430
 yellow pear and blue flame respectively 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.210
 four pieces then we have a radl 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.210

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.600
 the fruit head for picking and doing 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.020
 we have the paths because of the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.289
 Of course, rabe wants to be high in the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.879
 orchard and get the fruit and use 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.549
 Of course we want to prevent that 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.470
