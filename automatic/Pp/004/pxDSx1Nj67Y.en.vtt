00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.100 
consistent over the years even from
their<00:01:55.310> first<00:01:55.550> EP<00:01:55.700> which<00:01:56.450> they<00:01:56.630> released<00:01:56.960> I

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
their first EP which they released I

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.240 
their first EP which they released I
think<00:01:57.140> in<00:01:57.350> like<00:01:57.500> high<00:01:57.650> school<00:01:57.950> when<00:01:58.100> they<00:01:58.190> were

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
think in like high school when they were

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.610 
think in like high school when they were
like<00:01:58.400> 16<00:01:58.760> or<00:01:58.880> 17<00:01:59.330> all<00:01:59.570> the<00:02:00.020> way<00:02:00.110> up<00:02:00.229> until<00:02:00.350> their

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
like 16 or 17 all the way up until their

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.990 
like 16 or 17 all the way up until their
major<00:02:00.800> label<00:02:00.920> signing<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:01.670> after<00:02:01.880> that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
major label signing and after that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.550 
major label signing and after that
they've<00:02:02.299> just<00:02:02.479> remained<00:02:02.810> really<00:02:03.170> really

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
they've just remained really really

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.960 
they've just remained really really
solid<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:04.040> might<00:02:04.190> be<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> tiny<00:02:04.460> bit<00:02:04.580> biased

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
solid I might be a tiny bit biased

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.520 
solid I might be a tiny bit biased
