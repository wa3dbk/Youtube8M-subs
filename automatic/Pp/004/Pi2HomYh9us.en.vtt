Polly's<00:04:57.630> offense<00:04:57.960> looked<00:04:58.199> like<00:04:58.350> ran<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.889> lot<00:04:59.100> of

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
Polly's offense looked like ran a lot of

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.010 
Polly's offense looked like ran a lot of
clock<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.729> didn't<00:05:00.210> end<00:05:00.330> up<00:05:00.419> scoring<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.810> lot<00:05:00.930> in

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
clock and didn't end up scoring a lot in

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.600 
clock and didn't end up scoring a lot in
the<00:05:01.080> fourth<00:05:01.289> no<00:05:01.680> their<00:05:01.889> shortening<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.430> game

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
the fourth no their shortening the game

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.070 
the fourth no their shortening the game
and<00:05:02.850> it<00:05:03.000> certainly<00:05:03.300> seems<00:05:03.630> like<00:05:03.720> your<00:05:03.930> good

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
and it certainly seems like your good

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.540 
and it certainly seems like your good
approach<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.590> think<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.860> problem<00:05:05.250> was<00:05:05.400> they

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
approach I think the problem was they

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.340 
approach I think the problem was they
were<00:05:05.639> scoring<00:05:06.000> so<00:05:06.180> quickly<00:05:06.630> previously<00:05:07.260> it

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
were scoring so quickly previously it

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.540 
were scoring so quickly previously it
kind<00:05:07.590> of<00:05:07.650> seemed<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:07.919> take<00:05:08.130> him<00:05:08.250> out<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.430> rhythm

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
kind of seemed to take him out of rhythm

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.980 
kind of seemed to take him out of rhythm
and<00:05:08.789> so<00:05:09.000> they<00:05:09.120> were<00:05:09.210> getting<00:05:09.449> good<00:05:09.600> looks<00:05:09.630> like

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
and so they were getting good looks like

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.600 
and so they were getting good looks like
this<00:05:10.199> but<00:05:10.680> they<00:05:10.800> weren't<00:05:10.979> able<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.370> put<00:05:11.520> him

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
this but they weren't able to put him

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.890 
this but they weren't able to put him
down<00:05:11.760> than<00:05:11.970> where<00:05:12.090> they<00:05:12.180> were<00:05:12.210> earlier<00:05:12.660> in<00:05:12.720> the
