00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
you know I just had someone asking the

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
stood that isn't the same as cooking

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.730 
stood that isn't the same as cooking
it's<00:00:12.850> not<00:00:13.090> it's<00:00:13.540> different<00:00:13.990> but<00:00:14.680> it's

it's not it's different but it's

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.589 
it's not it's different but it's
definitely<00:00:15.129> it's<00:00:16.090> a<00:00:16.240> process<00:00:17.490> no<00:00:18.490> I<00:00:18.520> mean<00:00:18.849> let

definitely it's a process no I mean let
me<00:00:19.660> make<00:00:19.810> people<00:00:20.380> say<00:00:20.470> that's<00:00:20.619> not<00:00:20.860> producing

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
me make people say that's not producing

me make people say that's not producing
is<00:00:21.490> not<00:00:21.640> processing<00:00:22.270> food<00:00:22.509> but<00:00:23.290> blends<00:00:23.739> no<00:00:23.890> yes

it<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.689> here's<00:00:25.689> what<00:00:25.900> unprocessed<00:00:26.590> food<00:00:26.770> looks

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
it is here's what unprocessed food looks

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.580 
it is here's what unprocessed food looks
like<00:00:27.189> it<00:00:27.520> looks<00:00:27.820> like<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.119> whole<00:00:28.480> banana<00:00:28.720> or<00:00:29.200> a

whole orange or a whole lot that's
unprocessed<00:00:32.680> food<00:00:32.860> that's<00:00:33.070> what<00:00:33.340> optimal

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
unprocessed food that's what optimal

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.150 
unprocessed food that's what optimal
food<00:00:34.120> is<00:00:34.270> that's<00:00:34.540> we're<00:00:34.690> designing<00:00:35.070> when<00:00:36.070> we

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
food is that's we're designing when we

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.760 
food is that's we're designing when we
do<00:00:36.280> anything<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:37.180> we're<00:00:38.110> changing<00:00:38.620> it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
do anything to it we're changing it

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.919 
do anything to it we're changing it
various<00:00:39.130> ways<00:00:39.309> when<00:00:39.789> we<00:00:39.820> freeze<00:00:40.329> something

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
various ways when we freeze something

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.250 
various ways when we freeze something
what<00:00:41.289> happens<00:00:41.710> is<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:43.030> freeze<00:00:43.269> it<00:00:43.300> fruit<00:00:43.719> now

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
what happens is we freeze it fruit now

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.169 
what happens is we freeze it fruit now
bananas<00:00:44.739> are<00:00:44.859> less<00:00:45.160> effective<00:00:45.789> but<00:00:46.000> they're

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
bananas are less effective but they're

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.540 
bananas are less effective but they're
still<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.390> factor<00:00:46.780> have<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:47.739> ever<00:00:47.859> frozen<00:00:48.489> a

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
still a factor have you ever frozen a

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.779 
still a factor have you ever frozen a
banana<00:00:48.879> and<00:00:49.120> then<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.649> fall<00:00:51.010> out<00:00:51.039> not<00:00:51.460> not

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
banana and then have it fall out not not

banana and then have it fall out not not
running<00:00:52.089> for<00:00:52.179> the<00:00:52.269> machine<00:00:52.539> first<00:00:52.780> we'll<00:00:52.960> just

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
running for the machine first we'll just

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.259 
running for the machine first we'll just
have<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.260> file<00:00:53.530> on<00:00:53.769> counter<00:00:54.129> did<00:00:54.789> you<00:00:54.969> want<00:00:55.179> to

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
have a file on counter did you want to

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.010 
have a file on counter did you want to
eat

why<00:00:57.620> not<00:00:59.350> it's<00:01:00.350> all<00:01:00.530> slimy<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.130> soggy<00:01:01.700> and

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
why not it's all slimy and soggy and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.810 
why not it's all slimy and soggy and
gross<00:01:02.150> and<00:01:02.510> limp<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.590> yucky<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.520> you<00:01:04.670> know

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
gross and limp and yucky and you know

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.050 
gross and limp and yucky and you know
why<00:01:05.000> because<00:01:05.840> moving<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.890> banana<00:01:07.280> which<00:01:07.910> is

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
why because moving a banana which is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.030 
why because moving a banana which is
pretty<00:01:08.330> low<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.780> water<00:01:08.990> content<00:01:09.290> for<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.770> fresh

pretty low in water content for a fresh
fruit<00:01:10.340> it's<00:01:11.300> high<00:01:11.720> compared<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.470> say<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.740> 20<00:01:13.220> or

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
fruit it's high compared to say a 20 or

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.850 
fruit it's high compared to say a 20 or
a<00:01:13.730> white<00:01:13.910> bread<00:01:14.150> but<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:14.960> low<00:01:15.260> compared<00:01:15.830> to

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
a white bread but it's low compared to

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.100 
a white bread but it's low compared to
most<00:01:16.070> fresh<00:01:16.280> fruit<00:01:16.550> even<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.450> banana<00:01:17.570> stomach

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
most fresh fruit even a banana stomach

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.140 
most fresh fruit even a banana stomach
mattresses<00:01:18.530> water<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.520> when<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.730> freeze

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
mattresses water and when you freeze

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.710 
mattresses water and when you freeze
water<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:21.110> form<00:01:21.380> ice<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.920> ice<00:01:22.820> when<00:01:23.600> you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
water you form ice and ice when you

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.560 
water you form ice and ice when you
freeze<00:01:23.930> water<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.320> expands<00:01:24.940> okay<00:01:25.940> you<00:01:26.480> know

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
freeze water it expands okay you know

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.000 
freeze water it expands okay you know
how<00:01:26.660> you<00:01:26.720> print<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.410> pipes<00:01:27.620> in<00:01:27.770> your<00:01:27.800> house

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
how you print it the pipes in your house

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.310 
how you print it the pipes in your house
can<00:01:28.280> break<00:01:28.580> when<00:01:29.240> they<00:01:29.330> freeze<00:01:29.600> that's

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
can break when they freeze that's

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.969 
can break when they freeze that's
because<00:01:30.560> ice<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:32.060> expands<00:01:32.690> ices<00:01:33.050> it<00:01:33.410> takes

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
because ice is it expands ices it takes

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.340 
because ice is it expands ices it takes
up<00:01:34.130> more<00:01:34.310> volume<00:01:34.370> than<00:01:34.940> water<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:35.510> when<00:01:36.260> you

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
up more volume than water so when you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.219 
up more volume than water so when you
freeze<00:01:36.800> fruit<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:38.090> form<00:01:38.360> ice<00:01:38.600> crystals<00:01:38.630> which

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
freeze fruit you form ice crystals which

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.340 
freeze fruit you form ice crystals which
expand<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.250> they<00:01:40.670> burst<00:01:41.030> cell<00:01:41.570> membranes<00:01:42.170> of

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
expand and they burst cell membranes of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.710 
expand and they burst cell membranes of
the<00:01:42.440> cells<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.070> then<00:01:43.910> when<00:01:44.030> that<00:01:44.150> food<00:01:44.390> thaws

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
the cells and then when that food thaws

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.969 
the cells and then when that food thaws
out<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.920> oxidize<00:01:46.340> most<00:01:46.820> nutrients<00:01:47.979> they're

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
out you oxidize most nutrients they're

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.859 
out you oxidize most nutrients they're
no<00:01:49.130> longer<00:01:49.400> protected<00:01:49.880> inside<00:01:50.090> their<00:01:50.479> perfect

no longer protected inside their perfect
little<00:01:50.990> cells<00:01:52.000> can<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.090> first<00:01:53.390> all<00:01:53.540> cell

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
little cells can you first all cell

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.359 
little cells can you first all cell
membranes<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.860> now<00:01:54.979> have<00:01:55.130> something

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
membranes and you now have something

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.390 
membranes and you now have something
that<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.820> far<00:01:56.180> less<00:01:56.930> optimal<00:01:57.470> than<00:01:58.010> a<00:01:58.040> fresh

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
that is far less optimal than a fresh

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.060 
that is far less optimal than a fresh
fresh<00:01:59.270> piece<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.510> fruit<00:01:59.810> there's<00:02:00.380> also<00:02:00.560> some

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
fresh piece of fruit there's also some

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.529 
fresh piece of fruit there's also some
damn<00:02:02.770> sure<00:02:03.770> there<00:02:04.670> may<00:02:04.820> be<00:02:04.850> some<00:02:05.119> damn<00:02:05.300> dinner

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
damn sure there may be some damn dinner

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.460 
damn sure there may be some damn dinner

every week when I don't eat very much of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.090 
every week when I don't eat very much of
it<00:02:22.850> throwing<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.300> throwing<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.660> away<00:02:23.750> later

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
ice cream with blackberries of bananas

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.029 
ice cream with blackberries of bananas
mixed<00:04:24.060> together<00:04:24.180> or<00:04:24.780> an<00:04:25.020> occasional<00:04:25.590> smoothie

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
mixed together or an occasional smoothie

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.040 
mixed together or an occasional smoothie
with<00:04:26.190> some<00:04:26.370> frozen<00:04:26.639> blackberries<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.930> I

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
with some frozen blackberries but I

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.450 
with some frozen blackberries but I
wouldn't<00:04:28.380> make<00:04:28.560> them<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.830> staple<00:04:29.220> foods

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
wouldn't make them a staple foods

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.890 
wouldn't make them a staple foods
because<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:29.940> fact<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.389> they've<00:04:30.660> been

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
because the fact that they've been

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.600 
because the fact that they've been
frozen<00:04:31.169> means<00:04:31.620> they<00:04:31.800> are<00:04:31.949> far<00:04:32.310> less

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
frozen means they are far less

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.950 
frozen means they are far less
nutritious<00:04:33.300> than<00:04:34.020> pulses<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:34.889> I<00:04:35.960> found

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
nutritious than pulses and so I found

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.469 
nutritious than pulses and so I found
I've<00:04:37.500> been<00:04:37.770> I've<00:04:38.010> spoken<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.520> London<00:04:38.849> many

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
times probably seven or eight times I

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.210 
times probably seven or eight times I
find<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.990> I'd<00:04:43.110> seen<00:04:43.320> it's<00:04:43.560> full<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.889> biggest

cities in the world you can get pretty
much<00:04:45.720> anything<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.349> it's<00:04:46.470> not<00:04:46.650> too<00:04:46.860> bad<00:04:47.039> the
