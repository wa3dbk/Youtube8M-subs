 telefonino.net we are here in paris 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.660
 huawei press conference was 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.049
 finally presented the new ascend 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.240
 pizzette evolution of the choice you have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.300
 presented in London last year 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.970
 dimensions and design that they are 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 practically very similar leaving p7 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.199
 slightly higher because the display 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.449
 it gets a little bigger we talk about a 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.800
 5 inches diagonal a full hd 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.760
 really very nice 445 ppa is of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.730
 defining a viewing angle that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.270
 at least here in this first contact there 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.489
 it seems really very very large we go 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.950
 a little see also what are the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.320
 new user interface we have 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.190
 an android version operating system 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.070
 obviously the 4.4.2 kat kit 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.289
 the user interface which is the emotion 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.579
 the white 2.3 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.940
 regarding the processor 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.100
 we have a rais the quad comet 910 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.590
 1.8 gigahertz core we have the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.710
 support for networks up to 2 gigabytes of 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 ram memory and we have 16GB of memory 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.189
 integrated that we can go to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.860
 expand through the sim slot that 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.119
 is located at which on the right side on the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.979
 part now we also have the slot for 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.659
 the sim the power button e 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.070
 shutdown that has become circular 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.990
 keys for adjusting the volume 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.479
 on the top we have the jack 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.189
 3.5 mm audio and the second microphone 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.770
 for the suppression system of 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.750
 Very clean ambient noise on the side 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.610
 left on the lower side instead 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.700
 present the connector for micro usb 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.530
 on the back side which is made in 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.450
 glass the difference of pisa that was 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.680
 made entirely of metal then 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.300
 we have gorilla glass 3 sia 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.130
 at the front than at the rear 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.380
 we have a camera from ben 13 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.820
 megapixel oh my God thirteen mega pizza 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.920
 there are also those who have done better though 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.200
 surely it is a great camera with 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.820
 flash LED while it is 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.450
 important is the camera placed on the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.979
 front that 8 megapixel with 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.420
 a wide angle among others also with a 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.720
 very interesting feature that is 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.130
 state of which was spoken at the time of 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.070
 presentation which is to carry out 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.400
 of the self the views we see a little 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.100
 the user interface then emotion trouble 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.989
 2.3 therefore absence of drugs all 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.060
 applications that are already present 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.190
 directly here on the various home screens 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.220
 that we can go to customize 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.200
 we can go to choose the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.630
 default are obviously i 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.790
 there are at least themes from what I have 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.430
 seen really so many it does not seem that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.800
 it is possible to go online at least this way 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.450
 it seems we will see if then in the when 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.640
 will come on the market will also be presenting 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.260
 this functionality we see on the fly 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.030
 also how the browser behaves 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.190
 we are under wifi coverage but unfortunately 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.890
 so a lot of people arrived here 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.080
 it will be really very difficult 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.709
 surf safely anyway a 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.269
 web browser that seems to me all in all 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.739
 quite fast of course we will have to 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.320
 go to approve a little more 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.480
 but I announce that we will be able to carry out 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.580
 a really in-depth video preview 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.290
 very early notifications 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.030
 another novelty completely 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.709
 customizable possibility to go to 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.660
 adjust the brightness to go to 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.630
 choose all the buttons for remove 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.360
 the quick stop button that gives us the 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.549
 possibility of positioning on the display 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.260
 this key through which we can 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.239
 going to close all the programs that 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.130
 are currently present in memory 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.890
 we can go to block the display 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.450
 we can activate some mini ups 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.150
 of the floating illuminated we can 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.879
 and freely position on the display 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.599
 I don't know how many we can do 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.129
 out anyway yes no maybe more marquee 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.099
 another one comes out so do not 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.610
 they are all applications we can 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.319
 keep me open at the same time 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.599
 seems to have said a little we all have 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.030
 I remind you from the point of view of 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.250
 size and just a few last 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.090
 in fact not as far as the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.769
 we'll talk more about it 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.780
 in depth subsequently vi 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.640
 I only talk about connectivity will be 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.349
 therefore supported the lte surely 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.760
 very important and they told us between 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.769
 the other one, however, will not be available 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.260
 certainly in Italy also a version 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.560
 dual sim with the second sim you can 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.109
 insert in the same housing as the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.060
 micro sim of the micro sd then a 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.330
 micro sd which can serve a dual purpose 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.380
 function left 7 will arrive on the market 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.110
 around June in the first months on the 2nd of 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.139
 June precisely 4 June for 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.990
 sorry I'm talking about a price of 449 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.270
 euro but it is rumored that in Italy 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.770
 could also come to a little bit in 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.870
 less we'll see 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.120
 for the moment everything is from paris a 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.240
 salute or for telefonino.net antonio 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.240
