really wants to play de stereo I'm the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.800 
really wants to play de stereo I'm the
only<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.790> wants<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.150> play<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.509> even

only one that wants to play it even

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.700 
only one that wants to play it even
though<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.140> there<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> lot<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
though I think there will be a lot of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.490 
though I think there will be a lot of
fun<00:01:17.009> my<00:01:17.580> friends<00:01:17.970> don't<00:01:18.119> want<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> play<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
fun my friends don't want to play so I

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.910 
fun my friends don't want to play so I
guess<00:01:20.280> that's<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:20.640> an<00:01:20.939> option

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
guess that's not really an option

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.570 
guess that's not really an option
and<00:01:24.200> yeah<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.500> mean<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.400> where

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and yeah I mean that's kind of where

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
and yeah I mean that's kind of where
we're<00:01:26.700> stuck<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.950> definitely
