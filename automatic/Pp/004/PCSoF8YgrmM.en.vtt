server because if you have tried to

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.839 
server because if you have tried to
connect<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.770> last<00:00:07.980> couple<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.340> days<00:00:08.519> you

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
might have seen that the saw was

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.839 
might have seen that the saw was
whitelisted<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.160> reason<00:00:11.400> for<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.610> is

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
whitelisted and the reason for that is

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.999 
whitelisted and the reason for that is
that<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.210> did<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> lot<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.929> maintenance<00:00:13.259> here

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
that we did a lot of maintenance here

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.210 
that we did a lot of maintenance here
and<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.940> main<00:00:15.120> thing<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.260> around<00:00:16.560> me

and the main thing you can see around me

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.320 
and the main thing you can see around me
I<00:00:18.020> better<00:00:19.020> say<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.320> can't<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.039> because

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
I better say you can't see it because

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.640 
I better say you can't see it because
everything<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> gone<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
everything that was here is gone and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.920 
everything that was here is gone and
don't<00:00:22.859> worry<00:00:23.100> now<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.550> has<00:00:23.699> not<00:00:23.880> gone<00:00:24.240> from<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
don't worry now it has not gone from the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.609 
don't worry now it has not gone from the
server<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.500> has<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:26.250> been<00:00:26.580> moved<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.869> we

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
server it has just been moved so we

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.529 
server it has just been moved so we
thought<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.279> there's<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.760> lot<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.000> stuff<00:00:30.240> here

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
thought that there's a lot of stuff here

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.330 
thought that there's a lot of stuff here
that<00:00:30.599> people<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.349> built<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.070> server

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that people have built on the server

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.530 
that people have built on the server
already<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.130> are<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.460> active<00:00:35.850> anymore<00:00:35.969> or

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
already and are not active anymore or

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.729 
already and are not active anymore or
yet<00:00:37.290> tried<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.340> start<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.300> new<00:00:39.540> projects<00:00:40.079> so

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
yet tried to start with new projects so

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
yet tried to start with new projects so
we<00:00:40.770> decided<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.489> move<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.879> old<00:00:42.030> plots<00:00:42.420> just

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
we decided to move the old plots just

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.139 
we decided to move the old plots just
further<00:00:43.260> away<00:00:43.500> from<00:00:43.530> spawn<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> create<00:00:44.940> new

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
further away from spawn and create new

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.680 
further away from spawn and create new
plots<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.899> area<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.300> Aqua<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.450> red

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
plots in this area so the Aqua and red

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.959 
plots in this area so the Aqua and red
plots<00:00:48.930> are<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.739> direction<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
plots are just in this direction and the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
plots are just in this direction and the
blue<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.300> green<00:00:51.930> plots<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.469> dressed<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.860> this

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
blue and green plots are dressed in this

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.189 
blue and green plots are dressed in this
direction<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.600> followed<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> road

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
direction so if you followed the road

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.490 
direction so if you followed the road
you<00:00:55.440> will<00:00:55.559> find<00:00:55.829> them<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:57.170> then<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.350> are

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
you will find them and then there are

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.340 
you will find them and then there are
other<00:00:58.649> changes<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.789> made<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.570> so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
other changes that we made to this so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.399 
other changes that we made to this so
first<00:01:02.129> let<00:01:02.489> me<00:01:02.520> make<00:01:03.000> maybe<00:01:03.270> quickly<00:01:03.660> explain

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
first let me make maybe quickly explain

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.530 
first let me make maybe quickly explain
what<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.820> normally<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.299> what

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
what you can do here normally and what

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.109 
what you can do here normally and what
you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.840> still<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> great<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you can still do so this is a great of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.440 
you can still do so this is a great of
word<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.260> always<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.400> new<00:01:11.580> snapshot<00:01:12.000> or

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
word that is always in a new snapshot or

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
word that is always in a new snapshot or
in<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> newest<00:01:13.110> stable<00:01:13.710> snapshots<00:01:14.250> better

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
in the newest stable snapshots better

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.940 
in the newest stable snapshots better
say<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.689> whenever<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.200> start<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> new

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
say so whenever we start with the new

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.490 
say so whenever we start with the new
snapshots<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.640> want<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.390> update<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.290> server

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
snapshots we want to update the server

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
snapshots we want to update the server
so<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.070> play<00:01:20.340> around<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:21.000> us<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
so you can play around with us in that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.310 
so you can play around with us in that
snapshots<00:01:22.500> too<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.630> play<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.200> in

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
snapshots too and you can play here in

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830

creative<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.430> build<00:01:26.850> stuff<00:01:27.119> try<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.600> new

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
creative so build stuff try out new

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.289 
creative so build stuff try out new
creations<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.850> therefore<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.060> got

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
creations and therefore we have got

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.780 
creations and therefore we have got
these<00:01:30.630> areas<00:01:31.140> because<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.070> no<00:01:32.250> plot<00:01:32.579> me

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
command blocks and maybe you're

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.609 
command blocks and maybe you're
interested<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.939> quickly<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> look

here<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.460> read<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.060> route<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
here you can read the route and if you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.149 
here you can read the route and if you
have<00:01:57.930> read<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.530> will<00:01:58.710> get<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
have read them you will get the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.039 
have read them you will get the
guidebook<00:01:59.640> that<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.360> explain<00:02:00.750> everything

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
guidebook that will explain everything

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.410 
guidebook that will explain everything
you<00:02:01.560> need<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:04.460> then<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
you need to know and then you have the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.139 
you need to know and then you have the
rank<00:02:06.840> system<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.740> explained<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> new

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
rank system here explained so the new

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.690 
rank system here explained so the new
members<00:02:09.479> are<00:02:09.629> great<00:02:09.899> then

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
members are great then

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.130 
members are great then
plot<00:02:11.300> word<00:02:11.480> members<00:02:12.010> start<00:02:13.010> off<00:02:13.280> with<00:02:13.730> the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
plot word members start off with the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.990 
plot word members start off with the
aqua<00:02:15.140> rank<00:02:15.410> then<00:02:15.980> if<00:02:16.129> you're<00:02:16.280> active<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.730> will

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
aqua rank then if you're active you will

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.210 
aqua rank then if you're active you will
get<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.300> red<00:02:17.480> rank<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.410> will<00:02:18.620> then

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
get the red rank and that will then

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.920 
get the red rank and that will then
allow<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.580> not<00:02:19.849> only<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.300> but<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.690> Aqua

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
allow you not only to but in the Aqua

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.470 
allow you not only to but in the Aqua
area<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:21.349> also<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.860> red<00:02:22.010> area<00:02:22.190> then<00:02:23.090> if

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
area but also in the red area then if

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.210 
area but also in the red area then if
you<00:02:23.660> do<00:02:23.810> something<00:02:24.200> really<00:02:24.379> special<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.010> get

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
you do something really special and get

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.900 
you do something really special and get
noticed<00:02:25.840> then<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:27.110> might<00:02:27.620> rank<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.099> up<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.519> blue

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
noticed then I might rank you up to blue

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.830 
noticed then I might rank you up to blue
and<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:30.769> can<00:02:30.980> also<00:02:31.220> build<00:02:31.489> an<00:02:31.730> blue<00:02:32.209> plots

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
and you can also build an blue plots

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.720 
and you can also build an blue plots
which<00:02:33.140> are<00:02:33.349> then<00:02:33.530> more<00:02:33.890> secure<00:02:34.250> because<00:02:34.489> less

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
which are then more secure because less

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.120 
which are then more secure because less
people<00:02:34.760> are<00:02:35.450> allowed<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.989> play<00:02:36.620> there<00:02:36.950> and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
people are allowed to play there and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.550 
people are allowed to play there and

here still debts because we just started
if<00:03:44.750> we<00:03:44.930> walk<00:03:45.109> around<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.920> server<00:03:46.430> will<00:03:46.670> fix

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
if we walk around the server will fix

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.160 
if we walk around the server will fix
itself<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.630> it<00:03:48.290> will<00:03:48.500> update<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:49.340> borders<00:03:49.760> so

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
itself and it will update the borders so

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.780 
itself and it will update the borders so
don't<00:03:51.170> worry<00:03:51.350> about<00:03:51.590> these<00:03:52.069> holds<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:52.670> you

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
don't worry about these holds that you

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.920 
don't worry about these holds that you
can<00:03:52.940> see<00:03:53.120> around<00:03:53.359> here<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:55.569> another<00:03:56.569> cool

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
can see around here and another cool

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.550 
can see around here and another cool
thing<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.579> that<00:03:58.579> I<00:03:58.639> implemented<00:03:59.209> as<00:03:59.560> I've

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
thing that is that I implemented as I've

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.099 
thing that is that I implemented as I've
had<00:04:01.400> quite<00:04:01.880> often<00:04:02.060> people<00:04:02.420> asking<00:04:02.750> how<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.870> get

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
had quite often people asking how to get

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.920 
had quite often people asking how to get
back<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.440> spawn<00:04:03.739> if<00:04:03.920> they<00:04:04.069> got<00:04:04.220> lost<00:04:04.630> mostly<00:04:05.630> in

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
back to spawn if they got lost mostly in

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.400 
back to spawn if they got lost mostly in
spectator<00:04:06.560> mode<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:08.000> implemented<00:04:08.780> if<00:04:09.139> you

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
spectator mode so I implemented if you

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.309 
spectator mode so I implemented if you
fly<00:04:09.709> upwards<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:11.450> will<00:04:11.599> just<00:04:11.750> get<00:04:11.930> back<00:04:12.139> to

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
fly upwards you will just get back to

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.039 
fly upwards you will just get back to
spawn<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:13.269> normally<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.359> will<00:04:14.480> end<00:04:14.660> up<00:04:14.780> here

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
spawn and normally you will end up here

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.620 
spawn and normally you will end up here
in<00:04:15.079> game<00:04:15.349> at<00:04:15.500> one<00:04:15.739> but<00:04:16.130> because<00:04:16.459> I<00:04:16.940> have<00:04:17.419> some

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
in game at one but because I have some

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.449 
in game at one but because I have some
special<00:04:17.989> rules<00:04:18.109> for<00:04:18.229> myself<00:04:18.680> I'm<00:04:18.859> it's<00:04:19.250> turn

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
special rules for myself I'm it's turn

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.339 
special rules for myself I'm it's turn
spectator<00:04:19.880> mode<00:04:19.970> but<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:20.780> can<00:04:21.019> use<00:04:21.169> this

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
spectator mode but I can use this

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.159 
spectator mode but I can use this
opportunity<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:22.370> go<00:04:23.180> quickly<00:04:23.510> over<00:04:23.659> to<00:04:24.050> the

here feel free to it's all the same or

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.420 
here feel free to it's all the same or
the<00:04:43.490> same<00:04:43.729> mechanism<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.690> Reds<00:04:45.260> plots<00:04:46.250> are

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
the same mechanism the Reds plots are

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.350 
the same mechanism the Reds plots are
still<00:04:46.699> just<00:04:47.000> for<00:04:47.300> red<00:04:47.540> people<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:49.360> everything

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
still just for red people and everything

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.480 
still just for red people and everything
stood<00:04:50.780> here<00:04:51.110> besides<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.770> spawn<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.310> was

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
stood here besides the spawn that was

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.090 
stood here besides the spawn that was
here<00:04:52.729> in<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.360> front<00:04:53.720> but<00:04:55.180> yeah<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.210> think<00:04:56.449> that

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
here in the front but yeah I think that

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.920 
here in the front but yeah I think that
this<00:04:58.100> improvement<00:04:58.460> was<00:04:58.790> quite<00:04:59.090> needed<00:04:59.570> so<00:04:59.900> we

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
this improvement was quite needed so we

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.960 
this improvement was quite needed so we
have<00:05:00.200> more<00:05:00.500> space<00:05:00.650> now<00:05:00.830> and<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.820> new

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
have more space now and for the new

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.330 
have more space now and for the new
snapshots<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:02.960> will<00:05:03.139> come<00:05:03.320> soon<00:05:03.590> we<00:05:04.160> have

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
snapshots that will come soon we have

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.850 
snapshots that will come soon we have
more<00:05:04.729> space<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.120> play<00:05:05.600> around<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.260> if<00:05:06.710> you
