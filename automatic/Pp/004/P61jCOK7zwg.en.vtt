00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
keep this video short I put the extra

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.630 
keep this video short I put the extra
information<00:00:03.720> in<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.350> comments<00:00:04.920> so<00:00:05.220> look<00:00:05.400> for

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
information in the comments so look for

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.330 
information in the comments so look for
it<00:00:05.730> there<00:00:06.470> first<00:00:07.470> thing<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.919> remove<00:00:08.040> this

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
it there first thing is to remove this

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.440 
it there first thing is to remove this
cover<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.940> had<00:00:09.179> already<00:00:09.360> removed<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.929> earlier

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
cover I had already removed it earlier

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.030 
cover I had already removed it earlier
then<00:00:12.450> there's<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.929> lever<00:00:13.200> right<00:00:13.469> back<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:13.950> in

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
then there's a lever right back here in

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.849 
then there's a lever right back here in
the<00:00:14.130> back<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.670> relieves<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.839> pressure<00:00:16.020> from

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the back that relieves the pressure from

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.710 
the back that relieves the pressure from
the<00:00:16.980> fuel<00:00:17.250> let's<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.270> fuel<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.690> water<00:00:18.930> out

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
the fuel let's the fuel in water out

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
the fuel let's the fuel in water out
follow<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.960> line<00:00:22.170> right<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.890> down<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
follow the line right here down to the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.370 
follow the line right here down to the
bottom<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.920> put<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> catch<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.220> under<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
bottom and put a catch can under it and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.259 
bottom and put a catch can under it and
then<00:00:28.380> throw<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.769> lever<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.849> relieve<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
then throw the lever to relieve the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.880 
then throw the lever to relieve the
pressure<00:00:30.420> off<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.990> system<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.590> let<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
pressure off of the system and let the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
pressure off of the system and let the
fuel<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.430> water<00:00:32.579> out<00:00:38.870> different<00:00:39.870> filters

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
fuel and water out different filters

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.770 
fuel and water out different filters
will<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.770> different<00:00:41.070> lid<00:00:41.399> designs<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.239> do

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
will have different lid designs so do

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.000 
will have different lid designs so do
whatever<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.140> need<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.860> your
