00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
our body wants carbohydrates but our

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
our body wants carbohydrates but our
mind<00:01:08.130> processes<00:01:08.820> carbohydrates<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:10.020> ice

cream<00:01:10.880> pizza<00:01:11.880> bread<00:01:12.720> etc<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:14.299> your<00:01:15.299> brain

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540

basically tells you what type of food it
wants<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.759> body<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.390> telling<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
wants your body is just telling you that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.399 
wants your body is just telling you that
it<00:01:22.110> needs<00:01:22.580> carbohydrates<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:24.390> often<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:24.930> we

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it needs carbohydrates more often not we

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
it needs carbohydrates more often not we

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
want to get that in the simple form of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
want to get that in the simple form of
some<00:01:27.720> type<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:27.990> sugar<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:29.100> usually

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
some type of sugar so that's usually

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
some type of sugar so that's usually
what<00:01:29.490> happens<00:01:29.520> late<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.119> night<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.960> would

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
what happens late at night but I would

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859
