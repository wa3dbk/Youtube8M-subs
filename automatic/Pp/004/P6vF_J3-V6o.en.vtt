00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
if you've already flown it and you've

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.490 
if you've already flown it and you've
changed<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:30.369> to<00:00:30.630> airfield<00:00:31.630> mode<00:00:31.869> then<00:00:32.470> you

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
changed it to airfield mode then you

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.290 
changed it to airfield mode then you
need<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.890> change<00:00:33.100> it<00:00:33.340> back<00:00:33.489> first<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.030> be<00:00:34.180> in

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
need to change it back first to be in

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.200

part will show the couple simple steps

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.170 
part will show the couple simple steps
and<00:00:41.019> how<00:00:41.229> to<00:00:41.290> use<00:00:41.530> it<00:00:41.680> properly<00:00:42.120> okay<00:00:43.120> to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
and how to use it properly okay to

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.619 
and how to use it properly okay to
change<00:00:43.510> from<00:00:44.250> airfield<00:00:45.250> mode<00:00:45.519> back<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:45.879> park

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
change from airfield mode back to park

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:54.509 
change from airfield mode back to park
mode<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.089> couple<00:00:49.269> simple<00:00:49.570> steps<00:00:53.519> first

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
mode just a couple simple steps first

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.509 
mode just a couple simple steps first
access<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.210> battery<00:00:55.799> but<00:00:56.799> before<00:00:57.070> we<00:00:57.190> plug<00:00:57.400> it

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
access the battery but before we plug it

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.250 
access the battery but before we plug it
in<00:00:57.670> we<00:00:57.879> turn<00:00:58.089> on<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.360> transmitter<00:00:58.570> like

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
in we turn on the transmitter like

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.840 
in we turn on the transmitter like
always<00:00:59.530> it's<00:00:59.949> best<00:01:00.159> practice<00:01:00.220> to<00:01:00.580> turn<00:01:00.760> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
always it's best practice to turn the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.490 
always it's best practice to turn the
transmitter<00:01:01.150> on<00:01:01.449> before<00:01:01.780> powering<00:01:02.229> up<00:01:02.320> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
transmitter on before powering up the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.070 
transmitter on before powering up the
airplane<00:01:03.210> transmitters<00:01:04.210> on<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:04.659> we<00:01:04.780> power<00:01:04.960> the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
airplane transmitters on so we power the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.980 
airplane transmitters on so we power the
airplane<00:01:05.560> up<00:01:07.500> well<00:01:08.500> here<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.740> esc<00:01:09.719> that<00:01:10.719> tone

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
airplane up well here the esc that tone

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.870 
airplane up well here the esc that tone
just<00:01:11.259> tells<00:01:11.500> us<00:01:11.619> that<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.859> has<00:01:11.890> power<00:01:12.219> it's<00:01:12.789> not

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
just tells us that it has power it's not

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.060 
just tells us that it has power it's not
looking<00:01:13.359> for<00:01:13.570> satellites<00:01:14.289> yet<00:01:14.560> until<00:01:14.829> we<00:01:14.920> turn

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
looking for satellites yet until we turn

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.609 
looking for satellites yet until we turn
it<00:01:15.219> upright<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:16.359> now<00:01:16.509> it's<00:01:16.689> upright<00:01:16.930> it<00:01:17.259> starts

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
it upright so now it's upright it starts

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.169 
it upright so now it's upright it starts
looking<00:01:17.829> for<00:01:18.009> satellites<00:01:18.460> so<00:01:18.640> before<00:01:18.939> it<00:01:19.030> gets

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
looking for satellites so before it gets

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.840 
looking for satellites so before it gets
locked<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:20.409> hold<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.799> stick<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.340> right<00:01:21.549> stick

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
locked we hold the stick the right stick

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
stick we leave it low throttle and we

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.569 
stick we leave it low throttle and we
don't<00:01:28.630> touch<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.259> we<00:01:29.829> just<00:01:29.859> wait<00:01:30.189> till<00:01:30.429> get

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
don't touch it and we just wait till get

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.149 
don't touch it and we just wait till get
satellite<00:01:31.060> lock<00:01:31.270> once<00:01:31.749> it<00:01:31.869> does<00:01:32.049> that<00:01:32.079> like<00:01:33.009> it

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
satellite lock once it does that like it

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.190 
satellite lock once it does that like it
just<00:01:33.399> did<00:01:33.579> it<00:01:33.609> tells<00:01:34.060> us<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.359> did<00:01:34.539> by<00:01:34.810> moving

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
just did it tells us it did by moving

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.649 
just did it tells us it did by moving
the<00:01:35.409> ailerons<00:01:35.829> off<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.789> we<00:01:36.939> heard<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.210> esc

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
the ailerons off and we heard the esc

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.889 
the ailerons off and we heard the esc
tone<00:01:37.899> that<00:01:38.320> tells<00:01:38.590> us<00:01:38.799> it's<00:01:39.700> back<00:01:40.240> in<00:01:40.509> Park

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
tone that tells us it's back in Park

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.660 
tone that tells us it's back in Park
mode<00:01:41.140> now<00:01:41.530> it'll<00:01:41.710> stay<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.189> mode<00:01:42.429> until

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
mode now it'll stay in that mode until

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.489 
mode now it'll stay in that mode until
we<00:01:42.999> change<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.509> again<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:43.960> every<00:01:44.140> time<00:01:44.320> we<00:01:44.469> go

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
we change it again so every time we go

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.440 
we change it again so every time we go
fly<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.460> we<00:01:45.549> want<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.819> be<00:01:45.909> in<00:01:45.969> this<00:01:46.060> mode<00:01:46.270> we

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
fly and we want to be in this mode we

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.880 
fly and we want to be in this mode we
don't<00:01:46.630> have<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.899> do<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.170> every<00:01:47.319> time<00:01:47.469> just

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
don't have to do that every time just

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.080 
don't have to do that every time just
the<00:01:48.069> first<00:01:48.249> time<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.640> change<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:48.999> back<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:52.030> we

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
the first time to change it back now we

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.029 
the first time to change it back now we
just<00:01:52.390> flip<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.689> back<00:01:52.929> over<00:01:53.109> disconnect<00:01:53.979> the

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
just flip it back over disconnect the

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.580 
just flip it back over disconnect the
battery<00:01:54.749> next<00:01:55.749> time<00:01:55.869> we<00:01:55.990> plug<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.319> in<00:01:56.409> we're

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
battery next time we plug it in we're

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.130 
battery next time we plug it in we're
good<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.829> go<00:01:56.859> fly

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
good to go fly

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.040 
good to go fly
to<00:01:58.860> set<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.340> virtual<00:02:00.030> fence<00:02:00.240> park<00:02:00.780> mode

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
to set the virtual fence park mode

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.290 
to set the virtual fence park mode
properly<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.979> couple<00:02:02.220> very<00:02:02.700> easy<00:02:02.940> steps

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
properly just a couple very easy steps

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.030 
properly just a couple very easy steps
you<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.750> follow<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.710> airplane

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
you have to follow as the airplane

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.940 
you have to follow as the airplane
powers<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.940> knows<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.750> point<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
powers up so it knows the point on the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.770 
powers up so it knows the point on the
ground<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.490> wants<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> shoot<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.630> when

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
ground that it wants to shoot for when

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.080 
ground that it wants to shoot for when
it<00:02:09.869> lands<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.310> direction<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:11.970> wants

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
it lands and the direction that it wants

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.140 
it lands and the direction that it wants
to<00:02:12.330> land<00:02:12.510> when<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.720> tell<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.959> Ottawa<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:14.150> as

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
to land when you tell it to Ottawa so as

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.000 
to land when you tell it to Ottawa so as
always<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.630> flip<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.140> airplane<00:02:16.440> upside<00:02:16.650> down

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
always we flip the airplane upside down

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.070 
always we flip the airplane upside down
to<00:02:17.160> access<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.670> battery<00:02:17.820> turn<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
to access the battery turn on the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.540 
to access the battery turn on the
transmitter<00:02:19.500> first<00:02:19.740> because<00:02:20.190> it's<00:02:20.400> always

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
transmitter first because it's always

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.220 
transmitter first because it's always
best<00:02:20.820> practice<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.420> turn<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> transmitter

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
best practice to turn on the transmitter

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.040 
best practice to turn on the transmitter
before<00:02:22.590> powering<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.070> airplane<00:02:23.989> now<00:02:24.989> we

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
before powering the airplane now we

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.840 
before powering the airplane now we
power<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> airplane<00:02:26.180> by<00:02:27.180> plugging<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:28.850> we

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
power the airplane by plugging it in we

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.350 
power the airplane by plugging it in we
can<00:02:30.000> put<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.239> battery<00:02:30.540> hatch<00:02:30.750> back<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:32.360> now

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
can put the battery hatch back on now

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.150 
can put the battery hatch back on now
the<00:02:33.420> airplane<00:02:33.810> won't<00:02:34.080> start<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.500> look<00:02:34.620> for<00:02:34.800> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the airplane won't start to look for a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.740 
the airplane won't start to look for a
satellite<00:02:35.640> lock<00:02:35.850> until<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.450> sitting

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
satellite lock until it's sitting

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.750 
satellite lock until it's sitting
upright<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.110> its<00:02:37.260> wheels<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.280> we're<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.580> no

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
upright on its wheels so we're in no

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.640 
upright on its wheels so we're in no
rush<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.390> what<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:39.660> want<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.260> set<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
rush but what we want to do is set the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.610 
rush but what we want to do is set the
airplane<00:02:41.070> at<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.700> point<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:43.110> ground<00:02:43.380> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
airplane at the point on the ground that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.470 
airplane at the point on the ground that
we<00:02:43.739> want<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.130> aim<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:44.400> when<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.060> tell<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.390> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
we want it to aim for when we tell it to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.050 
we want it to aim for when we tell it to
auto<00:02:45.840> land<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:46.950> also<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.430> point<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.880> it

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
auto land this is also the point that it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.970 
auto land this is also the point that it
will<00:02:48.180> circle<00:02:48.660> around<00:02:48.780> when<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:49.650> go<00:02:49.800> into

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
will circle around when we go into

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.210 
will circle around when we go into
holding<00:02:50.400> pattern<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.410> case<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.920> want

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
holding pattern so in this case I want

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.470 
holding pattern so in this case I want
it<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.519> probably<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.090> middle<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.390> this

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it to be probably in the middle of this

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.870 
it to be probably in the middle of this
runway<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.200> I'll<00:02:55.350> walk<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.739> airplane<00:02:56.100> out<00:02:56.130> and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
runway so I'll walk the airplane out and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.570 
runway so I'll walk the airplane out and
I'll<00:02:57.000> set<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.239> at<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.510> point

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.870 

now<00:03:05.390> it'll<00:03:05.600> get<00:03:05.810> satellite<00:03:06.530> luck<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.280> we'll

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
now it'll get satellite luck and we'll

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.300 
now it'll get satellite luck and we'll
hear<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.210> esc<00:03:09.080> tone<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.680> tell<00:03:09.860> us<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.190> is

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
hear the esc tone to tell us that is

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.670 
hear the esc tone to tell us that is
ready<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.610> go

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.589 

now<00:03:21.680> we're<00:03:21.860> ready<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.129> go<00:03:22.370> now<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.150> system

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
now we're ready to go now the system

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.050 
now we're ready to go now the system
knows<00:03:23.810> its<00:03:24.049> point<00:03:24.409> on<00:03:24.590> on<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:25.400> earth<00:03:25.430> where<00:03:26.030> we

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
knows its point on on the earth where we

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.539 
knows its point on on the earth where we
want<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.510> land<00:03:26.840> or<00:03:27.140> we<00:03:27.290> want<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.769> to

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
want it to land or we want it to to

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.220 
want it to land or we want it to to
circle<00:03:28.940> when<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:29.209> tell<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.720> go<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.870> holding

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
circle when we tell it to go to holding

I<00:03:47.780> tell<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.200> Auto<00:03:48.349> land<00:03:48.680> it's<00:03:48.890> going<00:03:49.159> to<00:03:49.250> go

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
I tell it to Auto land it's going to go

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.330 
I tell it to Auto land it's going to go
downwind<00:03:50.360> and<00:03:50.540> fly<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:51.049> heading<00:03:51.379> back<00:03:52.099> to

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
downwind and fly that heading back to

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.949 
downwind and fly that heading back to
the<00:03:52.430> point<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:52.910> it's<00:03:53.090> sitting<00:03:53.359> at<00:03:53.480> right<00:03:53.690> now

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
the point that it's sitting at right now

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.289 
the point that it's sitting at right now
so<00:03:54.950> since<00:03:55.370> I'm<00:03:55.519> pointing<00:03:55.849> right<00:03:55.879> down<00:03:56.180> the

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
so since I'm pointing right down the

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.819 
so since I'm pointing right down the
runway<00:03:56.660> if<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:56.900> push<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.230> throttle<00:03:57.590> forward

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
runway if I push the throttle forward

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.500 
runway if I push the throttle forward
that's<00:03:58.250> going<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.609> set<00:03:58.819> it<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.150> it's<00:03:59.269> going<00:03:59.450> to

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
that's going to set it and it's going to

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.809 
that's going to set it and it's going to
land<00:03:59.750> from<00:04:00.410> behind<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.920> airplane<00:04:00.950> in<00:04:01.609> that

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
land from behind the airplane in that

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.240 
land from behind the airplane in that
direction<00:04:02.000> if<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.510> were<00:04:02.629> to<00:04:02.720> point<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.079> nose

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
direction if I were to point the nose

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.589 
direction if I were to point the nose
straight<00:04:04.250> out<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.760> push<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:05.030> throttle<00:04:05.420> up

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
straight out and push the throttle up

and<00:04:06.019> when<00:04:06.109> I<00:04:06.140> tell<00:04:06.379> it<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.590> land<00:04:06.829> it's<00:04:07.010> going<00:04:07.220> to

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
and when I tell it to land it's going to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.830 
and when I tell it to land it's going to
approach<00:04:07.549> from<00:04:07.609> behind<00:04:08.060> me<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.359> try<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.569> land

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.120 
to go so I push the throttle forward
when<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.180> hits<00:04:14.390> 90<00:04:14.720> percent<00:04:15.109> it's<00:04:15.829> going<00:04:16.070> to
