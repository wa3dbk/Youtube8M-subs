 in the Amur region evacuated already 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.740
 more than 500 villagers near for and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.139
 sky gs at risk 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.049
 Now there are about 30 inhabited 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.690
 items due to rains which did not lie 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.000
 do not stop in the region week level 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.980
 water in the Zeya reservoir exceeded 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.980
 the critical point is therefore water 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.400
 forced to dump and volume these can 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.900
 increase with the details olya deaf 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.699
 dangerous hydrological phenomena like 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.460
 calling what is happening on zeyskogo hydroelectric station 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.590
 locals express more flood 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.930
 water reserves are much higher than normal 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.350
 it is no longer just a threat 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.700
 spare zones recommends people places from 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.670
 Yangon who suffered floods 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.260
 most of all when I was leaving my 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.590
 home to the house I could not enter 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 brigade him well you know swamps 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.920
 no longer the water got into its house 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.930
 Return your yard and java tennis mouse not 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 smog flooding threatened 30 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.100
 Settlements in front of the Zeya hydroelectric station 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.350
 water level one meter higher 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.240
 marks therefore on hydroelectric 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
 urgently switched to the so-called 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.189
 idle discharge water flow 3 s 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.920
 half a thousand cubic meters every second 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.900
 but this may not be enough 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 experts say it is possible that 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.750
 discharge from the reservoir will have 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.570
 double 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.800
 the situation is more than serious and this is the second 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.960
 happening 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.750
 ATP at the time of construction of station 8 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.170
 fifth year and recurrence 2 case since 2007 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.210
 of the year 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.790
 it causes them to calm first for 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.200
 what are these short rows with such 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.060
 large tributaries and if you take the whole 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.220
 observation period over 100 years is 4 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.810
 cases when such a large sex this 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.880
 flood is predicted to be 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.010
 record water level and some poses 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.980
 all along the cupid can exceed the norm on 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.840
 7 or even 8 meters only for the last 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.600
 day in the Khabarovsk area the water rose 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.330
 16 centimeters last like 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.820
 was almost 20 years ago so tall 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.430
 we had eighty levels 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.790
 fifth year probably somewhere half a meter 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.790
 higher it was 550 while peak flood 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.480
 most likely still ahead, too, will give that 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:16.860
 we are there 16 to navel 576 not vagant warrior 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.170
 still high water all up shot cables 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.690
 gardeners to the last tried to save 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.170
 the harvest has not yet understood

 MOE boat while came to the aid has been 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.569
 decision made to move there 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.819

 several dozen houses 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.450
 well, something like this was the hour 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.909
 this moment like this underwater then 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.780
 It was but a little smaller on the train potatoes 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:54.840

 we have a kitchen where we can feed 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.120
 people emergency lighting in case 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.250
 suddenly there will be light in itself 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.530
 Annunciation in the area of Rick Burkhanov 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.780
 the idea went under the water dozens of garages in 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.120
 private sector level has sometimes reached 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.040
 one and a half meters to save cars 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.319
 car owners hired him curators or
