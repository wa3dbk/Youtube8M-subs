00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
different and the sort of thing that I'd

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.109

watch<00:02:06.680> myself<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.340> know<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.759> this<00:02:07.970> is

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
watch myself you know and this is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:17.610 
watch myself you know and this is
definitely<00:02:08.540> it's<00:02:09.440> different
