00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
Pirates boxes but I think that's because

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and the boxes were smaller on those like

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.450 
and the boxes were smaller on those like
the<00:00:36.600> final<00:00:36.989> fantasy<00:00:37.380> 7<00:00:37.710> boxes<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.280> know

fist<00:01:36.259> something<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:37.890> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
fist something I do not like about this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.310 
fist something I do not like about this
figure<00:01:38.520> probably<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:39.090> only<00:01:39.360> complaint<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
figure probably my only complaint is the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.160 
figure probably my only complaint is the
hands<00:01:40.979> don't<00:01:41.700> move<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.509> they<00:01:43.140> only

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hands don't move like this they only

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
hands don't move like this they only
twist<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.520> since<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.180> old<00:01:45.299> figure

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
twist but since it's a really old figure

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660 
twist but since it's a really old figure
and<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.649> good<00:01:46.799> figure<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.369> guess

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and it's a really good figure I guess

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.359 
and it's a really good figure I guess
I'm<00:01:47.790> ok<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> moving<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I'm ok with it so moving on to the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
around just like that it can go a little

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.160 
around just like that it can go a little
bit<00:02:09.539> down<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.619> too<00:02:10.830> much<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.420> not<00:02:12.420> back<00:02:12.780> for

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
bit down not too much and not back for

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.150

top and in the ponytail so those move

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.390 
top and in the ponytail so those move
like<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.209> said<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> jacket<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.860> very<00:02:23.160> nice

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
like I said the jacket it's very nice

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.050 
like I said the jacket it's very nice
and<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.880> comes<00:02:24.060> off<00:02:24.209> very<00:02:24.239> easy<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.560> anyways<00:02:26.060> he

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and it comes off very easy so anyways he

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.330 
and it comes off very easy so anyways he
does<00:02:27.239> move<00:02:27.480> at<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> waist<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.980> doesn't

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
does move at the waist but it doesn't

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.850 
does move at the waist but it doesn't
move<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.520> much<00:02:30.270> because<00:02:31.110> it's<00:02:31.260> more<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.560> an

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
move that much because it's more of an

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.559 
move that much because it's more of an
oval<00:02:32.670> than<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.030> circle<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.530> legs<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:36.150> some

oval than a circle the legs have some
very<00:02:36.810> nice<00:02:37.020> movement<00:02:37.590> that's<00:02:38.190> almost<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.730> 90

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
very nice movement that's almost a 90

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.620 
very nice movement that's almost a 90
degree<00:02:39.360> with<00:02:39.540> his<00:02:39.660> body<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.170> actually<00:02:40.830> and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
degree with his body it is actually and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.930 
degree with his body it is actually and
they<00:02:42.630> can<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:42.930> all<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.319> way<00:02:43.349> out<00:02:43.819> just<00:02:44.819> like

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
it twists closer to the elbow I don't

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.400 
it twists closer to the elbow I don't
know<00:03:33.269> if<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.540> see<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.840> right<00:03:34.019> there

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.530 

they<00:03:37.410> get<00:03:37.620> about<00:03:37.950> 90<00:03:38.519> degrees<00:03:38.640> for<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.390> red

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
they get about 90 degrees for the red

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.780 
they get about 90 degrees for the red
and<00:03:39.660> black<00:03:39.780> ones<00:03:40.079> this<00:03:40.920> one's<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.340> little<00:03:41.519> bit

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
and black ones this one's a little bit

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.110 
and black ones this one's a little bit
less<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:43.709> hands<00:03:44.160> like<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.430> said<00:03:44.609> before<00:03:44.760> they

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
less the hands like I said before they

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.050 
less the hands like I said before they
twist<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:45.780> they<00:03:45.900> do<00:03:45.959> not<00:03:46.230> move<00:03:46.530> like<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:50.060> so

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
twist but they do not move like that so

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.750 
twist but they do not move like that so
I<00:03:51.359> think<00:03:52.320> that's<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.220> pretty<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.640> a

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
I think that's it it's a pretty it's a

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.610 
I think that's it it's a pretty it's a
pretty<00:03:53.790> great<00:03:54.090> figure<00:03:54.450> here<00:03:54.720> I'll<00:03:55.230> take<00:03:55.470> off
