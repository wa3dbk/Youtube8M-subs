cognition areas not memory banks
assuming<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.490> two<00:01:49.760> don't<00:01:50.030> wipe<00:01:50.330> those<00:01:50.600> areas

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200

as<00:01:51.380> well<00:01:52.300> then<00:01:53.300> I'd<00:01:53.630> have<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.080> retrain<00:01:54.560> him<00:01:54.830> all

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
as well then I'd have to retrain him all

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.850 
as well then I'd have to retrain him all
over<00:01:55.550> again<00:01:57.220> as<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.430> was<00:01:58.460> saying<00:01:59.440> if<00:02:00.440> they<00:02:00.619> try

to<00:02:00.920> escape<00:02:01.250> again<00:02:01.399> they'll<00:02:01.910> have<00:02:02.090> some

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
to escape again they'll have some

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.880 
to escape again they'll have some
pre-existing<00:02:02.630> knowledge<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.470> help<00:02:03.560> them<00:02:03.800> get
