00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.470

away<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.250> can't<00:02:19.490> get<00:02:19.670> there

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
away so that you can't get there

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.630 
away so that you can't get there
fast<00:02:20.930> enough<00:02:21.260> even<00:02:21.530> if<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.769> c-4<00:02:22.190> does<00:02:22.430> go<00:02:22.610> off

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
fast enough even if the c-4 does go off

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.610 
fast enough even if the c-4 does go off
and<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.239> doesn't<00:02:23.510> kill<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.230> need<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.560> be

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
and it doesn't kill so you need to be

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.839 
and it doesn't kill so you need to be
able<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.920> get<00:02:25.099> in<00:02:25.220> there<00:02:25.310> fast<00:02:25.580> because<00:02:25.819> the

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
able to get in there fast because the

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.300 
able to get in there fast because the
second<00:02:26.299> you<00:02:26.330> hear<00:02:26.599> them<00:02:26.780> trying<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.739> defuse

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
second you hear them trying to defuse

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.589 
second you hear them trying to defuse
that's<00:02:28.489> when<00:02:28.610> you're<00:02:28.730> gonna<00:02:28.819> launch<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.360> c4

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
that's when you're gonna launch that c4

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.220 
that's when you're gonna launch that c4
course<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:30.799> again<00:02:31.390> with<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.569> bomb<00:02:32.720> we're

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
coming in here and you set up enough the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.559 
coming in here and you set up enough the
smoke<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.489> stop<00:02:52.700> them<00:02:52.910> from<00:02:53.000> rushing<00:02:53.390> through

dealing with some meat ball players
which<00:02:56.629> sometimes<00:02:57.349> is<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.769> case<00:02:58.010> but

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
which sometimes is the case but

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.910 
which sometimes is the case but
nonetheless<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.959> smoke<00:03:00.230> sort<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.560> deters

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
nonetheless the smoke sort of deters

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.589 
nonetheless the smoke sort of deters
them<00:03:01.160> from<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:01.609> running<00:03:01.910> blindly<00:03:02.269> through

them from just running blindly through

them from just running blindly through
there<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:03.140> got<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> claymores<00:03:03.829> set<00:03:04.040> up<00:03:04.160> for

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
there you got the claymores set up for

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.170 
there you got the claymores set up for
the<00:03:04.430> kill<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:06.519> obviously<00:03:07.519> it<00:03:07.700> didn't<00:03:07.970> go<00:03:08.030> off

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
the kill and obviously it didn't go off

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.400 
the kill and obviously it didn't go off
because<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.629> see<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.930> one<00:03:09.049> dude<00:03:09.230> and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
because you can see that one dude and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.900 
because you can see that one dude and
you<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.099> wait<00:03:10.250> for<00:03:10.489> him<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.609> run<00:03:10.760> across

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
you just wait for him to run across

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.030 
you just wait for him to run across
sometimes<00:03:11.510> it's<00:03:11.690> not<00:03:11.810> always<00:03:11.870> smart<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.319> go

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
sometimes it's not always smart to go

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.770 
sometimes it's not always smart to go
chasing<00:03:13.430> after<00:03:13.609> him<00:03:13.879> why<00:03:14.120> do<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.480> they're

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
chasing after him why do that they're

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.259 
chasing after him why do that they're
lit<00:03:14.989> up<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:16.129> just<00:03:16.370> watch<00:03:16.640> them<00:03:16.819> and<00:03:16.970> wait<00:03:17.120> for

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
lit up you just watch them and wait for

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.150 
lit up you just watch them and wait for
him<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:17.390> come<00:03:17.569> across<00:03:17.900> he's<00:03:18.260> easy<00:03:18.530> prey<00:03:18.680> and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
him to come across he's easy prey and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.220 
him to come across he's easy prey and
this<00:03:19.879> again<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.209> waiting<00:03:20.660> because<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.959> mean

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
this again is waiting because I mean

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.780 
this again is waiting because I mean
half<00:03:21.410> my<00:03:21.590> team<00:03:21.650> or<00:03:22.010> more<00:03:22.220> than<00:03:22.400> half<00:03:22.549> my<00:03:22.579> team

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
half my team or more than half my team

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.610 
half my team or more than half my team
was<00:03:23.120> eliminated<00:03:23.239> right<00:03:23.780> off<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.079> bat<00:03:24.260> so

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
was eliminated right off the bat so

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.809 
was eliminated right off the bat so

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
obviously they're an aggressive team

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.970 
obviously they're an aggressive team

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
sometimes it's smart at least within the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.610 
sometimes it's smart at least within the
first<00:03:28.190> minute<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.940> play<00:03:29.120> defensively<00:03:29.720> get<00:03:30.500> the

do it again so I'm going to be and I'm

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.319 
do it again so I'm going to be and I'm
actually<00:03:54.590> hugging<00:03:55.069> at<00:03:55.190> this<00:03:55.340> side<00:03:55.579> here<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.180> I

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
actually hugging at this side here and I

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.120 
actually hugging at this side here and I
know<00:03:56.389> it<00:03:56.569> seems<00:03:56.750> maybe<00:03:57.349> a<00:03:57.440> little<00:03:57.680> bit<00:03:57.859> foolish

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
know it seems maybe a little bit foolish

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.909 
know it seems maybe a little bit foolish
but<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.299> does<00:03:59.480> work<00:03:59.510> at<00:03:59.930> least<00:04:00.230> once<00:04:00.530> or<00:04:00.709> twice

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
but it does work at least once or twice

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.500 
but it does work at least once or twice
not<00:04:01.250> every<00:04:01.430> single<00:04:01.549> time<00:04:01.849> but<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.180> does<00:04:02.329> give

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
not every single time but it does give

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.420 
not every single time but it does give
you<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.690> good<00:04:03.109> odds<00:04:03.290> do<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.769> place<00:04:04.280> the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
you a good odds do that place the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.369 
you a good odds do that place the
Claymore<00:04:04.819> again<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.120> use<00:04:05.480> it<00:04:05.629> as<00:04:05.750> guards<00:04:06.139> for

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
Claymore again I use it as guards for

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.319 
Claymore again I use it as guards for
the<00:04:06.440> rear<00:04:06.620> because<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.310> can't<00:04:07.639> you<00:04:08.150> know<00:04:08.180> if
