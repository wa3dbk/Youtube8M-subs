00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 how are those New Year's resolutions going 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.449
 If I'm talking about the purpose of eating 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.850
 healthier and safer than for 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.980
 I need with my recipes both environment 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 It has been very easy to continue with these 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 groups then just thinking of 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.689
 that occurred to me today prepare 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.579
 a super rich salad we are going to prepare 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.680
 today a salad style 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.930
 Japanese besides it looks pretty 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.120
 it's very very very easy to prepare that the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.340
 list in minutes list let's see that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.489
 we need and how it is prepared is what 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.780
 You like it, we're going to need mango cucumber 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.059
 avocado 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.480
 onion I put purple onion for 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.780
 that had more color the saucer 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.060
 surimi 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.840
 soy sauce 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.030
 lemon juice and is optional a little 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.800
 of ginger zest we are going to apply 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.810
 all our ingredients in cubes 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.450
 little ones and we're going to put them in a 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.610
 container like this layered at the end 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.550
 of each layer we have to crush super 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.660
 well with a spoon or should be left 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.660
 super compact 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.300
 then we will place it on a plate 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.610
 we turn it around and very carefully 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.290
 let's remove the mold cited the idea is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.590
 that is a way more or less like 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590
 is 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.530
 We can accompany you with soy sauce 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.750
 we put a splash of lemon juice and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.400
 as I told them optional if they like the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.110
 flavor of ginger a little bit 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.630
 zest of ginger to give it a 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.640
 different touch is super fast and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.680
 That's how easy our salad is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.630
 Japanese style we can eat with 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.400
 chopsticks or if we do not like 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.580
 complicate us christmas with cutlery 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.530
 normal 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.570
 I hope you liked the recipe 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.790

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.770
 and every rich good if they do not like the 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.380
 Surimi can use other fish for 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.940
 example tuna salmon grass but 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.440
 you can be well alive and put 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.360
 the ingredients that want this 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.910
 it's just a suggestion and good 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.210

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.210
