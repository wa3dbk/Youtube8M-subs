00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
hospital so he didn't have to spend the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.029 
hospital so he didn't have to spend the
entire<00:00:25.890> time<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.580> me<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> hospital<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
entire time with me in the hospital and

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.519 
entire time with me in the hospital and
it<00:00:29.039> came<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.880> almost<00:00:30.420> $900<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it came out to like almost $900 so I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.520

think<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.890> were<00:00:31.949> incorrect<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
think they were incorrect and then it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
think they were incorrect and then it
was<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> whole<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.219> peso<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.910> dollar

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
was the whole like peso to dollar

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.940
