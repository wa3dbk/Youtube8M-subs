00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
over the dress it's a panel and I really

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.780 
over the dress it's a panel and I really
do<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:52.710> that<00:03:52.740> one<00:03:55.370> some<00:03:56.370> more<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:57.440> and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
do like that one some more of that and

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.370 
do like that one some more of that and
the<00:03:59.790> last<00:03:59.940> one<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.420> did<00:04:00.450> was<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.230> one<00:04:03.380> because

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
the last one I did was this one because

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.310 
the last one I did was this one because
I<00:04:04.470> can<00:04:04.620> use<00:04:04.800> that<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.340> spine<00:04:05.640> of<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> book

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
I can use that of the spine of the book

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.780 
I can use that of the spine of the book
which<00:04:07.320> I<00:04:07.440> will<00:04:07.590> do<00:04:07.860> probably<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:10.280> know<00:04:11.280> in

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
which I will do probably and you know in

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.960 
which I will do probably and you know in
the<00:04:12.060> book<00:04:12.240> itself<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.460> just<00:04:14.670> thought<00:04:14.790> I'll

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
the book itself so I just thought I'll

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.640 
the book itself so I just thought I'll
show<00:04:15.240> you<00:04:15.300> that<00:04:15.510> share<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:15.870> with<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.410> you

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.210 
show you that share that with you you
know<00:04:17.460> and<00:04:18.080> I'm<00:04:19.080> quite<00:04:19.290> looking<00:04:19.470> forward<00:04:20.070> to

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
know and I'm quite looking forward to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.360 
know and I'm quite looking forward to
starting<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.820> book<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.270> I<00:04:21.600> might<00:04:21.900> just<00:04:22.370> do

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
starting the book and I might just do

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.330 
starting the book and I might just do
the<00:04:23.400> book<00:04:23.760> with<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.890> can<00:04:26.070> see

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
the book with you so that you can see

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.170 
the book with you so that you can see
for<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.700> new<00:04:26.850> bit

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
for the new bit

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.039 
for the new bit
how<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.720> put<00:04:28.139> a<00:04:28.410> book<00:04:28.710> together<00:04:30.800> what<00:04:31.800> belong
