the cornea until it's the right shape
the<00:02:02.170> recovery<00:02:02.590> time<00:02:02.799> is<00:02:02.950> about<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.220> month<00:02:03.750> when

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the recovery time is about a month when

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.450 
the recovery time is about a month when
you<00:02:04.840> gradually<00:02:05.229> get<00:02:05.470> your<00:02:05.619> vision<00:02:05.920> back<00:02:06.070> over

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
that time not everyone can get the LASIK

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.849 
that time not everyone can get the LASIK
surgery<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.539> my<00:02:10.659> eyes<00:02:10.840> are<00:02:10.869> only<00:02:11.230> suited<00:02:11.680> for

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
surgery and my eyes are only suited for

the<00:02:11.950> PRK<00:02:12.310> procedure<00:02:13.379> PRK<00:02:14.379> is<00:02:14.439> more<00:02:14.739> safe

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
the PRK procedure PRK is more safe

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.590 
the PRK procedure PRK is more safe
