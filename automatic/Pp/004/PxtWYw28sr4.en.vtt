scanner it's a pretty cool application
lightning<00:00:33.270> fast<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:34.290> based<00:00:34.559> off<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
lightning fast it's based off a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.310 
lightning fast it's based off a
cloud-based<00:00:35.130> technology<00:00:36.030> dreaming<00:00:36.719> big<00:00:37.110> fan

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
cloud-based technology dreaming big fan

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
cloud-based technology dreaming big fan
of<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.969> he'll<00:00:38.969> explain<00:00:39.270> how<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> works<00:00:40.910> so

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
of and he'll explain how it works so

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.570 
of and he'll explain how it works so
basically<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.420> does<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.900> it<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.340> fast

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
basically what it does is it is a fast

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.920 
basically what it does is it is a fast
60<00:00:45.060> second<00:00:45.450> virus<00:00:45.630> scanner<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.350> free<00:00:47.930> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
60 second virus scanner it's free it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
60 second virus scanner it's free it
uses<00:00:49.170> cloud-based<00:00:49.500> technology<00:00:50.220> so<00:00:50.370> happens

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
uses cloud-based technology so happens

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
uses cloud-based technology so happens
is<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.060> is<00:00:51.270> scanning<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.430> use

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
is as is scanning and kind of like use

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.430 
is as is scanning and kind of like use
the<00:00:53.700> cloud<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.570> an<00:00:54.780> information<00:00:55.050> back

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the cloud so it has an information back

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
the cloud so it has an information back
and<00:00:55.470> forth<00:00:55.650> it's<00:00:56.550> very<00:00:56.640> easy<00:00:56.880> to<00:00:57.030> use<00:00:57.090> big

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and forth it's very easy to use big

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.100 
and forth it's very easy to use big
buttons<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.790> yeah<00:00:59.790> so<00:01:00.090> we'll<00:01:00.630> get<00:01:00.720> to<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.020> so

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
to work with your antivirus so it's not

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
seconds now we can see it's not give us

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.460 
seconds now we can see it's not give us
our<00:03:34.620> average<00:03:34.950> time<00:03:35.220> scan<00:03:35.910> files<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.660> even

our average time scan files and even

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.920 
our average time scan files and even
scan<00:03:37.859> processes<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.389> I<00:03:39.480> said<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
scan processes so like I said it's a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.830 
scan processes so like I said it's a
pretty<00:03:40.109> fast<00:03:40.379> scanner<00:03:41.599> obviously<00:03:42.599> this<00:03:42.720> is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
pretty fast scanner obviously this is

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.659 
pretty fast scanner obviously this is
not<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:43.019> replacement<00:03:43.440> for<00:03:43.799> your<00:03:44.400> antivirus
