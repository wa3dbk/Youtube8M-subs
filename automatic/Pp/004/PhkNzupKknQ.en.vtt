00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:10.980
 if I remember correctly it was in 2000 2006 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.620
 2007 with the mini gp of 56 points that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.100
 he was also in karting when he wanted 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.100
 with the 50 promo and lessons are coming 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.350
 and my dream is to become the champion 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.279
 of the world 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.160
 like the last salory 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.840
 also be world champion and be able to 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.840
 devote to this which is what I like 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.850
 well I have improved a bit a little 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.470
 better than 2011 but well I still 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.680
 I need to let go, so I improved it 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.650
 and good where I realize that where 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.070
 you learn more in the payment that deceives us 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.070
 life better 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.909
 If you follow good grace client 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.000
 throughout the box and that has 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.759
 changed and good out outside more or less 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 same when two mature years pass and what 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.350
 the main thing that has changed 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.370
 good is is a basis that good that 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.790
 you learn a lot and good thanks to 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.070
 can be learn 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.590
 you can get some experience and 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.660
 well the team taught me a lot of things 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.850
 I did not know since then like 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.940
 compete in the best national championship 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.860
 well as it has been shown that there is 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.870
 many that happened here and now are 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.420
 champions of a world of motogp then 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.170
 well I think it's the best leap for 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.170
 stop global 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.640
 was to achieve the championship in 2011 in the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.190
 last race of sherry with Ã¡lex marquez 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.160
 that it was a very busy race I enjoyed 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.280
 a little more because there was no pressure nor 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.550
 a little bit because he was running against yourself 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.260
 in 2011 not because in 2012 you were one 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.360
 there was already the pressure that you had to win 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.360
 and a little bit did not enjoy playing 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.760
 well what 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.650
 that go with head 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.019
 and always 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.569
 there are many crazy things that they enjoy 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.860
 now that when they are going to have fun 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.790
 true 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.790
 although this position 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.160
 and last year I was surprised that 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.350
 in the world they go from the first minute 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.300
 they all go to death and they do not keep 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.790
 nothing the rhythm that has to suffer the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.310
 world since the beginning and quickly that's not 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.620
 they have it and also in the world we 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.010
 is tempting you instead in the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.010
 cepsi 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.620
 well on one side he taught me a lot to 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.200
 to train me as a pilot and also as a 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.319
 person 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.470
 and good either you want or not thanks to this I have 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.810
 come a little more prepared to 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.690
 well I kinda experience the coges 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 in the cep also the level is very high and 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.430
 then you arrive at the world cup and that the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.140
 rhythm be a little different is already very 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.140
 similar and that's what you want 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.340
 man for the title I do not know because 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.290
 it's much harder but 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.030
 but alexis who has started very strong and 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.319
 I believe that some race is fighting 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:37.890
 for winning the championship because why not 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:39.959
 I have to win everything but you can do it 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.670
 some career being with them as 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.670
 a qatar then we're going to try 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.010
 When I arrived here I was very much 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.410
 good people who did a lot 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.270
 time that I did not see it so well then you're 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.520
 happy to come back from knowing and talking to 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.160
 them I like a little the people that 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.350
 know this is like a house like a 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.230
 family when they get to the world cup there 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.330
 less less friends is more everyone 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.570
 will win since it is a bit like a 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.570
 family
