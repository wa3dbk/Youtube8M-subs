00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.069
 it confines itself to the starting point of a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.049
 new life for the 195 students 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.910
 officer candidates in first year at 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.309
 the royal military school of brussels 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.410
 they spent six intensive weeks there 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.960
 during their pine the fim and the phase 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.180
 military initiation it allows 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.949
 the integration of young recruits so 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.130
 Officer cadets in the middle 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.980
 military as well inside a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.750
 barracks than on the ground than actually 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.590
 pee and must be able like I 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.500
 tell him to master the basics 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.040
 that is to say, to be able to use a weapon 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.559
 shoot with the handle correctly and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.489
 especially in a safe way must be 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.600
 able to focus on the other to read 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.270
 read a map determine their 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 service ability to choose a route 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 go from point a to point b to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910
 control the compass so so everything 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.770
 who is reading cards 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.629
 in addition to the tactical aspect the students 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.250
 son also the drill course of 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.769
 first aid and settlement for 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.939
 perfect their military knowledge 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.479
 a good physical condition is 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.159
 necessary 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.200
 that's why he's playing sports 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.119
 several times a week but this 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.130
 particular pace of life is not done 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.720
 without difficulty or without concession 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.220
 knowing that the most difficult is at 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.439
 early to adapt to the military view 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.000
 especially then the fact that we have not 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.000
 a lot of sleep that is tiring 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.300
 so of course the frame puts us the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.160
 pressure to see how we are going 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.930
 react under stress what is 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.060
 very important during missions for 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
 not psychologically cracked 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.410
 so in this case luckily we have 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.820
 a refocused group goes beyond all alone 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.610
 we will not get there it's really 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.180
 combining our forces that our difficulties 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.729
 we manage to overcome each test 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.320
 at the start you have to take them by 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.670
 hand to really show them everything and 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.929
 offering measure it becomes more and 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.650
 more autonomous and we see that they 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.530
 continuously evolving constantly 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.830
 in the end he took the same level Sakhir 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.380
 that those who have already made in the name be 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.090
 there mummy fathers the spirit of 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.310
 student cohesion and perseverance 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.670
 candidate officers have therefore worn their 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.260
 fruits 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.390
 they have now acquired a baggage 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.560
 sufficient military resources to continue 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.660
 their training at the royal school 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.050
 military and discover new 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.050
 backgrounds
