leather loop the black color still look
take<00:02:09.260> a<00:02:09.290> look<00:02:09.440> at<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.770> sides<00:02:10.190> here<00:02:11.350> it's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
take a look at the sides here it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.050 
take a look at the sides here it's
pretty<00:02:14.350> fits<00:02:15.350> pretty<00:02:15.530> well<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.810> side<00:02:18.050> as<00:02:18.230> well

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
pretty fits pretty well the side as well

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
pretty good yeah let's see how the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.890 
pretty good yeah let's see how the
magnet<00:02:32.960> is<00:02:37.600> let's<00:02:38.600> try<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.050> put<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.380> on<00:02:39.560> it's

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
magnet is let's try and put this on it's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:49.800 
magnet is let's try and put this on it's
pretty<00:02:41.900> difficult<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.590> trial

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.070 

all<00:02:50.410> right<00:02:50.590> hmm<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:52.000> pretty<00:02:52.390> difficult<00:02:52.660> to

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
all right hmm it's pretty difficult to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.930 
all right hmm it's pretty difficult to
try<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.319> loop<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.950> I'm<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:54.370> sure<00:02:54.520> about<00:02:54.700> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
try to loop this I'm not sure about the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.280 
try to loop this I'm not sure about the
real<00:02:55.590> loop<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:57.220> yeah<00:02:58.030> once<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:59.080> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
real loop but yeah once you have the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.770 
real loop but yeah once you have the
loop<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.830> alright<00:03:00.819> just<00:03:01.330> put<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.630> there

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
loop in alright just put it on and there

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.280 
loop in alright just put it on and there
you<00:03:04.810> go<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:07.660> pretty<00:03:07.959> tight

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.690 

the<00:03:11.290> leather<00:03:11.530> don't<00:03:12.069> really<00:03:12.430> feel<00:03:12.640> like

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
the leather don't really feel like

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.120 
the leather don't really feel like
leather<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:14.500> feels<00:03:14.739> like<00:03:15.040> some<00:03:16.030> synthetic

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
leather it feels like some synthetic

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.250 
leather it feels like some synthetic
fuse<00:03:18.130> plasticky<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.660> would<00:03:22.930> say<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
fuse plasticky but I would say the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.290 
fuse plasticky but I would say the
magnet<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:23.769> pretty<00:03:23.980> good<00:03:26.400> yeah<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:28.120> looks

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
magnet is pretty good yeah it looks

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.979 
magnet is pretty good yeah it looks
pretty<00:03:28.360> good<00:03:28.660> as<00:03:28.840> well<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:30.989> leather

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
loop is only 50 US dollars it's a pretty

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.740 
loop is only 50 US dollars it's a pretty
good<00:03:38.739> buy<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:38.950> would<00:03:39.190> say<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.730> will<00:03:40.390> provide<00:03:40.690> a
