00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.440
 everyone will soon have a warm season 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.870
 spring all this relationship is a day to rest 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.080
 although the application is very bad 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:19.920
 time and I lidok a moment when you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.350
 along with our phones and nothing in this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.519
 case to do in order to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.449
 return our phone 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.539
 life now I'll show it to all of them 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.750
 tell you how to live above the ring 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 such a machine do not pay some 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.850
 attention to the fact that the tide he already sees 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.879
 or everything happens exactly the same as 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.500
 modern devices and all of our 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.230
 the actions will be absolutely identical and so 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.860
 bathes naturally first 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 you need as quickly as possible to get it and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:00.170
 remove the battery memory card and sim card 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.170
 if you have this and 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.360
 typical mistake many try immediately 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.310
 turn it on put on charge 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.780
 start to worry just shot 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.570
 the way to the captured video is okay 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.600
 if your photo had time to dream 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.530
 she will be on the practices if you have time for her 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.590
 no longer put the first were either 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.869
 i.e. you have an iphone motorola 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 Still with not removing him with a battery and 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.990
 hair 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.700
 This class phones are usually with 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.500
 massive additional protection 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.820
 most importantly do not try to learn or constantly 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.250
 further action 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.670
 you are going to clean it yourself 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.300
 maybe did before or feel everything 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:57.740
 strength confidence make it open 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:02:00.729
 phone everything is as it should and flashing and with 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.140
 using the most ordinary toothbrush 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:09.440
 binder there from the nearest pharmacy all 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.150
 gently clear the display 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.610
 additionally, you can wipe the usual 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.060
 leave the phone you are already on 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.340
 some time so he sand and 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.610
 collect it with a high probability 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.850
 everyone was out of order and he earned again 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.090
 1 just the most common mistakes 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.480
 in no case can not immediately try 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.450
 telephone key on wet contacts 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.410
 short circuit and nothing good from 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.020
 of this 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.200
 also no need to dry the phone 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.600
 independently indiscriminately water at 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.610
 contact with metal contacts 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.920
 as we see there are very many of them 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.840
 form oxide film other flandr 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.030
 hotter 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.900
 even here iron is not used on 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.430
 non-ferrous metals likewise oxidize and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.210
 subsequently, over time, this oxide 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.430
 film destroy our contacts and 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:17.050
 leads no longer corrected for phone 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.620
 the consequences plus we should have taken 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.230
 purely 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.800
 Well, in actual natural conditions 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.580
 You understand such pure water and all that 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.630
 what was in the water will be on our board all 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.810
 these small fractions are sand and mind 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:40.530
 something else mixed with 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.530
 oxide film is no good 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.090
 what to do if you don't feel 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.000
 all confident do not know how you know neither 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.940
 even the phone needs as fast as possible 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.480
 do not need to take it to the service center 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.610
 dry 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.180
 in any case, you can not put the battery 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.010
 and put it called with a great grammy 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.090
 probabilities by such actions you 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.069
 put a calf me try again 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.519
 after the visit the service center 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.650
 usually all dinner will be done 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.519
 professionally high quality your phone 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.150
 us return the workers and so short mode 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.459
 if you have a phone about you have 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.580
 two ways or else it yourself with 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.610
 using some simple 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:31.660
 Screwdriver set tooth brushes and alcohol 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.310
 wipes you clean your phone itself 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.500
 worth either of you service thread types 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.120
 dry the phone to charge 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.580
 return the battery try to turn on 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:49.800
 it is not necessary in this xy only skimp on 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.800
