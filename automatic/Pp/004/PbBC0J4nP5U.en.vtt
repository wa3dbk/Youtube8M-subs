yellow so loading festival with the pink

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.870 
yellow so loading festival with the pink
you're<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:33.350> literally<00:02:33.740> dragging<00:02:34.610> your

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
you're just literally dragging your

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.480 
you're just literally dragging your
sponge<00:02:35.150> down<00:02:36.490> like<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> couple<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.300> times

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
sponge down like this a couple of times

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.730 
sponge down like this a couple of times
and<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.700> started<00:02:41.120> loading<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:42.110> first<00:02:42.410> part

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
and that started loading that first part

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.780 
and that started loading that first part
of<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.610> sponge<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.040> turn<00:02:46.370> your<00:02:46.490> sponge

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
of the sponge and you turn your sponge

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.330 
of the sponge and you turn your sponge
and<00:02:47.000> start<00:02:47.210> loading<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.630> with<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.140> yellow<00:02:48.380> so

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
and start loading it with the yellow so

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.100 
and start loading it with the yellow so
we're<00:02:49.550> gonna<00:02:49.640> start<00:02:50.000> off<00:02:50.210> with<00:02:53.110> diagonal

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
we're gonna start off with diagonal

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.910 
we're gonna start off with diagonal
angle<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.520> this<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:56.090> kind<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.420> like<00:02:56.920> then

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
angle like this it's kind of like then

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.880 
angle like this it's kind of like then
I'm<00:02:58.220> with<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.550> we<00:02:58.700> need<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.880> dabbing<00:02:59.240> motion

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.030 

stop<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.700> say<00:03:06.790> turn<00:03:07.790> your<00:03:08.000> sponge<00:03:08.390> over

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
stop that like say turn your sponge over

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.140 
stop that like say turn your sponge over
if<00:03:10.040> we<00:03:10.160> do<00:03:10.280> another<00:03:10.490> wing<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:10.970> another

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
if we do another wing so it's another

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.020 
if we do another wing so it's another
diagonal<00:03:11.830> you're<00:03:12.830> going<00:03:13.070> inwards<00:03:13.700> that's

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
diagonal you're going inwards that's

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.540 
diagonal you're going inwards that's
fine<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.680> just<00:03:15.950> literally<00:03:16.850> round<00:03:17.270> it<00:03:17.540> off

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
fine and just literally round it off

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.150 
fine and just literally round it off
you're<00:03:19.550> going<00:03:19.790> diagonal<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.930> horizontal<00:03:21.890> like

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
you're going diagonal to horizontal like

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400 
you're going diagonal to horizontal like
that<00:03:22.400> obviously<00:03:23.330> probably<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.290> it

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
that obviously probably to you it

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.620 
that obviously probably to you it
doesn't<00:03:24.620> look<00:03:24.800> just<00:03:25.040> like<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.250> blog<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.000> but

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
doesn't look just like a blog and but

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.150 
doesn't look just like a blog and but
once<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.900> get<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.140> outlining<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.010> go

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
once you get the outlining on the go

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.920 
once you get the outlining on the go
we're<00:03:29.000> good<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.330> go<00:03:29.360> there<00:03:29.480> when<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.780> first

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
we're good to go there when you first

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.500 
we're good to go there when you first
start<00:03:30.290> it's<00:03:30.710> all<00:03:30.860> about<00:03:31.040> pressure<00:03:31.340> as<00:03:31.700> well<00:03:31.970> so

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
start it's all about pressure as well so

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.850 
start it's all about pressure as well so
I'm<00:03:32.570> gonna<00:03:32.660> start<00:03:32.930> off<00:03:33.020> down<00:03:33.290> here<00:03:33.320> starting

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
I'm gonna start off down here starting

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.610 
I'm gonna start off down here starting
left<00:03:34.010> handed<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.520> might<00:03:34.700> don't<00:03:34.820> see<00:03:35.030> but

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
left handed you might don't see but

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.910 
left handed you might don't see but
straight<00:03:36.620> line<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:38.060> kind<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.480> pressure

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
straight line and it's kind of pressure

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.440 
straight line and it's kind of pressure
and<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:40.790> slip<00:03:45.460> these<00:03:46.460> are<00:03:46.640> just<00:03:46.760> little<00:03:47.000> amounts

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
and a slip these are just little amounts

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.790 
we've just got this area covered this
one<00:05:42.300> needs<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.630> be<00:05:42.840> yellow<00:05:43.169> so<00:05:43.350> just<00:05:43.560> take<00:05:43.770> that

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
one needs to be yellow so just take that

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.890 
one needs to be yellow so just take that
part<00:05:44.220> of<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.430> sponge<00:05:44.640> reload<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.660> color

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
part of the sponge reload it and color

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.560 
part of the sponge reload it and color
it<00:05:46.080> in<00:05:46.220> okay<00:05:47.220> so<00:05:47.280> this<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.850> as<00:05:48.030> far<00:05:48.210> as<00:05:48.360> the

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
it in okay so this is as far as the

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.180 
it in okay so this is as far as the
double<00:05:48.870> loading<00:05:49.200> at<00:05:49.350> stage<00:05:49.590> goes<00:05:49.919> obviously

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
double loading at stage goes obviously

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.890 
double loading at stage goes obviously
there's<00:05:50.580> a<00:05:50.610> bit<00:05:50.730> of<00:05:50.760> white<00:05:51.090> out<00:05:51.120> there<00:05:51.660> I<00:05:51.690> will

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
there's a bit of white out there I will

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.210 
there's a bit of white out there I will
do<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.140> whole<00:05:52.169> design<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.650> won't<00:05:52.890> just<00:05:53.040> leave

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
do the whole design I won't just leave

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.850 
do the whole design I won't just leave
you<00:05:53.400> left<00:05:54.240> wondering<00:05:55.230> what's<00:05:55.410> next

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
you left wondering what's next

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.530 
you left wondering what's next
it<00:05:56.010> was<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.250> same<00:05:56.490> we're<00:05:56.880> gonna<00:05:57.000> go<00:05:57.210> in<00:05:57.330> at<00:05:57.450> an

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
it was the same we're gonna go in at an

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.380 
it was the same we're gonna go in at an
angle<00:05:58.040> so<00:05:59.040> it's<00:05:59.160> kind<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.430> out<00:05:59.669> that's<00:06:00.000> out

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
angle so it's kind of out that's out

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.920 
angle so it's kind of out that's out
that<00:06:00.750> side<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.490> dabbing<00:06:02.490> motion<00:06:03.090> again<00:06:03.419> like

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
that side a dabbing motion again like

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.070 
that side a dabbing motion again like
this<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:05.250> bringing<00:06:05.880> it<00:06:06.000> round<00:06:06.240> it's<00:06:06.720> bit<00:06:06.900> like

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
this and bringing it round it's bit like

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.580 
this and bringing it round it's bit like
a<00:06:07.110> triangle<00:06:07.470> like<00:06:08.510> that<00:06:09.510> and<00:06:09.930> if<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.140> can<00:06:10.380> get

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
a triangle like that and if you can get

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.310 
a triangle like that and if you can get
them<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.830> close<00:06:11.010> their<00:06:11.070> eyes<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:12.169> do<00:06:13.169> the

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
them to close their eyes and do the

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.409 
them to close their eyes and do the
eyelid<00:06:13.710> as<00:06:13.860> well<00:06:15.050> just<00:06:16.050> to<00:06:16.200> fill<00:06:16.410> it<00:06:16.500> in

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
eyelid as well just to fill it in

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.179 
eyelid as well just to fill it in
so<00:06:17.930> as<00:06:18.020> you<00:06:18.169> can<00:06:18.289> see<00:06:18.469> I've<00:06:18.740> done<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:19.069> other

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:19.189 
so as you can see I've done the other

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:21.219 
so as you can see I've done the other
side<00:06:19.280> it's<00:06:19.699> just<00:06:19.819> the<00:06:20.150> opposite<00:06:20.539> angle<00:06:20.689> going

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
side it's just the opposite angle going

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.570 
side it's just the opposite angle going
in<00:06:21.349> there<00:06:21.530> we're<00:06:21.680> going<00:06:21.800> to<00:06:21.889> do<00:06:22.009> the<00:06:22.129> muzzle

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
in there we're going to do the muzzle

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:30.850 
in there we're going to do the muzzle
bit<00:06:22.939> now<00:06:29.020> all<00:06:30.020> right<00:06:30.229> we're<00:06:30.379> going<00:06:30.530> to<00:06:30.560> move<00:06:30.710> on

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
bit now all right we're going to move on

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:55.250 
bit now all right we're going to move on
with<00:06:30.979> a<00:06:31.039> design<00:06:31.400> with<00:06:31.610> some<00:06:31.789> line<00:06:32.060> work

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.130 

so<00:06:55.980> as<00:06:56.280> you<00:06:56.550> can<00:06:56.730> see<00:06:56.970> the<00:06:57.300> line<00:06:57.570> work<00:06:57.810> really

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140 
so as you can see the line work really

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.990 
so as you can see the line work really
makes<00:06:58.410> it<00:06:58.560> pop<00:06:58.620> and<00:06:59.070> all<00:06:59.250> the<00:06:59.430> colors<00:06:59.700> just

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
makes it pop and all the colors just

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.150 
makes it pop and all the colors just
blend<00:07:00.210> together<00:07:00.420> and<00:07:01.170> that's<00:07:01.860> your<00:07:02.010> basic

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
blend together and that's your basic
