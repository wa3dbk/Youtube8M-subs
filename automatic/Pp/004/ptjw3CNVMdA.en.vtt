00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.719
 we have to do is the mold to each 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.640
 melar the mold since we're going to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.940
 caramel with melted butter and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.559
 sugar this sugar I'm not waiting 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.969
 that melts with a little bit of time 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.969
 moving blond sugar 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.210
 the recipe chain a lot 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.700
 all good melt melt the 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.680
 butter like sugar until it 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.320
 make a little bit of candy too 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.730
 let's go up a little for the fire 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.710
 for what 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.900
 roughly about three minutes until 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 it is formed that today we are here with the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.700
 butter and then when I have my 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.650
 taste ready we are going to pour it on the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.810
 mold but always taking care of 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.730
 not burn us because candy burns and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.570
 forget that you're going to the bone 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:36.300
 burn and nothing for burns 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.150
 well I have tried and it is good 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.860
 often put your hand in a bag 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.750
 of flour or in a flour sachet 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.240
 so for example by chance it is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.729
 that more than good to have flour in the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.650
 gauze gets his hand there are ties but not a 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.470
 about five or ten minutes and 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.470
 blistering results no longer deformed 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.210
 with an egg button we have here 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.100
 our mold with butter 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.260
 melted and sugar a little bit 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:18.950
 melt caramelized then now 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.770
 let's go over now we're going to put the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.940
 Pineapples accommodates as you like 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.430
 you want it or not in a way 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.310
 pretty and neat 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.959
 as they are in the house of this 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.570
 you have to do it immediately they go out 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.000
 candy so that the pineapple can be 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.560
 hit the clear soul then I do not know 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.380
 then up for example suddenly you 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.270
 we can put a little more pineapple 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.130
 pineapple to the juice in rovérsio can that are 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.100
 the students the protesters do not 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.760
 can move forward and it is in the house well pain 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.350
 in my nicolás and then here for example 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.980
 I already brought a mold and now we have 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.870
 ready not and this one is a little bit more 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.670
 golden but good for reasons of 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.140
 time you can do it in your 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.010
 adorable house a little bit longer already 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.799
 according to the taste of here 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.170
 then here to prepare 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.610
 they leave it there to rest a little nile 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.829
 Agave a lot in molar because it bothers 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.730
 hot then now let's put 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.939
 butter 75 grams of butter that 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.260
 we're going to burn and it was here and 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.360
 just types 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.920
 that's where we did to but so that the 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.060
 apprentice beaten to the press we have to 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.890
 plug in pretty here we do the course 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.340
 He also told me that I do not remember between 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.340
 parts 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.280
 and we are going to fight 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.340
 and sugar and until we 're going to 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:54.040
 debate it until it is almost white and 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.040
 like fluffy it's not like neon 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.709
 what always always remember 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.500
 scrape the sides because down sometimes 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.870
 down in the tree the 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.470
 butter and this always beating 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.720
 beating well and mixing 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.260
 and this has to be said about five 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.260
 minutes approximately 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.980
 the quality of your mind the speed that 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:38.160

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.160
 220 hour per hour
