they're<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.860> easy<00:03:31.520> parts<00:03:31.880> of<00:03:32.000> show<00:03:32.150> but

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
they're the easy parts of show but

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.510 
they're the easy parts of show but
there's<00:03:32.690> plenty<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:32.959> technical<00:03:34.250> going
