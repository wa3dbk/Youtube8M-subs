is the new castle badge and this one has

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.169 
is the new castle badge and this one has
taken<00:00:11.099> me<00:00:11.190> sometimes<00:00:11.580> do<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:11.969> i<00:00:12.000> do<00:00:12.090> apologize

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
taken me sometimes do so i do apologize

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.330 
taken me sometimes do so i do apologize
for<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:13.410> i<00:00:13.469> wanted<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.889> get<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.070> as<00:00:14.160> close

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
for that but i wanted to get it as close

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.580 
for that but i wanted to get it as close
to<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.610> as<00:00:14.730> possible<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.299> as<00:00:15.480> hopefully<00:00:16.470> as

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
to it as possible and as hopefully as

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.230 
to it as possible and as hopefully as
accurate<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.310> that's<00:00:17.880> probably<00:00:17.970> why<00:00:18.210> I

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
accurate to it and that's probably why I

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.550 
accurate to it and that's probably why I
took<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.480> bit<00:00:18.630> more<00:00:18.750> time<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.380> start

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
took a bit more time but we do start

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
took a bit more time but we do start
with<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.800> layer<00:00:19.949> 5<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.630> that's<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:21.810> going

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
with the layer 5 and that's we're going

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.029 
with the layer 5 and that's we're going
to<00:00:21.990> start<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.260> shield<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.680> I'm<00:00:22.740> gonna<00:00:22.890> go

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
to start with a shield and I'm gonna go

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.320 
to start with a shield and I'm gonna go
at<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> rounded<00:00:23.460> squared<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.880> I'll<00:00:23.970> cover<00:00:24.150> up

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
at the rounded squared so I'll cover up

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.519 
at the rounded squared so I'll cover up
that<00:00:24.449> briefcase<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.080> middle<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that briefcase in the middle which is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.890 
that briefcase in the middle which is
foremost<00:00:25.890> bombs<00:00:26.189> detonate<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:26.880> I'm<00:00:27.689> not

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
foremost bombs detonate I think I'm not

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.089

too<00:00:28.050> sure<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.380> by<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:28.890> something

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
too sure on that by now it's something

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
too sure on that by now it's something
to<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:29.429> bombs<00:00:30.060> detonating<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.779> planning

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
squad builder I went to continued it

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.420

again<00:01:39.840> has<00:01:40.320> been<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> long<00:01:40.890> time<00:01:41.189> since<00:01:41.220> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
again has been a long time since I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.859 
again has been a long time since I
actually<00:01:41.520> done<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> last<00:01:42.750> time

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
actually done that I think the last time

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.359 
actually done that I think the last time
I<00:01:42.990> did<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> argentinian<00:01:43.950> scored<00:01:44.189> so

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
I did that was the argentinian scored so
and<00:01:45.329> then<00:01:45.450> i<00:01:45.509> went<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> hybrids<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and then i went on to hybrids so a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.380 
and then i went on to hybrids so a
reasonable<00:01:47.549> squad<00:01:47.700> builder<00:01:47.939> should<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.210> out

cloning<00:02:14.890> them<00:02:14.980> over<00:02:15.310> as<00:02:15.489> I<00:02:15.819> normally<00:02:15.970> do<00:02:16.390> for

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
cloning them over as I normally do for

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.449 
cloning them over as I normally do for
writing<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.319> that's<00:02:17.950> probably<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.340> the

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
writing and that's probably one of the

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.040 
writing and that's probably one of the
best<00:02:18.700> recommendations<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.480> cloning<00:02:19.870> over

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
best recommendations for cloning over

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.320 
best recommendations for cloning over
when<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.290> when<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:20.830> writing<00:02:21.129> all<00:02:22.030> emblems

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
when you when you do writing all emblems

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.000 
when you when you do writing all emblems
just<00:02:22.840> close<00:02:23.019> them<00:02:23.170> over<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> simplest

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
just close them over it's the simplest

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.369 
just close them over it's the simplest
and<00:02:24.280> most<00:02:24.730> effective<00:02:25.000> way<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.510> keeping<00:02:26.140> around

revert<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:54.880> just<00:02:55.150> going<00:02:55.299> playing<00:02:55.569> games<00:02:55.810> to

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
revert to just going playing games to

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.080 
revert to just going playing games to
get<00:02:56.049> their<00:02:56.200> coins<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.709> just<00:02:56.970> figure<00:02:57.970> out

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
get their coins but I just figure out

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.819 
get their coins but I just figure out
different<00:02:58.209> players<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.900> new<00:02:59.019> sort<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.590> things

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
different players and new sort of things

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.559 
different players and new sort of things
and<00:03:00.069> they<00:03:00.430> try<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.849> go<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.239> trade

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
and they try to go with that and trade

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.119 
and they try to go with that and trade
so<00:03:02.049> as<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.170> can<00:03:02.290> see<00:03:02.410> here<00:03:02.590> going<00:03:02.769> back<00:03:03.010> and

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
so as you can see here going back and

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.440 
so as you can see here going back and
use<00:03:03.250> those<00:03:03.400> early<00:03:03.610> layers<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.180> I'm<00:03:04.269> going<00:03:04.390> to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
use those early layers and I'm going to

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.449 
use those early layers and I'm going to
go<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.720> use<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.019> lamp<00:03:05.230> shade<00:03:05.440> here<00:03:05.650> after

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
go and use the lamp shade here after

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.280 
go and use the lamp shade here after
going<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.819> putting<00:03:07.510> one<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.840> those<00:03:07.930> blocks

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
going and putting one of those blocks

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.380 
going and putting one of those blocks
over<00:03:08.500> there<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.769> think<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.120> capturing<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> a

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
over there I think it's capturing the a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.050 
over there I think it's capturing the a
point<00:03:10.720> in<00:03:10.900> domination<00:03:11.680> by<00:03:12.519> going<00:03:12.730> at<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:12.910> lamp

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
point in domination by going at the lamp

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.670 
point in domination by going at the lamp
shade<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.720> put<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:13.989> there<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.200> sort<00:03:14.349> of<00:03:14.440> act

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
shade and I put it there to sort of act

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.970 
shade and I put it there to sort of act
as<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.129> bit<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.090> middle<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.420> emblem

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
as the bit in the middle of the emblem

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.009 
as the bit in the middle of the emblem
then<00:03:17.980> go<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.220> get<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:19.329> layer<00:03:19.569> to<00:03:19.840> which

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
then go and get this this layer to which

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.990 
then go and get this this layer to which
I<00:03:20.109> have<00:03:20.260> no<00:03:20.440> idea<00:03:20.620> what<00:03:20.739> it's<00:03:20.769> called<00:03:21.040> all<00:03:21.819> I<00:03:21.850> do

with a cross in it so I'm going to get a

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.670 
with a cross in it so I'm going to get a
rounded<00:03:53.680> square<00:03:53.769> make<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.400> light<00:03:54.669> blue<00:03:54.880> and

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.280 
make it the same color so as the banner
on<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.060> bomb<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:58.510> think<00:03:58.690> it's<00:03:58.810> optional<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.200> you

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
on the bomb I think it's optional to you

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.930 
on the bomb I think it's optional to you
guys<00:03:59.410> if<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.769> want<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.280> make<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.579> same

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
guys if you want to make it the same

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.190 
guys if you want to make it the same
color<00:04:01.239> or<00:04:01.419> you<00:04:01.510> can<00:04:01.630> just<00:04:01.690> play<00:04:01.900> around<00:04:01.959> with<00:04:02.169> a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
color or you can just play around with a

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.839 
color or you can just play around with a
coloring<00:04:02.530> system<00:04:02.769> slightly<00:04:03.069> then<00:04:03.579> go<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.760> get

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
coloring system slightly then go and get

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.370 
coloring system slightly then go and get
the<00:04:03.970> red<00:04:04.150> make<00:04:04.480> sure<00:04:04.569> it's<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.750> same<00:04:04.780> red<00:04:05.169> and

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
the red make sure it's the same red and

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.670 
the red make sure it's the same red and
then<00:04:05.500> clone<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.400> over<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:07.470> give<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.560> that

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
then clone it over and give you that

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.440 
then clone it over and give you that
cross<00:04:08.919> at<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.160> top<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.609> then<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.389> the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
cross at the top and then this is the

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.629 
cross at the top and then this is the
bit<00:04:10.630> where<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.810> said<00:04:11.019> before<00:04:11.400> you'll<00:04:12.400> need<00:04:12.549> the

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
bit where I said before you'll need the

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.000 
bit where I said before you'll need the
attack<00:04:12.940> dogs<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.359> this<00:04:14.349> way<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.530> had<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:14.829> sort

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
attack dogs and this way I had to sort

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.699 
attack dogs and this way I had to sort
