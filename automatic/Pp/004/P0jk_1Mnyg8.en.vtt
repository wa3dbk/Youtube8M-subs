00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 to make this game up on a normal 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.029
 deck of cards 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.890
 I run through the papers , I take them 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.480
 one freely we put that this 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.610
 card chose from the 3d viewer 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.799
 wants respected regards the card to 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.420
 remember it's the food in the bunch 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.820
 at this point they must check the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.410
 card take it from the center of the bat to the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.810
 top of the bunch the control you use 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.250
 this is a mixture of Indian 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.960
 students in auction this way 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.359
 I would find it better explained later 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.030
 separately the card is put in 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.100
 deck and the risk so bound from above 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 I drop some papers 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.149
 I drop the whole bunch and the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.059
 mazzetti no that holds the card comes 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.590
 capacity at the top of the chest 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.579
 of the spectator a pole observer 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.940
 tempers if in the deck 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.219
 I go over with my right hand holding 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 the bunch of the right hand between the middle 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.210
 and thumbs from the left hand holds the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.160
 deck of cards in the service position 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.730
 index above 3 say on the side along the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.430
 thumb at this point I go and take away 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.450
 immediately the bunch below making it between 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.360
 thumb and ring finger and shuffle the cards 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.490
 leaving to have bunches of the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.680
 upper part mixed risk to a certain 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 point I drop everything so I leave 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.820
 the grip I drop all I take 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.430
 this and brings it to the top 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.920
 in this way controlled the paper from the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.570
 spa or at the top of the bunch who 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.060
 after an idea on another way a lot 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.560
 simple to check the chosen calm 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.520
 so hearts are put in the bunch 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.850
 in this case I cover when I leave 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.310
 a little finger that separates the deck then 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.640
 called break it creates a break then 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 I cover this movement that david 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.789
 aggregates are actually divided there is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.920
 always the break and then support the cards 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:52.439
 on the table 123 in this way the paper 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.750
 now it's on top I'll do this again 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:00.869
 control watch the card remembers the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:03.360
 put from the deck and I the new 1 2 and 3 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.729
 we managed to get the card on top 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.319
 to the deck the 3d hearts and I say that I believe 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.000
 that the card yes where somewhere of 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.830
 mass and that I will be able to make it try from 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.010
 spectator of miss top and the spectator 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 I stop anywhere and we have a 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.480
 8 of pique that clearly is not a boy 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.069
 any card could come out 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.110
 jacko you could get out of any 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.940
 other card in this case we have lot 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.160
 look at the card this is the card that 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.040
 I chose to put but I show the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.260
 gatta creates a break but from what may us 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.750
 place the garda and put it back in the deck 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.030
 inserting a portion of the little finger ve 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.500
 arranged the card or even help me with 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.190
 the right hand and a little black spot 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.590
 put it there are some portions of meat 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.690
 that divides it from the remaining cards 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.790
 so this card is break break 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.970
 codominio is your year card 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.880
 when it is said by opening the card 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.920
 near the deck and aim at the far from 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.350
 deck in this case I took two cards 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.840
 as if they were one with the thumb and the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.700
 average time to review a network of 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.650
 this card will be a double 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.310
 paper soon we will have the transformation 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.130
 from 8 to 3 with this movement but 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.210
 see you again then I take 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.780
 a card that is not that of 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.180
 spectator and break the card la 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.240
 card chosen that the 3 resume the card 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.540
 the support above randomly and aim 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.060
 move away from the deck so keeping thumb 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.580
 and average the paper in this way 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.060
 slightly bent this way 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.080
 card remains remain well satisfied 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.600
 this is the situation 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.320
 now I move the hand while the new one 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.060
 hand I with the index touch the burgundy and 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.290
 what will happen now 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.989
 in doing so 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.400
 difficult to make it normal speed evening 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.870
 that the black signs turned into this 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.909
 so I repeat the paper I learn and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.439
 looks good to correct your card 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.799
 turns this point has a double 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:03.650
 card back support randomly la 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.319
 card above I take one this time 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.720
 paper then lot will stay here in March 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.170
 for a single leg and throws it on 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.299
 table and we have the transformation of 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.639
 I do it again once more 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.970
 we have the card looking at the top we have 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.870
 lotto is put into the deck and I take the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.289
 hand double the new card and while the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.169
 moving hand I turn it around like this 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:35.030
 the index will hold and I miss the indexes 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:38.710
 leaning over I get close again I leave e 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.710
 the game is over
