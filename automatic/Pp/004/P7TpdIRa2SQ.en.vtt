okay<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:11.570> next<00:00:11.690> thing<00:00:11.900> I<00:00:12.049> will<00:00:12.350> talk<00:00:12.590> about<00:00:12.740> is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
okay the next thing I will talk about is

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.129 
okay the next thing I will talk about is
a<00:00:13.370> problem<00:00:14.150> that<00:00:14.240> many<00:00:14.300> people<00:00:14.480> face<00:00:14.900> when

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
a problem that many people face when

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.450 
a problem that many people face when
they're<00:00:15.230> doing<00:00:15.410> they're<00:00:15.679> at<00:00:15.800> their<00:00:15.980> attacks

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
they're doing they're at their attacks

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.640 
they're doing they're at their attacks
with<00:00:16.610> the<00:00:16.670> hands<00:00:16.939> is<00:00:17.119> if<00:00:17.930> you<00:00:18.110> do<00:00:18.259> it<00:00:18.290> to<00:00:18.470> on<00:00:18.619> a

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
with the hands is if you do it to on a

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.050 
with the hands is if you do it to on a
straight<00:00:18.920> line<00:00:18.950> it's<00:00:19.250> very<00:00:19.460> easy<00:00:19.670> for<00:00:19.790> my

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
straight line it's very easy for my

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.940 
straight line it's very easy for my
opponent<00:00:20.450> to<00:00:20.540> can't<00:00:21.110> a<00:00:21.200> psychic<00:00:21.529> for<00:00:21.649> example

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
opponent to can't a psychic for example

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.550 
opponent to can't a psychic for example
so<00:00:22.040> if<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:22.250> was<00:00:22.399> going<00:00:22.550> to<00:00:22.610> go<00:00:22.730> here<00:00:22.989> it's<00:00:23.989> too

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
so if I was going to go here it's too

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.839 
so if I was going to go here it's too
easy<00:00:24.590> to<00:00:24.829> read<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:25.310> of<00:00:25.399> course<00:00:25.579> I'm<00:00:25.730> on<00:00:25.820> a

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
easy to read and of course I'm on a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.819 
easy to read and of course I'm on a
straight<00:00:26.119> line<00:00:26.149> I'm<00:00:26.840> gonna<00:00:27.020> eat<00:00:27.259> that<00:00:27.410> psychic

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
straight line I'm gonna eat that psychic

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.589 
straight line I'm gonna eat that psychic
all<00:00:27.980> day<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:28.160> what<00:00:28.399> I<00:00:28.430> need<00:00:28.550> to<00:00:28.759> do<00:00:28.910> is<00:00:29.059> find<00:00:29.480> a

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
all day so what I need to do is find a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.049 
all day so what I need to do is find a
way<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.840> bypassing<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.439> technique<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.160> also

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
way of bypassing that technique and also

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.580 
way of bypassing that technique and also
maybe<00:00:32.360> changing<00:00:32.780> an<00:00:32.870> angle<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.260> keep<00:00:33.410> my

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
maybe changing an angle to keep my

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.139 
maybe changing an angle to keep my
opponent<00:00:33.980> guessing<00:00:34.309> from<00:00:34.430> when<00:00:34.760> I'm<00:00:34.910> going<00:00:35.090> to

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
opponent guessing from when I'm going to

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.819 
opponent guessing from when I'm going to
attack<00:00:35.390> them<00:00:35.510> from<00:00:35.660> which<00:00:35.870> direction<00:00:36.079> so

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
attack them from which direction so

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:50.160 
attack them from which direction so
they're<00:00:36.980> always<00:00:37.160> playing<00:00:37.489> catch-up

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.450 

what<00:00:51.170> I'm<00:00:51.260> gonna<00:00:51.410> talk<00:00:51.590> about<00:00:51.620> is<00:00:51.949> how<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.160> move

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
what I'm gonna talk about is how to move

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.100 
what I'm gonna talk about is how to move
to<00:00:52.760> either<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.270> back<00:00:53.420> side<00:00:53.660> or<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.870> chest

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
to either the back side or the chest

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.569 
to either the back side or the chest
side<00:00:54.320> doesn't<00:00:54.739> matter<00:00:54.949> which<00:00:55.129> stance<00:00:55.399> you're

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
side doesn't matter which stance you're

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.790 
side doesn't matter which stance you're
in<00:00:55.670> because<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:56.030> can<00:00:56.149> do<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.300> either<00:00:56.420> way<00:00:56.800> so

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
in because you can do it either way so

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.959 
in because you can do it either way so
if<00:00:57.890> I'm<00:00:58.040> here<00:00:58.219> with<00:00:58.309> my<00:00:58.460> opponent<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:58.879> we

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
if I'm here with my opponent and we

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.819 
if I'm here with my opponent and we
squared<00:00:59.269> off<00:00:59.390> the<00:01:00.079> first<00:01:00.320> thing<00:01:00.469> that<00:01:00.589> I<00:01:00.649> want

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
squared off the first thing that I want

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.200 
squared off the first thing that I want
to<00:01:00.890> do<00:01:00.980> is<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.219> change<00:01:01.399> my<00:01:01.610> angle<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.120> way

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
to do is to change my angle and the way

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.999 
to do is to change my angle and the way
that<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.449> do<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.839> is<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.140> move<00:01:03.290> my<00:01:03.530> back<00:01:03.800> foot

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
that I do that is to move my back foot

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.320 
that I do that is to move my back foot
the<00:01:04.309> reason<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:04.610> move<00:01:04.729> my<00:01:04.850> back<00:01:05.030> foot<00:01:05.239> is

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
the reason I move my back foot is

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.790 
the reason I move my back foot is
because<00:01:05.600> it's<00:01:05.750> furthest<00:01:06.229> away<00:01:06.380> from<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.680> eye

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
because it's furthest away from the eye

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.249 
because it's furthest away from the eye
line<00:01:07.130> if<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:07.610> move<00:01:07.790> my<00:01:07.820> front<00:01:08.240> foot<00:01:08.330> my<00:01:08.840> opponent

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
line if I move my front foot my opponent

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.139 
line if I move my front foot my opponent
can<00:01:09.380> see<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.710> my<00:01:09.830> body<00:01:09.950> moose<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.640> it's<00:01:10.970> very

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
can see that my body moose and it's very

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.810 
can see that my body moose and it's very
clear<00:01:11.540> that<00:01:11.840> I'm<00:01:12.530> moving<00:01:12.740> off<00:01:13.100> line<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:13.550> he<00:01:13.670> can

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
clear that I'm moving off line so he can

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.950 
clear that I'm moving off line so he can
react<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.240> very<00:01:14.450> quickly

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
react to that very quickly

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.320 
react to that very quickly
whereas<00:01:15.530> if<00:01:15.649> I<00:01:15.740> move<00:01:15.890> my<00:01:15.920> back<00:01:16.280> foot<00:01:16.580> it's<00:01:17.210> a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
whereas if I move my back foot it's a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.270 
whereas if I move my back foot it's a
little<00:01:17.570> bit<00:01:17.690> more<00:01:17.840> subtle<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.830> movement

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
little bit more subtle and the movement

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.820 
little bit more subtle and the movement
is<00:01:19.700> less<00:01:20.000> easy<00:01:20.720> for<00:01:21.020> this<00:01:21.110> guy<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.380> see<00:01:21.649> when

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
is less easy for this guy to see when

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.830 
is less easy for this guy to see when
I'm<00:01:21.920> doing<00:01:22.160> my<00:01:22.190> movement<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:22.729> definitely<00:01:23.660> move

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
I'm doing my movement so definitely move

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.719 
I'm doing my movement so definitely move
my<00:01:23.960> back<00:01:24.140> foot<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:25.130> second<00:01:25.460> thing<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.610> you

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
my back foot the second thing that you

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.040 
my back foot the second thing that you
want<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.910> concentrate<00:01:26.179> on<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.810> draw<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
want to concentrate on is to draw the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.930 
want to concentrate on is to draw the
eye<00:01:27.170> away<00:01:27.289> even<00:01:28.039> further<00:01:28.280> from<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.640> back<00:01:28.789> foot

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
eye away even further from the back foot

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.180 
eye away even further from the back foot
by<00:01:29.060> using<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.479> lead<00:01:29.630> hand<00:01:29.929> so<00:01:30.710> when<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:30.950> move

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
by using the lead hand so when I move

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.350 
by using the lead hand so when I move
that<00:01:31.340> back<00:01:31.490> foot<00:01:31.670> at<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.880> same<00:01:31.940> time

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
that back foot at the same time

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.230 
that back foot at the same time
simultaneously<00:01:32.539> I<00:01:33.080> will<00:01:33.259> do<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:35.030> would

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
simultaneously I will do this this would

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.029 
simultaneously I will do this this would
just<00:01:35.360> disguise<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.990> leg<00:01:36.140> movement<00:01:36.560> even<00:01:36.679> more

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
just disguise the leg movement even more

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.910 
just disguise the leg movement even more
wherever<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.460> go<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:37.789> way<00:01:38.409> or<00:01:39.409> this<00:01:39.470> way

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
wherever I go this way or this way

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.620 
wherever I go this way or this way
the<00:01:40.310> movement<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:40.729> exactly<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.240> same<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.600> just

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
the movement is exactly the same it just

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.870 
the movement is exactly the same it just
it<00:01:42.050> just<00:01:42.080> covers<00:01:42.440> them<00:01:42.679> a<00:01:42.740> little<00:01:42.979> bit<00:01:43.069> more<00:01:43.100> so

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
it just covers them a little bit more so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.540 
it just covers them a little bit more so
from<00:01:44.270> here<00:01:44.450> if<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.140> go<00:01:45.289> here<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.770> then<00:01:46.340> move<00:01:46.520> my

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
from here if I go here I then move my

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.609 
from here if I go here I then move my
front<00:01:46.909> foot<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.360> can<00:01:47.539> then<00:01:47.750> do<00:01:47.990> any<00:01:48.229> attack

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
on this side or if I go here I can do

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.710 
on this side or if I go here I can do
exactly<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.399> same<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:52.940> can<00:01:53.090> do<00:01:53.179> any<00:01:53.420> attack

exactly the same and I can do any attack
on<00:01:53.869> this<00:01:53.989> side<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:55.520> course<00:01:55.849> you<00:01:56.030> can<00:01:56.179> do<00:01:56.330> it

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
on this side of course you can do it

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.820 
on this side of course you can do it
just<00:01:56.599> dynamically<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.319> can<00:01:57.470> do<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> very

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
just dynamically and you can do a very

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.859 
just dynamically and you can do a very
quick<00:01:58.009> attack<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:58.640> if<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:59.330> know<00:01:59.539> that<00:01:59.720> the

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
quick attack so if you know that the

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.389 
quick attack so if you know that the
psychics<00:02:00.289> come<00:02:00.500> in<00:02:00.619> when<00:02:00.739> the<00:02:00.830> psychic<00:02:01.160> comes

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
psychics come in when the psychic comes

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.490 
psychics come in when the psychic comes
you<00:02:01.759> can<00:02:01.970> move<00:02:02.119> off<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.720> attack<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.319> way

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
you can move off and attack this way

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.499 
you can move off and attack this way
here<00:02:03.739> or<00:02:04.220> if<00:02:04.879> you<00:02:05.030> want<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.239> keep<00:02:05.420> your

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
here or if you want to keep your

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:06.669 
here or if you want to keep your
opponent<00:02:05.750> guessing<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.410> you<00:02:06.470> want<00:02:06.619> to

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
opponent guessing and you want to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:07.900 
opponent guessing and you want to
actually<00:02:06.800> do<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.160> with<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.369> rhythm<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.819> you

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
actually do it with the rhythm and you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.219 
actually do it with the rhythm and you
want<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> keep<00:02:08.539> them<00:02:08.720> for<00:02:08.810> playing<00:02:09.020> catch-up

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
want to keep them for playing catch-up

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.690 
want to keep them for playing catch-up
all<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> time<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:10.099> can<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.280> do<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.670> whole

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
all the time you can just do the whole

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:23.960 
all the time you can just do the whole
movement<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.330> I'll<00:02:11.390> demonstrate<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:11.930> now

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:35.350 

you

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.700 

okay<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.290> movement

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
okay so you can see the with movement

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.020 
okay so you can see the with movement
the<00:02:37.770> partner<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.280> always<00:02:38.550> playing<00:02:38.760> catch-up

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
the partner is always playing catch-up

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.640 
the partner is always playing catch-up
so<00:02:39.300> every<00:02:39.510> time<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.870> move<00:02:40.020> they<00:02:40.380> have<00:02:40.530> to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
so every time you move they have to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.520 
so every time you move they have to
adjust<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.670> they<00:02:41.850> adjust<00:02:42.350> that's<00:02:43.350> when

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
adjust and as they adjust that's when

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.390 
adjust and as they adjust that's when
you're<00:02:43.650> going<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.800> score<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.160> hit<00:02:44.310> your

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
you're going to score and hit your

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.640 
you're going to score and hit your
points<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.780> two<00:02:45.930> main<00:02:46.110> things<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.410> focus

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
points so the two main things to focus

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.380 
points so the two main things to focus
on<00:02:46.920> when<00:02:47.070> you're<00:02:47.160> doing<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:48.090> first

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
on when you're doing this the first

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.300 
on when you're doing this the first
thing<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.230> back<00:02:49.470> foot<00:02:49.710> that<00:02:49.830> moves<00:02:50.040> first

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
thing is the back foot that moves first

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.340 
thing is the back foot that moves first
is<00:02:50.580> furthest<00:02:50.970> away<00:02:51.090> from<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.420> eye<00:02:51.450> line<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
is furthest away from the eye line the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.830 
is furthest away from the eye line the
second<00:02:52.770> thing<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.430> use<00:02:53.520> your<00:02:53.760> hand<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.240> catch

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
second thing you use your hand to catch

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.870 
second thing you use your hand to catch
the<00:02:55.080> eye<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.740> take<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.040> even<00:02:56.160> further<00:02:56.310> away

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the eye to take it even further away

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.350 
the eye to take it even further away
from<00:02:56.910> from<00:02:57.630> seeing<00:02:57.870> your<00:02:57.990> leg<00:02:58.140> move
