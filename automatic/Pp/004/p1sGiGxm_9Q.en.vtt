00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.580
 Hello, I want to show you today 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.990
 makeup is not finished and 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.550
 tell me your opinion 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.950
 what is not if you are interested then 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.480
 stay with me here is such a package 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.800
 I have already met mainly here 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.820
 cosmetics l'oxitan 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.930
 and the first thing I show is oil for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.119
 almond soul 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 I like her very much I don’t know 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.539
 how much i use it and which these 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.369
 jars it is pleasant consistency 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.059
 the fragrance is a means to shower does not foam 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.670
 as an ordinary shower gel create such 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 very light foam and it does not wash with 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.870
 a washcloth in general is an oil to me very 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.000
 like there is a format 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.070
 flavoring synthesizers 500 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.950
 milliliters but there have been cases that the dispenser 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.760
 breaks down so I most often run here in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.399
 such formats 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 it’s easy to make epilation in the shower and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.320
 pleasant feeling remains after 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.750
 the use of such a lazy as if 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.359
 skin moisturizers already applied 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 from the same series I ended scrub 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.869
 in my mini versions it demanded 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.659
 formats I took 5 pieces to be replaced 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.600
 full of format because at that time in 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.549
 Russia would not have sold more 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.180
 information since l'oxitan no no 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.820
 coped with the production of this scrub 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.280
 in some countries it has ceased 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.080
 sell but in my opinion now he is already 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.509
 returned to the Russian market that is he 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.659
 then disappears then appears very cool 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.250
 scrub the same pleasant aroma fat 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.979
 after him the feeling of fatness 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.110
 it remains to me he really does not like 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.110
 Only two empty cans but 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.880
 There were 5 of them replacing the full-length 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.100
 version and even if buying in miniatures 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.619
 they are full of the format the price turns out so 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.579
 the same line of almonds is butter 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.909
 for body 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.009
 it also smells great but i'm more 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.860
 just love this line just for the flavor 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.590
 because if it were not for that smell 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.869
 i panel 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.799
 hardly used this line because 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.500
 what basically 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.220
 oil for the shower can be found some 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.620
 analogue 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.730
 body oil also happens a lot 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.550
 but the smell is just awesome here too 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.720
 grape seed oil as in oil 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.930
 for the soul almond oil and it is generally so 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.599
 cool smells really like here is 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.680
 I have finished karite oil 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.840
 certificate of eco sept so this 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.890
 completely organic oil i'm completely 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.220
 he used it so fat and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.880
 this format is enough for a very long time 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.480
 I had this jar two 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.430
 years although the total need to store 12 months 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.000
 but I was fine . 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.239
 there was no annoyance 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.200
 general not us this butter but if you don't 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.510
 use butter on the whole body of it 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.510
 the format will be too much because 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.220
 he spent very economically gave them 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.639
 not such a lip scrub 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.380
 he goes with a spatula spatula i 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:24.150
 put the jar and there were two phases 1 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:27.250
 john im sugar another with butter karite 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.209
 very pleasant feeling after that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.060
 scrub hands are so smooth and soft 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:39.459
 the truth is we have such a deceptive feeling 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:43.739
 that they are even smoother and softer on 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.780
 touch when you flush this oil 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.970
 precisely because the oil slides under 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.310
 water it seems that they are so smooth 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.470
 which is simply unreal then when you 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.470
 wipe your feet with a towel you feel 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.720
 that is not so cool 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.780
 Feels like hands are like silk but they 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.760
 good enough to peel and good 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.980
 hydrated very cool scrub and in 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.139
 with karite cream 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.120
 he is not unfortunately matched with this 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.599
 cream for 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.510
 corry ten it is generally just not that hands 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:20.989
 you have well-groomed wet saturated 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.460
 I ended the bath salt with a rose 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.100
 her advantage is 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:31.110
 smells so well, in principle, good salt 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.300
 It was such a spoon with which I 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.220
 unhappy see she was oxidized now 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.190
 she looks just like silver 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.100
 a spoon like the future once golden so 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.060
 she was in an ugly state and and 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.740
 cleaned 1 3 zen of the standard view 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.900
 very good salt great salt to me 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.550
 Liked the aroma and more pleasant when 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.220
 you add it and I will because 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:59.639
 It turns out such a very delicate smell and 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.120
 when you dip in the bath these are qualities 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.130
 like rose petals surrounds ti well 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.620
 very pleasant really smells 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.380
 roses from l'oxitan they did not end 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.289
 This is a means of aromatic 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.950
 spray that can be sprayed in the bedroom 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.229
 but in any room on the pillow on your 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.990
 linens 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.000
 but this is why this particular tool is 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.220
 I do not like this line by flavor 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.750
 all other means are simple 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.210
 they smell so nice 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.780
 tea tree oil mix aroma 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.510
 lavender and geraniums are my favorite mix and 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.889
 I love this line for its flavor 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.599
 but it is this remedy that is wrong 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.940
 smells good like other means 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.820
 aki because of this line of him remained 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.550
 pleasant smell only after i 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.580
 I spread it on the pillow and the fibers are leaving 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:01.199
 from the room and going through five to six 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.120
 o'clock i feel that the smell is nice but in 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.830
 that moment when i spray it 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.630
 i don't smell so nice 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.550
 like the rest of this line 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.600
 I ended up with such a cream from 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.950
 clarence 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.370
 such saturated nourishes the skin with 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.980
 karite oil for dry skin for winter 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.050
 this is an excellent tool he is fast 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.420
 consumed despite being so big 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:32.490
 the format here is 400 milliliters good 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:36.450
 moisturizes and nourishes the skin I liked and 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.820
 smell i like that smell 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.760
 just such a cream 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.500
 dense nutrient is very good 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.110
 the remedy ended with me here such 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.690
 glue for eyes from shu uemura like this 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.960
 i first thought that this 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.730
 the cream does nothing i mean i 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.430
 take advantage of and use nothing 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.140
 happens it does not moisturize the skin and i don't 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.020
 I see no effect from him but 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.010
 stopped using it and I started 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.110
 use another eye cream that 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.300
 have the worst condition of my skin apparently in 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.960
 He was not so much moisturizing 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.180
 substances and skin just became sushi i 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.360
 finished using that cream start 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.120
 enjoy it and he did not return something 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.170
 the condition that I had that is he 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.510
 moisturizes 

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:31.110
 he is not nutritious does not give any 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.980
 powerful effect and does not eliminate dark 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.870
 circles 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.480
 but it keeps in moist 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.940
 condition that your skin requires 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.910
 That's how it looks easy to do 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.760
 product for me was enough portion 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.200
 with a grain of rice in general i can 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.430
 say it is a very good cream for 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.680
 eyes and for the day and for the evening if you 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.290
 I need some kind of loss 

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.790
 No, I hope you were interested, thank you. 

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.650
 thank you very much for your attention 

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.650
 good day to you until
