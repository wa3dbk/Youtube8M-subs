remember mericans that um we have faced
challenges<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.850> past<00:03:01.880> we<00:03:02.300> have<00:03:02.450> overcome

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
challenges in the past we have overcome

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.510 
challenges in the past we have overcome
them<00:03:03.170> drawing<00:03:03.440> on<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.770> resources<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:04.280> we

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
them drawing on the resources that we

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.320 
them drawing on the resources that we
have<00:03:04.550> collectively<00:03:05.270> as<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:06.050> population<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:08.030> so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
have collectively as a population and so

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.810 
have collectively as a population and so
I<00:03:08.360> think<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.810> was<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.350> speech<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.310> really

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
I think it was a speech that really

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.180 
I think it was a speech that really
captured<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.450> moment<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.320> said<00:03:12.560> yes<00:03:12.890> we

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
captured the moment that said yes we

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.640 
captured the moment that said yes we
have<00:03:13.459> these<00:03:13.670> challenges<00:03:14.360> but<00:03:14.930> we<00:03:15.140> know<00:03:15.380> that

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
have these challenges but we know that

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.860 
have these challenges but we know that
and<00:03:16.100> we<00:03:16.130> were<00:03:16.760> faced<00:03:17.060> on<00:03:17.330> with<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.600> resources

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
and we were faced on with the resources

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.900 
and we were faced on with the resources
that<00:03:18.050> we<00:03:18.320> have<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.130> were<00:03:19.250> overcome<00:03:19.700> them

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
that we have and you were overcome them

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.840 
that we have and you were overcome them
so<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.180> think<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.510> was<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.660> good<00:03:20.810> pleases<00:03:21.410> sorry

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
so I think it was a good pleases sorry

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.290 
so I think it was a good pleases sorry
the<00:03:22.940> question<00:03:23.450> is<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:23.960> canvas<00:03:25.300> inspiration

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
the question is and a canvas inspiration

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.640 
the question is and a canvas inspiration
we<00:03:26.900> interpreted<00:03:27.680> in<00:03:28.400> successfully<00:03:29.650> overcome

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
we interpreted in successfully overcome

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.280 
we interpreted in successfully overcome
all<00:03:31.100> these<00:03:31.370> challenges<00:03:31.640> right<00:03:32.450> right<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:33.140> mean

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
all these challenges right right I mean

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.160 
all these challenges right right I mean
I<00:03:33.410> bet<00:03:33.680> spits<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.130> big<00:03:34.280> challenge<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:35.840> think

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
I bet spits a big challenge and I think

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.150 
I bet spits a big challenge and I think
that<00:03:37.540> right<00:03:38.540> now<00:03:38.570> we<00:03:38.780> face<00:03:39.080> many<00:03:39.110> unknowns<00:03:39.860> we

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
that right now we face many unknowns we

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.800 
that right now we face many unknowns we
don't<00:03:40.340> know<00:03:40.550> exactly<00:03:40.790> how<00:03:41.300> everything<00:03:41.720> is

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
don't know exactly how everything is

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.530 
don't know exactly how everything is
going<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:42.140> throw<00:03:42.290> out<00:03:42.530> if<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.740> don't<00:03:42.920> have<00:03:43.540> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
going to throw out if you don't have the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.870 
going to throw out if you don't have the
economic<00:03:45.110> crisis<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:45.860> complicated<00:03:46.370> it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
economic crisis is so complicated it

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.190 
economic crisis is so complicated it
started<00:03:47.240> with<00:03:47.330> a<00:03:47.390> credit<00:03:47.660> crunch<00:03:47.750> but<00:03:48.050> it's

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
started with a credit crunch but it's

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.950 
started with a credit crunch but it's
going<00:03:48.590> throughout<00:03:48.950> its<00:03:49.430> going<00:03:49.670> further<00:03:50.000> it's

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
going throughout its going further it's

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.020 
going throughout its going further it's
national<00:03:51.290> about<00:03:51.950> people<00:03:52.280> losing<00:03:52.460> their<00:03:52.640> fam

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
national about people losing their fam

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.110 
national about people losing their fam
so<00:03:53.360> losing<00:03:53.600> their<00:03:53.810> jobs<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:55.370> we<00:03:55.730> don't<00:03:55.940> know

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
so losing their jobs so we don't know

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.270 
so losing their jobs so we don't know
how<00:03:56.390> it's<00:03:56.780> going<00:03:56.960> to<00:03:57.020> play<00:03:57.200> out<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:57.740> i<00:03:58.010> think

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
how it's going to play out but i think

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.360 
how it's going to play out but i think
that<00:03:58.340> that's<00:03:58.760> where<00:03:59.290> the<00:04:00.290> president<00:04:01.010> wanted

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
that that's where the president wanted

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.790 
that that's where the president wanted
to<00:04:01.610> say<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.150> people<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:03.140> don't<00:04:03.260> know<00:04:03.350> exactly

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
to say to people you don't know exactly

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.470 
to say to people you don't know exactly
what's<00:04:04.010> going<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.280> happen<00:04:04.580> but<00:04:05.060> we<00:04:05.180> do<00:04:05.330> have

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
what's going to happen but we do have

these users with immigrants orses i can

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.850

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
administration right now is monitoring

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:16.829 
administration right now is monitoring
how<00:05:15.429> the<00:05:15.489> first<00:05:15.849> seven<00:05:16.419> hundred<00:05:16.659> billion

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:16.839 
how the first seven hundred billion

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.319 
how the first seven hundred billion
dollars<00:05:16.989> that<00:05:17.529> went<00:05:17.709> to<00:05:17.889> the<00:05:18.099> grocery<00:05:18.879> bill

dollars that went to the grocery bill

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:21.119 
dollars that went to the grocery bill
about<00:05:19.419> how<00:05:19.719> that<00:05:19.959> is<00:05:20.139> having<00:05:20.439> an<00:05:20.529> effect<00:05:20.799> where

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
about how that is having an effect where

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.909 
about how that is having an effect where
is<00:05:21.369> it<00:05:21.489> going<00:05:21.699> and<00:05:22.059> what<00:05:22.989> is<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.259> doing<00:05:23.469> how<00:05:23.889> is

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
is it going and what is it doing how is

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.029 
is it going and what is it doing how is
it<00:05:24.129> mitigating<00:05:24.669> the<00:05:24.699> effects<00:05:25.089> of<00:05:25.239> the<00:05:25.360> crisis

it mitigating the effects of the crisis

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.109 
it mitigating the effects of the crisis
so<00:05:27.039> there's<00:05:27.429> going<00:05:27.579> to<00:05:27.699> be<00:05:27.729> a<00:05:27.789> bit<00:05:27.969> of<00:05:27.999> a

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:28.119 
so there's going to be a bit of a

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.299 
so there's going to be a bit of a
feedback<00:05:28.569> there<00:05:28.839> and<00:05:29.169> and<00:05:29.439> and<00:05:29.769> I<00:05:29.829> think<00:05:30.099> that

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:30.309 
feedback there and and and I think that

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:32.969 
feedback there and and and I think that
this<00:05:31.299> is<00:05:31.479> not<00:05:31.719> something<00:05:32.169> that's<00:05:32.529> going<00:05:32.619> to<00:05:32.829> be

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
this is not something that's going to be

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.039 
this is not something that's going to be

measured in degrees the turnaround is

not<00:05:35.199> going<00:05:35.319> to<00:05:35.379> be<00:05:35.499> something<00:05:35.679> that's

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
not going to be something that's

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.119 
not going to be something that's
