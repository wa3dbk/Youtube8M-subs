00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:02.959 
there's a quick weather update we're

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.030 
there's a quick weather update we're
running<00:00:03.959> over<00:00:04.020> top<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.380> some<00:00:04.620> light<00:00:04.799> rain

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
running over top of some light rain

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.740 
running over top of some light rain
showers<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.730> say<00:00:05.940> over<00:00:06.210> top

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
showers I say over top

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.310 
showers I say over top
we<00:00:07.230> still<00:00:07.470> got<00:00:07.620> blue<00:00:08.040> sky<00:00:08.370> out<00:00:08.400> here<00:00:09.260> you<00:00:10.260> know

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
we still got blue sky out here you know

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.140 
we still got blue sky out here you know
we're<00:00:10.830> not<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.309> but<00:00:11.550> there's<00:00:11.730> blue<00:00:11.910> sky

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
we're not in it but there's blue sky

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.620 
we're not in it but there's blue sky
above<00:00:12.179> us<00:00:13.130> surface<00:00:14.130> temperature<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.389> well

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
above us surface temperature is is well

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.980 
above us surface temperature is is well
above<00:00:15.870> freezing<00:00:15.900> but<00:00:16.379> up<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:17.119> it's<00:00:18.119> minus<00:00:18.510> 18

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
above freezing but up here it's minus 18

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.620 
above freezing but up here it's minus 18
C<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.890> we're<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:20.970> gonna<00:00:21.090> see<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.359> we're<00:00:21.480> going

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
C so we're not gonna see it we're going

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.240 
C so we're not gonna see it we're going
up<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:21.960> today<00:00:22.170> there's<00:00:22.380> no<00:00:22.529> convection<00:00:22.949> on

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
up for today there's no convection on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.609 
up for today there's no convection on
this<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.869> know<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.170> because<00:00:25.350> we've

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
this and we know that because we've

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.640 
this and we know that because we've
checked<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> carefully<00:00:26.630> just<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.439> off

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
checked it carefully just like and off

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.250 
checked it carefully just like and off
to<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.859> south<00:00:29.220> there's<00:00:29.550> some<00:00:29.760> moderate<00:00:30.179> rain

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
to the south there's some moderate rain

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.680 
to the south there's some moderate rain
we'll<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.470> some<00:00:31.800> some<00:00:32.430> light<00:00:32.669> turbulence<00:00:33.300> at

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
we'll get some some light turbulence at

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.470 
we'll get some some light turbulence at
this<00:00:33.840> point<00:00:34.670> I'm<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.000> keep<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
this point I'm going to keep it in the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
this point I'm going to keep it in the
green<00:00:36.690> arc<00:00:36.960> we're<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.410> right<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> top<00:00:37.950> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
green arc we're just right at the top of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.650 
green arc we're just right at the top of
the<00:00:38.160> green<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.329> thing<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.629> going

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the green and the first thing I'm going

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.479 
the green and the first thing I'm going
to<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:39.989> we've<00:00:40.379> gone<00:00:40.500> down<00:00:40.680> 500<00:00:41.219> feet<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> minute

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to do we've gone down 500 feet a minute

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.950 
to do we've gone down 500 feet a minute
and<00:00:43.010> we're<00:00:44.010> need<00:00:44.160> 500<00:00:44.969> correction<00:00:45.300> 600<00:00:45.750> feet<00:00:45.840> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and we're need 500 correction 600 feet a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.979 
and we're need 500 correction 600 feet a
minute<00:00:46.100> need<00:00:47.420> 500<00:00:49.219> 576<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.370> minute<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.570> make<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
minute need 500 576 a minute to make the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.430 
minute need 500 576 a minute to make the
descent<00:00:52.350> profile<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.699> set<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:53.969> earlier

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
descent profile that we set up earlier

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.049 
descent profile that we set up earlier
which<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> fine<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:56.190> happy<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.699> that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
which is fine I'm happy with that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.130 
which is fine I'm happy with that
if<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.109> I'll<00:00:58.379> bring<00:00:59.070> power<00:00:59.340> away<00:01:00.140> but

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
if I have to I'll bring power away but

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.209 
if I have to I'll bring power away but
I'm<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.649> take<00:01:01.859> power<00:01:02.100> away

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
I'm not going to take power away

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.520 
I'm not going to take power away
unnecessarily<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.480> don't<00:01:03.750> want<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
unnecessarily because I don't want to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
unnecessarily because I don't want to
have<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> add<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> we're<00:01:05.640> still<00:01:05.880> 30

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
have to add it back and we're still 30

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.530 
have to add it back and we're still 30
minutes<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.369> we're<00:01:08.640> looking<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.060> two

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
minutes out so we're looking at two

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.109 
minutes out so we're looking at two
hours<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.990> fuel<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.560> 30<00:01:11.460> minutes<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.850> flight

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
hours of fuel and 30 minutes of flight

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.320 
hours of fuel and 30 minutes of flight
so<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.710> fuel<00:01:13.979> bingos<00:01:14.430> actually<00:01:14.939> improved

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
so the fuel bingos actually improved

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
so the fuel bingos actually improved
that's<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> course<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.560> part<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.400> we're

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that's of course in part because we're

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.179 
that's of course in part because we're
using<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> same<00:01:18.930> amount<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.320> fuel<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
using the same amount of fuel and the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.120 
using the same amount of fuel and the
kinetic<00:01:20.580> energy<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> descent<00:01:22.130> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
kinetic energy of the descent and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.270 
kinetic energy of the descent and
getting<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> higher<00:01:23.759> ground<00:01:24.030> speed<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.280> took

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
getting a higher ground speed now I took

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
getting a higher ground speed now I took
the<00:01:26.400> liberty<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> checking<00:01:26.939> ahead<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.540> were

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the liberty of checking ahead we were

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
the liberty of checking ahead we were
landing<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.290> wiley<00:01:28.500> post<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:29.040> fuel<00:01:29.280> I've<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
landing at wiley post for fuel I've just

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.030 
landing at wiley post for fuel I've just
called<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> FBO<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.020> requested<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> quick

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
called the FBO and requested the quick

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.359 
called the FBO and requested the quick
turn<00:01:32.810> topped<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.049> inners<00:01:34.320> at<00:01:34.710> 10:00<00:01:35.040> aside

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
turn topped the inners at 10:00 aside

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.550 
turn topped the inners at 10:00 aside
hunter<00:01:35.729> low<00:01:35.880> led<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> outers<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.970> they

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
hunter low led to the outers and they

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.330 
hunter low led to the outers and they
confirmed<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.310> I'll<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:41.909> us

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
confirmed it that's what I'll do for us

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
confirmed it that's what I'll do for us
though<00:01:44.450> but<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> hurry<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
though but I'm in a hurry but I like to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.550 
though but I'm in a hurry but I like to
minimize<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> ground<00:01:47.220> time<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.970> because

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
minimize the ground time just because

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.460 
minimize the ground time just because
it's<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:50.970> practical<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.259> keep

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
it's it's it's more practical to to keep

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.789 
it's it's it's more practical to to keep
moving<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.939> enjoy<00:01:54.210> flying<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.110> don't

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
moving and I enjoy flying but I don't

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.630 
moving and I enjoy flying but I don't
enjoy<00:01:55.950> waiting<00:01:56.700> around<00:01:56.759> ESP<00:01:57.210> oh<00:01:58.310> alright<00:01:59.310> then

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
enjoy waiting around ESP oh alright then

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880
