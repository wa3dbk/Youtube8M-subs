00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
out the functionality of this smart case

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.060 
out the functionality of this smart case
now<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> smart<00:01:04.470> case<00:01:04.650> you'll<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.979> able

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
now with the smart case you'll be able

now with the smart case you'll be able
to<00:01:05.400> lay<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> down<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.299> it'll<00:01:06.720> act<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to lay it down and it'll act as a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
to lay it down and it'll act as a
keyboard<00:01:07.860> stand<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.640> simply<00:01:09.180> by<00:01:09.210> folding<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
keyboard stand so simply by folding the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
keyboard stand so simply by folding the
back<00:01:10.110> you'll<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.860> able<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> tilt<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
back you'll be able to tilt it up and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
back you'll be able to tilt it up and
have<00:01:12.360> sort<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:12.960> angle<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.590> when<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.830> are

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
have sort of an angle so when you are

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
have sort of an angle so when you are
typing<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.390> comfortably

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
typing on it you can do that comfortably

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
typing on it you can do that comfortably
but<00:01:16.229> another<00:01:16.470> thing<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> smart<00:01:17.130> case

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
but another thing that the smart case

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
but another thing that the smart case
does<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.390> keep<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> folded<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.290> as

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
does is you can keep it folded back as

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190 
does is you can keep it folded back as
it<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.820> stand<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.780> upright

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it is now but stand it up at an upright

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
it is now but stand it up at an upright
position<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.580> it'll<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:24.000> great<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.299> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so like I say in the beginning the video

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.789 
so like I say in the beginning the video
the<00:01:59.670> smart<00:01:59.909> case<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> leather<00:02:00.719> design<00:02:01.200> it's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
the smart case is a leather design it's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.740 
the smart case is a leather design it's
actually<00:02:02.100> made<00:02:02.310> out<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.670> aniline<00:02:03.090> dye<00:02:03.329> leather

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
actually made out of aniline dye leather

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.300 
actually made out of aniline dye leather
and<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.409> pick<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.680> up<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.920> six<00:02:05.159> different

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and you can pick it up in six different

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.940 
and you can pick it up in six different
colors<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.659> does<00:02:06.899> come<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.619> hefty

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
colors but it does come with a hefty

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.630 
colors but it does come with a hefty
price<00:02:08.190> tag<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:09.379> $79<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.370> worth

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
price tag at $79 so is it really worth

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.730 
price tag at $79 so is it really worth
spending<00:02:12.060> $79<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
spending $79 on a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.150 
spending $79 on a
other<00:02:13.860> case<00:02:14.130> my<00:02:15.030> opinion<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.840> yes<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.470> no<00:02:16.710> it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
other case my opinion is yes and no it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.340 
other case my opinion is yes and no it
does<00:02:17.490> give<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.910> premium<00:02:18.300> fill<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
iPad it's very thin it's very light so

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.230 
iPad it's very thin it's very light so
with<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.740> does<00:02:22.980> not<00:02:23.160> add<00:02:23.370> too<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:23.880> bulk

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
with this it does not add too much bulk

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.260 
with this it does not add too much bulk
or<00:02:24.540> heaviness<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.800> device<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.210> still

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
again for eighty dollars you can find a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.250 
again for eighty dollars you can find a
better<00:02:31.740> case<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.730> pick<00:02:33.600> up<00:02:33.780> something<00:02:34.020> else

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
better case and pick up something else

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.530 
better case and pick up something else
