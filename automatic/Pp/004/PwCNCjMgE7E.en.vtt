you get in irons wedges etc just that's
that<00:01:37.600> these<00:01:38.600> would<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:38.899> SAP<00:01:39.319> storage

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
that these would be SAP storage

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.100 
that these would be SAP storage
obviously<00:01:40.310> here<00:01:40.520> will<00:01:40.670> be<00:01:40.759> one<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.539> then<00:01:41.929> two

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
obviously here will be one and then two

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.700 
obviously here will be one and then two
we<00:01:42.409> do<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.619> vertically<00:01:43.009> or<00:01:43.219> horizontally<00:01:44.710> so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
leave for the new I know that you I have

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.210 
leave for the new I know that you I have
to<00:03:10.639> force<00:03:10.849> on<00:03:11.030> both<00:03:11.299> of<00:03:11.510> those<00:03:12.099> versus<00:03:13.099> the

to force on both of those versus the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.479 
to force on both of those versus the
difference<00:03:13.579> this<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:15.799> way<00:03:15.829> to<00:03:15.950> put<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.370> the

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
difference this is a way to put in the

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.970 
difference this is a way to put in the
hosel<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.269> affect<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.810> CG<00:03:18.139> of<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:18.680> golf<00:03:18.859> club

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
hosel you affect the CG of the golf club

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.849 
hosel you affect the CG of the golf club
so<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.630> new<00:03:20.750> weight<00:03:20.930> port<00:03:21.109> system<00:03:21.319> is<00:03:21.560> a

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
so this the new weight port system is a

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.740 
so this the new weight port system is a
precision<00:03:22.790> port<00:03:23.120> we're<00:03:23.329> going<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.540> call<00:03:23.660> you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.190 
precision port we're going to call you
put<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.019> label<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.349> want

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200

which<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.739> nice<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.099> makes<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.340> easier<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.610> do

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
which is nice it makes it easier to do

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.250 
which is nice it makes it easier to do
you<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.519> do<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.730> after<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.120> party<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:31.110> makes

so<00:03:50.189> when<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.760> add<00:03:51.750> swing<00:03:52.140> weight<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.470> a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
so when we have to add swing weight to a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.309 
so when we have to add swing weight to a
golf<00:03:52.739> ball<00:03:53.010> without<00:03:53.959> removable<00:03:54.959> weight<00:03:55.109> like

golf ball without removable weight like
a<00:03:55.349> burner<00:03:55.620> if<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.829> need<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.040> add<00:03:56.159> some<00:03:56.430> weight

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549

you<00:04:49.620> measure<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.610> measured<00:04:50.909> based<00:04:51.030> on

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
you measure this is measured based on

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.640 
you measure this is measured based on
this<00:04:51.330> plate<00:04:51.599> on<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.810> bottom<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.289> one<00:04:52.440> sits

this plate on the bottom that one sits

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.589 
this plate on the bottom that one sits
in<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.830> slightly<00:04:53.070> different<00:04:53.190> way<00:04:53.490> trying<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.479> be

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
in a slightly different way trying to be

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.719 
in a slightly different way trying to be
a<00:04:54.630> little<00:04:54.720> bit<00:04:54.900> more<00:04:58.190> because<00:04:59.190> we<00:04:59.340> all<00:04:59.460> have<00:04:59.580> so

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
a little bit more because we all have so

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.339 
a little bit more because we all have so
many<00:04:59.789> different<00:05:00.150> ways<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.810> measuring<00:05:01.020> things

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
many different ways of measuring things

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:07.570 
many different ways of measuring things
and<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:02.340> problem<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:02.669> nobody<00:05:02.820> uses<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.210> same

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.409 

these<00:05:08.580> are<00:05:08.729> something<00:05:08.880> you<00:05:09.000> don't<00:05:09.120> really<00:05:09.210> see

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
these are something you don't really see

these are something you don't really see
very<00:05:09.449> often<00:05:09.930> now<00:05:10.050> if<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.199> wouldn't<00:05:10.380> see<00:05:10.500> these

on this goes in just protective paint

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.679 
on this goes in just protective paint
because<00:05:30.780> when<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:30.960> put<00:05:31.169> pressure<00:05:31.260> on<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.560> you

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689 
because when you put pressure on it you

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:34.889 
because when you put pressure on it you
just<00:05:33.019> a<00:05:33.110> little<00:05:33.289> towel<00:05:33.499> on<00:05:33.679> top<00:05:33.709> of<00:05:34.039> them<00:05:34.129> and

just a little towel on top of them and

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:38.499 
just a little towel on top of them and
goes<00:05:35.899> then<00:05:36.789> that<00:05:37.789> would<00:05:37.909> be<00:05:37.999> on<00:05:38.089> top<00:05:38.209> the<00:05:38.360> head

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
goes then that would be on top the head

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.439 
goes then that would be on top the head
obviously<00:05:38.889> pressure<00:05:39.969> that<00:05:40.969> doesn't<00:05:41.360> move

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
our engineers develop these curing cells

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.529 
our engineers develop these curing cells
which<00:06:18.559> allows<00:06:18.829> 24<00:06:19.550> hour<00:06:19.639> epoxy<00:06:20.059> to<00:06:20.179> cure<00:06:20.419> it

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
which allows 24 hour epoxy to cure it

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:21.609 
which allows 24 hour epoxy to cure it
and<00:06:20.659> just<00:06:20.929> under<00:06:21.079> three<00:06:21.229> minutes

00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:21.619 
and just under three minutes

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:23.079 
and just under three minutes
so<00:06:22.099> we<00:06:22.189> could<00:06:22.279> have<00:06:22.369> a<00:06:22.429> driver<00:06:22.639> belt<00:06:22.909> and

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.089 
so we could have a driver belt and

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:25.359 
so we could have a driver belt and
literally<00:06:23.329> about<00:06:23.599> four<00:06:24.050> minutes<00:06:24.199> will<00:06:25.189> take

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:25.369 
literally about four minutes will take

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:26.979 
literally about four minutes will take
