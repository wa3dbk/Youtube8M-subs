 against ricardo mejía and here the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.740
 problem is not whether it is commercial or not 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.720

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.020

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.690
 monopolized for many years by 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.790
 foreigners and Mexican individuals 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.070
 under legaloid arguments and with 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.430
 complacency of the government that prevent the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.549
 free access to Mexicans 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.489

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.170
 these deputies traitors to the homeland 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.480
