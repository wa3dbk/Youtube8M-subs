through trouble in life and that's the
thing<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.390> about<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.689> album<00:02:03.990> is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
thing I really like about the album is

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
thing I really like about the album is
that<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.649> such<00:02:04.799> an<00:02:04.920> introspective<00:02:05.549> look

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that it's such an introspective look

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.819 
that it's such an introspective look
into<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.079> he<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.320> going<00:02:07.649> through

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
into what he was going through

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.460 
into what he was going through
throughout<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.379> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
throughout this and you really do get a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.010 
throughout this and you really do get a
feel<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.180> exactly<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:12.300> he<00:02:12.360> was<00:02:12.480> feeling<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
feel of exactly what he was feeling and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.490 
feel of exactly what he was feeling and
it's<00:02:13.170> not

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
it's not

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
it's not
ever<00:02:13.590> over<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.490> top<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.000> it's<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.330> ever<00:02:15.510> too

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
ever over the top and it's not ever too

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.510 
ever over the top and it's not ever too
subtle<00:02:15.990> it's<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.560> perfect<00:02:16.800> balance

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
subtle it's just this perfect balance

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.510 
subtle it's just this perfect balance
now<00:02:17.940> musically<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.990> think<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.680> album<00:02:20.130> came<00:02:20.400> out

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
now musically I think the album came out

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.070 
now musically I think the album came out
sounding<00:02:20.730> incredible<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> vinyl<00:02:21.900> sounds

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
sounding incredible the vinyl sounds

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.560
