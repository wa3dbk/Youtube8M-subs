dog so we would have bought one sooner
if<00:03:29.570> we<00:03:30.020> could<00:03:30.230> have<00:03:30.320> tried<00:03:30.590> once<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.100> that's

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
if we could have tried once and that's

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.699

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
where renting comes in really handy so

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.250 
where renting comes in really handy so
