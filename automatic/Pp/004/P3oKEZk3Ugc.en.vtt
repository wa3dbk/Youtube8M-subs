firmly with your thumb there now I got
my<00:02:49.000> hardware<00:02:49.450> I'm<00:02:49.540> going<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.750> pull<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.260> back

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
my hardware I'm going to pull this back

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.340 
my hardware I'm going to pull this back
up<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.300> hand<00:02:52.510> tighten<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.110> top

outer one to the hole I just made that's

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.690 
outer one to the hole I just made that's
going<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.440> be<00:02:59.500> easier<00:02:59.860> than<00:02:59.920> trying<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.370> drill

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
going to be easier than trying to drill

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.010 
going to be easier than trying to drill
and<00:03:00.880> hold<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.120> bracket<00:03:01.270> at<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.600> same<00:03:01.810> time

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
and hold the bracket at the same time

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.350 
and hold the bracket at the same time
now<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.370> can<00:03:03.460> switch<00:03:03.790> back<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:06.060> your<00:03:07.060> Phillips
