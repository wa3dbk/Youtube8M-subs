00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 So 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.640

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.739
 m 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:11.739
 t 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.829
 okay also add that in the cave 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.560
 work and perhaps 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.030
 and guard someone 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.650
 but my companions scrambled 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.429
 begging to sign drink a coin home 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.429
 at 36 can someone just find 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.220
 device historian brakes I'm here 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.410
 designers 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.740
 edition 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.990
 prostitution 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.730
 raid and 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.480
 who goes to yours is not 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.710
 This type of cancellation of funny 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.850
 all this as a mother about 110 thousand here and 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.670
 such a case 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 and Sitronics then either pipe 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.079
 i may 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.379
 Donetsk Pipeline Chumak 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.600
 pipelines allow 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.039
 teleporting should no longer be 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.720
 no motivation for stepping up 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.000
 I do not plan everything so that you were 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.860
 more convenient than something to complain about 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.700
 Georgievich point criteria and well thanks for 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.420
 detractors such a constant force 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.210
 me to you more such ways of them 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.310
 to get what I would for a period 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.280
 which is to taste as an equal 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.910
 cling to time where to put 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.920
 yes status take them to the winter 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.340
 this is 100 so difficult kulish know and 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 redistribution alright how about coins 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.860
 that is, if you are taking shape now 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.070
 impressions if make up attention 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.170
 that can send 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.400
 hurt dollars so me 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.940
 make it yes nothing i have no idea why 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.770
 you want to transform our life so 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.750
 did but if i still have to want 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.409
 jump over I could fail from 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.720
 That is also through the pipeline I 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.590
 personally smoking myself a shirt 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 Europeans lecture about what is right through 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.980
 the road was broken 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.569
 in the case then 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.569
 to man fine 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.789
