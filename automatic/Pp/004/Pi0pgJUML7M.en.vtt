that's<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.600> different<00:04:27.930> story<00:04:28.020> it's<00:04:28.530> very<00:04:28.770> flat

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
that's a different story it's very flat

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.790 
that's a different story it's very flat
as<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.789> can<00:04:29.940> see<00:04:30.090> there's<00:04:30.930> no<00:04:31.050> curvature<00:04:31.440> it's

just<00:04:32.009> very<00:04:32.130> flat<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:32.880> it's<00:04:33.750> not<00:04:33.930> as

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
just very flat so it's not as

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.689 
just very flat so it's not as
