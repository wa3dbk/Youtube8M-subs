fiberglass<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> boards<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.030> this

applied on they don't dent as easy so
the<00:01:31.560> surface<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.520> harder<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> board<00:01:33.720> last

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
