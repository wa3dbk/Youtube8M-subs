00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
first thing you want to do fold it

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.790 
first thing you want to do fold it
straight<00:00:11.550> across<00:00:11.880> here<00:00:12.630> right<00:00:13.410> around<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
straight across here right around the

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.369 
straight across here right around the
bottom<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.430> pyramid<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.199> roughly<00:00:16.199> right

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
bottom of the pyramid and roughly right

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.810 
bottom of the pyramid and roughly right
through<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> tee<00:00:17.960> okay<00:00:18.960> that's<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.440> a<00:00:19.820> rough

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
through the tee okay that's just a rough

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.310 
through the tee okay that's just a rough
estimate<00:00:20.940> of<00:00:21.270> where<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.600> needs<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.170> can

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
estimate of where it needs to be you can

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.310 
estimate of where it needs to be you can
go<00:00:22.470> anywhere<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.010> want<00:00:23.100> right<00:00:23.520> in<00:00:23.550> there<00:00:24.320> next

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
go anywhere you want right in there next

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.099 
go anywhere you want right in there next
one's<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> be<00:00:26.010> an<00:00:26.100> angled<00:00:26.520> fold<00:00:27.109> it's

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
one's going to be an angled fold it's

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
one's going to be an angled fold it's
going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.350> go<00:00:28.500> between<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.699> Trust<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
going to go between we and Trust and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:40.810 
going to go between we and Trust and
then<00:00:31.289> between<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.980> N<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> e<00:00:33.800> okay

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
so you can see trust there and then when

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.410 
so you can see trust there and then when
you<00:00:43.850> flip<00:00:44.060> it<00:00:44.180> over<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:44.720> says<00:00:45.020> no<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:47.270> want

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
you flip it over it says no and you want

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.670 
you flip it over it says no and you want
to<00:00:47.480> fold<00:00:47.690> this<00:00:47.900> margin<00:00:48.410> back<00:00:50.380> okay<00:00:51.380> you<00:00:51.440> can

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
we're just going to line this crease up

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.830 
we're just going to line this crease up
with<00:01:06.440> itself<00:01:06.860> there<00:01:07.250> okay<00:01:10.270> hold<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:11.450> there

one<00:01:17.540> we're<00:01:17.750> going<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:17.900> use<00:01:17.960> over<00:01:18.350> here<00:01:19.330> we're

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
one we're going to use over here we're

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.969 
one we're going to use over here we're
going<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.509> bring<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:20.930> over<00:01:21.759> put<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:22.880> next<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.180> no

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
going to bring it over put it next to no

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.620 
going to bring it over put it next to no
to<00:01:24.979> line<00:01:25.220> it<00:01:25.250> up<00:01:25.490> straight<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.090> then<00:01:26.150> crease

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
to line it up straight and then crease

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.040 
to line it up straight and then crease
it<00:01:26.869> right<00:01:27.830> there<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.520> then<00:01:29.330> crease<00:01:29.600> this<00:01:29.810> one

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
it right there and then crease this one

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.910 
it right there and then crease this one
right<00:01:30.200> here<00:01:31.900> okay<00:01:32.900> now<00:01:33.470> we're<00:01:33.590> going<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.770> make

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
right here okay now we're going to make

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.130 
right here okay now we're going to make
a<00:01:33.950> straight<00:01:34.310> crease<00:01:34.520> across<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.180> top<00:01:35.420> from

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
a straight crease across the top from

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.690 
a straight crease across the top from
here<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.950> right<00:01:37.160> where<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.520> fold<00:01:37.910> is<00:01:39.700> all

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
here to right where that fold is all

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.560 
here to right where that fold is all
right<00:01:41.890> once<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:43.070> get<00:01:43.160> that<00:01:43.399> one<00:01:43.550> in<00:01:43.580> we're

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
right once we get that one in we're

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.510 
right once we get that one in we're
going<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.720> make<00:01:44.930> an<00:01:45.080> angled<00:01:45.409> one<00:01:45.560> down<00:01:48.340> okay

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
going to make an angled one down okay

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.380 
going to make an angled one down okay
so<00:01:50.300> it<00:01:50.420> ends<00:01:50.600> up<00:01:50.690> looking<00:01:50.750> like<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:52.240> fold<00:01:53.240> it

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
so it ends up looking like that fold it

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.270 
so it ends up looking like that fold it
down<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:53.900> then<00:01:54.080> we'll<00:01:54.229> just<00:01:54.380> smash<00:01:54.740> all<00:01:55.040> this

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
down and then we'll just smash all this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.160 
down and then we'll just smash all this
stuff<00:01:55.580> in<00:01:55.790> here<00:01:56.830> fold<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:57.979> over

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.590 

okay<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:03.130> last<00:02:03.280> one<00:02:03.579> is<00:02:03.640> going<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.820> be<00:02:04.030> the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
okay the last one is going to be the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.679 
okay the last one is going to be the
bottom<00:02:04.990> all<00:02:05.740> right<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.189> like<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.090> go<00:02:07.270> right<00:02:07.509> at

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
bottom all right I like to go right at

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.719 
bottom all right I like to go right at
the<00:02:07.780> bottom<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.530> bill<00:02:08.890> right<00:02:09.250> there<00:02:09.519> and

the bottom of the bill right there and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.640 
the bottom of the bill right there and
all<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.420> way<00:02:10.539> across<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.379> ends<00:02:14.590> up

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
all the way across so so it ends up

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.140 
all the way across so so it ends up
looking<00:02:14.800> like<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:16.860> let's<00:02:17.860> mash<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.790> all<00:02:18.940> down

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
looking like that let's mash it all down

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.759 
looking like that let's mash it all down
really<00:02:19.540> nice<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.780> then<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.930> says<00:02:23.230> trust<00:02:23.590> no

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
really nice and then it says trust no

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.070 
really nice and then it says trust no
