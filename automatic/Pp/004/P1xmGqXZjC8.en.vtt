next to the objective all the time is

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.289 
next to the objective all the time is
good<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.340> vantage<00:01:44.820> point<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
good to get a little vantage point and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.999 
good to get a little vantage point and
run<00:01:45.509> back<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.750> check<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.470> every<00:01:46.799> now<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
run back and check up on every now and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
run back and check up on every now and
again<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.399> need<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.000> watching<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
again you don't need to be watching it a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.230 
again you don't need to be watching it a
hundred<00:01:49.140> percent<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> time<00:01:50.240> usually

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
hundred percent of the time usually

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.740 
hundred percent of the time usually
leads<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.899> getting<00:01:51.930> killed<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:53.759> good<00:01:54.509> tip

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
leads to you getting killed a good tip

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.469 
leads to you getting killed a good tip
is<00:01:55.040> when<00:01:56.040> an<00:01:56.219> enemy<00:01:56.369> goes<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> disarm<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
is when an enemy goes to disarm it it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.600 
is when an enemy goes to disarm it it
