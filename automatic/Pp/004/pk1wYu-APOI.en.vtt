00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.830
 from September through small and through large into the main hall of the palace 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.870
 antwerp 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.349
 that is also small 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:10.499
 and 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:13.289
 I watch the story of death by the extinct 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:19.579
 the bird the chicken after the position of a dodo and therefore large from 16 years 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.599
 and that is at the show or the extinct full of the blind spot with then 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.880
 can of man 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.800
 but those are precisely with that dodo 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.540
 which 10,490 the dodo extinct on the island of mauritius 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.260
 And that is because of the Dutch who brought the final bid to Indonesia on cash 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.730
 warren and on the way just stopped the island because the chain to break 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.090
 and if you are legally done then we have entered the typing 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.700
 the dodo and the runway were killed and eaten 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.100
 Dutch We are therefore responsible 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.310
 therefore the killing of an entire animal species is also broken 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.710
 is still used as a symbol for delay 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.160
 from directx 10 the world i could login 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.920
 and therefore also that I want the show by the ascending on the square 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.140
 make it in the palace because it is bio diversity that is more important 8 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.450
 by a small, much smaller group with four people, two musicians 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.390

 picasso from dongen klein 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.580
 because of a large in the small and that the Quran because of the large is that large 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.890
 I want the plan in red 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.210

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.390

 my big wish 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.600
