ordered<00:00:40.960> look<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.200> bit<00:00:41.380> weird<00:00:41.560> I<00:00:41.860> don't<00:00:41.920> think

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
ordered look a bit weird I don't think

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.640 
ordered look a bit weird I don't think
the<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:43.150> color<00:00:43.420> quite<00:00:43.660> suits<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.350> Apple

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
the the color quite suits the Apple

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.320 
the the color quite suits the Apple
styling<00:00:45.100> but<00:00:45.370> nonetheless<00:00:45.640> it<00:00:46.030> still<00:00:46.090> looks

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
styling but nonetheless it still looks

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.480 
styling but nonetheless it still looks
pretty<00:00:46.450> snazzy<00:00:46.630> now<00:00:47.590> I<00:00:47.620> think<00:00:47.770> taking<00:00:48.370> these

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
pretty snazzy now I think taking these

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.220 
pretty snazzy now I think taking these
out<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.730> box<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.120> gonna<00:00:49.270> take<00:00:49.540> me<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.720> while<00:00:49.750> so

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
for about two three hours now and I have

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.140 
for about two three hours now and I have
to<00:00:59.079> say<00:00:59.200> I<00:00:59.230> really<00:00:59.710> really<00:00:59.950> like<00:01:00.160> them<00:01:00.370> like

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
to say I really really like them like

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.450 
to say I really really like them like
the<00:01:01.450> build<00:01:01.660> quality<00:01:01.900> is<00:01:02.200> probably<00:01:02.410> about<00:01:02.770> 60

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
the build quality is probably about 60

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.340 
the build quality is probably about 60
to<00:01:03.640> 70<00:01:03.970> percent<00:01:04.089> as<00:01:04.420> good<00:01:04.600> as<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:04.780> original<00:01:04.809> up

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
to 70 percent as good as the original up

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.529 
to 70 percent as good as the original up
horns<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:05.950> then<00:01:06.579> the<00:01:06.729> sound<00:01:07.149> quality<00:01:07.509> is

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
horns and then the sound quality is

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.719 
horns and then the sound quality is
probably<00:01:07.960> about<00:01:08.049> 80%<00:01:08.469> as<00:01:08.890> good<00:01:09.100> so

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
probably about 80% as good so

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.099 
probably about 80% as good so
considering<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.659> then<00:01:10.749> considering

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:11.109 
considering that and then considering

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:12.870 
considering that and then considering
that<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.350> price<00:01:11.619> is<00:01:11.649> about<00:01:12.009> 5%<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.789> the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
that the price is about 5% of the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.370 
that the price is about 5% of the
originals<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:13.539> is<00:01:13.659> actually<00:01:14.079> a<00:01:14.109> really

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
originals that this is actually a really

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.260 
originals that this is actually a really
really<00:01:14.499> cool<00:01:14.890> thing<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.460> yeah<00:01:15.939> it's<00:01:16.090> pretty

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
really cool thing so yeah it's pretty

really cool thing so yeah it's pretty
much<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.659> one-to-one<00:01:17.079> replica<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.920> cable

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
much a one-to-one replica the cable

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:19.770 
much a one-to-one replica the cable
feels<00:01:18.460> okay<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:18.999> doesn't<00:01:19.179> actually<00:01:19.389> make<00:01:19.719> any

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780
