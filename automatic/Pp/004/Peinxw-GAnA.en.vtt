all right so I'm going to give you a
quick<00:00:01.860> overview<00:00:02.460> on<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.669> Garmin<00:00:03.179> Oregon<00:00:03.480> 450

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
quick overview on the Garmin Oregon 450

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.980 
quick overview on the Garmin Oregon 450
GPS<00:00:04.920> so<00:00:05.460> these<00:00:05.609> are<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.819> real<00:00:06.000> high-class<00:00:06.240> GPS

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
GPS so these are the real high-class GPS

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.379 
GPS so these are the real high-class GPS
that<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.410> use<00:00:07.560> here<00:00:07.799> vu<00:00:08.160> experience<00:00:08.639> LED<00:00:08.910> and

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
that we use here vu experience LED and

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.730 
that we use here vu experience LED and
they're<00:00:09.510> pretty<00:00:09.690> easy<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.960> use<00:00:10.080> they<00:00:10.440> work<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
they're pretty easy to use they work the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.440 
they're pretty easy to use they work the
same<00:00:10.920> way<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.219> regular<00:00:11.340> GPS<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.090> do

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
same way that regular GPS is do

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.150 
same way that regular GPS is do
we've<00:00:12.719> got<00:00:12.990> satellites<00:00:13.710> you're<00:00:13.860> trying<00:00:14.070> to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
we've got satellites you're trying to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.070 
we've got satellites you're trying to
pick<00:00:14.340> up<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.730> they're<00:00:14.820> receiving<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.599> so

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
pick up and they're receiving on this so

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.689 
pick up and they're receiving on this so
once<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.440> turn<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.070> there's<00:00:17.250> only<00:00:17.400> one

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
once you turn it on and there's only one

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.010 
once you turn it on and there's only one
button<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.210> that's<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.539> button<00:00:18.840> right<00:00:18.869> here

want to worry about our where to map and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.400 
want to worry about our where to map and
compass<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.520> possibly<00:00:48.239> trip<00:00:48.480> computer<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
compass and possibly trip computer so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.240 
compass and possibly trip computer so
what<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> do<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.010> we're<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.840 
what we're going to do is we're going to
select<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:51.449> fun<00:00:53.030> where<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.710> find<00:00:55.710> another<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
select a fun where to find another and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
select a fun where to find another and
we're<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> select<00:00:57.500> waypoints<00:00:58.500> because

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
we're going to select waypoints because

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.020 
we're going to select waypoints because
that's<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.010> everything's<00:00:59.309> loaded<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.850> as

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that's what everything's loaded in as

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.450 
that's what everything's loaded in as
now<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.199> tells<00:01:01.500> us<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> closest

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
now right here tells us what the closest

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
now right here tells us what the closest
waypoints<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> Blandford

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
waypoints are we have the Blandford

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.830 
waypoints are we have the Blandford
Street<00:01:04.439> stop<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> SMG<00:01:06.270> building

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
Street stop and we have the SMG building

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.600 
Street stop and we have the SMG building
so<00:01:07.350> those<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:07.860> locations<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.490> are

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so those are two locations that are

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.899 
so those are two locations that are
nearby

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
nearby

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
nearby
but<00:01:09.450> I'm<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> scan<00:01:10.080> through<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.860> try<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
but I'm going to scan through and try to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.149 
but I'm going to scan through and try to
find<00:01:11.460> well<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> find<00:01:12.950> not<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
find well I want to find not going to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
find well I want to find not going to
find<00:01:14.340> northeastern<00:01:14.850> who'd<00:01:15.030> want<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.409> I'm

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
find northeastern who'd want that I'm

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
find northeastern who'd want that I'm
going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> find<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.520> Prudential<00:01:18.030> Center

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
going to find the Prudential Center

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.770 
going to find the Prudential Center
right<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> Prudential<00:01:19.200> T<00:01:19.380> stop<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> there

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
right so the Prudential T stop so there

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.109 
right so the Prudential T stop so there
we<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.590> gives<00:01:22.710> me<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> map<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
we go so now it gives me a map there's a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.570 
we go so now it gives me a map there's a
little<00:01:24.420> T<00:01:24.600> stop<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.259> little<00:01:25.830> pin<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.340> right

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
little T stop a little pin that's right

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
little T stop a little pin that's right
there<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.360> where<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> location<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
there so we know where the location is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.420 
there so we know where the location is
and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.250> press<00:01:29.610> GO<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.710> it's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and then I'm going to press GO and it's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.429 
and then I'm going to press GO and it's
