00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
around it's dark we are in a perfect

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.410 
around it's dark we are in a perfect
flatland<00:00:24.720> world<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.619> are<00:00:25.859> at<00:00:26.119> difficulty<00:00:27.119> hard

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
flatland world we are at difficulty hard

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.500 
flatland world we are at difficulty hard
you<00:00:28.199> see<00:00:28.380> any<00:00:28.560> mobs<00:00:30.769> you<00:00:31.769> don't<00:00:31.980> either<00:00:32.210> nope

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
you see any mobs you don't either nope

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.340 
you see any mobs you don't either nope
so<00:00:34.440> yeah<00:00:35.160> looks<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.910> Mojang<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.870> working

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
so yeah looks like Mojang is working

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.610 
so yeah looks like Mojang is working
with<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:38.790> treat<00:00:39.090> err<00:00:39.390> blocks<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
with the way they treat err blocks and I

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
with the way they treat err blocks and I
think<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.399> made<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.300> mistake<00:00:42.540> there

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
think they made a little mistake there

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.410 
think they made a little mistake there
or<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.620> sink<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:45.000> triggered

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
or we sink because there they triggered

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.290 
or we sink because there they triggered
a<00:00:45.510> bug<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.079> very<00:00:46.590> old<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:48.000> now<00:00:48.120> back

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
a bug that is very old and it's now back

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.869 
a bug that is very old and it's now back
we<00:00:48.960> will<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.260> no<00:00:49.410> mob<00:00:49.620> spawning<00:00:50.010> because<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
we will have no mob spawning because of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.479 
we will have no mob spawning because of
LC<00:00:51.329> value<00:00:51.809> related<00:00:52.140> things<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> look<00:00:53.309> at

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
LC value related things if you look at

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
LC value related things if you look at
it<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:54.270> I'm<00:00:54.570> standing<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.050> here's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it right now I'm standing here here's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.799 
it right now I'm standing here here's
the<00:00:55.469> LC<00:00:55.890> level<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> 79<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.270> because<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the LC level of 79 that is because I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.270 
the LC level of 79 that is because I
placed<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.469> block<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.489> before<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.020> go

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
placed a block here before if I go

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.460 
placed a block here before if I go
further<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.149> LC<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.379> on

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
further you can see LC you can see it on

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
further you can see LC you can see it on
the<00:01:04.559> top<00:01:04.739> left<00:01:05.070> there<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.700> numbers<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.540> are

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the top left there in the numbers we are

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.640 
the top left there in the numbers we are
at<00:01:07.040> 63<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> LC<00:01:10.619> level<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.299> low<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:13.020> around

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
at 63 and so LC level is low so around

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
at 63 and so LC level is low so around
us<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> game<00:01:14.700> does<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.600> mob

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
us what the game does now if for mob

is<00:01:58.890> filled<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.729> around<00:02:00.360> us<00:02:01.219> nothing<00:02:02.219> can

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
is filled in here around us nothing can

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.730 
is filled in here around us nothing can
spawn<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:04.979> quite<00:02:05.219> funny<00:02:05.430> sadly<00:02:06.740> yeah

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
spawn that is quite funny sadly yeah

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.180 
spawn that is quite funny sadly yeah
they<00:02:08.000> didn't<00:02:09.000> fix<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:10.080> sea<00:02:10.530> level<00:02:10.830> resets

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
they didn't fix that sea level resets

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250 
they didn't fix that sea level resets
itself<00:02:11.459> because<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.239> then<00:02:12.900> would<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.200> been

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
interests

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.050 
interests
but<00:02:14.049> if<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.319> place<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.590> block<00:02:14.980> now<00:02:15.310> over<00:02:15.640> there

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
but if I place a block now over there

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.259 
but if I place a block now over there
and<00:02:16.450> we<00:02:16.989> move<00:02:17.230> away<00:02:17.640> far<00:02:18.640> enough<00:02:19.030> we

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
and we move away far enough we

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.360 
and we move away far enough we
definitely<00:02:19.480> should<00:02:19.810> see<00:02:20.260> mob<00:02:20.650> spawning<00:02:20.980> going

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
definitely should see mob spawning going

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.000 
definitely should see mob spawning going
on<00:02:21.519> yep<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.360> see<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.739> skeleton

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
on yep you see that the skeleton

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.839 
on yep you see that the skeleton
spawning<00:02:24.610> well<00:02:25.330> now<00:02:25.540> what<00:02:25.750> happened<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.440> and

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
spawning well now what happened is and

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.490 
spawning well now what happened is and
massive<00:02:27.849> mob<00:02:28.060> spawning<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.900> now<00:02:29.319> what

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
massive mob spawning so now what

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.009 
massive mob spawning so now what
happened<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.010> here<00:02:30.790> we<00:02:31.000> have<00:02:31.150> an<00:02:31.299> higher<00:02:31.510> Elsi

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
happened is here we have an higher Elsi

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.229 
happened is here we have an higher Elsi
level<00:02:32.349> again<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.860> mentioned<00:02:33.129> now<00:02:33.430> we<00:02:33.489> have<00:02:33.700> 79

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
level again as mentioned now we have 79

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.720 
level again as mentioned now we have 79
as<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:35.140> placed<00:02:35.440> one<00:02:35.829> block<00:02:36.099> in<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.400> next

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
as I placed one block in the next

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.240 
as I placed one block in the next
section<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.510> LC<00:02:38.170> level<00:02:38.440> always<00:02:38.650> goes<00:02:39.040> in

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
section the LC level always goes in

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.119 
section the LC level always goes in
second<00:02:40.000> blocks<00:02:40.299> and<00:02:40.599> 16<00:02:41.049> blocks<00:02:41.319> increments

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
second blocks and 16 blocks increments

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.259 
second blocks and 16 blocks increments
you<00:02:42.909> know

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
you know

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.809 
you know
so<00:02:43.989> last<00:02:44.349> LC<00:02:45.010> value<00:02:45.340> was<00:02:45.549> 63<00:02:46.540> now<00:02:47.200> 79<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.400> then

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
so last LC value was 63 now 79 and then

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.080 
so last LC value was 63 now 79 and then
plus<00:02:49.090> 16<00:02:49.629> would<00:02:49.810> be<00:02:49.870> 95<00:02:50.620> if<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.310> go<00:02:51.519> higher<00:02:51.760> and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
plus 16 would be 95 if I go higher and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.930 
plus 16 would be 95 if I go higher and
yeah<00:02:52.629> now<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.200> game<00:02:53.620> checks<00:02:53.950> okay<00:02:54.099> here<00:02:54.640> we

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
yeah now the game checks okay here we

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.780 
yeah now the game checks okay here we
have<00:02:54.970> an<00:02:55.390> LC<00:02:55.750> level<00:02:56.049> that<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.379> 79<00:02:57.010> we<00:02:57.280> check<00:02:57.549> if

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
have an LC level that is 79 we check if

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.199 
have an LC level that is 79 we check if
up<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.120> LC<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.959> 79<00:02:59.590> mob<00:03:00.220> spawning<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.730> possible

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
up to LC of 79 mob spawning is possible

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.300 
up to LC of 79 mob spawning is possible
and<00:03:01.390> yes<00:03:01.569> indeed<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.049> also<00:03:02.470> over<00:03:02.769> there<00:03:03.010> at

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
and yes indeed and also over there at

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.330 
and yes indeed and also over there at
spawn<00:03:04.030> at<00:03:04.269> our<00:03:04.390> spawn<00:03:04.840> point<00:03:05.200> where<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:05.980> placed

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
spawn at our spawn point where I placed

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.539 
spawn at our spawn point where I placed
a<00:03:06.760> block<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:08.079> had<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> higher<00:03:08.470> LC<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:09.489> is

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
a block and we had a higher LC this is

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.180 
a block and we had a higher LC this is
why<00:03:09.849> only<00:03:10.239> at<00:03:10.510> these<00:03:10.720> two<00:03:10.959> spots<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.650> this

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
why only at these two spots in this

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.759 
why only at these two spots in this
whole<00:03:12.430> world<00:03:12.750> mobs<00:03:13.750> will<00:03:13.989> be<00:03:14.109> able<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.500> spawn

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
whole world mobs will be able to spawn

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.430 
whole world mobs will be able to spawn
in<00:03:15.069> a<00:03:15.549> real<00:03:15.790> world<00:03:16.120> if<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.629> go<00:03:16.780> down<00:03:17.109> now<00:03:17.379> you

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
in a real world if you go down now you

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.740 
in a real world if you go down now you
would<00:03:17.769> have<00:03:17.799> cave<00:03:18.220> systems<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.060> air<00:03:19.389> blocks

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
would have cave systems and air blocks

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.949 
would have cave systems and air blocks
and<00:03:19.989> open<00:03:20.319> spots<00:03:20.680> below<00:03:21.190> an<00:03:21.340> LC<00:03:21.760> level<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.150> 63

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
and open spots below an LC level of 63

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.110 
and open spots below an LC level of 63
that<00:03:23.260> would<00:03:23.410> mean<00:03:23.560> below<00:03:23.919> us<00:03:24.099> a<00:03:24.370> lot<00:03:24.819> of<00:03:24.940> mob

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
that would mean below us a lot of mob

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.970 
that would mean below us a lot of mob
spawning<00:03:25.419> would<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.900> course<00:03:26.109> happen<00:03:26.470> if<00:03:26.680> there

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
spawning would of course happen if there

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.539 
spawning would of course happen if there
was<00:03:27.340> case<00:03:27.669> so<00:03:28.389> yeah<00:03:29.109> I<00:03:29.349> don't<00:03:29.410> think<00:03:29.889> this<00:03:30.489> is

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
was case so yeah I don't think this is

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.420 
was case so yeah I don't think this is
intended<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:31.840> would<00:03:31.989> only<00:03:32.200> make<00:03:32.560> sense<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:33.220> mo

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
intended it would only make sense if mo

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.000 
intended it would only make sense if mo
Chang<00:03:33.700> would<00:03:33.910> make<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.329> LC<00:03:34.810> levels<00:03:35.349> reset

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
Chang would make the LC levels reset

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.449 
Chang would make the LC levels reset
which<00:03:36.549> is<00:03:36.730> sadly<00:03:37.120> still<00:03:37.299> not<00:03:37.750> happening<00:03:37.989> and

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
which is sadly still not happening and

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.520 
which is sadly still not happening and
sea<00:03:39.459> level<00:03:39.790> here<00:03:39.970> in<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.180> area<00:03:40.510> will<00:03:40.930> stay<00:03:41.230> at

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
sea level here in this area will stay at

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.689 
sea level here in this area will stay at
79

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
79

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.030 
79
it<00:03:42.879> gets<00:03:43.180> only<00:03:43.510> updated<00:03:44.019> client<00:03:44.410> site<00:03:44.680> but

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
it gets only updated client site but

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.580 
it gets only updated client site but
yeah<00:03:45.310> we<00:03:45.459> tested<00:03:45.879> it<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.269> end<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.840> we

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
yeah we tested it in the end and we

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.580 
yeah we tested it in the end and we
could<00:03:47.769> see<00:03:48.209> confirmation<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.419> let's<00:03:50.169> see<00:03:50.379> if

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
could see confirmation so let's see if

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.849 
could see confirmation so let's see if
they<00:03:50.769> fix<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.250> LC<00:03:51.730> resetting<00:03:52.449> back<00:03:52.840> then<00:03:53.590> it

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
they fix the LC resetting back then it

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.710 
they fix the LC resetting back then it
would<00:03:54.010> be<00:03:54.129> possible<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.639> make<00:03:54.910> really<00:03:55.389> really

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
would be possible to make really really

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.520 
would be possible to make really really
efficient<00:03:56.379> map<00:03:57.190> farms<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:57.819> yeah<00:03:58.299> times<00:03:59.260> where

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
efficient map farms and yeah times where

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.930 
efficient map farms and yeah times where
everybody<00:03:59.859> was<00:03:59.980> saying<00:04:00.190> we<00:04:00.310> need<00:04:00.459> air<00:04:00.669> locks

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
everybody was saying we need air locks

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.430 
everybody was saying we need air locks
air<00:04:01.120> blocks<00:04:01.389> air<00:04:01.599> blocks<00:04:01.930> might<00:04:02.889> change

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
air blocks air blocks might change

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.280 
air blocks air blocks might change
alright<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.859> yeah<00:04:06.160> we<00:04:06.489> also<00:04:06.699> have<00:04:07.290> command

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
alright and yeah we also have command

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.759 
alright and yeah we also have command
block<00:04:08.530> minecarts<00:04:09.160> now<00:04:09.340> check<00:04:10.239> it

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
block minecarts now check it

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.020 
block minecarts now check it
funny<00:04:11.769> thing<00:04:12.099> if<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.489> an<00:04:12.579> activator

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
funny thing if you have an activator

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.150 
funny thing if you have an activator
rail<00:04:13.239> that<00:04:13.419> is<00:04:13.510> activated<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.739> constantly

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
rail that is activated it constantly

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.520 
rail that is activated it constantly
does<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.519> command<00:04:15.819> here<00:04:16.120> for<00:04:17.019> now<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.169> told

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530

him I'm a command block in a minecart so
pretty<00:04:21.729> cool<00:04:21.940> for<00:04:22.539> map<00:04:22.719> makers<00:04:23.169> new<00:04:23.950> tools<00:04:24.219> to

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
pretty cool for map makers new tools to

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.330 
pretty cool for map makers new tools to
play<00:04:24.580> around

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
play around

you can find it only in Mesa biomes and
yeah<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.700> question<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.180> ask<00:04:48.330> yourself<00:04:48.419> what

block which is pretty cool I like the

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.350 
block which is pretty cool I like the
looks<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.229> it<00:05:04.410> should<00:05:05.370> be<00:05:05.520> interesting<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.060> use

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
looks of it should be interesting to use

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.230 
looks of it should be interesting to use
for<00:05:07.139> example<00:05:07.530> nice<00:05:07.800> walkways<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:08.729> passages

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240

many<00:05:12.540> of<00:05:12.780> us<00:05:13.020> got<00:05:13.710> fixed<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:14.280> way<00:05:14.460> boats

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
many of us got fixed the way boats

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.159 
many of us got fixed the way boats
behave<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:16.410> let<00:05:16.800> me<00:05:16.979> quickly<00:05:17.130> go<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:18.169> game-mode

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
behave so let me quickly go to game-mode

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.800 
behave so let me quickly go to game-mode
zero<00:05:19.620> survival<00:05:20.610> mode<00:05:20.790> jump<00:05:21.630> in<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.870> boat<00:05:22.070> and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
zero survival mode jump in the boat and

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:31.880 
zero survival mode jump in the boat and
yeah<00:05:24.950> you<00:05:25.950> can<00:05:26.130> see<00:05:26.340> it's<00:05:26.790> to<00:05:27.030> protect<00:05:30.890> awesome

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
yeah you can see it's to protect awesome

and sound however you say it but and

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.800 
and sound however you say it but and
before<00:05:47.250> there<00:05:47.400> was<00:05:47.520> this<00:05:47.669> crazy<00:05:47.970> pack<00:05:48.510> you

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
before there was this crazy pack you

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.810 
before there was this crazy pack you
know<00:05:48.930> when<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.289> sometimes<00:05:49.890> only<00:05:50.280> dropped<00:05:50.729> a

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
know when you sometimes only dropped a

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.880 
know when you sometimes only dropped a
half<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.210> block<00:05:51.360> onto<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:51.900> boat<00:05:52.169> dock<00:05:52.380> like<00:05:52.650> that

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
half a block onto a boat dock like that

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.010 
half a block onto a boat dock like that
you<00:05:53.310> suddenly<00:05:53.580> died<00:05:54.060> we<00:05:54.330> all<00:05:54.479> know<00:05:54.660> that<00:05:54.840> the

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
you suddenly died we all know that the

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.340 
you suddenly died we all know that the
boat<00:05:55.229> glitch<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.910> think<00:05:57.510> they<00:05:57.840> got<00:05:58.080> that

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
boat glitch and I think they got that

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.830 
boat glitch and I think they got that
covered<00:05:58.800> now<00:05:59.130> and<00:05:59.490> it<00:05:59.880> says<00:06:00.090> in<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.300> back<00:06:00.539> fix

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
covered now and it says in the back fix

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.620 
covered now and it says in the back fix
listed<00:06:01.650> that<00:06:01.830> was<00:06:02.070> taken<00:06:02.430> care<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.669> so<00:06:03.000> very

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
listed that was taken care of so very

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.480 
listed that was taken care of so very
simple<00:06:04.050> boat<00:06:04.260> dogs<00:06:04.590> like<00:06:04.889> that<00:06:04.919> should<00:06:05.340> be

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
simple boat dogs like that should be

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.000 
simple boat dogs like that should be
possible<00:06:05.700> now<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.479> hopefully<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.590> boats<00:06:07.800> are

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
possible now and hopefully the boats are

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.070 
possible now and hopefully the boats are
less<00:06:08.190> derpy<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:11.430> yeah<00:06:12.389> other<00:06:12.690> than<00:06:12.780> that

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
less derpy and yeah other than that

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.150 
less derpy and yeah other than that
there<00:06:13.260> were<00:06:13.380> some<00:06:13.560> improvements<00:06:13.800> to

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
there were some improvements to

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.730 
there were some improvements to
stability<00:06:14.820> and<00:06:15.120> so<00:06:15.330> on<00:06:15.539> mainly<00:06:16.110> there<00:06:16.350> working

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
stability and so on mainly there working

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.680 
stability and so on mainly there working
on<00:06:16.889> the<00:06:17.039> way<00:06:17.160> air<00:06:17.460> blocks<00:06:17.729> are<00:06:17.910> treated<00:06:18.300> and

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
on the way air blocks are treated and

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.469 
on the way air blocks are treated and
yet<00:06:19.260> still<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:20.010> lot<00:06:20.490> of<00:06:20.520> bugs<00:06:20.880> in<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.180> snapshot

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
yet still a lot of bugs in the snapshot

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.529 
yet still a lot of bugs in the snapshot
I<00:06:21.750> think<00:06:22.440> we<00:06:22.590> will<00:06:22.770> see<00:06:22.979> a<00:06:23.010> B<00:06:23.580> or<00:06:23.789> C<00:06:23.820> snapshot

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
I think we will see a B or C snapshot

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.240 
I think we will see a B or C snapshot
coming<00:06:25.020> although<00:06:25.350> dinnerbone<00:06:25.800> wants<00:06:26.100> to
