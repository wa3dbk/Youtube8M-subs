how big those babies really are there's
two<00:02:51.250> miniature<00:02:51.610> canons<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:54.550> focal<00:02:54.880> length<00:02:54.910> on

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
two miniature canons the focal length on

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.250 
two miniature canons the focal length on
these<00:02:55.480> two<00:02:55.720> lenses<00:02:56.200> are<00:02:56.440> between<00:02:57.269> 23<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.540> 24

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
these two lenses are between 23 and 24

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.100 
these two lenses are between 23 and 24
inches<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.760> voigtländer<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.810> left

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
inches the voigtländer is on the left

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.759 
inches the voigtländer is on the left
that's<00:03:02.440> approximately<00:03:03.160> an<00:03:03.819> f4<00:03:04.420> lens<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:05.260> might

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
that's approximately an f4 lens it might

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.080 
that's approximately an f4 lens it might
be<00:03:06.280> slightly<00:03:06.760> faster<00:03:07.000> than<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:08.819> but<00:03:09.819> it's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
be slightly faster than that but it's

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.540 
be slightly faster than that but it's
right<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.660> neighborhood<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.739> cone<00:03:12.250> lens

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
right in that neighborhood the cone lens

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.990 
right in that neighborhood the cone lens
on<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:13.000> right<00:03:13.380> its<00:03:14.380> neck<00:03:14.860> down<00:03:15.190> on<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.580> inside

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
on the right its neck down on the inside

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.990 
on the right its neck down on the inside
a<00:03:16.030> little<00:03:16.360> bit<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:16.870> it's<00:03:17.050> not<00:03:17.260> quite<00:03:17.530> as<00:03:17.860> fast

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
a little bit so it's not quite as fast

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.600 
a little bit so it's not quite as fast
but<00:03:19.000> they're<00:03:19.180> both<00:03:19.420> big<00:03:19.810> monster<00:03:20.470> fast<00:03:21.010> lenses

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
but they're both big monster fast lenses

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.539 
but they're both big monster fast lenses
they<00:03:22.360> stand<00:03:22.720> over<00:03:23.079> 16<00:03:23.530> inches<00:03:23.829> tall<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.400> they

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
they stand over 16 inches tall and they

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.259 
they stand over 16 inches tall and they
weigh<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:25.120> good<00:03:25.840> portion<00:03:26.170> of<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.560> ton<00:03:26.829> so<00:03:27.549> stay

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
weigh a good portion of a ton so stay

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.630 
weigh a good portion of a ton so stay
