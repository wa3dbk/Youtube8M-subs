00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.890
 nobody knows how the idea of 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.590
 paste gum on walls but today we go 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.160
 to go to the biggest gum wall 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.230
 of the world let's go to sitel usa 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.720
 probably this is one of the 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.670
 most disgusting walls and with more 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.880
 germs that exist on the planet 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.490
 land actually takes more than 10 years 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.310
 sticking gum and despite having 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.460
 cleaned several times already is wall to 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.060
 today has more than 15 centimeters 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.160
 of gum thickness let's say that of 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.930
 stick so much gum on others 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.240
 there are more than 15 centimeters thick 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.490
 it's awesome I do not think it can 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.130
 to become the people the case is that the 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.800
 People today value this wall 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.680
 as if it were a real attraction 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.560
 Sitel tourist indeed occupies 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.110
 first places on tripadvisor with what 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.590
 which gives a lot to think about not as a 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.070
 person can conceive a wall 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.330
 full of gum like a work of art 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.060
 but that's how it is 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.460
 in fact as you can see in the photos the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.160
 amount of chewing gum stuck along 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.160
 10 years is overwhelming there is not even a 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.800
 only space where there is no 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.720
 gum stuck do not also say that the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.650
 extension is quite large are 15 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.870
 meters 15 meters of wall 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.760
 and good looks that people continue 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.100
 sticking their chewing gum there and even 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.130
 papers such as the city pass of 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.470
 sitel paste everything do some 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.730
 some figures sculptures in short a 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 little of everything under my criteria I do not achieve 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.010
 understand where all this came from but 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.580
 it's not the first place I see with 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.530
 chewing gums 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.100
 in fact itself if you go to any 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.880
 theme park or if you go to an area very 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.640
 busy there are walls that tend to be 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.890
 covered in chewing gum seems that in 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.470
 how many gums are stuck in 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.570
 a zone 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.390
 people can not help but take out the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.450
 chewing gum out of your mouth and sticking yours in that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.940
 good area is a fashion that does not have 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.340
 no explanation and that to this day 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.820
 well as I already said the sitel 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.530
 It is an authentic tourist attraction 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.260
 much larger than some of the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.540
 Main tourist attractions 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.230
 monumental that has curious sitel 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.230
 but true
