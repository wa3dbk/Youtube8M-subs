00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.719 

I<00:01:06.789> go<00:01:07.450> okay<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.649> acoustic<00:01:09.009> sounds<00:01:09.310> good<00:01:09.490> what

I go okay the acoustic sounds good what
they've<00:01:09.880> got<00:01:10.829> five<00:01:11.829> positions<00:01:12.340> switch<00:01:12.610> on

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
they've got five positions switch on

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.500 
they've got five positions switch on
this<00:01:12.939> one

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.910 

you've<00:01:15.990> got<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> volume<00:01:16.500> bass<00:01:17.160> and<00:01:17.490> treble<00:01:18.920> so

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you've got a volume bass and treble so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.040 
you've got a volume bass and treble so
you<00:01:20.010> can<00:01:20.160> adjust<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.700> kinds<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> things<00:01:21.360> if

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
you can adjust all kinds of things if

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.050 
you can adjust all kinds of things if
you<00:01:22.260> want<00:01:22.410> a<00:01:22.440> little<00:01:22.590> more<00:01:22.710> jungle

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.210 

so<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> first<00:01:28.200> setting<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.010> acoustic

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
so the first setting is the acoustic

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
so the first setting is the acoustic
setting<00:01:29.790> which<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.990> an<00:01:31.140> under<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> board

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
which is right in here body sensors back

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.399 
which is right in here body sensors back
here<00:01:41.790> now<00:01:42.790> we<00:01:43.330> go<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.720> second<00:01:44.080> setting

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
here now we go to the second setting

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.020 
here now we go to the second setting
which<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.590> going<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.890> be<00:01:45.010> just<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.430> humbucking

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030

a<00:03:41.340> lot<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.370> tones<00:03:42.670> out<00:03:42.879> of<00:03:42.939> this<00:03:43.090> thing

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
a lot of tones out of this thing

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.099 
humbucker and the onboard humbucking up
here<00:03:55.959> in<00:03:56.400> parallel<00:03:57.400> which<00:03:58.390> is<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.599> kind<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.930> cool

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
here in parallel which is a kind of cool

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:11.910 
here in parallel which is a kind of cool
jazzy<00:03:59.680> tone<00:03:59.920> it's<00:04:00.340> kind<00:04:00.579> of<00:04:00.700> helped<00:04:00.909> a<00:04:10.920> little

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
jazzy tone it's kind of helped a little

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.199 
jazzy tone it's kind of helped a little
different<00:04:12.250> voicing<00:04:12.609> then<00:04:12.760> when<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.030> go<00:04:13.180> to

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
different voicing then when you go to

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.849 
different voicing then when you go to
the<00:04:13.480> next<00:04:13.629> which<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:14.049> putting<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.379> pickups<00:04:14.709> in

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
the next which is putting the pickups in

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:23.220 
the next which is putting the pickups in
series

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.200 

a<00:04:23.350> little<00:04:24.160> more<00:04:24.280> output<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:24.790> it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.239 

works<00:04:28.210> good

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:34.249 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:35.709 

different<00:04:34.849> sound<00:04:35.059> between<00:04:35.179> those<00:04:35.479> two

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:35.719 
different sound between those two

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.469 
different sound between those two
settings<00:04:36.139> real<00:04:36.589> cool<00:04:37.099> so<00:04:37.729> while<00:04:38.239> I<00:04:38.269> was

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
settings real cool so while I was

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:51.100 
settings real cool so while I was
playing<00:04:38.979> my<00:04:42.489> skepticism<00:04:45.669> lost

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.590 

this<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:52.040> really<00:04:52.310> good<00:04:52.610> sign<00:04:52.820> of<00:04:52.850> guitars<00:04:53.330> I

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
this is really good sign of guitars I

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.770 
this is really good sign of guitars I
think<00:04:53.810> for<00:04:54.020> working<00:04:54.500> for<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:54.830> working<00:04:55.220> musician

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.300 

you<00:04:59.780> get<00:04:59.900> this<00:05:00.050> thing<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.350> break<00:05:00.560> up<00:05:00.740> nicely<00:05:00.980> so

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
you get this thing to break up nicely so

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.250 
you get this thing to break up nicely so
then<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.460> wanted<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:01.880> try<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.600> at

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
then I wanted to try it and at

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.800 
then I wanted to try it and at
humbucking<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.790> gas<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.300> with<00:05:05.420> a<00:05:05.450> couple

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
humbucking and gas it with a couple

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.170 
humbucking and gas it with a couple
different<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:06.470> couple<00:05:07.400> different<00:05:07.670> pedals<00:05:07.970> to

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
different a couple different pedals to

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.440 
different a couple different pedals to
see<00:05:08.330> what<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.570> would<00:05:08.660> do<00:05:09.910> so<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:10.970> used<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.240> pro

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
see what it would do so I used the pro

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.200 
see what it would do so I used the pro
analogue<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.590> boost<00:05:12.800> Royale<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:14.030> tube

analogue the boost Royale and the tube

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.780 
analogue the boost Royale and the tube
screamer<00:05:14.360> together<00:05:15.250> just<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.340> see<00:05:16.520> what<00:05:16.670> the

screamer together just to see what the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:36.869 
screamer together just to see what the
heck<00:05:16.910> it<00:05:17.060> would<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.450> would<00:05:17.540> bring<00:05:17.780> for

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:43.049 

and<00:05:37.469> it<00:05:38.469> works<00:05:38.800> holy<00:05:39.699> cow<00:05:40.059> it<00:05:40.270> works<00:05:42.059> for
