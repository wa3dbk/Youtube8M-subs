00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.780

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.280
 there is someone who will not take us to the page 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.280
 load of the subject 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.950
 Well, here they are shown the photo 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.570
 example of how that subject 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.270
 and here are the buttons and this is for 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.289

 I turn the desk for faster 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.960
 equality 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.340
 and as you can see, it does not weigh anything to go down super 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.969
 Quick 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.570
 and then let's go now the installation here 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:09.899
 is the issue that we download that 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.899
 download I give you right click copy 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.319
 and then now let's go to the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.030
 to the unit of our ps the unit of 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.080
 memory of our p esp I have it for 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.110

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.659
 They can also be downloaded from the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.040
 pp browser and I also think it 's 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.470
 faster out there just have to have 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.470
