00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
of the basic components of the game so

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.750 
of the basic components of the game so
the<00:00:51.030> Bulls<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.960> oxen<00:00:52.380> move<00:00:52.860> via<00:00:53.130> cards<00:00:53.610> at

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the Bulls and the oxen move via cards at

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.250 
the Bulls and the oxen move via cards at
the<00:00:53.790> start<00:00:54.150> of<00:00:54.180> every<00:00:54.330> turn<00:00:54.630> there<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.050> four

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the start of every turn there are four

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.980 
the start of every turn there are four
rounds<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.770> game<00:00:56.030> players<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.240> get<00:00:57.390> five

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
rounds in the game players will get five

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.770 
rounds in the game players will get five
movement<00:00:58.770> cards<00:00:59.040> like<00:00:59.310> so<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.880> bowls<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
movement cards like so so bowls the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
movement cards like so so bowls the
black<00:01:00.960> ones<00:01:01.200> are<00:01:01.710> controlled<00:01:02.190> by<00:01:02.340> these<00:01:02.400> cards

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
black ones are controlled by these cards

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
black ones are controlled by these cards
so<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.480> three<00:01:03.720> eight<00:01:03.840> would<00:01:03.960> move<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.530> two

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
so the three eight would move one two

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.419 
so the three eight would move one two
three<00:01:05.189> until<00:01:06.149> it<00:01:06.270> runs<00:01:06.479> into<00:01:06.659> somebody<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:07.429 
three until it runs into somebody in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:10.580 
three until it runs into somebody in
savagely<00:01:08.429> Gore's<00:01:08.759> Li<00:01:08.939> oxen<00:01:09.929> the<00:01:10.229> same<00:01:10.439> way

oxen and you want to position it in such

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.070 
oxen and you want to position it in such
a<00:02:57.549> way<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.330> can<00:02:58.480> actually<00:02:58.599> use<00:02:58.840> your

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
a way that you can actually use your

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.530 
a way that you can actually use your
your<00:02:59.530> Bulls<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.130> your<00:03:00.700> your<00:03:00.880> animals<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.390> try

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
your Bulls and your your animals to try

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.509 
your Bulls and your your animals to try
to<00:03:01.630> guard<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.650> for<00:03:02.830> example<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.370> was

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
to guard you so for example if I was

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.039 
to guard you so for example if I was
blue<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.790> might<00:03:04.120> have<00:03:04.239> wanted<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.510> go<00:03:04.630> here

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
blue I might have wanted to go here

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.080 
blue I might have wanted to go here
because<00:03:05.560> then<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.099> try<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.340> make<00:03:06.819> sure<00:03:06.970> that

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
because then I can try to make sure that

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.449 
because then I can try to make sure that
my<00:03:07.239> oxen<00:03:07.720> doesn't<00:03:07.989> run<00:03:08.170> me<00:03:08.349> over<00:03:08.380> it's<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.280> game

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
my oxen doesn't run me over it's a game

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.890 
my oxen doesn't run me over it's a game
that's<00:03:09.640> really<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.940> lot<00:03:10.120> about<00:03:10.299> positioning

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
that's really a lot about positioning

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.320 
that's really a lot about positioning
when<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.140> comes<00:03:11.349> right<00:03:11.440> down<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:12.330> these

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
when it comes right down to it these

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.690 
when it comes right down to it these
little<00:03:13.450> spaces<00:03:13.780> these<00:03:14.410> run<00:03:14.860> over<00:03:15.130> guys<00:03:15.310> are

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
little spaces these run over guys are

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.880 
little spaces these run over guys are

obstacles when you've run into them you

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.490

have<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.100> stop<00:03:18.130> moving<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.930> game<00:03:20.079> starts

out<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.680> ordinary<00:03:39.069> then<00:03:39.819> once<00:03:39.970> that's

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
out of the ordinary then once that's

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.300 
out of the ordinary then once that's
gone<00:03:40.299> people<00:03:40.959> play<00:03:41.200> depending<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.040> where

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
gone people play depending on where

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.270 
gone people play depending on where
their<00:03:42.489> bulls<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.880> oxen<00:03:43.269> are<00:03:43.389> so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
their bulls and oxen are so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.460 
their bulls and oxen are so
hypothetically<00:03:45.280> if<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:45.459> was<00:03:45.609> like<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:49.470> this

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
hypothetically if I was like this this

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.740 
hypothetically if I was like this this
guy<00:03:50.590> well<00:03:51.040> these<00:03:51.250> guys<00:03:51.430> would<00:03:51.670> go<00:03:51.850> then<00:03:52.600> this

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
guy well these guys would go then this

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.110 
guy well these guys would go then this
oxen<00:03:53.260> then<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:53.920> runner<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.549> moves<00:03:54.819> from

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
oxen then this runner it moves from

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.300 
oxen then this runner it moves from
right<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.600> left<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.109> positioning<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.069> really

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
right to left so positioning is really

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.780 
right to left so positioning is really
key<00:03:57.549> so<00:03:58.329> player<00:03:59.310> making<00:04:00.310> sure<00:04:00.489> I'm<00:04:00.639> on<00:04:00.730> the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
key so player making sure I'm on the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.220 
key so player making sure I'm on the
right<00:04:01.000> side<00:04:01.030> here<00:04:01.420> because<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:02.079> trouble

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
right side here because I have trouble

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.500 
right side here because I have trouble
telling<00:04:02.470> right<00:04:02.739> from<00:04:02.920> left<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:04.090> player<00:04:04.299> who

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
telling right from left the player who

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.819 
telling right from left the player who
is<00:04:04.540> closest<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.079> right<00:04:05.319> he<00:04:05.500> will<00:04:05.620> get<00:04:05.739> to

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
is closest to the right he will get to

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.440 
is closest to the right he will get to
go<00:04:05.859> first<00:04:06.220> if<00:04:06.430> everybody's<00:04:06.819> in<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.030> same<00:04:07.239> row

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
go first if everybody's in the same row

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.970 
go first if everybody's in the same row
so<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.900> always<00:04:08.170> try<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.530> make<00:04:08.739> sure<00:04:08.769> that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
so you always try to make sure that

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.069 
so you always try to make sure that
you're<00:04:09.579> closest<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.209> edge<00:04:10.420> positioning

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
you're closest to that edge positioning

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.849 
you're closest to that edge positioning
is<00:04:11.200> really<00:04:11.410> critical<00:04:11.829> for<00:04:11.859> this<00:04:13.049> if<00:04:14.049> on<00:04:14.380> your

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
is really critical for this if on your

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.680 
is really critical for this if on your
turn<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:15.340> have<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.790> bad<00:04:16.000> luck<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.539> have<00:04:16.570> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
turn you have the bad luck to have a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.870 
turn you have the bad luck to have a
bull<00:04:16.959> move<00:04:17.200> into<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.680> would<00:04:17.799> say<00:04:18.039> orange

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
bull move into you it would say orange

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.670 
bull move into you it would say orange
just<00:04:19.150> isn't<00:04:19.419> spry<00:04:19.690> enough<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.470> green

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
just isn't spry enough and the green

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.659 
just isn't spry enough and the green
bull<00:04:20.950> moves<00:04:21.159> into<00:04:21.519> him<00:04:21.640> he<00:04:22.599> gets

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
bull moves into him he gets

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.159 
bull moves into him he gets

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
when your gourd you're taken out of this

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.839 
when your gourd you're taken out of this
particular<00:04:25.620> round<00:04:25.770> any<00:04:26.189> points<00:04:26.729> you've

for<00:04:36.300> having<00:04:36.389> gored<00:04:36.719> somebody<00:04:37.139> when<00:04:37.860> you're

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
for having gored somebody when you're

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.769 
for having gored somebody when you're
trampled<00:04:38.520> it's<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.729> little<00:04:38.939> different<00:04:39.330> if

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:39.779 
trampled it's a little different if

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.080 
trampled it's a little different if
let's<00:04:40.409> say<00:04:40.469> green<00:04:40.860> got<00:04:41.069> trampled<00:04:41.520> by<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.879> one

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
let's say green got trampled by that one

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.709 
let's say green got trampled by that one
he<00:04:42.749> gets<00:04:43.560> knocked<00:04:43.800> down<00:04:43.979> but<00:04:44.819> he<00:04:44.909> only<00:04:45.120> but

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
he gets knocked down but he only but

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.200 
he gets knocked down but he only but
he's<00:04:45.870> get<00:04:46.650> back<00:04:46.830> up<00:04:47.039> again<00:04:47.279> next<00:04:47.460> turn<00:04:47.759> it's

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
he's get back up again next turn it's

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.929 
he's get back up again next turn it's
not<00:04:48.360> ideal<00:04:48.539> but<00:04:49.080> in<00:04:49.800> some<00:04:50.069> ways<00:04:50.219> actually<00:04:50.580> it's

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
not ideal but in some ways actually it's

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.749 
not ideal but in some ways actually it's
can<00:04:51.629> be<00:04:51.719> a<00:04:51.749> good<00:04:52.620> strategy<00:04:52.949> to<00:04:53.340> have<00:04:53.460> your<00:04:53.610> own

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
can be a good strategy to have your own

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.909 
can be a good strategy to have your own
ox<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.360> trample<00:04:54.749> you<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.169> you<00:04:55.229> can<00:04:55.469> basically

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
ox and trample you so you can basically

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.559 
ox and trample you so you can basically
be<00:04:56.279> protected<00:04:56.759> if<00:04:56.849> it<00:04:56.969> comes<00:04:57.150> right<00:04:57.300> down<00:04:57.360> to

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
be protected if it comes right down to

to<00:05:27.180> evaluating<00:05:27.779> the<00:05:27.900> game<00:05:28.490> it's<00:05:29.490> really<00:05:29.610> fun

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
to evaluating the game it's really fun

to evaluating the game it's really fun
with<00:05:30.180> four<00:05:30.419> players<00:05:30.689> once<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.139> actually

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
with four players once you actually

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.800 
with four players once you actually

decipher the rules the rulebook

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.929 
decipher the rules the rulebook
I'm<00:05:34.500> not<00:05:34.710> sure<00:05:34.860> if<00:05:34.949> it's<00:05:35.069> a<00:05:35.129> translation<00:05:35.460> issue

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:35.939 
I'm not sure if it's a translation issue

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.459 
I'm not sure if it's a translation issue
or<00:05:36.360> I'm<00:05:36.479> not<00:05:36.629> sure<00:05:36.870> if<00:05:36.990> it's<00:05:37.139> just<00:05:37.259> not

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
or I'm not sure if it's just not

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:38.510 
or I'm not sure if it's just not

we<00:05:38.879> spent<00:05:39.210> my<00:05:39.659> group<00:05:39.870> of<00:05:39.990> friends<00:05:40.319> a<00:05:40.500> half<00:05:41.370> an

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
we spent my group of friends a half an

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.010 
we spent my group of friends a half an
hour<00:05:41.639> trying<00:05:41.939> to<00:05:42.060> figure<00:05:42.180> out<00:05:42.389> exactly<00:05:42.479> how<00:05:42.930> to

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
hour trying to figure out exactly how to

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.499 
hour trying to figure out exactly how to
play<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.409> game<00:05:43.560> which<00:05:44.550> is<00:05:44.699> unfortunate

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
play the game which is unfortunate

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:46.519 
play the game which is unfortunate
because<00:05:45.599> it's<00:05:45.839> actually<00:05:45.960> a<00:05:46.139> pretty<00:05:46.289> simple

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:46.529 
because it's actually a pretty simple

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.200 
because it's actually a pretty simple
game<00:05:46.830> once<00:05:47.069> you<00:05:47.159> break<00:05:47.339> into<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.639> mechanics<00:05:48.120> I

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
game once you break into the mechanics I

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.269 
game once you break into the mechanics I
feel<00:05:48.389> like<00:05:48.509> I<00:05:48.629> had<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.199> down<00:05:49.409> once<00:05:49.740> I<00:05:49.860> sat<00:05:50.099> there

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
feel like I had it down once I sat there

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.610 
feel like I had it down once I sat there
and<00:05:50.310> played<00:05:50.610> it<00:05:50.789> but<00:05:51.599> a<00:05:51.659> little<00:05:51.990> intimidating

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
and played it but a little intimidating

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.129 
and played it but a little intimidating
to<00:05:52.649> start<00:05:53.069> with<00:05:53.279> so<00:05:53.580> that's<00:05:54.300> not<00:05:54.509> ideal<00:05:54.569> maybe

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
to start with so that's not ideal maybe

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.749 
to start with so that's not ideal maybe
it's<00:05:55.319> better<00:05:55.469> in<00:05:55.649> different<00:05:55.949> languages<00:05:56.460> maybe

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
it's better in different languages maybe

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.579 
it's better in different languages maybe
it's<00:05:57.270> just<00:05:57.389> an<00:05:57.539> English<00:05:57.810> localization

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:58.589 
it's just an English localization

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:01.909 
it's just an English localization
problem<00:05:59.210> I<00:06:00.210> do<00:06:00.870> think<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.289> game<00:06:01.439> really<00:06:01.800> only

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
problem I do think the game really only

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.579 
problem I do think the game really only
works<00:06:02.159> with<00:06:02.399> four<00:06:02.639> with<00:06:03.240> two<00:06:03.509> you<00:06:03.960> don't<00:06:04.469> have

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:04.589 
works with four with two you don't have

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:05.749 
works with four with two you don't have
as<00:06:04.710> many<00:06:04.800> bowls<00:06:05.129> and<00:06:05.250> you<00:06:05.339> don't<00:06:05.490> have<00:06:05.580> as<00:06:05.669> many

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
as many bowls and you don't have as many

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.969 
as many bowls and you don't have as many
runners<00:06:06.060> there's<00:06:06.389> just<00:06:06.569> too<00:06:06.659> much<00:06:06.779> space<00:06:07.080> it

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
runners there's just too much space it

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.950 
runners there's just too much space it
doesn't<00:06:08.520> really<00:06:08.669> have<00:06:08.969> the<00:06:09.180> same<00:06:09.360> energy<00:06:09.569> that

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
doesn't really have the same energy that

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.170 
doesn't really have the same energy that
a<00:06:09.990> four-person<00:06:10.589> game<00:06:10.770> does<00:06:10.979> so<00:06:11.310> if<00:06:12.000> you're

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
a four-person game does so if you're

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.029 
a four-person game does so if you're
gonna<00:06:12.300> forget<00:06:12.449> this<00:06:12.750> count<00:06:13.379> on<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:13.620> being<00:06:13.710> four

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
gonna forget this count on it being four

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.769 
gonna forget this count on it being four
people<00:06:16.339> it's<00:06:17.339> a<00:06:17.460> I<00:06:17.699> would<00:06:18.210> rank<00:06:18.360> it<00:06:18.509> actually

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
people it's a I would rank it actually

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.360 
people it's a I would rank it actually
it's<00:06:18.870> a<00:06:18.899> pretty<00:06:19.080> high<00:06:19.259> beer<00:06:19.800> and<00:06:19.949> pretzels

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
it's a pretty high beer and pretzels

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.559 
it's a pretty high beer and pretzels
game<00:06:20.550> it's<00:06:20.729> something<00:06:20.969> you<00:06:21.089> sit<00:06:21.300> back<00:06:21.419> and

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
game it's something you sit back and

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:22.790 
game it's something you sit back and
play<00:06:21.719> with<00:06:21.839> your<00:06:21.930> friends<00:06:21.990> once<00:06:22.439> you<00:06:22.560> know<00:06:22.649> the

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
play with your friends once you know the

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.850 
play with your friends once you know the
rules<00:06:23.719> there's<00:06:24.719> strategy<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.529> there's<00:06:25.710> some

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
rules there's strategy and there's some

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.529 
rules there's strategy and there's some
positioning<00:06:26.310> that<00:06:26.399> goes<00:06:26.580> into<00:06:26.879> it<00:06:27.029> but<00:06:27.210> it's

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
positioning that goes into it but it's

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:28.879 
positioning that goes into it but it's
still<00:06:27.659> laid-back<00:06:27.990> enough<00:06:28.529> that<00:06:28.710> you<00:06:28.770> could

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
still laid-back enough that you could

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.860 
still laid-back enough that you could
basically<00:06:29.189> watch<00:06:29.639> a<00:06:29.759> movie<00:06:30.089> and<00:06:30.389> do<00:06:30.599> it<00:06:30.750> with

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
basically watch a movie and do it with

that<00:06:33.469> way<00:06:34.240> overall<00:06:35.240> giving<00:06:35.869> this<00:06:36.110> ranking<00:06:36.589> I

that way overall giving this ranking I

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.409 
that way overall giving this ranking I
would<00:06:36.889> put<00:06:37.039> it<00:06:37.129> in<00:06:37.219> about<00:06:37.399> a<00:06:37.430> seven<00:06:37.819> I'm<00:06:37.999> not

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
would put it in about a seven I'm not

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.779 
would put it in about a seven I'm not
sure<00:06:38.569> I'd<00:06:38.719> always<00:06:38.960> want<00:06:39.289> to<00:06:39.319> play<00:06:39.439> it<00:06:39.680> but<00:06:40.399> if<00:06:40.639> I

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
sure I'd always want to play it but if I

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.429 
sure I'd always want to play it but if I
just<00:06:40.969> want<00:06:41.089> to<00:06:41.149> hang<00:06:41.300> out<00:06:41.419> with<00:06:41.479> people<00:06:41.960> it

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:42.439 
just want to hang out with people it

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:45.699 
just want to hang out with people it
seems<00:06:42.619> like<00:06:42.710> a<00:06:42.800> good<00:06:42.919> wheel<00:06:43.490> out
