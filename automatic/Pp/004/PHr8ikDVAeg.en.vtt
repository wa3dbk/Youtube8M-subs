been using I've been using compost I've
been<00:02:02.460> sifting<00:02:02.759> through<00:02:02.789> my<00:02:03.030> compost<00:02:03.539> pile

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
been sifting through my compost pile

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.080 
been sifting through my compost pile
just<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.520> check<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
just to check it out and kind of

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.260 
just to check it out and kind of
recalibrate<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.729> make<00:02:09.729> sure<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:10.090> kind

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
recalibrate it and make sure it's kind

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.120 
recalibrate it and make sure it's kind
of<00:02:10.300> doing<00:02:10.539> what<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.690> want<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.260> just<00:02:11.770> strung<00:02:12.010> up

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
of doing what I want I just strung up

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.420 
of doing what I want I just strung up
this<00:02:12.280> tarp<00:02:12.610> here<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.660> try<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.370> I'll<00:02:15.370> probably

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
this tarp here to try to I'll probably

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.300 
this tarp here to try to I'll probably
do<00:02:15.880> something<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.209> little<00:02:16.390> better<00:02:16.510> later<00:02:16.840> on

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
do something a little better later on

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.730 
do something a little better later on
but<00:02:18.310> that'll<00:02:18.610> help<00:02:18.730> kind<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.060> feed<00:02:19.530> make<00:02:20.530> sure

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
but that'll help kind of feed make sure

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.800 
but that'll help kind of feed make sure
the<00:02:20.890> castings<00:02:22.080> fall<00:02:23.080> into<00:02:23.350> those<00:02:23.470> tubs<00:02:23.860> and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the castings fall into those tubs and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.140 
the castings fall into those tubs and
you'll<00:02:25.810> see<00:02:26.020> on<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> construction<00:02:26.650> here<00:02:27.150> I've

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
you'll see on the construction here I've

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.380 
you'll see on the construction here I've
got<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.450> axle<00:02:28.930> I've<00:02:29.440> got<00:02:29.680> two<00:02:29.890> struts<00:02:30.400> a

either<00:02:41.950> end<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.760> buckets<00:02:43.060> on<00:02:43.180> either<00:02:43.330> end<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
either end the buckets on either end and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.240 
either end the buckets on either end and
and<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:46.600> axle<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.290> then<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.830> just<00:02:48.010> put<00:02:48.220> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
and that axle and then I just put a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.630 
and that axle and then I just put a
piece<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:51.220> little<00:02:51.519> piece<00:02:51.700> right<00:02:51.910> here<00:02:51.970> is

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
piece this little piece right here is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.890 
piece this little piece right here is
running<00:02:54.640> down<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.970> center<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.390> act<00:02:55.600> as<00:02:55.750> kind

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
running down the center to act as kind

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.380 
running down the center to act as kind
of<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.140> paddle<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.620> keep<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.010> started<00:02:57.489> but<00:02:58.239> I'm

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
of a paddle to keep it started but I'm

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.820 
of a paddle to keep it started but I'm
going<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.569> see<00:02:58.750> if<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.140> show<00:02:59.350> you<00:02:59.410> how<00:02:59.680> it

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
going to see if I can show you how it

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:19.970 
going to see if I can show you how it
how<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.160> works<00:03:00.400> here

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.010 

so<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.430> know<00:03:21.520> there's<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:22.450> not<00:03:22.630> exactly

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
so you know there's it's not exactly

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.770 
so you know there's it's not exactly
what<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.290> want<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.620> yet<00:03:24.069> but<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:25.510> doing

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
what I want it just yet but it's doing

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.229 
what I want it just yet but it's doing
pretty<00:03:25.989> good<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.160> compost<00:03:27.790> it's<00:03:28.090> not

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
pretty good and this is compost it's not

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.140 
pretty good and this is compost it's not
my<00:03:28.390> warm<00:03:28.630> bed<00:03:28.750> but<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:30.370> will<00:03:30.550> get<00:03:30.730> some<00:03:30.910> little

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
my warm bed but you will get some little

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.530 
my warm bed but you will get some little
little<00:03:31.600> bitty<00:03:31.870> guys<00:03:32.700> stuck<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.910> mesh<00:03:34.150> here

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
little bitty guys stuck in the mesh here

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.940 
little bitty guys stuck in the mesh here
and<00:03:35.849> those<00:03:36.849> are<00:03:37.030> actually<00:03:37.739> European<00:03:38.739> night

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
and those are actually European night

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.680 
and those are actually European night
crawlers<00:03:39.489> or<00:03:39.730> what<00:03:40.120> we've<00:03:40.269> always<00:03:40.450> referred

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
crawlers or what we've always referred

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.470 
crawlers or what we've always referred
to<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:41.110> Texas<00:03:41.620> as<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.900> earthworms<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.709> so

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
to in Texas as just earthworms and so

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.059 
to in Texas as just earthworms and so
they're<00:03:46.480> coming<00:03:46.750> up<00:03:46.930> into<00:03:47.110> my<00:03:47.200> compost<00:03:47.680> pile

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
they're coming up into my compost pile

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.940 
they're coming up into my compost pile
of<00:03:48.340> feeding<00:03:48.610> on<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.819> organic<00:03:49.299> matter<00:03:49.540> and

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
of feeding on that organic matter and

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.610 
of feeding on that organic matter and
getting<00:03:50.950> warm<00:03:51.280> I'm<00:03:51.459> assuming<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.620> this

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
getting warm I'm assuming in this this

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.220 
getting warm I'm assuming in this this
unseasonally<00:03:54.540> cold<00:03:55.540> winter<00:03:55.840> we're<00:03:55.989> having

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
unseasonally cold winter we're having

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.470 
unseasonally cold winter we're having
here<00:03:56.380> in<00:03:56.470> San<00:03:56.680> Antonio

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
here in San Antonio

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.670 
here in San Antonio
after<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.569> clean-out<00:03:58.780> today<00:03:59.110> this<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.500> some

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
after the clean-out today this is some

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.250 
after the clean-out today this is some
of<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.890> coarser<00:04:00.610> material<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:01.360> was<00:04:01.510> was

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
of the coarser material that was was

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.190 
of the coarser material that was was
harvested<00:04:02.799> but<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:04.420> really<00:04:04.810> nice<00:04:04.989> I

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
harvested but it is it is really nice I

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.650 
harvested but it is it is really nice I
could<00:04:05.260> run<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.590> through<00:04:05.709> again<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:06.660> separate

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
could run it through again and separate

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.199 
could run it through again and separate
a<00:04:07.690> little<00:04:07.840> more<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.290> here's<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.590> look<00:04:08.739> at<00:04:08.890> the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
a little more and here's a look at the

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.729 
a little more and here's a look at the
the<00:04:10.209> finer<00:04:10.510> product<00:04:11.430> he<00:04:12.430> came<00:04:12.640> through<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.090> I

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
the finer product he came through the I

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.460 
the finer product he came through the I
guess<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.769> one-eighth<00:04:15.700> inch<00:04:15.730> screen<00:04:16.470> anyway

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
guess the one-eighth inch screen anyway

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.420 
guess the one-eighth inch screen anyway
that's<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:19.049> little<00:04:20.049> bit<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.289> worm<00:04:20.470> castings<00:04:21.130> but

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
that's a little bit of worm castings but

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.300 
that's a little bit of worm castings but
mostly<00:04:21.760> its<00:04:22.000> compost<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.990> did<00:04:23.410> one<00:04:23.650> worm<00:04:24.010> run

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
mostly its compost I did one worm run

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.200 
mostly its compost I did one worm run
with<00:04:24.640> one<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:24.940> my<00:04:25.030> flow<00:04:25.270> through<00:04:25.479> bins<00:04:25.720> and

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
with one of my flow through bins and

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.110 
with one of my flow through bins and
boxed<00:04:28.210> up<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.450> worms<00:04:28.660> there<00:04:29.580> got<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.610> box<00:04:30.880> of

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
boxed up the worms there got a box of

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.670 
boxed up the worms there got a box of
night<00:04:31.330> crawlers<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:31.870> then<00:04:32.140> most<00:04:32.350> of<00:04:32.470> them<00:04:32.620> are

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
night crawlers and then most of them are

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.070 
night crawlers and then most of them are
red<00:04:32.830> worm
