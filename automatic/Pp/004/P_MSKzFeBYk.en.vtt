and whether we're successful or not it's

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.470 
and whether we're successful or not it's
always<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> challenge<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> there's<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.150> few

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
always a challenge so there's a few

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.900

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
hints that I can give you to get grass

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.210 
hints that I can give you to get grass
to<00:00:24.210> grow<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.600> shade<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:25.800> none<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> them

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to grow in shade but if none of them

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.620 
to grow in shade but if none of them
work<00:00:26.519> then<00:00:26.939> you're<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.180> gonna<00:00:27.359> probably

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
work then you're just gonna probably

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.390 
work then you're just gonna probably
have<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> give<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.590> grow<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> moss<00:00:29.099> garden

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
have to give up and grow a moss garden

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.910 
have to give up and grow a moss garden
in<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.820> area<00:00:30.179> especially<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.590> live<00:00:31.740> in

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
in that area especially if you live in

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280 
in that area especially if you live in
the<00:00:32.040> northwest<00:00:32.480> but<00:00:33.480> here's<00:00:33.750> some<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the northwest but here's some of the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.160 
the northwest but here's some of the
reasons<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.640> cannot<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.660> grass<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
reasons that you cannot get grass to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.290 
reasons that you cannot get grass to
grow<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.620> shade<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.190> number<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
grow in your shade a number one is

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.670 
grow in your shade a number one is
because<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.719> don't<00:00:39.840> water<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> shade

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
because you don't water in the shade

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.340 
because you don't water in the shade
this<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.399> kind<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.760> my<00:00:41.969> shady<00:00:42.360> area<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.079> my

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this is kind of my shady area of my

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.650 
this is kind of my shady area of my
front<00:00:43.620> yard<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> fall<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
front yard and it's in the fall it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.880 
front yard and it's in the fall it
looked<00:00:45.899> pretty<00:00:46.079> good<00:00:46.230> over<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> summer

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
looked pretty good over the summer

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100 
looked pretty good over the summer
actually<00:00:47.160> cuz<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:47.820> watering<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> time

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
actually cuz I was watering all the time

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.529 
actually cuz I was watering all the time
but<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.770> haven't<00:00:50.129> been<00:00:50.399> watering<00:00:50.789> lately<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but I haven't been watering lately and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.160 
but I haven't been watering lately and
because<00:00:52.289> there's<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.620> big<00:00:52.890> trees<00:00:53.190> above<00:00:53.730> me

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
because there's these big trees above me

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
because there's these big trees above me
everything<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.469> turning<00:00:56.340> brown<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.390> if

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
everything is turning brown you know if

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
everything is turning brown you know if
I<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:58.020> put<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.350> sprinklers<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
I would put some sprinklers out here and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.599 
I would put some sprinklers out here and
water<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.620> would<00:01:01.859> green<00:01:02.129> right

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
water really well this would green right

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.670 
water really well this would green right
up<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> grass<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> sunnier

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
up just like the grass in the sunnier

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340 
up just like the grass in the sunnier
areas<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.360> number<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.689> reason<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
areas have so the number one reason that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
areas have so the number one reason that
your<00:01:07.619> grass<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.220> growing<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> shade

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
your grass is not growing in the shade

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
your grass is not growing in the shade
is<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.570> drying<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.950> water

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
is because it's drying out so just water

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.940 
is because it's drying out so just water
it<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.549> you'll<00:01:11.700> find<00:01:11.970> it'll<00:01:12.180> help<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.570> lot

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
it and you'll find it'll help a lot

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
it and you'll find it'll help a lot
another<00:01:13.950> trick<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.670> found<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.150> helps<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
another trick that I found that helps a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
another trick that I found that helps a
lot<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.990> putting<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.680> bit<00:01:17.100> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
lot is just putting a little bit of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.490 
lot is just putting a little bit of
compost<00:01:17.640> over<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:18.270> area<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> soil<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
compost over your area if the soil is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.249 
compost over your area if the soil is
just<00:01:19.770> clay<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:21.000> sand<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.869> there's<00:01:22.049> no

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
just clay or sand or there's no

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
just clay or sand or there's no
nutrition<00:01:22.470> down<00:01:23.009> there<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.939> by<00:01:24.090> putting<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
nutrition down there just by putting a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.690 
nutrition down there just by putting a
little<00:01:24.570> layer<00:01:24.960> soil<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.040> putting<00:01:26.220> lots

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
little layer soil and just putting lots

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.480 
little layer soil and just putting lots
of<00:01:26.939> grass<00:01:27.180> seed<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.780> area<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:29.280> doing

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
of grass seed in that area then doing

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.700 
of grass seed in that area then doing
that<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.180> fall<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.990> spring<00:01:31.110> every

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that in the fall and the spring every

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
that in the fall and the spring every
year<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> couple<00:01:32.670> years<00:01:32.850> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
year for do it for a couple years it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.920 
year for do it for a couple years it
usually<00:01:34.020> will<00:01:34.200> grow<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:35.070> very<00:01:35.400> well

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
usually will grow in very very well

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.480 
usually will grow in very very well
another<00:01:36.930> trick<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.799> cut<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> couple<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
another trick it's just cut a couple the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.609 
another trick it's just cut a couple the
branches<00:01:39.060> out<00:01:39.270> from<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> lower<00:01:39.930> parts<00:01:40.409> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
branches out from the lower parts of

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.710 
branches out from the lower parts of
your<00:01:40.740> trees<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.340> it'll<00:01:41.970> allow<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> lot<00:01:42.689> more

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
your trees and it'll allow a lot more
