00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.020
 the signal 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.059
 Germany's most successful hard-rocker 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.520
 quite often at the concerts for the series 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.349
 mtv unplugged, the scorpions have theirs 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.050
 Electric guitars against acoustic guitars 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.240
 not exchanged the only novum for 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.810
 the rock dinosaur the biggest 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.470
 Changeover was certainly the announcement of 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.929
 sth 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.730
 we would like to have all the musicians on 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.830
 to put the stage 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.390
 in the reason but also very clear here 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.739
 it is not about the big show but it 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.739
 it's just about the music 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.089
 and there beside new songs the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.100
 Classics are not lacking in the economic 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.659
 greece was to occur 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.379
 a conscious one for the german band 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.989
 decision 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.750
 the thought in a political 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.579
 difficult tense time to say 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.710
 is easy with your friends too 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.600
 celebrate when there is something to celebrate but 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.369
 when your friends are lying on the ground 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.629
 then shows where your friends are 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.409
 and that was one of the reasons 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.729
 together 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.060
 we go to greece we go 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.060
 to athens 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.230
 in september the musicians turn off 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.230
 Hanover on the way 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.280
 on 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.730
 and the Greek fans are already waiting 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.730
 at sea 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.250
 in the lykabettus amphitheater finds that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.010
 spectacle instead 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.970
 the first mtv unplugged concert under 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.370
 free sky 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 that's what the scorpions have to offer 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.150
 invited musical guests 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.210
 Johannes Strate from a hamburger band 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.610
 I'm the same as a revolver hero 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.259
 grown up with your music and 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.790
 hurricane is a rock you like a 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.070
 hurricane is one of my favorite 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.560
 tracks and that would be the song that I am 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.340
 would like to sing with you and with you 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.340
 would shape 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.670
 also the former singer of 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.709
 norwegian band a-ha morten 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.950
 harket tomorrow was one of the first of the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.500
 for the project has promised and had 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.090
 shaped wind of change and I believe it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.260
 also a very nice and unusual 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.340
 become version because he is a very 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.340
 has extraordinary voice 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.610
 the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.660
 morning 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.190
 Actually, the scorpions wanted to 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.840
 last year 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.840
 but there is no talk of that now 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.069
 Just start again through the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.799
