00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
of them have skills some of them just

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.959

like<00:00:47.670> hard<00:00:48.300> scope<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> shit<00:00:48.930> out<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.079> me<00:00:49.200> but

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
like hard scope the shit out of me but

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.010 
like hard scope the shit out of me but
the<00:00:50.969> other<00:00:51.090> should<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.390> their<00:00:51.539> own<00:00:51.570> playlist

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
the other should have their own playlist
and<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.440> probably<00:00:52.739> appreciate<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.910> I'd

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and I probably appreciate it like I'd

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.090 
and I probably appreciate it like I'd
probably<00:00:54.480> takes<00:00:54.899> Knight<00:00:55.170> being<00:00:55.410> more<00:00:55.620> serious

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
probably takes Knight being more serious

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.889 
probably takes Knight being more serious
if<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> had<00:00:56.520> his<00:00:56.730> own<00:00:56.879> playlist<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.719> could

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
if it had his own playlist and I could

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
if it had his own playlist and I could
actually<00:00:58.050> try<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> uh<00:00:59.340> like<00:01:00.090> snipe<00:01:00.329> some

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
actually try to uh like snipe some

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.130 
actually try to uh like snipe some
people<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.960> stuff<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.980> um<00:01:02.420> onto<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.870> map

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
people out and stuff but um onto the map

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990 
people out and stuff but um onto the map
and<00:01:04.409> stuff<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.369> lot<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.760> don't

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and stuff because a lot of you don't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840 
and stuff because a lot of you don't
even<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> map<00:01:07.020> pack<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.640> Xbox<00:01:08.640> is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
even have the map pack because Xbox is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.730 
even have the map pack because Xbox is
favored<00:01:09.330> over<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.750> ps3<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> don't<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.500> why<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
favored over the ps3 I don't know why I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.380 
favored over the ps3 I don't know why I
think<00:01:11.310> Xbox<00:01:11.670> displays<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> money

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
think Xbox displays a lot of money

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.170 
think Xbox displays a lot of money
instead<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.990> ps3<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.159> ps3<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.760> free<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
instead of ps3 you know ps3 is free and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
instead of ps3 you know ps3 is free and
stuff<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.259> get<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.619> much

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
stuff so they don't really get that much

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.429 
stuff so they don't really get that much
revenue<00:01:17.159> except<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> microsoft<00:01:19.080> point

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
revenue except for the microsoft point

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.080
