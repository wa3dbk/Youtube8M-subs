Hey okay just I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:06.299> make<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.839> UM<00:00:07.140> like<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.010> psychedelic<00:00:09.080> okay

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
to make the UM like a psychedelic okay

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.450 
to make the UM like a psychedelic okay
like<00:00:11.280> stuff<00:00:11.730> like<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.889> it's<00:00:13.889> pretty<00:00:14.309> awesome

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
like stuff like this it's pretty awesome

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
ingredient anyway you're going to find a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.120 
ingredient anyway you're going to find a
gradient<00:00:20.279> tool<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:21.109> now<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
gradient tool here now if you have the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
gradient tool here now if you have the
paint<00:00:23.400> bucket<00:00:23.760> tool<00:00:23.789> instead<00:00:24.470> you<00:00:25.470> should

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
paint bucket tool instead you should

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.400 
paint bucket tool instead you should
want<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.769> hold<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> down<00:00:26.990> click<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> gradient

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
want to hold it down click the gradient

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.959 
want to hold it down click the gradient
tool<00:00:30.769> they<00:00:31.769> could<00:00:32.009> pick<00:00:32.189> whichever<00:00:32.550> one<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
tool they could pick whichever one you

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.270 
tool they could pick whichever one you
want

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
want

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.720 
want
yeah<00:00:35.719> pick<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.989> mode<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.500> want<00:00:37.680> make<00:00:38.579> sure

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
yeah pick the mode you want make sure

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.360 
yeah pick the mode you want make sure
you<00:00:38.790> set<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.329> difference<00:00:45.890> yeah<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
you set this to difference yeah then you

00:00:47.370 --> 00:01:08.660 
you set this to difference yeah then you
do<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> line<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.270> it<00:01:07.100> when<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.430> it's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
do a line for it when you think it's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
do a line for it when you think it's
best<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.360> start<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:17.040> should<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
best you can start you should do the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.740 
best you can start you should do the
lines<00:01:17.670> any<00:01:17.939> way<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.090> want<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> could<00:01:18.540> change

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
lines any way you want you could change

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
lines any way you want you could change
the<00:01:18.960> modes<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.619> well<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> modes<00:01:20.250> but

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the modes as well not the modes but

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.230 
the modes as well not the modes but
whether<00:01:21.330> these<00:01:21.540> things<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.170> why<00:01:22.290> they

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
whether these things up here why they

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.240 
whether these things up here why they
are<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> gradient<00:01:24.689> shut<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.100> can

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
are you a gradient shut up then you can

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.859 
are you a gradient shut up then you can
make<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.490> different<00:01:26.909> things<00:01:26.939> inside<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
make like different things inside it so

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.010 
make like different things inside it so
you<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.229> diamond<00:01:28.680> thing<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:30.020> over

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you got a diamond thing over there over

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.520 
you got a diamond thing over there over
here<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.790> one<00:01:32.790> over<00:01:33.090> there

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:51.700 

this<00:01:39.530> one<00:01:48.130> fish<00:01:49.960> make<00:01:50.960> these<00:01:51.110> blend<00:01:51.350> in<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.560> bit

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
this one fish make these blend in a bit

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:06.010 
this one fish make these blend in a bit
more<00:02:02.830> do<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:04.100> when<00:02:04.370> it<00:02:04.550> smudge<00:02:04.910> tool<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:05.600> by

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
more do that when it smudge tool now by

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.050 
more do that when it smudge tool now by
default<00:02:06.260> it's<00:02:06.680> normally<00:02:07.220> set<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.790> their

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
default it's normally set to their

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.420 
default it's normally set to their
history<00:02:08.690> brush<00:02:09.020> tool<00:02:09.080> just<00:02:09.980> hold<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.340> down

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
history brush tool just hold that down

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.760 
history brush tool just hold that down
okay<00:02:10.790> wrong<00:02:10.940> one

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
I lost it there it go it's normally on

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.170 
I lost it there it go it's normally on
the<00:02:22.460> shark<00:02:22.760> or<00:02:23.060> blur<00:02:23.300> tool<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:24.040> triangle<00:02:25.040> yeah

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.490

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
then you should want to set it to the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.080 
then you should want to set it to the
smudge<00:02:30.830> tool<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.850> then<00:02:32.140> smudge<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:37.520> don't

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
smudge tool and then smudge it I don't

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.270 
smudge tool and then smudge it I don't
know<00:02:38.180> about<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.630> -<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:39.400> would<00:02:40.400> be<00:02:40.430> strength

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
know about it - that would be strength

so ruined I wouldn't recommend you put

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.390 
so ruined I wouldn't recommend you put
it<00:03:16.909> too<00:03:17.090> high<00:03:17.379> it's<00:03:18.379> just<00:03:18.620> made<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.889> big<00:03:19.129> smudge

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
it too high it's just made a big smudge

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:32.979 
it too high it's just made a big smudge
not<00:03:22.400> really<00:03:25.299> it's<00:03:26.299> pretty<00:03:26.540> awesome<00:03:31.989> display

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
not really it's pretty awesome display

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.539 
not really it's pretty awesome display
for<00:03:33.199> this<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.439> stop<00:03:35.829> when<00:03:36.829> did<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.069> decide<00:03:37.129> to

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
for this to stop when did I decide to
