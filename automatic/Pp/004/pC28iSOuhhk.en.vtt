00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.240
 but 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.680
 in this new chapter about the fields 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.570
 of technical school practices 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.940
 superior of agronomists of the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.770
 Let Universidad Politecnica de Madrid 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.930
 to know the cultivation of plants 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.760
 forage 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.070
 the forage plants are 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.020
 constituted by all those species 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.239
 plants that in their entirety or in 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.460
 some of its vegetative parts are 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.310
 susceptible to be used as 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.110
 food for the canal 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.300
 in the school's practice camps 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.490
 there is an important livestock hut 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.890
 that depends on the department of 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.470
 animal production for sustenance 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.170
 it is necessary to have several stops 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.310
 of different species to ensure a 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.310
 forage production 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.980
 with this reason the department has 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.079
 permanently of a plot 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.829
 planted with alfalfa and another with 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.590
 ryegrass 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.330
 on the margin of these permanent plots 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.490
 many others that are not 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.410
 employed for some project are occupied 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.190
 with forages that are obtained by mixing 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.230
 vetch and cereal seeds 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.540
 the maintenance of these grasslands of the 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.120
 own livestock hut is oriented to the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.490
 student training in the case that 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.590
 deals with forage plants the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.560
 ultimate purpose is to offer the student 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.090
 a global vision of the crop from the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.860
 preparation of the ground until its 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.140
 harvesting through planting 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.060
 fertilization irrigation installation and 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.490
 mechanization 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.170
 We will now look into 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 some of the stages of the process 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.509
 the plots are maintained with irrigation by 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.189
 Conventional cover spray with 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.659
 the water that comes from a large pond 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.900
 that is recharged from a spring 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.880
 close by naturally this water is 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.409
 enough to cover the needs 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.539
 of the crops of the fields 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.880
 through a modern pumping equipment 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.549
 boosts water to the last point of 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.890
 the irrigation network a large part of the risks 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.590
 they are automated by a modern 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.330
 programmer 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.700
 as a complement to the theoretical classes 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.220
 the practice camps offer 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.750
 teachers and students a space for 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.269
 check first hand all the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.920
 field work always alfalfas 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.980
 keeps for five years so 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.570
 that rotate all crops improving 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.610
 the seeds of the ways as is 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.590
 so to work with this type of 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.910
 seeds we can not use a 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.370
 sower to chorrillo as we use 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.070
 some cereals we have to use a 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.540
 Seeder behind the features 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.220
 of the crop before seeing a bit the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.840
 machinery the characteristics of 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.820
 cultivation is a grape crop for 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.380
 forage what does this mean 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.300
 related to livestock areas 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.550
 cuts that usually give you come to be 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.530
 of 4 or 5 depending on the areas worth 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.600
 with less than 4 cuts or 3 cut in the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.600
 zone is not optimal for future 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.360
 in the practice fields the harvest is 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.120
 performed with a drum mower or with 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.190
 double blade cutting bar the most 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.840
 used is the latter thanks to its 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.959
 perfect adaptation to all kinds of 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.879
 crops and this state thereof 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.830
 machine works with a scissor that 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.959
 performs an almost perfect cut that 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.049
 favors the regrowth of the plant for a 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.970
 new subsequent cut annually 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.930
 they get five cuts of alfalfa and two 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.930
 cuts of ryegrass 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.489
 once the forage is harvested, it is left 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.200
 dry in the field normally to the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.810
 two days of the harvest is proceeded to 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.090
 led with rotary rake this 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.340
 machine allows making laces with great 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.829
 aeration capacity where to finish the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.819
 drying of the forage thus allowing a 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.819
 perfect unified 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.710
 after two days after being led 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.310
 collects the forage with baler 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.210
 conventional prismatic farkas 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.130
 exceptionally when the teaching of 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.590
 the practices requires it is proceeded with 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.390
 broken balers though the use of this 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.910
 machine has no reason to be in 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.260
 small land areas here is 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.670
 used for the students of the 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.950
 Higher technical school of engineers 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.510
 agronomists can carry out practices with 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.510
 them taken fourth in wins 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.520
 let's see how they are doing here 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.639
 these chains 6 teachers 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.780
 corresponding 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.210
 and the adapted system drive 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.930
 of the bale but fixed in the part 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.080
 front of a shaft with a series of 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.789
 older the forage obtained is collected 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.650
 with trailer with a load of bales 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.180
 hydraulic and it takes to the 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.770
 livestock facilities where 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.779
 uses as animal feed in the 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.779
 trials that allow or advise
