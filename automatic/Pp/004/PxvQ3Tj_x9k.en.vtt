00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 this 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.200
 league leader 1 qualified in 8th of 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.660
 champions league final psg 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.730
 insatiable also wants shone in the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.439
 national cups and tonight at the park 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.970
 princes presents himself the titleholder 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.130
 of this league cup the ace 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.080
 Saint-Etienne team that the psg does not have 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.640
 managed to beat in the last 4 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.109
 oppositions the greens that had 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.119
 eliminated the Parisians in quarterfinals 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.010
 final the past season so there is a 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.260
 revenge for the Parisians who 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.300
 evolves without alex riberas nor maxwell 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.300
 shower she holds in the goals 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.219
 Parisians take control of 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.670
 operations very quickly along 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:53.059
 balloon to lucas worthy the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.149
 withdrawal for marco verras you will see ti 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.859
 at the second pole the control of cavani 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.859
 is impeccable a technical sequence 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.930
 high class from el matador 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.119
 the right foot hook full of blood 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.170
 cold for eliminated ruffier then 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.709
 mark in the empty goal 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.709
 in the 24th minute the psg leads 1 to 0 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:19.550
 everything is perfect lucas worthy in 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.990
 passing through mr ati and for edinson 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.170
 cavani at the finish 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.000
 it's the 17th goal in 23 games for 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.619
 cavani under the colors of psg all 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.619
 competitions and the joy of el 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.739
 matador is perfectly logical 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.340
 the Parisians dominated cavani a 

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:44.239
 a lot brought and not bad on the side 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.890
 also lukasz very stirring it is 

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:47.890
 strikes a stéphane ruffier vigilant 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.829
 and saint-etienne in all this is going to have 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.360
 two shy reactions the passing of 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.119
 legs of franck tabanou and the striking 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.810
 chained the ball was slightly 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.159
 deviated by marquinhos and nicolas douchez 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.229
 was vigilant it was the first 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.030
 intervention of the ex porter rennais ce 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.610
 Paris night again on the offensive with 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.780
 edison cavani who keep on rezoning 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.370
 had said that is countered in a 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.540
 first time by the back of perrin and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.989
 then ruffier makes the difference 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.880
 1-0 for psg at half time and this 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.739
 advantage to the score perfectly reflects the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.170
 physiognomy of the first 45 minutes 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.049
 sin wants to score this break goal 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.860
 why not with this free kick laup 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:43.060
 breaks and that comes flirting the amount of 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.799
 stéphane ruffier and saint-etienne who 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.739
 is still standing still alive who 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.769
 lends itself to believe the hit of renaud 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.430
 cohade blocked without problem by 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.430
 nicolas shower 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.560
 Paris wants to score that second goal that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.540
 would facilitate the end of the game cavani 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.640
 is well served by javier pastore who 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.670
 had come into play a few 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.489
 minutes earlier the cavani check 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.329
 is good the typing is slightly too much 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:22.010
 cross and Saint Stephen's blow seized 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:25.769
 his luck in the 78th minute 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.139
 The French Cleric's Pass is cut by 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.989
 mevlut erding he is not in position 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.879
 out of the game the former Parisian 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.129
 the call is excellent in the back of 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.669
 marquinhos and just ahead van der wiel 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.950
 a true goal of center forward 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:43.129
 mevlut erding who hands the two teams 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.590
 tied 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:50.060
 and white laurent knows her team is going 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.500
 having to play overtime 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.689
 it's not necessarily a good thing to 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.639
 a few days of a shock in the league 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.930
 facing Lille and Parisians want 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.419
 give everything to pass this round 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.950
 van der wiel in his works he 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.319
 time and recalls for 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.810
 javier pastore 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.760
 the ball does not go far 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.519
 ruffier post that was masked by 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.829
 a forest of white laurent players do not 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.419
 not see his players for the moment 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.070
 make a difference even if you have to 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.590
 evidence of a dominance that was a 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.180
 little bit symptomatic throughout 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.500
 this part 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.780
 blaise matuidi who made his entry into 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.900
 play also for will he see the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.349
 vera offset ti for the ménez ménez 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.150
 second pole for edinson cavani at 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.539
 tip extensions 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.480
 the paris saint germain flies two to 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:46.260
 double it for cavani 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.400
 and the beautiful service of Jeremy lead him 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.260
 also came into play in the place of lavezzi 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.050
 edison cavani truly the man of 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.870
 this meeting a doubled he had no 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.770
 ceases to call harassing and 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.560
 to make movements to seissan the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.620
 psg wins 2 goals to 1 after 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.390
 suspense is finally imposed against 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.310
 Saint-Etienne and especially qualifies 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.620
 for the next round where a displacement 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.910
 perilous in Bordeaux will wait for men 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.910
 of white laurent in january
