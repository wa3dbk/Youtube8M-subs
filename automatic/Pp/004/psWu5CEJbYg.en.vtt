00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.990 
why can't they just keep the team
together<00:03:54.180> that's<00:03:54.599> that's<00:03:55.169> it<00:03:55.349> that<00:03:55.560> was<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.680> big

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
together that's that's it that was a big

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.240 
together that's that's it that was a big
complaint<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.510> me<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.290> again<00:03:58.769> about<00:03:59.099> the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
complaint to me and again about the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.189 
complaint to me and again about the
gameplay<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.939> would<00:04:00.120> make<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.419> easier<00:04:00.629> to<00:04:01.079> do

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
gameplay this would make it easier to do

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.719 
gameplay this would make it easier to do
different<00:04:01.680> things<00:04:01.709> instead<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.280> look<00:04:02.549> down

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
different things instead of look down

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.339 
different things instead of look down
range<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.299> shoot<00:04:03.449> everything<00:04:03.810> if<00:04:04.079> there<00:04:04.260> was

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
range and shoot everything if there was

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.729 
range and shoot everything if there was
an<00:04:04.439> improved<00:04:04.799> squad<00:04:05.189> mechanic<00:04:06.319> not<00:04:07.319> as<00:04:07.470> dense

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
an improved squad mechanic not as dense

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.559 
an improved squad mechanic not as dense
as<00:04:07.949> Rainbow<00:04:08.370> six<00:04:08.639> but<00:04:08.819> some<00:04:09.000> were<00:04:09.120> kind<00:04:09.389> of<00:04:09.449> in

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
as Rainbow six but some were kind of in

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.059 
as Rainbow six but some were kind of in
the<00:04:09.629> middle<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.109> can<00:04:10.259> say<00:04:10.409> squads<00:04:10.799> stay

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
the middle so you can say squads stay

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.039 
the middle so you can say squads stay
here<00:04:11.370> I'll<00:04:11.609> go<00:04:11.639> around<00:04:12.000> kind<00:04:12.509> of<00:04:12.569> my<00:04:12.689> brothers

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
here I'll go around kind of my brothers

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.770 
here I'll go around kind of my brothers
in<00:04:13.109> arms<00:04:13.439> I<00:04:13.620> think<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.370> would<00:04:14.549> change<00:04:15.479> it<00:04:15.689> up

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
in arms I think that would change it up

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.210 
in arms I think that would change it up
a<00:04:15.900> little<00:04:15.930> bit<00:04:16.139> like<00:04:16.409> the<00:04:16.560> squad<00:04:16.859> commands

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
a little bit like the squad commands

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.819 
a little bit like the squad commands
there<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.269> essentially<00:04:18.900> none<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.440> can<00:04:19.590> trade

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
there is essentially none you can trade

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.069 
there is essentially none you can trade
weapons<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.430> can<00:04:20.579> trade<00:04:20.760> ammo<00:04:21.000> but<00:04:21.930> that's

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
weapons you can trade ammo but that's

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.360 
weapons you can trade ammo but that's
about<00:04:22.289> it<00:04:22.349> i<00:04:22.469> think<00:04:22.680> that's<00:04:22.950> disappointing

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
about it i think that's disappointing

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.270 
about it i think that's disappointing
for<00:04:23.820> you

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
for you

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.780 
for you
pretty<00:04:24.850> heavy<00:04:25.090> squad-based<00:04:25.570> gate<00:04:26.460> so<00:04:27.460> the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
pretty heavy squad-based gate so the

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.520 
pretty heavy squad-based gate so the
look<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.120> game<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.600> very<00:04:28.750> well<00:04:29.020> done<00:04:29.230> it

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
look of the game is very well done it

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.410 
look of the game is very well done it
looks<00:04:29.710> good<00:04:30.010> definitely<00:04:30.970> looks<00:04:31.090> better<00:04:31.150> than

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
looks good definitely looks better than

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.420 
looks good definitely looks better than
the<00:04:31.480> first<00:04:31.750> two<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.650> sound<00:04:32.919> is<00:04:33.010> very<00:04:33.190> well

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
the first two the sound is very well

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.760 
the first two the sound is very well

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.029 
why people do it's really great to see
dedicated<00:06:22.900> servers<00:06:23.260> and<00:06:23.440> a<00:06:23.500> good<00:06:23.680> connection

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
dedicated servers and a good connection

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.070 
dedicated servers and a good connection
finally<00:06:24.760> after<00:06:25.000> Australians<00:06:25.630> had<00:06:25.750> to<00:06:25.870> put<00:06:26.050> up

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
finally after Australians had to put up

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.360 
finally after Australians had to put up
with<00:06:26.169> so<00:06:26.380> much<00:06:26.410> hit<00:06:26.740> number<00:06:27.039> one<00:06:27.190> and<00:06:27.340> number

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
with so much hit number one and number

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.010 
with so much hit number one and number
two<00:06:27.669> it<00:06:27.789> was<00:06:27.880> terrible<00:06:28.300> connection<00:06:28.539> so<00:06:28.900> it's

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
two it was terrible connection so it's

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.779 
two it was terrible connection so it's
good<00:06:29.200> to<00:06:29.229> see<00:06:29.320> that<00:06:29.470> it<00:06:30.039> is<00:06:30.100> kind<00:06:30.520> of<00:06:30.640> fun

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
good to see that it is kind of fun

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.120 
good to see that it is kind of fun
sometimes<00:06:31.330> but<00:06:31.600> to<00:06:31.720> me<00:06:31.900> I<00:06:31.930> kind<00:06:32.680> of<00:06:32.770> equate<00:06:33.010> it

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
sometimes but to me I kind of equate it

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.770 
sometimes but to me I kind of equate it
to<00:06:33.159> like<00:06:33.370> halo<00:06:33.729> where<00:06:33.970> if<00:06:34.240> you're<00:06:34.330> really<00:06:34.630> good

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
to like halo where if you're really good

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.029 
to like halo where if you're really good
at<00:06:34.810> it<00:06:34.930> you<00:06:35.140> will<00:06:35.260> enjoy<00:06:35.440> it<00:06:35.710> and<00:06:35.800> if<00:06:35.919> you're

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
at it you will enjoy it and if you're

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:36.550 
at it you will enjoy it and if you're
not<00:06:36.220> you

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
not you

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.129
