00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.340
 what's up, kid, it's a new 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.930
 video of the 1.56 guys came out yesterday 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.400
 Wednesday then let's make a video 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.019
 of how the minecraft for will be 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.810
 some say that the bay transformers 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.760
 errors and so on this good 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.890
 and it works for me is not normal if 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.840
 because you 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.509
 if it is not because you make a step 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.130
 bad something good let's give this 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.230
 explanation step by step since the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.849
 1.5 tomorrow we start already with the videos 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.099
 of the mods and setter endorsements 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.100
 let's go to the beginning and write to whom 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:37.239
 says look let's put percent to 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.200
 data percent attacks so I have to 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.920
 I said I got entangled all percent 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.920
 to percent data we go to the enter key 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.560
 and we go with a folder called point 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.060
 minecraft that we will be here double click 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.320
 and good what we are going to do here 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.660
 boys is to eliminate the vile folder what 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.460
 let's move the folder to the trash 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.670
 While we will delete the folder re 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670
 source 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.450
 there's the one you know 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.670
 where do you have your maps so 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.550
 we're not going to eliminate that because if the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.930
 erase your maps will be deleted 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.160
 written are the images that is if 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.800
 you do not want to have the image is 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.940
 good and this does not matter is to give this I do not know 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.860
 what is in fact 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.600
 it's the texture and the texture 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.370
 we leave it this way, it's ok, it 's not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.770
 eliminate because these are the servers 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.690
 that you have then what we are going 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.220
 to do let's close this is worth what 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.550
 we close let's go to the pages that 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.560
 I read in the description and let's go here 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.690
 all the versions of the force will be 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.660
 all the most recent will always be 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.750
 up that would be the 1.5 voucher in this 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.660
 If the 1.5 universal fashion worth 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.300
 universal we click here we go here is not going to 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.840
 leave the dead suite page we wait 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.200
 we hope we wait 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.939
 we wait three seconds five seconds 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.380
 there we are going to jump advertising and we 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.450
 you have to download the automatic 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.549
 ok then let's move this to 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.840
 close by writing to the desk so that 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.850
 it becomes easier for us 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.690
 let's go let's go 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.690
 could he have spent 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.660
 come on let's go to the desk we minimize 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.120
 this and we're going to open this file to a 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.260
 point of knowledge to open this 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.330
 file has to have a file 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.710
 called winrar if they do not have it although the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.840
 most have it but those who do not 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.750
 they have good look for double winrar vale 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.520
 then we were double click we will leave 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.050
 this type of interface is the same as 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.270
 the right will have all these files 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.300
 and et cetera etcetera what we are going to 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.100
 to do now boys is to go to our 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.709
 mike is worth them and how to eliminate and how 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.720
 we removed the bing folder and solve and 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.580
 what we eliminate is worth and the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.290
 we're going to inter it will not start 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.330
 load this up so it does not hurt to 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.400
 sumatra do not worry that it will not 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.870
 start loading this we hope I do not know if 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.180
 you who alkalize fast or to me 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.950
 will charge little fast as good to download 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.690
 the good folders and the folders that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.820
 missing that we eliminate vale to create 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.560
 new ones and that is clean cited 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.050
 our point meter mark point 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.880
 I hope I'm going to pass the video 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.470
 I do not I will not be more I will 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.470
 put in fast camera from now 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.180
 good as it is ending already 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.700
 finished already very well and we will leave the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.200
 1.5 here is worth nothing, let's go to single 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.330
 player to remove our worlds because 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.160
 we do not delete the folders you know now 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.600
 close the minecraft and we will open the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.520
 micro form no longer we have it open and 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.920
 let's go to the same address as 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.440
 put percentages appdata percentage 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.069
 we give the enter key and we will search 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.170
 another in the minecraft point folder 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.629
 and here as she was commissioned the folder 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.099
 re source and the pin folder so 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.689
 you had to eliminate before and 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.150
 now he was re-created worth then 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.510
 we open it and here in minecraft lamos 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.280
 right click will be that that minecraft 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.980
 Right click fuck with my click 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.980
 to see if I try to right click 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.750
 shit 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.380
 good already after giving you right click 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.910
 they give in open with winrar vale open it 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.470
 with win back me as I have here 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.849
 predetermined then I give double click and 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.529
 It is done 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.300
 well now what we have to do with 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.770
 this minecraft make sure it is that this 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.629
 mind folder is not here 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.980
 when they open it is worth it and what we are going to 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:42.430
 do is eliminate the bomb we give 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.910
 the metal and we are going to eliminate it is safe 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.100
 if we remove metals at sme time and 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.900
 now the folder to whom we are going to move 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.480
 everything but absolutely all 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.430
 files to minecraft points that is what 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.680
 we selected everything and we had it in the 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:02.190
 part below we hope a little 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.990
 we hope a little bit we will accept and 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.669
 all of these will be happening and this 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.789
 time this goal jens that will appear here 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.590
 do not erase it now if we close everything already 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.960
 they know if they followed the installation they were 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.270
 is going to be fine this was all the video to 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.310
