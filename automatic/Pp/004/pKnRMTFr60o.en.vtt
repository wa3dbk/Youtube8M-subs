Eminem there are a few different

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.870 
Eminem there are a few different
versions<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> shoe<00:00:31.920> I've<00:00:32.160> seen<00:00:32.369> samples

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
versions of the shoe I've seen samples

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.639 
versions of the shoe I've seen samples
that<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.239> different<00:00:33.660> color<00:00:33.899> placements<00:00:34.500> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
that have different color placements I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.100 
that have different color placements I
have<00:00:34.829> another<00:00:35.070> pair<00:00:35.309> actually<00:00:35.610> myself<00:00:36.079> that<00:00:37.079> I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
have another pair actually myself that I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.940 
have another pair actually myself that I
wear<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.530> doesn't<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> lines<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
wear that doesn't that of the lines the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.430 
wear that doesn't that of the lines the
stripes<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> midsole<00:00:41.700> or<00:00:42.110> this<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.260> white

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
stripes on the midsole or this is white

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380 
stripes on the midsole or this is white
and<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.309> piece<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> blue<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.120> there's<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and the this piece is blue so there's a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
and the this piece is blue so there's a
few<00:00:45.539> little<00:00:45.719> subtle<00:00:46.020> differences<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
few little subtle differences and you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270 
few little subtle differences and you
have<00:00:47.789> proof<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> inside<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.250> they<00:00:50.250> are

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
have proof on the inside and they are

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.150 
have proof on the inside and they are
numbered<00:00:50.700> all<00:00:51.059> these<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.539> numbered<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.989> eight

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
numbered all these are numbered to eight

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.560 
numbered all these are numbered to eight
so<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.820> number<00:00:53.969> five<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.420> eight

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
so this one is number five of eight

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.209 
so this one is number five of eight
there's<00:00:54.840> eight<00:00:54.989> pairs<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.320> each<00:00:57.500> I'm<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.680> sure

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
there's eight pairs of each I'm not sure

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.650 
there's eight pairs of each I'm not sure
how<00:00:59.340> hundred<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.149> feel<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.480> there's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
how hundred that is I feel like there's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.510 
how hundred that is I feel like there's
more<00:01:00.840> than<00:01:01.050> eight<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.250> I've

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
more than eight of this one and I've

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
seen a few where I feel like there's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
seen a few where I feel like there's
more<00:01:04.320> than<00:01:04.589> eight<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> them<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.549> nevertheless
