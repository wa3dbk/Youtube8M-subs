00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.519
 very good friends today we came again to 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.320
 the house of the grandmother to prepare a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.119
 Colombian drink called taragudo 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 well you know some regions of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.380
 Colombia for example I met her in the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 manita valley beyond pure cauca 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 valley side where they are all 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.309
 beautiful vineyards of the Cauca Valley today 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.649
 here in the company of tish and made 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.960
 straw what I love most in this 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.079
 world we are going to prepare the blunderbuss for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.769
 all of you are still welcome 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.480
 Well the first thing we do is separate 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.479
 four egg yolks 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.539
 we are going to use only the yolks of 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.539
 egg 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.680
 this is one of the ways to separate 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.739
 you can find each one the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.700
 yours or the one you most comfortable with 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.400
 where it's easier than 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.680
 4 egg yolks 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.730
 here in this container we already have 2 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.030
 liters of milk on fire 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.470
 and add 4 heaping tablespoons of 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.940
 corn starch 4 heaping spoons 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.900
 let's now add the 4 yolks of 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.120
 egg that we already have 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.520
 previously separated 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.990
 and we start to stir constantly 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.710
 let's stir constantly because 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.070
 we do not hit the starch in the background 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.670
 of the pot add a spoonful of 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.670
 cinnamon powder 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.170
 for you how rich 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.480
 that this work is a very very 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.850
 delicious 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.570
 we constantly stir 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.000
 we add some cloves 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.190
 if they have it if they have the nails in 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.780
 dust or they can also add os what 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.370
 add the nail 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.390
 At the end of the preparation we are going to 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.250
 remove them I repeat stir 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.710
 constantly so that it does not stick 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.140
 let's add two tablespoons of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.810
 vanilla 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.810
 and we continue stirring 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.250
 to be reiterative but it's very 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.280
 important to constantly stir 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.310
 because it is starch sticks very easy to 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.310
 optional voice background 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.910
 and everyone 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.569
 good 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.000
 the aniseed brandy is a very 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.950
 very good can also add rum if 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.480
 they prefer it but the brandy is very 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.180
 good 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.049
 we constantly stir 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.120
 together until it starts to boil 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.730
 notice the consistency you are taking 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.129
 when it comes this thickens a little and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.129
 It is very very nice to take 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.680
 when we already have 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.920
 at this point in the preparation as it has 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.370
 started to boil 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.490
 then let's lower the fire a little 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.110
 to let it boil a little more 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:21.130
 and thus end 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.160
 this delicious blunderbuss 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.400
 we just need to add sugar to the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.740
 taste here we are going to add 3 tablespoons 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.990
 but I confess that in the end we added 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.200
 one more or we add 4 tablespoons of 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.800
 sugar 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.330
 we stir to integrate the sugar to the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.340
 drink 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:49.060
 and this practically is now ready 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.970
 there it is no longer served it is already ready that 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.060
 a little bit thick delicious sugar 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.940
 taste 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.220
 let's lower it let's let it cool 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.160
 and it is preferable to take it very cold is a 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.540
 very refreshing drink 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.930
 jungers 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.629
 well we let it cool about 4 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.140
 or 5 hours and we take it to the refrigerator 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.760
 and we serve it with the delicious mantecada 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.280
 good friends we prepared the trabuco 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.470
 we say work because that's how it is known in 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.690
 areas that regions can 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.259
 some of you tell me no this is a 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.090
 zone of corn starch and can be called 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.789
 cast in different regions by 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.860
 carried in different ways but here 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.810
 it's known as work in some 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.660
 regions and at the request of some 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.910
 subscribers we present it as work 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.979
 because people look for work and if not 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.190
 we call it work and we put blunderbuss not 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.020
 they are going to find work so 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.419
 thank you very much for visiting this 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.190
 channel and see you in a next fallita 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.190
