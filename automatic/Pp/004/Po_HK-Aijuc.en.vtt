00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
of these two metal rails I be honest I'm

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.770 
of these two metal rails I be honest I'm
not<00:00:50.829> sure<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.340> could<00:00:51.460> even<00:00:51.610> begin<00:00:52.060> to<00:00:52.600> hurt

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
not sure that could even begin to hurt

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.819 
not sure that could even begin to hurt
that<00:00:52.810> tire<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.340> they<00:00:54.550> have<00:00:54.850> this<00:00:57.000> slip<00:00:58.000> in<00:00:58.829> bar

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
that tire so they have this slip in bar

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.490 
that tire so they have this slip in bar
it<00:01:00.220> kind<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.550> comes<00:01:00.970> up<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.510> has<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.110> set<00:01:02.470> of

it kind of comes up and has a set of

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.130 
it kind of comes up and has a set of
wings<00:01:03.070> on<00:01:03.340> either<00:01:03.520> side<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:04.210> some<00:01:04.899> sort<00:01:05.079> of

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.350 
wings on either side and some sort of
hard<00:01:05.409> attachment<00:01:06.070> points<00:01:06.399> that<00:01:06.880> hold<00:01:07.120> it<00:01:07.270> in

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
hard attachment points that hold it in

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.360 
hard attachment points that hold it in
place<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:08.260> I've<00:01:08.560> just<00:01:08.800> been<00:01:08.920> holding<00:01:09.280> this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370

tire in here with a ratchet strap but
you<00:01:13.120> know<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.720> ain't<00:01:13.960> cool<00:01:14.370> especially

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
you know that ain't cool especially

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.980 
you know that ain't cool especially
especially<00:01:15.729> not<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.270> Sun<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:16.750> everything

especially not in the Sun and everything

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.890

else<00:01:17.170> so<00:01:17.830> what<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.370> built<00:01:18.729> was<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:19.720> little

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
else so what I built was this little

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.450 
else so what I built was this little
device<00:01:20.110> here<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:21.670> gonna<00:01:21.850> slip<00:01:22.180> over<00:01:22.450> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
device here and it's gonna slip over and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.380 
device here and it's gonna slip over and
roll<00:01:24.460> around<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:26.350> I<00:01:26.560> will<00:01:26.770> attach<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
roll around and then I will attach the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.140 
roll around and then I will attach the
hoist<00:01:28.690> cable<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.010> rig<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.549> then<00:01:34.030> I

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
hoist cable and to this rig and then I

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.780 
hoist cable and to this rig and then I
can<00:01:34.299> tighten<00:01:34.630> up<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.780> hoist<00:01:35.049> cable<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.650> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
can tighten up the hoist cable and that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.750 
can tighten up the hoist cable and that
will<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.840> was<00:01:37.990> all<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.290> tire<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.760> much

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
will that was all that tire and much

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.870 
will that was all that tire and much
much<00:01:40.000> better<00:01:41.010> this<00:01:42.010> cable<00:01:42.430> was<00:01:42.520> heavy<00:01:42.760> enough

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
much better this cable was heavy enough

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.969 
much better this cable was heavy enough
to<00:01:43.030> lift<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.420> tire<00:01:43.630> I<00:01:43.869> know<00:01:44.020> because<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.799> did<00:01:44.830> it

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
to lift the tire I know because I did it

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.679 
to lift the tire I know because I did it
even<00:01:45.640> though<00:01:45.729> I<00:01:45.760> guess<00:01:45.939> I<00:01:46.060> wasn't<00:01:46.210> supposed<00:01:46.390> to

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
even though I guess I wasn't supposed to

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.160 
even though I guess I wasn't supposed to
and<00:01:48.060> should<00:01:49.060> be<00:01:49.210> heavy<00:01:49.390> enough<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:49.900> simply

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
and should be heavy enough just simply

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.950 
and should be heavy enough just simply
to<00:01:50.290> hold<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.770> place<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.310> mean<00:01:52.299> as<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.840> can

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
to hold it in place I mean as you can

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.929 
to hold it in place I mean as you can
see<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.229> basically<00:01:54.100> stays<00:01:54.400> in<00:01:54.549> place<00:01:54.729> right

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
see it basically stays in place right

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.250 
see it basically stays in place right
now<00:01:55.000> you'd<00:01:55.390> have<00:01:55.510> to<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:55.750> up<00:01:55.900> there<00:01:55.930> with<00:01:56.140> your

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
now you'd have to get up there with your

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.390 
now you'd have to get up there with your
feet<00:01:56.439> and<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:57.460> really<00:01:57.790> force<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.180> out<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:58.689> I

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
feet and like really force it out so I

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.109 
feet and like really force it out so I
like<00:02:00.400> that<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.640> lot<00:02:00.759> better<00:02:01.060> than<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.170> like<00:02:03.119> just

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
like that a lot better than I like just

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.639 
like that a lot better than I like just

well I mean I thought when I had these
overhangs<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:33.640> get<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.910> water<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.209> sheet

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480

overhangs that I get the water a sheet
pass<00:02:34.720> but<00:02:34.990> oh<00:02:35.050> no<00:02:35.680> its<00:02:35.980> sheets<00:02:36.250> right<00:02:36.670> back

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
pass but oh no its sheets right back

will<00:03:20.380> be<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.680> expanded<00:03:21.190> metal<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.870> even

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
will be that expanded metal but even

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.140 
will be that expanded metal but even
though<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.160> obviously<00:03:24.670> keep<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.880> water

heck I mean I could walk around on the
roof<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.970> truck<00:03:28.209> once<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.690> get<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.900> all

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959

bolted in which could be convenient

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.860 
bolted in which could be convenient
sometimes<00:03:31.650> if<00:03:32.650> only<00:03:32.890> for<00:03:33.010> trimming<00:03:33.340> trees<00:03:33.870> but

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
sometimes if only for trimming trees but

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.110 
sometimes if only for trimming trees but
I'm<00:03:34.989> concerned<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.650> despite<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.880> fact<00:03:37.060> that

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120

I wanna you know I want to get with the
men<00:04:23.290> who<00:04:23.410> know<00:04:23.940> beforehand<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.180> then<00:04:25.300> that

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
men who know beforehand and then that

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.780 
men who know beforehand and then that
that<00:04:26.680> first<00:04:26.920> tarp<00:04:27.280> will<00:04:27.400> simply<00:04:27.670> be

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
that first tarp will simply be

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.080 
that first tarp will simply be
sacrificial<00:04:29.100> also<00:04:30.100> I'm<00:04:30.220> hoping<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.910> it'll

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
sacrificial also I'm hoping that it'll

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.060 
sacrificial also I'm hoping that it'll
stop<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.390> condensation<00:04:32.080> because<00:04:32.590> every

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
stop the condensation because every

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.160 
stop the condensation because every
morning<00:04:33.220> when<00:04:33.640> it<00:04:33.790> gets<00:04:34.000> cold<00:04:34.210> out<00:04:34.390> this<00:04:34.960> thing

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
morning when it gets cold out this thing

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.500 
morning when it gets cold out this thing
drips<00:04:35.470> up<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:35.770> there<00:04:35.950> which<00:04:36.700> is<00:04:36.730> hard<00:04:37.390> on<00:04:37.450> the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
drips up in there which is hard on the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.600 
drips up in there which is hard on the
speakers<00:04:37.960> if<00:04:38.110> nothing<00:04:38.380> else<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:39.310> I'm<00:04:39.370> hoping

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
speakers if nothing else so I'm hoping

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.920 
speakers if nothing else so I'm hoping
that<00:04:39.760> if<00:04:39.850> I<00:04:39.940> get<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.090> double<00:04:40.390> layer<00:04:40.540> to<00:04:40.750> work

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
that if I get a double layer to work

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.150 
that if I get a double layer to work
like<00:04:41.140> tar<00:04:41.350> paper<00:04:42.300> who<00:04:43.300> knows

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
like tar paper who knows

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.750 
like tar paper who knows
and<00:04:45.160> then<00:04:45.930> despite<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.190> hard<00:04:48.190> hard<00:04:48.400> work<00:04:48.580> of

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
and then despite the hard hard work of

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.830 
and then despite the hard hard work of
floppy<00:04:49.450> hat<00:04:49.720> photos<00:04:50.140> what<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:51.420> what<00:04:52.420> a<00:04:52.450> patient

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
floppy hat photos what a what a patient

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.770 
floppy hat photos what a what a patient
man<00:04:53.730> we've<00:04:54.730> come<00:04:54.760> to<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.210> realization<00:04:55.750> that

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
man we've come to the realization that

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.720 
man we've come to the realization that
the<00:04:56.200> word<00:04:56.350> mine<00:04:56.680> has<00:04:56.980> to<00:04:57.130> come<00:04:57.250> off<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.550> truck

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
and I got to figure out how to do that

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.780 
and I got to figure out how to do that
so<00:05:00.790> just<00:05:00.970> so<00:05:01.060> it's<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.270> historic<00:05:01.780> tours<00:05:02.790> then
