00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 so hello people and welcome 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.640
 in a tips and tricks video about 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.640
 have fun 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.580
 let's start with the most boring part 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.990
 Listen and master cool down reduction 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.869
 level for the clubs 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.580
 that has the reason that we with the brit 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.430
 quieter and the korean shoes 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.919
 even at 40 percent are armor seals 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.079
 and no hp goal because yours 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.880
 live briefly and the more 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.980
 Resistance you have the harder it is 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.040
 for the enemy the shield broke 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.540
 get the match win for that 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.340
 weighed a little easier 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.110
 do 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.690
 eight european market mini den 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.519
 want to have maximum damage if so 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.379
 however unsure what that is 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.469
 I would rather be burdened 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.589
 say octagon with taste then 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.539
 The whole thing is a bit easier 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.890
 and a crib you like it you have to 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.870
 I do not do that completely 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.239
 gladly because it is very funny with 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.020
 look like this crib on level 2 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.640
 for example, the lane can win 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.250
 and then to the masters that is 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.580
 a relatively standard 21 90 page 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.030
 with cola reduction equips and expeed 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.040
 with blade with everything in it because you 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.799
 relatively much car tech and also relative 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.909
 lots of space used and the los angeles 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.920
 then quite well together and so 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.079
 we finally get to the gameplay we 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.880
 catch the workshops or wild jumps 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.619
 and I'll show you here in the hinterland 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.409
 just a few walls over the man 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.850
 can jump with a third ko 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.789
 actually it is almost every wall with 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.170
 quite a few exceptions but easy to 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.990
 For example, I always show you a few 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.789
 in the background if you your your your 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.829
 third uses then you can do a lot 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.520
 jump closer and the wall jump 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.520
 works almost always 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.930
 next I'll show you some 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.550
 animation cans left the three or four 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.640
 important that you actually relate 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.380
 may need that is once the New man 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.910
 they set a direction and push 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.060
 during the cache hurts then did or 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.940
 the hydra + w and then the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.550
 most important if you are during your ashes 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.319
 and you have no more and animation 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.060
 that means you can fight opponents very easily 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.190
 surprise and how to get here in the video 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.110
 you can also see the stand 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.600
 to put it behind that means you press it 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.700
 how very fast in a row and has 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.040
 so tear open places that otherwise 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.830
 a relatively long cast time would have it 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.780
 the tip here is very very patch 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.250
 depending that means if you have the video in 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.180
 then a couple of months will look 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.610
 probably not anymore 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.830
 currently it works that way 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.769
 you through the wulffs camp a whole 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.989
 level gets that means many top players 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.299
 use currently teleport so that yes 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.239
 normal and start at wulffs camp on 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.250
 market for example how to use the whole 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.430
 Winning best does not take much time 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.400
 I'll just show you how to lose 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.709
 when the timer is at 145 you found 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.680
 to use your cuse with the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.170
 the greatest possible distance is you 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.000
 then I wait for this timer here 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.570
 short of the leak is hardly true 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.549
 wait again and crew a third time 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.880
 that's me with the three passive stacks 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.290
 and the crew still does not have cabbage 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.530
 or almost no cult 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.609
 The state is of course with the place 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.190
 report we take from it while we 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.250
 fight against the wolves here 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.680
 and the rest is actually relative 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.750
 self-explanatory simply beat kyu man 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.840
 always you can still between the 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.880
 cruze so the second wolf and the through 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.489
 lothar wolf with that we can reach it 2 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.060
 if we want to go aggressively give it 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.280
 we want to go www defensively to e 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.400
 I just go by the eh no idea 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.630
 why spot game and then we can 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.769
 buy five spots and a vision award 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.870
 and of course back to the lane 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.600
 teleport and what's so good now 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.020
 that's what the minions fit for us 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:33.889
 that means the opponent is faster then 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:35.419
 also level 2, however, are 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.280
 the minions on our side that is 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.080
 we have a general experience 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.169
 Advantage and we have five ports and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.750
 a vision and sport is killing me right now 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.790
 almost and last but not least something 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.650
 actually pretty obvious 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.310
 but I did not know that forever 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.470
 greven skew works so that he can 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.880
 She's just moving in that direction 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.740
 That's when I just look again 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.300
 She goes in the direction of the clock 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.180
 just does not matter how my mouse cursor 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.370
 straight is when I though the mouse 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.990
 cursor over an opponent then went 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.760
 you in the direction no matter in which direction 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.530
 she just looks, that is when 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.300
 I in the direction only in the direction 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.860
 cinema and then up over the opponents 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.610
 harvard then she jumps in the direction 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.130
 of the opponent 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.080
 that is very useful to know because 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.560
 if you are seated you can do that 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.699
 for example, use youku and then 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.380
 someone take me now in the direction 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.229
 would shoot you can so to them 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.130
 jumping on it has little practicality 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.570
 but it is good to know 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.669
 And for some reason, this provides 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.639
 cow mechanics for that my volumes 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.070
 can be missing now if I have this 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.750
 Want to jump wall would be like that 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.470
 yes, no problem there I can easily 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.630
 over if I do, however, the mouse 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:52.389
 about a pack for the golems and the 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.620
 third make something hell 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.210
 but now, if I'm the mouse 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.639
 grab cursor over one of the golems 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.870
 while I do the third kyu yes 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.460
 that's exactly what happens 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.139
 you jump against the wall I know 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.210
 not why it is or what it is 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.860
 makes sure that happens but tries 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.320
 easy to get that out of his pocket 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.820
 when an opponent is when you try 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.940
 to do my jobs 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.590
 That's exactly what my mouse would have been here 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.160
 and not on them which loose over 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.930
 come 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.940
 I really have no idea why 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.210
 but that's just too easy 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.860
 deal and that was it for now 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.150
 with the tips and tricks about Rinn 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.349
 maybe I'll do it someday 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.030
 a second part if me a few 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:32.120
 things have come to mind for now 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.129
 was that it now and then I would 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.289
 if they follow you 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:37.550
 or the tips would have pleased me 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:41.979
 look forward to an evaluation 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.979
 See you the first time
