00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.660
 good friends I will try to 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.880
 explain quickly how to solve 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.519
 a problem that I think several of them 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.669
 has presented at the time of updating 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:17.850
 our tablet filippa car sting 7 of the 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:20.400
 version 8.1 to version 10 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.300
 how can you see 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.280
 activity center option does not appear 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.740
 The key 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.099
 a rotation block 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.640
 therefore you can see I'm going to turn 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.640
 the tablet 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.680
 with a little 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.150
 do not flip I have it configured for 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.340
 show me 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:51.120
 the presentation horizontally 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 as you can see they do not do the woman or 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 in the same way 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.050
 when oppressing 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.690
 the windows button here did not have either 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.460
 no reaction 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.140
 I want to comment that I did the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.140
 windows 10 update and according 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.160
 to the order of arrival I got the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.730
 notice I did it and here in 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 Recovery after update 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.160
 I read reset pc to make a 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.350
 and a complete reboot with remove all 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.450
 this caused this problem to occur 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.940
 but in reality the solution is very 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.610
 easy what happens is that there are 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.040
 drivers that are not updated or 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.500
 are not installed and it's really very 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.280
 easy we have to go it's just to the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.119
 page 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.119
 from hewlett packard 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.750
 www.hp.com 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.250
 when we go to the page we go to 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.210
 find technical support download 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.210
 controllers 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.480
 and here in search by product we are going to 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.480
 Introduce 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.769
 stress 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.769
 7 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.390
 ok here come a series of results 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.550
 there are many tablets with that reference 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:40.620
 the specific tablet where I have in 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.620
 the tablet hp this in 7 557 0 2 l 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.080
 what's here and it comes out in the options and 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.930
 let's go to software and drivers 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.250
 let's go directly to this option 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.500
 here is the trick 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.370
 hewlett packard automatically detects 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.020
 that we have installed our tablet 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.020
 windows 10 you have to edit why 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.920
 in windows 10 I'm going to show you here 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.920
 before stopping this option 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.160
 and we left the option windows 10 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.160
 we will only appear 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.790
 utilities and tools that is the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.959
 maintenance software and software 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.980
 from julie packard to lend us contributions 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.780
 then we have to choose the option 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.010
 here you can see 8.1 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.010
 we give you update 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.920
 we hope ok we have no problem in this 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.840
 table so in this case I do not have 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.959
 problems with the video controller of 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.629
 audio but in case that's what 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.030
 had here are all the 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.010
 controllers 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.170
 the driver that interests us so that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.630
 work on the windows key and the turn 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.700
 of the screen are these two 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.640
 touch controller controllers 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.600
 guadix and driver enable 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.410
 onyx and sensor the only thing that we have to 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.410
 do is download 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.320
 I'm going to put you here just download 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.320
 following 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.200
 ok and the other file are also 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.200
 really small files 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:45.540
 ok the 2 have already been downloaded 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.430
 then I will go to the browser 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.569
 records 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:55.020
 already downloads I will find 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:58.430
 the two files that you just downloaded 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.430
 is this 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.950
 the s &amp; p s 69 305 and the act 69 300 8 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.790
 we give him 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.790
 install 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.580
 because there commands are executed 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:25.949
 and ready 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.949
 well let's go for the other file 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.530
 in the same way then we install it 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.070
 we follow the instructions we accept the 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.070
 terms 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.360
 a following 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.440
 and we wait for a moment that runs 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.440
 the entire installation program 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.310
 how do i think 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.690
 already finished doing all the 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:07.270
 facilities here I'm going to deactivate the 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.720
 screen rotation lock 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.810
 as you can see here is compressing 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.639
 the windows key 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.060
 there it is working is fulfilling its 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.060
 function 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.849
 we have activated 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.480
 a little better 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.470
 I'm going to close this 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.150
 that is to say 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.129
 of the screen a very easy solution 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.639
 simple 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:41.939
 without any inconvenience we do not 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:43.949
 we scared we just run these 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:45.599
 We download two files from the 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:48.090
 official page of hewlett packard ni is 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:51.690
 a hacked program or anything 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:55.790
 and we already have our tablet running 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.790
 as it is with windows 10
