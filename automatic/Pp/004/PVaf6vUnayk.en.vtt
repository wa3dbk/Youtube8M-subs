thicker and by faster through Oh Russia
I<00:01:00.539> suspect<00:01:00.989> what's<00:01:01.109> happened<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.500> Martin

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I suspect what's happened there Martin

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.820 
I suspect what's happened there Martin
is<00:01:02.210> Yoshimoto<00:01:03.210> has<00:01:03.480> slowed<00:01:03.840> more<00:01:04.199> than<00:01:04.409> Yanni

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
is Yoshimoto has slowed more than Yanni

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.950 
is Yoshimoto has slowed more than Yanni
expected<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.939> spray<00:01:06.180> Yanni<00:01:06.510> couldn't<00:01:06.810> see

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
expected in the spray Yanni couldn't see

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
expected in the spray Yanni couldn't see
him<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> pair<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.560> plashed<00:01:07.830> coming<00:01:08.729> out

non-stop all day today and there's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.320 
non-stop all day today and there's
another<00:01:17.820> example<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.479> exactly<00:01:18.960> why<00:01:19.850> yeah<00:01:20.850> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
another example of exactly why yeah so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.420 
another example of exactly why yeah so
safety<00:01:21.840> car<00:01:22.229> once<00:01:22.500> more<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.070> there's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
safety car once more and there's

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
safety car once more and there's
absolutely<00:01:23.700> no<00:01:24.180> question<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
absolutely no question that that is the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929 
absolutely no question that that is the
correct<00:01:25.740> decision<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.520> debris

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
correct decision there is debris

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
correct decision there is debris
littering<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> track<00:01:28.259> never<00:01:28.740> mind<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
perimeter and in these conditions that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.200 
perimeter and in these conditions that
is<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.189> treacherous<00:01:32.520> well<00:01:32.939> there's

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
is just so treacherous well there's

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.350 
is just so treacherous well there's
rocky<00:01:33.450> Yoshimoto

the<00:01:36.350> diminutive<00:01:37.190> Japanese<00:01:37.790> driver

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
the diminutive Japanese driver

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.630 
the diminutive Japanese driver
I<00:01:38.540> guess<00:01:39.350> he<00:01:39.530> probably<00:01:39.890> had<00:01:40.220> his<00:01:40.370> bell<00:01:40.610> rung

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
I guess he probably had his bell rung

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.490 
I guess he probably had his bell rung
pretty<00:01:40.880> convincingly<00:01:41.660> by<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.020> as<00:01:42.140> well<00:01:42.170> Neil

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
pretty convincingly by that as well Neil

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.830 
pretty convincingly by that as well Neil
Yanni<00:01:42.800> we<00:01:43.040> saw<00:01:43.220> out<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.670> car<00:01:43.910> as<00:01:44.090> well<00:01:44.120> and

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
Yanni we saw out of the car as well and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.200 
Yanni we saw out of the car as well and
and<00:01:45.800> there's<00:01:45.980> no<00:01:46.010> visa<00:01:46.460> we<00:01:46.580> saw<00:01:46.730> ask<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.060> car

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
and there's no visa we saw ask the car

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.840 
and there's no visa we saw ask the car
now<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.390> danger<00:01:47.990> here<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.350> well<00:01:51.670> guess<00:01:52.670> they

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
now the danger here as well guess they

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.580 
now the danger here as well guess they
can't<00:01:53.210> see<00:01:53.420> where<00:01:53.600> they're<00:01:53.810> going<00:01:54.050> and<00:01:54.350> there

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
can't see where they're going and there

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.200 
can't see where they're going and there
are<00:01:54.710> stationary<00:01:55.220> vehicles<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.090> know

flatbed<00:01:56.780> trucks<00:01:57.170> for<00:01:57.410> goodness<00:01:57.710> sake

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
flatbed trucks for goodness sake

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.970 
flatbed trucks for goodness sake
there's<00:01:59.420> nobody<00:01:59.630> get<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.740> these

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
there's nobody get it in these

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.010 
there's nobody get it in these
conditions<00:02:01.280> red<00:02:01.850> flag<00:02:02.120> well<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.720> had<00:02:02.990> to

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
conditions red flag well it had to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.580 
conditions red flag well it had to
happen<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.800> is<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.850> only<00:02:05.120> sensible<00:02:05.930> course

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
happen and is the only sensible course

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.090 
happen and is the only sensible course
of<00:02:07.220> action<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.610> think<00:02:08.320> completed<00:02:09.320> ten<00:02:09.590> laps<00:02:09.830> of

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
of action I think completed ten laps of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.830 
of action I think completed ten laps of
the<00:02:10.280> eighteen<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:12.940> let's<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.120> look<00:02:14.300> this

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
the eighteen and let's have a look this

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.170 
the eighteen and let's have a look this
is<00:02:15.020> Neil<00:02:15.260> Jarno<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.190> easy<00:02:16.400> as<00:02:16.670> nothing<00:02:16.820> is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
is Neil Jarno this is easy as nothing is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
is Neil Jarno this is easy as nothing is
that<00:02:17.209> visa<00:02:17.600> or<00:02:17.870> Yoshimoto

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
that visa or Yoshimoto

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.750 
that visa or Yoshimoto
now<00:02:21.200> did<00:02:21.440> we<00:02:21.560> not<00:02:21.709> pick<00:02:21.950> up<00:02:22.130> following<00:02:22.490> that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
now did we not pick up following that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.420 
now did we not pick up following that
that<00:02:22.940> Neil<00:02:23.090> Yanni<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.900> think<00:02:24.620> went<00:02:24.770> off<00:02:24.920> after

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
that Neil Yanni I think went off after

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.090 
that Neil Yanni I think went off after
he<00:02:25.550> on<00:02:26.360> e<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.570> Yoshimoto<00:02:27.200> were<00:02:27.410> was<00:02:27.650> some<00:02:27.830> sort

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
he on e and Yoshimoto were was some sort

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.340 
he on e and Yoshimoto were was some sort
of<00:02:28.190> twenty<00:02:28.430> thirty<00:02:28.610> seconds<00:02:28.880> down<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> road

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
of twenty thirty seconds down the road

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.630 
of twenty thirty seconds down the road
so<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.380> think<00:02:30.620> what's<00:02:30.740> happened<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.100> Yoshimoto

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
so I think what's happened is Yoshimoto

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640 
so I think what's happened is Yoshimoto
has<00:02:31.850> arrived<00:02:32.690> at<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.900> incident<00:02:33.290> scene<00:02:33.440> yellow
