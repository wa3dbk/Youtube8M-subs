00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 talk guys with the renato with another video and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.879
 today our third video of how 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.170
 get all the gold chests in the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 southeast and now we are here in 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.780
 Venus and let's get into patrol mode 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.490
 to get our first ball 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.980
 well you're going to fill exactly in that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 The point is that you can see that you have 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.660
 two paths one left and one right 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.269
 You solve the right path. 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.670
 and then just follow here the road 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.429
 who has no problem has not 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.529
 complications this is the simplest goal 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.630
 gave some enemies up ahead but 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.820
 they are very weak you can pass 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.760
 straight even if you do not take just a little bit 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.739
 damage and you will going until you reach 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.120
 in this statue here have it 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.920
 statue as reference point 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.940
 arriving in this state 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.460
 you turn left and enter through this 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 door that coming to that door you 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.469
 leave the vehicle in this cave 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.809
 with that purple light and it's well in that column 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.270
 from the middle behind that middle column you 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 the first goal is scored by the second and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.729
 third trunk we will get on the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.340
 mission is that the winter suffering 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.869
 remembering that you can pick up on one 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.520
 patrol mode should know that it has to 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.720
 be a little better because they do not have a 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 map parties 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.380
 Good, I'm here in front of the mission. 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.979
 in a cave with a few pieces of robots 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 It's the trunk here and it's in the front 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.189
 you just have to go back there 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.259
 lusa give you a double dip pick up the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.150
 neighborhood there as if you find that point 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.950
 well this point here is very simple because 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.079
 She knows the beginning of it all in. 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.180
 of a cave that is the only point that 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.070
 stay open so you can call 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.759
 when they get open skies here in the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.950
 ahead of the quest you will arrive 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.670
 here in front and will have a little head 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.770
 of a ship coming up the trunk it's there 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.049
 on the edge of that nothing you expect a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.759
 sniper you can see him me 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.250
 I'm going to clean up everything that has several enemies. 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.020
 I got there from the ship I cleaned everything already I'm here 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.300
 on the personal ship so you've seen 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.979
 where is the chest you already know is simple 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.210
 just take a little care not to 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.590
 fall right 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:22.140
 but it is very easy even and collected there 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.660
 third and the fourth chest 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.770
 We'll get on the cooperative mission. 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.410
 this chest is one of the most 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.390
 far away if they do not have to go 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.390
 and you recommend this mission 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.750
 Why is there an arrow and are you going? 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.820
 following this arrow you followed 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.800
 until you find this enemy that how much 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.560
 You find this flash enemy stays. 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.970
 caught in it and it only goes to show the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 map again after the c-max 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.590
 enemy to fight the enemy continue 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.810
 here I arrived in this round tunnel 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.430
 You'll probably come by here. 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.540
 If you are following correctly 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.370
 Mission Cleitinho 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.900
 arriving here is a restricted area you 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:08.370
 have to leave the vehicle and follow the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:10.350
 walk on that antenna there the trophy he goes 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.510
 stay behind a container of some 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.340
 buildings there and has some 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.900
 weak limits here you can choose 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.390
 for killing the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.110
 I'll go straight here and kill some 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:27.470
 but you do not have to go straight right here 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.470
 ahead 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.750
 the flight it stays behind you fall 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.690
 here it is really hidden and it is 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.740
