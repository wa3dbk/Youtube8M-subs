the<00:00:19.080> background<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> story<00:00:20.099> and<00:00:20.400> like

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the background of the story and like

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.970 
the background of the story and like
sort<00:00:20.790> of<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.450> New<00:00:22.079> York<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> way<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.829> is

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
sort of why New York is the way it is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.749 
sort of why New York is the way it is
and<00:00:23.220> things<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.520> that<00:00:23.660> sure<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:25.590> mean<00:00:26.279> that

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
and things like that sure I mean that

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.190 
and things like that sure I mean that
the<00:00:26.910> basic<00:00:27.210> premise<00:00:27.360> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> game<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
the basic premise of the game is that

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.109 
the basic premise of the game is that
there's<00:00:28.380> been<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.649> release<00:00:29.610> of<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.939> deadly

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
there's been a release of a deadly

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.540 
there's been a release of a deadly
biological<00:00:30.689> agent<00:00:31.410> that's<00:00:32.070> turning<00:00:32.340> into<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
biological agent that's turning into a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
biological agent that's turning into a
pandemic<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.110> started<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> New<00:00:34.739> York

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
pandemic and it all started in New York

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.189 
pandemic and it all started in New York
so<00:00:35.220> New<00:00:35.340> York<00:00:35.550> has<00:00:35.760> basically<00:00:36.149> crumbled<00:00:37.109> the

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
so New York has basically crumbled the

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.830 
so New York has basically crumbled the
farthest<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:37.949> places<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:39.179> about<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
farthest of all places and it's about to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
farthest of all places and it's about to
collapse<00:00:40.109> totally<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.039> that's<00:00:41.609> when<00:00:41.789> these

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
collapse totally and that's when these

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.970 
collapse totally and that's when these
agents<00:00:42.300> go<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.660> there<00:00:42.839> to<00:00:43.050> try<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.320> sort<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.890> all

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
agents go in there to try to sort it all

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.529 
agents go in there to try to sort it all
out<00:00:44.039> and<00:00:44.429> you<00:00:44.699> of<00:00:44.850> course<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.359> of<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
out and you of course are one of the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.639 
out and you of course are one of the
agents<00:00:45.839> ok<00:00:46.679> cool<00:00:46.949> so<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.820> saw<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.570> demo<00:00:49.440> from

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
agents ok cool so we saw the demo from

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
agents ok cool so we saw the demo from
the<00:00:49.769> Xbox<00:00:50.219> briefing<00:00:50.969> earlier<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:51.839> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the Xbox briefing earlier and then I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.590 
the Xbox briefing earlier and then I
also<00:00:52.260> got<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.579> different<00:00:53.579> demo<00:00:53.789> same<00:00:54.059> area<00:00:54.420> but

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
also got a different demo same area but

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.759 
also got a different demo same area but
it<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.749> a<00:00:54.780> different<00:00:54.870> time<00:00:55.109> of<00:00:55.230> day<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.649> was

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
it was a different time of day it was

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.470 
it was a different time of day it was
that<00:00:55.890> night<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.909> after<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.359> had

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that night and it was after we had

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
that night and it was after we had
captured<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.960> stronghold<00:00:58.230> point<00:00:58.679> and<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.519> we

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
captured a stronghold point and so we

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.040 
captured a stronghold point and so we
were<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.059> through<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.600> were<00:01:00.780> basically

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
were going through and we were basically

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.840 
were going through and we were basically
saving<00:01:01.589> a<00:01:01.829> supermarket<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.730> like

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
saving a supermarket that was like

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
saving a supermarket that was like
essentially<00:01:03.210> under<00:01:03.539> attack<00:01:03.839> to<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
essentially under attack to get the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
essentially under attack to get the
resources<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.370> that<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.120> when<00:01:06.270> we

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
resources out of that and then when we

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.730 
resources out of that and then when we
were<00:01:06.450> done<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.020> had<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.170> effect<00:01:07.230> on

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
were done with that it had an effect on

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
were done with that it had an effect on
the<00:01:07.950> whole<00:01:08.100> area<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.550> whole<00:01:08.670> map<00:01:08.909> positive

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the whole area the whole map positive

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
the whole area the whole map positive
effect<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.079> that<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.439> talk<00:01:10.619> about<00:01:10.649> how

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
effect on that can you talk about how

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
effect on that can you talk about how
those<00:01:11.520> actions<00:01:12.000> change<00:01:12.149> change<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> player

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
those actions change change the player

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
those actions change change the player
world<00:01:13.560> around<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.979> sure<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.939> mean<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.540> world

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
world around you sure I mean the world

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
world around you sure I mean the world
is<00:01:15.960> divided<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.500> districts<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.399> each

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
is divided into districts and in each

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.889 
is divided into districts and in each
district<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.299> something<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.659> call<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
district there is something we call the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.990 
district there is something we call the
base<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> operations<00:01:19.649> and<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:20.759> three

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
base of operations and there are three

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
base of operations and there are three
things<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.540> keep<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.719> mind<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.740> comes<00:01:22.979> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
things to keep in mind when it comes to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.679 
things to keep in mind when it comes to
the<00:01:23.250> districts<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.969> base<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> operations

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the districts and the base of operations

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.620 
the districts and the base of operations
its<00:01:24.930> security<00:01:25.740> morale<00:01:26.399> and<00:01:26.729> contagion

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
its security morale and contagion

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
its security morale and contagion
contagion<00:01:28.200> level<00:01:28.469> that's<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
contagion level that's kind of the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.709 
contagion level that's kind of the
factors<00:01:29.729> you're<00:01:29.850> dealing<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.479> trying

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
factors you're dealing with and trying

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.120 
factors you're dealing with and trying
to<00:01:30.899> juggle<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> player<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.920> security<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
to juggle as a player and security and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
to juggle as a player and security and
morale<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.030> has<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.539> people

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
morale that has to do with the people

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.510 
morale that has to do with the people
living<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.229> at<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.619> contagion<00:01:38.100> level<00:01:38.399> that's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
living there at a contagion level that's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
living there at a contagion level that's
of<00:01:38.700> course<00:01:38.939> how<00:01:39.149> how<00:01:39.689> present<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> viruses

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
of course how how present the viruses

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.380 
of course how how present the viruses
and<00:01:41.280> once<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.579> reaches<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> certain<00:01:42.210> level

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and once that reaches a certain level

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.789 
and once that reaches a certain level
you<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:42.930> start<00:01:43.140> playing<00:01:43.320> around<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
you can start playing around with the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
you can start playing around with the
base<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> operations<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> try<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> figure<00:01:45.719> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
base of operations and try to figure it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.679 
base of operations and try to figure it
out<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.289> restore<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.340> semblance<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.149> order<00:01:48.390> in

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
out and restore a semblance of order in

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.709 
out and restore a semblance of order in
this<00:01:49.109> chaotic<00:01:49.469> district<00:01:49.979> ok<00:01:50.670> cool<00:01:50.939> yeah<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.689> I

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
this chaotic district ok cool yeah so I

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.660 
this chaotic district ok cool yeah so I
saw<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.289> we<00:01:52.320> went<00:01:52.680> into<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> supermarket<00:01:53.340> we

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
saw when we went into the supermarket we

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.459 
saw when we went into the supermarket we
restored<00:01:54.060> power<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> sprinklers

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
restored power and like the sprinklers

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.770 
restored power and like the sprinklers
went<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.859> put<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> fire<00:01:56.670> essentially<00:01:57.359> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
went on put out the fire essentially and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.510 
went on put out the fire essentially and
then<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.020> was<00:01:58.140> saved<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.740> then<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> map

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
then it was saved and then on the map

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.800 
then it was saved and then on the map
you<00:01:59.549> could<00:01:59.789> see<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.149> morale<00:02:00.479> had<00:02:00.630> boosted

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you could see like morale had boosted

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.370 
you could see like morale had boosted
and<00:02:01.200> things<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> area

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
and things like that and the in the area

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.599 
and things like that and the in the area
but<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.500> order<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:04.890> into<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.159> area<00:02:05.369> there

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
but in order to get into that area there

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.399 
but in order to get into that area there
was<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> contamination<00:02:06.450> level<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> contagion

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
was a contamination level or a contagion

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
was a contamination level or a contagion
level<00:02:07.679> that<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.310> needed<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.610> equip<00:02:08.910> our<00:02:09.030> gas

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
level that we needed to equip our gas

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.690 
level that we needed to equip our gas
mask<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.460> sort<00:02:11.610> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
mask on and that's going to sort of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.100 
mask on and that's going to sort of
limit<00:02:11.970> where<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.210> can<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.540> depending<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
limit where you can go depending on the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.990 
limit where you can go depending on the
equipment<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.560> right<00:02:13.920> exactly<00:02:14.850> yeah

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
equipment you have right exactly yeah

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.410 
equipment you have right exactly yeah
that

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
that

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210 
that
that<00:02:15.690> level<00:02:15.959> they<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.500> has<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.770> do<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.040> your

that level they it has to do with your
level<00:02:17.550> as<00:02:17.670> well<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> level<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.690> gear

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
level as well and the level of the gear

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.500 
level as well and the level of the gear
you<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.590> etc<00:02:20.430> all<00:02:20.880> right<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.420> are

you have and etc all right there are

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600 
you have and etc all right there are
certain<00:02:21.810> limitations<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.709> world<00:02:22.920> that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
certain limitations in the world that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.059 
certain limitations in the world that
you<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.090> deal<00:02:24.660> with<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.230> overcome<00:02:25.380> as

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
you have to deal with and overcome as

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.100 
you have to deal with and overcome as
you<00:02:26.250> progress<00:02:26.400> through<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.940> game<00:02:26.970> okay<00:02:27.840> cool

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
you progress through the game okay cool

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.250 
you progress through the game okay cool
so<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.030> co-op<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.569> saw<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:30.959> had<00:02:30.989> one

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
so the the co-op that we saw we had one

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
so the the co-op that we saw we had one
player<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> tablet<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.819> we<00:02:33.060> got<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.300> see

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
player on on a tablet and we got to see

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.090 
player on on a tablet and we got to see
the<00:02:33.450> tablet<00:02:33.870> screen<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.350> first<00:02:34.530> time<00:02:34.770> and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
the tablet screen for the first time and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.890 
the tablet screen for the first time and
it<00:02:35.489> was<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:35.819> not<00:02:36.060> expected<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.540> blew<00:02:36.720> me<00:02:36.870> away

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900

it just sort of pops up right on the
ground<00:04:15.049> and<00:04:15.290> you<00:04:15.349> can<00:04:15.500> easily<00:04:15.650> sort<00:04:16.010> of<00:04:16.100> mark

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
ground and you can easily sort of mark

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
same time if we're trying to coordinate

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.450 
same time if we're trying to coordinate
attacks<00:04:23.840> or<00:04:24.289> something<00:04:24.530> like<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:24.710> that's

to be ways to communicate various

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.680 
to be ways to communicate various
