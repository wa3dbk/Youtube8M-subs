00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
through the pollination period just fine

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.100 
through the pollination period just fine
but<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.610> we<00:00:26.820> often<00:00:27.150> talked<00:00:27.390> about<00:00:27.690> it's<00:00:27.960> not

but as we often talked about it's not

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.990 
but as we often talked about it's not
just<00:00:28.560> getting<00:00:28.740> through<00:00:29.070> pollination<00:00:29.790> it's

just getting through pollination it's
also<00:00:30.180> getting<00:00:30.420> through<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> rest<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.230> grain

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
degrees of kernel abortion and that's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.520 
degrees of kernel abortion and that's
the<00:00:38.940> consequence<00:00:39.480> that's<00:00:39.719> most<00:00:39.989> likely<00:00:40.320> to

during a drought is you may come in and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
during a drought is you may come in and
find<00:00:50.460> plants<00:00:50.940> where<00:00:51.149> there's<00:00:51.449> obviously<00:00:52.050> an

find plants where there's obviously an

find plants where there's obviously an

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
ear developing and you might have hope

ear developing and you might have hope
that<00:00:55.199> there's<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.859> full<00:00:56.489> colonel

nicely but unfortunately sometimes when

nicely but unfortunately sometimes when
you<00:01:01.589> open<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:01.949> these<00:01:02.159> years<00:01:02.460> you'll<00:01:02.760> find<00:01:03.089> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you open up these years you'll find a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.790 
you open up these years you'll find a
lot<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> kernel<00:01:04.830> abortion<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
lot of kernel abortion and and and and

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.100 
lot of kernel abortion and and and and
this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.100> why<00:01:08.220> folks<00:01:08.520> need<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
this is why folks need to be out in the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.929 
this is why folks need to be out in the
early<00:01:10.530> stages<00:01:10.829> of<00:01:11.130> grain<00:01:11.340> field<00:01:11.610> during<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
early stages of grain field during a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.730 
early stages of grain field during a
major<00:01:12.119> drought<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.469> you<00:01:13.710> can

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
major drought like this because you can

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.969 
major drought like this because you can
begin<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:14.579> some<00:01:14.960> decisions<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.200> severity

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
begin to make some decisions on severity

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.499 
begin to make some decisions on severity
of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> problem<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.850> may<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.299> able<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
of the problem you may not be able to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539 
of the problem you may not be able to
determine<00:01:18.750> exact<00:01:19.290> grain<00:01:19.680> yield<00:01:19.950> per<00:01:20.130> acre<00:01:20.189> but

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
determine exact grain yield per acre but

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.310 
determine exact grain yield per acre but
you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.909> at<00:01:21.000> least<00:01:21.030> determine<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> magnitude

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you can at least determine the magnitude

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350 
you can at least determine the magnitude
of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> problem<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.280> we'll<00:01:23.759> take<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> look<00:01:24.270> at

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of the problem so we'll take a look at

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.550 
of the problem so we'll take a look at
this<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:24.719> and<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> kernel

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
this here and see what the kernel

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
this here and see what the kernel
abortion<00:01:25.950> looks<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.340> almost<00:01:26.820> every<00:01:27.360> silk

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
abortion looks like almost every silk

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.950 
abortion looks like almost every silk
received<00:01:28.619> pollen<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> almost<00:01:30.270> every<00:01:30.539> kernel

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
received pollen and almost every kernel

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.069 
received pollen and almost every kernel
or<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.439> least<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> about<00:01:32.420> maybe<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.630> final

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
or at least up to about maybe the final

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.219 
or at least up to about maybe the final
I'll<00:01:34.439> say<00:01:34.710> half<00:01:34.979> inch<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> cob<00:01:36.229> received

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I'll say half inch of this cob received

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.349 
I'll say half inch of this cob received
pollen<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> kernels<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.880> begun<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
pollen and the kernels have begun to

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.279 
pollen and the kernels have begun to
develop<00:01:39.979> but<00:01:41.659> they're<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.810> they're<00:01:43.170> in

varying degrees now of shutting down and

as you look around the circumference of
this<00:01:50.130> ear<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.390> might<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.719> able<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> pick<00:01:52.079> out

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
this ear you might be able to pick out

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.899 
this ear you might be able to pick out
even<00:01:52.649> these<00:01:52.770> subtle<00:01:53.159> differences<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.729> the

stage<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.770> development<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.079> go

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
stage of development and then as you go

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.590 
stage of development and then as you go
on<00:02:04.530> either<00:02:04.740> side<00:02:05.100> or<00:02:05.130> simply<00:02:05.850> look<00:02:06.090> around<00:02:06.210> the

rest<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.990> cob<00:02:07.289> you'll<00:02:07.710> see<00:02:07.979> kernels<00:02:08.460> that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
rest of that cob you'll see kernels that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.770 
rest of that cob you'll see kernels that
are<00:02:08.759> smaller<00:02:09.770> they're<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.130> yellow<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.510> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
are smaller they're not as yellow and in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.080 
are smaller they're not as yellow and in
fact<00:02:13.050> some<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.470> these<00:02:13.650> kernels<00:02:13.980> has<00:02:14.790> already

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
fact some of these kernels has already

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.839 
fact some of these kernels has already
begun<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.510> shrivel<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:17.340> course<00:02:17.550> that

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
begun to shrivel up and of course that

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.640 
begun to shrivel up and of course that
is<00:02:18.150> definitely<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.840> normal

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
is definitely not normal

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.699 
is definitely not normal
it's<00:02:19.799> definitely<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.400> expected<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.780> normal

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
it's definitely not expected in a normal

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.759 
it's definitely not expected in a normal
non<00:02:22.950> stress<00:02:23.459> tear<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.870> we're<00:02:25.079> having<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
non stress tear and so we're having a

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.460 
non stress tear and so we're having a
direct<00:02:25.980> effect<00:02:26.189> on<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.970> yield<00:02:27.900> potential

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
direct effect on on yield potential

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.910 
direct effect on on yield potential
because<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.280> Colonel<00:02:29.640> abortion<00:02:30.090> even<00:02:30.420> though

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
because of Colonel abortion even though

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.380 
because of Colonel abortion even though
pollination<00:02:31.920> itself<00:02:32.250> was<00:02:32.459> successful<00:02:33.090> so

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
pollination itself was successful so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.210 
pollination itself was successful so
here's<00:02:33.629> another<00:02:33.870> year<00:02:34.200> from<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.500> nearby<00:02:34.709> plant

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
here's another year from a nearby plant

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.300 
here's another year from a nearby plant
when<00:02:35.879> you<00:02:36.000> remove<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.510> husks<00:02:36.959> this<00:02:37.920> year<00:02:38.189> is

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
when you remove the husks this year is

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.610 
when you remove the husks this year is
even<00:02:38.430> worse<00:02:38.879> condition<00:02:39.390> than<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.200> first<00:02:40.409> year

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
even worse condition than the first year

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.300 
even worse condition than the first year
that<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.890> looked<00:02:41.129> at<00:02:42.319> many<00:02:43.319> many<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.799> kernels

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that we looked at many many more kernels

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.970 
that we looked at many many more kernels
have<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:44.640> shriveled<00:02:45.349> symptom<00:02:46.349> indicating

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
have that shriveled symptom indicating

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.740 
have that shriveled symptom indicating
that<00:02:47.189> that<00:02:47.519> they're<00:02:47.849> in<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.060> process<00:02:48.599> of

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
that that they're in the process of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.500 
that that they're in the process of
aborting<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.280> ear<00:02:50.489> itself<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:51.359> a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
aborting and the ear itself it's a

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.530 
aborting and the ear itself it's a
rubbery<00:02:51.989> feel<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.620> simply<00:02:53.099> it's<00:02:53.940> simply<00:02:54.329> not

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
rubbery feel it's simply it's simply not

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.860 
rubbery feel it's simply it's simply not
the<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.590> firm<00:02:56.120> nature<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.299> you'd<00:02:57.450> expect

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the the firm nature that you'd expect

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.449 
the the firm nature that you'd expect
out<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.049> an<00:02:58.260> ear<00:02:58.379> corn<00:02:58.709> at<00:02:58.829> this<00:02:58.980> point<00:02:59.220> in<00:02:59.280> time

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
out of an ear corn at this point in time

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.369 
out of an ear corn at this point in time
and<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.970> that's<00:03:00.510> another<00:03:00.750> indication<00:03:01.200> that

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
and so that's another indication that

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.860 
and so that's another indication that
the<00:03:01.709> water<00:03:02.010> status<00:03:02.579> of<00:03:02.760> these<00:03:02.909> plants<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.599> is

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the water status of these plants is is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.460 
the water status of these plants is is
just<00:03:04.230> dropping<00:03:05.389> severely<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:06.840> there's<00:03:07.260> not

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
just dropping severely and there's not

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.160 
just dropping severely and there's not
enough<00:03:07.859> water<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:09.269> sustain<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.840> plant's

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
enough water to sustain the plant's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.080 
enough water to sustain the plant's
growth<00:03:10.200> there's<00:03:10.739> not<00:03:10.950> enough<00:03:11.250> turgor

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
growth there's not enough turgor

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.990 
growth there's not enough turgor
pressure<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.629> sustain<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.290> growth<00:03:13.439> of<00:03:14.000> really

pressure to sustain the growth of really
anything<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.629> plant<00:03:15.900> at<00:03:16.079> this<00:03:16.230> point<00:03:16.500> in
