the<00:01:26.790> 64<00:01:27.270> gig<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.020> $400<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.390> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the 64 gig one for about $400 and the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
the 64 gig one for about $400 and the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
because it's only 70 bucks more than the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.410 
because it's only 70 bucks more than the
8<00:01:34.290> gig<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.729> three<00:01:35.939> times<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.299> amount

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
8 gig and you get three times the amount

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.760 
8 gig and you get three times the amount
of<00:01:36.509> memory<00:01:36.780> which<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.320> good<00:01:37.530> deal

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
go not on home because most people have

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.630 
go not on home because most people have
webcams<00:03:02.970> like<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.510> said<00:03:03.720> before<00:03:04.370> also<00:03:05.370> really

webcams like I said before also really
cool<00:03:05.790> thing<00:03:05.910> about<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.240> is<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.720> have

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
cool thing about this is if you have

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.080 
cool thing about this is if you have
Wi-Fi<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.560> search<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.860> internet<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:09.000> if
