00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.030 
so what is the first step so the first
step<00:02:00.340> is<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.730> cut<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.140> edges<00:02:02.140> inside<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
step is to cut the edges inside of the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.920 
step is to cut the edges inside of the
gene<00:02:03.280> right<00:02:03.760> where<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.060> seam<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.330> at<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.870> you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
gene right where the seam is at and you

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.020 
gene right where the seam is at and you
cut<00:02:05.200> them<00:02:05.350> diagonally<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.490> then<00:02:06.700> what<00:02:06.820> we<00:02:06.910> do

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
cut them diagonally and then what we do

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.300 
cut them diagonally and then what we do
after<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.450> after<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.710> have<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.070> fold

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
after that after that you have to fold

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.420 
after that after that you have to fold
the<00:02:09.490> jeans<00:02:09.729> in<00:02:10.140> once<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.560> then<00:02:11.800> another<00:02:12.070> time

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
the jeans in once and then another time

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.550 
the jeans in once and then another time
so<00:02:13.210> that<00:02:13.360> then<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.630> can<00:02:13.840> go<00:02:13.990> over<00:02:14.140> with<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
so that then you can go over with the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.470 
so that then you can go over with the
sewing<00:02:14.800> machine<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.460> then<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.120> need<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.360> use

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
sewing machine and then you need to use

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.820 
sewing machine and then you need to use
a<00:02:16.510> thread<00:02:16.780> obviously<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.290> matches<00:02:17.620> correct

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
a thread obviously that matches correct

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.740 
a thread obviously that matches correct
yeah<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.520> proven<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.180> use<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> thread

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
yeah you have proven you to use a thread

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.600 
yeah you have proven you to use a thread
that<00:02:19.870> matches<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.740> what<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.010> technique<00:02:21.310> to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
that matches so what is the technique to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.180 
that matches so what is the technique to
actually<00:02:22.000> sew<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> sewing<00:02:23.050> machine<00:02:23.190> so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
actually sew with a sewing machine so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.710 
actually sew with a sewing machine so
once<00:02:24.700> you're<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> sewing<00:02:25.330> machine<00:02:25.600> you

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
once you're in the sewing machine you

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.300 
once you're in the sewing machine you
have<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.990> go<00:02:26.110> forward<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:26.830> once<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.100> want<00:02:27.220> to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
close it off you have to go back half an

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
close it off you have to go back half an
inch<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.890> quarter<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.400> an<00:02:30.490> inch<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.820> then
