00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.300
 houllier 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.300
 the 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:15.649
 ohl 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.509
 the 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.719
 of three boys and girls ladies and gentlemen with its many other very it is 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.470
 now time to combine 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.640
 and in this region little time to the third is not that long 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.450
 And I have a 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.860
 heard until the dalers sound starts 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.460
 think in the last curve of the linden. in new country of residence 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.399
 that is a very good result 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.269
 I don't see myself as a country I see myself as blackbirds 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.220
 it is not smart gendarmerie itself 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.250
 because of course it was in the field 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.350
 it just like last time 2 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.220
 but i see the school as a relaxed lynch and not as thailand or 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.110
 so 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 you can compare me to that were that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.720
 that doesn't mean much to me 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 because every commentators exciting race and that everyone does it on his own 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.990
 way 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.490
 so this way life claims it doesn't start so well because of this turtle one 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.370
 nice dress 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.479
 but years later in the game it goes much better 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.320
 I now suddenly use a lot of playing minutes for once a chicks claim 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.680
 47 hours I know it is a very bad weapon but I use it anyway 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.670
 often on ps3 because then i 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.830
 the best tempest others 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.590
 marjorie feather parked dirty feed 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.000
 But now let's just come to the winter 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.300
 I made a new channel with the friezes 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.170
 his name is allegri menno eyi 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.810
 and then I will have it in particular 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.260
 all rail carriers across the threshold are both for starters 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.910
 subscribe that channel 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.350
 yes do what you want 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.520
 good luck 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.259
 that in the marinade below that part of i will now be the show dead 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.330
 financial times today i have a very rich x box in the car and 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.669
 and these are described on the screen 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.420
 one is the next 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.749
 there are five hundred and seven 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.670
 you must certainly die there 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.420
 He is 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.909
 a very nice guy and 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:30.879
 fight 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.090
 really cool videos really me 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.069
 really over 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.269
 almere 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.889
 also in third place next 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.389
 chilling out 10 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.349
 these make settings in particular 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.079
 but I don't have a single one yet 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.619
 it just seems like one 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.219
 so you can view settings there in particular 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.769
 and then I have four as the last 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.039
 lod master nl 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.079
 make sure you subscribe all 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.159
 we already have a big difference in the description and on the screen 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.999
 open moment that I said it and now all again 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.029
 so also when they are all 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.189
 what now is the time for the 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.049
 Ask for this week I have looked at the consoles before all the questions 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.049
 last week have also been listed 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.509
 such as one included 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:25.459
 the first question was for a job at i play the game what a name 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.839
 what is actually so great having fun 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.739
 then just a right choice all they make you can say your whole van too 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.789
 see turn on elm 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.979
 you came everything yes everything clothing line 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.059
 you can get a big 9 because of the problem 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.129
 apia small 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.129
 make the brand new or something 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:53.559
 that was about what I can tell about that 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.969
 for the rest you have to see the bird sanctuary fight quickly 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.339
 exactly 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.829
 the next question is from the newest CLA 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.749
 a case of a k3 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:06.829
 nadal 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.990
 i'm in yongin first 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.189
 and the two and 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.389
 so as a partner 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.359
 my answer of who are 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.459
 after the following question 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.409
 from dutch valley drills 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.849
 but this is a very weird question 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.300
 these are not questions for low expectations, but yes 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.129
 that says nice in his book 9 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.549
 That system was designed by Congo to put it along is not really true 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.490
 so no 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.240
 one and then I have another question that is the last question from June 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.039
 two o'clock 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.439
 well he asked if I immediately bought an HD PVR m yes that's right I have one 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.309
 pair the same two times with the purchased 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:54.080
 but that was the question that was asked 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.099
 what well then I have just logged in for a little while 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.559
 I of course as the usually know a nice terrace server 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.409
 in this is now on the screen 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.620
 and so she must 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.919
 dare to play along with my profile 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.249
 and I also intend to do a nice let's play hit 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.430
 chaouchi for which xd 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.880
 the training is not the first time that the agency sky 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.629
 yes bet on it 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:24.620
 really 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.860
 kitchen 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.199
 but let's continue the games in that will be in 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:34.029
 Therefore, most stars are placed on the most constant 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.389
 so i would say come and watch with a time of this video 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.740
 and based on that one will week 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.659
 make it a competition to 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.110
 just 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.620
 but the head 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.419
 And these were pretty much all the topics that head 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.419
 so I'm going to talk and talk 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:56.499
 well 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:57.539
 I have is again 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.499
 but i don't even have turkish culture 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.710
 besides the super is bad 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.229
 I have a door 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.189

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.770
 stopping power and 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.540

 and want to use it with his 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:12.960
 sharon 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.770
 and I intended him 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.699
 the stone and bone 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.460
 and an employee 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.919

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.860

 it well I would also come back there in English soon because me 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.849
 find it a bit sad for the English m 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.139
 the burglar lives yes 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.389
 they cannot stand to stand 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.990
 maybe it's a diploma so I don't want to give myself too much work 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.139
 do it again this Thursday but in English 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.580
