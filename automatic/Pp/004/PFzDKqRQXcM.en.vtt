00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.820
 so far the boy the boy was 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.820
 indifferent to beauty 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.470
 what campaigns you can play

 with liam concretized with jack 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.130
 I recommend playing with the lion I do not know 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.410
 Why, but I did not like the game very much . 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.880
 the wedge then play with something and then 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.330
 tactful way we play with one 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.260
 to show how with a mode 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.690
 2 multiplayer you see difficulty 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.870
 normal professional tehran 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:40.420
 beginner single or split screen mode 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.990
 Only one is for you to play alone divided. 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.300
 Are you two to play? 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.000
 will choose your million character with 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.100
 helena apply 6 2 will have to click 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.730
 start and then you will have to select the 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:03.220
 profile will have to select everything 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:08.950
 where will the memory be saved 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.440
 everything selected everything ok will appear 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.810
 network selection will be disconnected 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.900
 Why do you want to play online more? 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.020
 you can also play online here at 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.150
 attack action allowed not only allowed 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.360
 attacks really catch on 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.729
 if you will get a reaction going 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.220
 those type buttons click here 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.540
 two days because rt infinite ammunition 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.790
 allowing to allow 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.060
 It makes no difference to me because 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:44.020
 the text I tested or allowed and did not have 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.100
 serious infinite ammo there you click 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.100
 start the game 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.970
 then started in multiplayer 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.920
 the screens will stay this way it 's good to take 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.180
 It was great that there it gets better for 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.720
 play from 2 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.500
 I tried to tweak the settings options 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.630
 menu and everything and still have not seen as a 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.990
 change that different for example as 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.600
 stay resident evil 5 that is hacked into 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.020
 friend in the middle I would rather like that 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.840
 but the settings let this game not 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.460
 I have not seen any that you can change 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.240
 this way of playing 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:27.330
 so have another curiosity 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.520
 you will find in the course and items that 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.800
 It's called I do not know about skill. 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.540
 skill points 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.720
 this will serve for after you 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.920
 close let us say the first chapter 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.140
 after you close the first 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.200
 chapter will appear a screen for you 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.700
 to buy skills will be 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.880
 and therefore only had to 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.650
 means you can only have three 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.810
 You'll get the points that you 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.810
 was able to run from the game in the 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.720
 up and will have a cost of skills 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.400
 how much each 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.700
 I regret, for example, the ability to 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.600
 you have a copacol attack with a greater 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.220
 I really like this problem skill. 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.720
 you can level up and of course if 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.380
 You do not like the skill you can. 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.540
 to change that, then I hope you 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.940
 have enjoyed the mini tutorial on how to 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.800
 play football in some curiosities of the 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:25.520
 Resident Evil 6 Good game for you and 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.520
 good success too
