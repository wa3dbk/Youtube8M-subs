00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
gives you a little bit more range of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.410 
gives you a little bit more range of
motion<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> shoulders<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.120> you

there<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.850> studies<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.300> show<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
there are studies that show that the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.830 
there are studies that show that the
sleeve<00:01:04.290> wet<00:01:04.530> suit<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.949> more<00:01:05.640> hydrodynamic<00:01:06.180> or

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
more efficient in the water so if speed

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.940 
more efficient in the water so if speed
is<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.720> option<00:01:10.140> then<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.320> might<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.799> go

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
is your option then you might want to go

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.920

with<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> sleeve<00:01:11.430> wetsuit<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.750> good

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
with a sleeve wetsuit but it's a good

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.020 
with a sleeve wetsuit but it's a good
idea<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.350> try<00:01:13.500> both<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:14.400> idea<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.790> which

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
idea to try both to get an idea of which

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
idea to try both to get an idea of which
one<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> would<00:01:15.509> prefer<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.200> where<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
one you would prefer that where the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.490 
one you would prefer that where the
sleeve<00:01:17.460> wetsuit<00:01:17.880> does<00:01:18.119> act<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.540> add<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> lot

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
sleeve wetsuit does act as add a lot

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
sleeve wetsuit does act as add a lot
more<00:01:19.530> restrictions<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> shoulders<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.210> if

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
more restrictions to the shoulders so if

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.820 
more restrictions to the shoulders so if
you're<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.720> bit<00:01:21.930> broader<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.710> bit

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you're a little bit broader a little bit

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.170 
you're a little bit broader a little bit
tighter<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> shoulders<00:01:23.700> that's<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
tighter in the shoulders that's going to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
tighter in the shoulders that's going to
add<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.570> once<00:01:25.439> you've<00:01:25.590> got<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> wetsuit<00:01:26.280> up

athletes there is compression on the
chest<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.150> restricting<00:01:39.750> your<00:01:39.869> blood<00:01:40.140> flow

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470

everything's nice and tight and snug so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.870 
everything's nice and tight and snug so
breathing<00:01:43.229> gets<00:01:43.409> tough<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> be

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
breathing gets tough so it's going to be

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.780 
breathing gets tough so it's going to be
it's<00:01:45.509> going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.840> crucial<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.790> get

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
out and practice like I said with the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.260 
out and practice like I said with the
wetsuit<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.700> used<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
wetsuit so you get used to that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.789 
wetsuit so you get used to that
restriction<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> neck<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> chest

restriction on the neck and the chest

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
restriction on the neck and the chest
which<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.220> making<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> little<00:01:53.909> bit<00:01:54.119> tougher

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
which is making it a little bit tougher

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330 
which is making it a little bit tougher
to<00:01:54.479> breathe<00:01:54.840> when<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.710> out<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.159> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
to breathe when you get out there on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.789 
to breathe when you get out there on
race<00:01:56.579> day<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.149> there's<00:01:57.630> another<00:01:57.990> 50<00:01:58.530> hundred
