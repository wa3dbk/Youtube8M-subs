00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
over barbell rows so this exercise works

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.750 

I<00:04:07.400> did<00:04:08.360> two<00:04:08.540> sets<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.050> 95<00:04:09.470> pounds<00:04:09.950> 10<00:04:10.519> reps

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.540 

then<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.970> up<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.630> weights<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:26.050> 115<00:04:26.860> pounds<00:04:27.099> and

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
then I up the weights to 115 pounds and

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.390 
then I up the weights to 115 pounds and
change<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.360> grip<00:04:28.720> borders<00:04:29.050> around<00:04:29.169> by<00:04:30.039> do<00:04:30.099> 10

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
change the grip borders around by do 10

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.270 
change the grip borders around by do 10
reps<00:04:30.610> overhead<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.449> then<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.810> attempted<00:04:32.289> about

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
reps overhead and then I attempted about

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.999 
reps overhead and then I attempted about
eight<00:04:33.520> reps<00:04:33.759> for<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.300> reverse<00:04:34.660> grip<00:04:34.930> with<00:04:35.620> rigs

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
eight reps for a reverse grip with rigs

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.530 
eight reps for a reverse grip with rigs
in<00:04:36.130> between

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.060 

as<00:04:41.540> you<00:04:41.630> can<00:04:41.720> see<00:04:41.930> here<00:04:42.110> my<00:04:42.230> form<00:04:42.530> went<00:04:42.770> south

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
as you can see here my form went south

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.710 
as you can see here my form went south
with<00:04:43.430> heavier<00:04:43.760> weights<00:04:44.030> because<00:04:44.300> i'm<00:04:44.690> using

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
with heavier weights because i'm using

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.450 
with heavier weights because i'm using
other<00:04:45.140> parts<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.470> my<00:04:45.560> muscles<00:04:45.980> just<00:04:46.160> hip<00:04:46.430> away

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
other parts of my muscles just hip away

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.210 
other parts of my muscles just hip away
so<00:04:46.880> i<00:04:47.560> probably<00:04:48.560> should<00:04:48.800> have<00:04:48.860> just<00:04:49.010> arrested

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
so i probably should have just arrested

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.770 
so i probably should have just arrested

the front but the one in the back makes
it<00:07:02.120> more<00:07:02.270> top-heavy<00:07:02.600> so<00:07:03.170> it's<00:07:03.350> a<00:07:03.410> little

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
it more top-heavy so it's a little

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.770 
it more top-heavy so it's a little
harder<00:07:03.860> to<00:07:03.890> come<00:07:04.190> up<00:07:04.310> with<00:07:04.340> a<00:07:04.520> very<00:07:04.670> bottom<00:07:05.710> and
