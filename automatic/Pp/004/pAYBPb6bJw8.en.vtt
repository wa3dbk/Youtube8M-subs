the moment because that's the only thing
I<00:00:37.320> really<00:00:37.739> track<00:00:38.040> fitness<00:00:38.430> wise<00:00:39.020> this<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
I really track fitness wise this is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.250 
I really track fitness wise this is
picked<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.920> these<00:00:41.340> steps<00:00:42.030> from<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.050> motion

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
picked up these steps from the motion

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.040 
picked up these steps from the motion
sensor<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> 5s<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.719> comes

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
sensor because I have the 5s it comes

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.889 
sensor because I have the 5s it comes
with<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.350> inbuilt<00:00:46.680> motion<00:00:47.280> sensor<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.570> that's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
with an inbuilt motion sensor so that's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.709 
with an inbuilt motion sensor so that's
really<00:00:49.289> handy<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
really handy for that if you do have a

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.260 
really handy for that if you do have a
device<00:00:52.500> such<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.070> Fitbit<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.120> it
