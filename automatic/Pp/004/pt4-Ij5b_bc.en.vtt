00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:05.889 
trains raw a little bit more than some

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:09.569 
trains raw a little bit more than some
of<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.189> rest<00:01:06.219> of<00:01:06.490> us<00:01:06.579> so<00:01:06.819> I<00:01:07.060> think<00:01:07.869> that<00:01:08.579> has

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
of the rest of us so I think that has

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:10.730 
of the rest of us so I think that has
something<00:01:09.969> to<00:01:09.999> do<00:01:10.179> with<00:01:10.299> that<00:01:10.359> piece

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
something to do with that piece

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.559 
something to do with that piece
developed<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.829> lot<00:01:11.950> of<00:01:12.069> strength<00:01:12.369> raw<00:01:12.789> so<00:01:13.479> he

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
developed a lot of strength raw so he

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.260 
developed a lot of strength raw so he
kind<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.840> knows<00:01:14.020> where<00:01:14.259> he<00:01:14.380> needs<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.679> stand

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
kind of knows where he needs to stand

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.669 
kind of knows where he needs to stand
when<00:01:16.270> he<00:01:16.299> puts<00:01:16.539> his<00:01:16.630> gear<00:01:16.929> on<00:01:16.959> he's<00:01:17.350> just<00:01:17.530> more

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
when he puts his gear on he's just more

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.770 
when he puts his gear on he's just more
comfortable<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.310> those<00:01:18.459> positions<00:01:19.240> same

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
comfortable in those positions same

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.840 
comfortable in those positions same
positions<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.439> he's<00:01:20.590> in<00:01:20.770> when<00:01:21.549> it's<00:01:21.670> raw

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
positions that he's in when it's raw

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
at super training and that I didn't

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.349

squat<00:02:03.579> bar<00:02:03.819> I<00:02:04.090> think<00:02:04.779> or<00:02:05.139> very<00:02:05.950> close<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.399> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
squat bar I think or very close to the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.880 
squat bar I think or very close to the
same<00:02:06.700> amount<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.929> some<00:02:08.110> misconceptions

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
same amount kind of some misconceptions

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.399 
same amount kind of some misconceptions
out<00:02:09.039> there<00:02:09.099> about<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.509> safety<00:02:10.750> squat<00:02:11.200> bar

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
out there about the safety squat bar

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.259 
out there about the safety squat bar
people<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.310> think<00:02:12.459> it's<00:02:12.670> automatically

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
people just think it's automatically

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.929 
people just think it's automatically
harder<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:14.439> does<00:02:14.680> place<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> senator<00:02:15.430> gravity

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
harder it does place a senator gravity

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.080 
harder it does place a senator gravity
in<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.150> different<00:02:16.510> spot<00:02:16.750> but

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
in a different spot but

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.520 
in a different spot but
for<00:02:19.090> me<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.239> can<00:02:19.510> handle<00:02:19.750> more<00:02:19.959> weight<00:02:20.019> with<00:02:20.409> it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
for me I can handle more weight with it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.740 
for me I can handle more weight with it
because<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:21.489> don't<00:02:21.670> see<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:21.969> dysfunction

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
because you don't see the dysfunction

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.470 
because you don't see the dysfunction
that<00:02:22.959> happens<00:02:23.469> with<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> normal<00:02:24.099> barbell<00:02:24.579> with

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
that happens with a normal barbell with

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.420 
that happens with a normal barbell with
the<00:02:25.599> safety<00:02:25.959> squat<00:02:26.230> bar<00:02:26.469> if<00:02:27.159> you<00:02:27.310> have

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the safety squat bar if you have

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.849 
the safety squat bar if you have
shoulder<00:02:27.700> problems<00:02:28.000> which<00:02:28.500> almost<00:02:29.500> everybody

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
shoulder problems which almost everybody

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.459 
shoulder problems which almost everybody
does<00:02:30.099> shoulder<00:02:30.969> mobility<00:02:31.150> issue<00:02:31.659> of<00:02:31.989> any<00:02:32.140> kind

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
does shoulder mobility issue of any kind

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.800 
does shoulder mobility issue of any kind
or<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:34.000> know<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.150> have<00:02:34.269> trouble<00:02:34.510> carrying

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
or you know you have trouble carrying

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.959 
or you know you have trouble carrying
the<00:02:35.109> bar<00:02:35.319> low<00:02:35.709> or<00:02:36.069> trouble<00:02:36.370> carrying<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.790> bar

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:36.969 
the bar low or trouble carrying the bar

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.449 
the bar low or trouble carrying the bar
in<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.150> right<00:02:37.269> spot<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:38.379> most<00:02:38.620> optimal<00:02:39.189> spot

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
in the right spot the most optimal spot

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.220 
in the right spot the most optimal spot
for<00:02:39.670> your<00:02:39.760> body<00:02:40.030> type<00:02:40.329> which<00:02:40.629> is<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.109> know

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
for your body type which is you know

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.330 
for your body type which is you know
again<00:02:41.590> there'd<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> lot<00:02:42.639> a<00:02:42.670> lot<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.239> people

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
again there'd be a lot a lot of people

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.589 
again there'd be a lot a lot of people
so<00:02:45.340> all<00:02:45.489> those<00:02:45.639> things<00:02:45.849> factor<00:02:46.359> into

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
so all those things factor into

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.750 
so all those things factor into
squatting<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.200> swatting<00:02:48.159> a<00:02:48.219> straight<00:02:48.519> bar

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
squatting the swatting a straight bar

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.399 
squatting the swatting a straight bar
and<00:02:50.879> they<00:02:51.879> manifest<00:02:52.540> into<00:02:52.840> some<00:02:53.049> ugliness

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
and they manifest into some ugliness

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.379 
and they manifest into some ugliness
when<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.459> go<00:02:54.579> through<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.849> full<00:02:55.090> range<00:02:55.269> of

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
when you go through a full range of

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.300 
when you go through a full range of
motion<00:02:55.540> squaw<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.319> don't<00:02:56.530> see<00:02:56.829> that<00:02:57.040> with<00:02:57.189> the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
motion squaw you don't see that with the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.179 
motion squaw you don't see that with the
safety<00:02:57.669> squat<00:02:57.939> bar<00:02:58.200> because<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.319> can<00:02:59.470> stay<00:02:59.980> in

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
safety squat bar because you can stay in

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.369 
safety squat bar because you can stay in
a<00:03:00.280> rigid<00:03:00.489> upright<00:03:01.090> position<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.599> whole<00:03:01.840> time

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
a rigid upright position the whole time

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.830 
a rigid upright position the whole time
although<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.219> bar<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.639> shoving<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.359> forward

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
although the bar is shoving you forward

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.429 
although the bar is shoving you forward
slightly

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
slightly

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.520 
slightly
you<00:03:06.069> can<00:03:06.219> also<00:03:06.750> fight<00:03:07.750> against<00:03:08.109> that<00:03:08.349> by

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
you can also fight against that by

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.789 
you can also fight against that by
pushing<00:03:08.709> those<00:03:08.950> handles<00:03:09.370> up<00:03:10.439> or<00:03:11.439> by<00:03:11.620> just

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
pushing those handles up or by just

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.259 
pushing those handles up or by just
keeping<00:03:11.919> the<00:03:12.189> hips<00:03:12.370> underneath<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.819> barbell

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
keeping the hips underneath the barbell

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.589 
keeping the hips underneath the barbell
the<00:03:13.510> weight<00:03:13.659> robots<00:03:14.049> doing<00:03:14.319> there<00:03:15.419> but<00:03:16.419> again

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
the weight robots doing there but again

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.789 
the weight robots doing there but again
with<00:03:16.719> the<00:03:16.810> straight<00:03:17.049> bar<00:03:17.230> that's<00:03:17.469> almost

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
with the straight bar that's almost

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.490 
with the straight bar that's almost
harder<00:03:18.159> so<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.989> think<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.200> lot<00:03:20.379> of<00:03:20.409> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
harder so I think a lot of the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.800 
harder so I think a lot of the
misconceptions<00:03:20.650> have<00:03:21.280> come<00:03:21.519> people<00:03:22.479> talking

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
misconceptions have come people talking

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.839 
misconceptions have come people talking

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
least eight plates or so somewhere in

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.030 
least eight plates or so somewhere in
there<00:03:42.519> but<00:03:42.699> I<00:03:43.150> really<00:03:43.659> don't<00:03:43.720> know<00:03:43.959> but<00:03:44.889> let's

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
there but I really don't know but let's

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.309 
there but I really don't know but let's
say<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.340> do<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.729> could<00:03:46.060> do<00:03:46.150> 800<00:03:46.479> pounds<00:03:46.930> with

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
say you do it I could do 800 pounds with

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.439 
say you do it I could do 800 pounds with
the<00:03:47.439> safety<00:03:47.769> strap<00:03:48.069> off<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.459> box<00:03:50.939> but<00:03:51.939> you<00:03:52.359> know

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
the safety strap off a box but you know

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.300 
the safety strap off a box but you know
I'm<00:03:52.540> squatting<00:03:52.780> near<00:03:53.169> 1,100<00:03:53.739> pounds<00:03:53.859> of<00:03:54.129> meats

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
I'm squatting near 1,100 pounds of meats

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.890 
I'm squatting near 1,100 pounds of meats
and<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.150> think<00:03:55.239> that's<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.689> misconception

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
and so I think that's the misconception

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.050 
and so I think that's the misconception
people<00:03:56.470> are<00:03:56.829> kind<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.159> trying<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.489> equate<00:03:57.879> it

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
people are kind of trying to equate it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.449 
people are kind of trying to equate it
to<00:03:58.090> like<00:03:59.049> some<00:03:59.290> sort<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.530> geared<00:03:59.829> lift<00:04:00.129> in<00:04:00.400> a

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
to like some sort of geared lift in a

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.429 
to like some sort of geared lift in a
meat<00:04:00.669> which<00:04:00.939> is<00:04:01.120> way<00:04:01.659> way<00:04:01.840> different<00:04:02.049> because

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
meat which is way way different because

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.960 
meat which is way way different because
you're<00:04:02.620> putting<00:04:02.889> on<00:04:02.979> more<00:04:03.280> here<00:04:03.579> in<00:04:03.699> the<00:04:03.790> meat

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
you're putting on more here in the meat

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.360 
you're putting on more here in the meat
and<00:04:04.530> latching<00:04:05.530> yourself<00:04:05.889> down<00:04:06.099> with<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
and latching yourself down with the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.009 
and latching yourself down with the
velcro<00:04:06.609> straps<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.299> everything<00:04:07.599> else<00:04:07.750> and

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
velcro straps and everything else and

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.199 
velcro straps and everything else and
taking<00:04:08.889> more<00:04:09.099> advantage<00:04:09.189> of<00:04:09.669> your<00:04:09.759> gear<00:04:10.060> than

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
taking more advantage of your gear than

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.159 
taking more advantage of your gear than
they<00:04:10.329> think<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:13.209> in<00:04:13.509> the<00:04:13.859> in<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:14.949> box<00:04:15.159> squat

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
they think so in the in the box squat

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.659 
they think so in the in the box squat
box<00:04:17.169> squat<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.590> supposed<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.889> be<00:04:18.039> harder<00:04:18.459> than

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
box squat is supposed to be harder than

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.120 
box squat is supposed to be harder than
a<00:04:19.479> regular<00:04:19.659> squat<00:04:20.139> for<00:04:20.380> one<00:04:20.560> so<00:04:20.859> that's<00:04:20.949> gonna

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
a regular squat for one so that's gonna

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.129 
a regular squat for one so that's gonna
you<00:04:21.699> know<00:04:21.820> keep<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.150> numbers<00:04:22.479> down<00:04:22.509> just<00:04:23.080> a

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
you know keep the numbers down just a

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.350 
you know keep the numbers down just a
little<00:04:23.440> bit<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:24.400> if<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.639> was<00:04:24.789> to<00:04:24.909> do<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.060> regular

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
little bit but if I was to do a regular

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.810 
little bit but if I was to do a regular
straight<00:04:25.810> bar<00:04:26.080> squat<00:04:26.469> the<00:04:27.279> weights<00:04:27.490> would<00:04:27.669> be

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
straight bar squat the weights would be

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.820 
straight bar squat the weights would be
very<00:04:28.060> similar<00:04:28.389> or<00:04:28.990> they'd<00:04:29.680> be<00:04:29.710> slightly<00:04:30.190> lower

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
very similar or they'd be slightly lower

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.370 
very similar or they'd be slightly lower

you try to need it you need to kind of

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.890 
you try to need it you need to kind of
figure<00:04:55.700> out<00:04:55.730> how<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:55.970> equate<00:04:56.420> it<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.630> something

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
figure out how to equate it to something

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.950 
figure out how to equate it to something
and<00:04:57.140> then<00:04:57.230> also<00:04:57.380> if<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.610> do<00:04:58.850> increase<00:04:59.360> if<00:04:59.900> you

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
and then also if you do increase if you

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.890 
and then also if you do increase if you
do<00:05:00.200> get<00:05:00.410> better<00:05:00.590> at<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:00.890> safety<00:05:01.250> squat<00:05:01.550> bar

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
do get better at the safety squat bar

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.810 
do get better at the safety squat bar
are<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:02.960> noticing<00:05:03.410> an<00:05:03.950> increase<00:05:04.280> on<00:05:04.730> the

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
are you noticing an increase on the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.090 
are you noticing an increase on the
platform<00:05:05.330> because<00:05:05.510> ultimately<00:05:05.870> that's<00:05:06.710> all

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
platform because ultimately that's all

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.920 
platform because ultimately that's all
that<00:05:07.340> matters<00:05:07.760> is<00:05:07.970> your<00:05:08.210> deadlift<00:05:08.630> getting

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
that matters is your deadlift getting

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.140 
that matters is your deadlift getting
better<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.350> your<00:05:09.560> squat<00:05:09.830> getting<00:05:10.160> better<00:05:10.340> if

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
better is your squat getting better if

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.110 
better is your squat getting better if
they're<00:05:11.300> not<00:05:11.450> then<00:05:12.230> you<00:05:12.560> may<00:05:12.710> need<00:05:12.890> to<00:05:13.190> look

they're not then you may need to look

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.490 
they're not then you may need to look
into<00:05:14.360> some<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.960> other<00:05:14.990> things<00:05:15.380> you're

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.300 
but you can see how he's kind of
shifting<00:05:32.720> forward<00:05:32.990> out<00:05:33.200> of<00:05:33.320> his<00:05:33.410> knees<00:05:33.620> very
