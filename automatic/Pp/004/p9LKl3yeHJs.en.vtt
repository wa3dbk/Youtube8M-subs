00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
with like some zigzags and zigzags in

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.330 
with like some zigzags and zigzags in
between<00:02:12.860> now<00:02:13.860> coming<00:02:14.190> back<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.070> little

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
between now coming back it's a little

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.540 
between now coming back it's a little
different<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.740> heart<00:02:19.950> shapes<00:02:20.250> are<00:02:20.430> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
different like the heart shapes are the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.220 
different like the heart shapes are the
same<00:02:20.850> but<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.240> time<00:02:21.450> you're<00:02:21.630> zig<00:02:21.840> zags<00:02:22.080> are

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
same but this time you're zig zags are

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.880 
same but this time you're zig zags are
going<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.470> facing<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.920> opposite<00:02:23.460> way<00:02:24.890> so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
going to be facing the opposite way so

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.080 
going to be facing the opposite way so
you<00:02:26.580> want<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> push<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.330> first<00:02:27.690> roadie<00:02:28.350> on

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
you want to push that first roadie on

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.470 
you want to push that first roadie on
and<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:32.300> come<00:02:33.300> up<00:02:33.540> back<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:35.480> your

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
and you you come up back this is your

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.420 
and you you come up back this is your
last<00:02:36.720> pace<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.800> get<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.130> one<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
last pace of you you get that one and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.180 
last pace of you you get that one and
you<00:02:38.490> go<00:02:38.700> down<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.990> trace<00:02:40.710> your<00:02:40.740> heart

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
you go down and you trace your heart

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.470 
you go down and you trace your heart
shape<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:43.080> go<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.680> pick<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.480> so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
shape you go up and you pick up so

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.200 
shape you go up and you pick up so
you're<00:02:45.870> doing<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.290> same<00:02:49.910> you're<00:02:50.910> you're

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
you're doing the same you're you're

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.730 
you're doing the same you're you're
doing<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.660> same<00:02:51.930> pattern<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:55.530> are

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.280 
doing the same pattern but you are
you'll<00:02:56.130> trace<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.640> heart<00:02:56.880> shape<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.480> then

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
you'll trace the heart shape and then

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.900 
you'll trace the heart shape and then
you'll<00:02:58.500> pick<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.550> ones<00:02:59.730> you're

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
picking up it's gonna be facing the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.220 
picking up it's gonna be facing the
opposite<00:03:01.500> way<00:03:02.120> from<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.209> one<00:03:03.480> before<00:03:03.510> let<00:03:04.110> me

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
opposite way from the one before let me

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
is well one row of this one is just way

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.240 
is well one row of this one is just way
down<00:03:43.020> that's<00:03:43.290> one<00:03:43.470> row<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:43.890> come<00:03:44.100> back

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250

that's row two with some of these

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.680 
that's row two with some of these
stitches<00:03:47.520> you'll<00:03:47.850> be<00:03:47.970> going<00:03:48.150> down<00:03:48.330> you'll<00:03:48.660> be

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
stitches you'll be going down you'll be

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.940 
stitches you'll be going down you'll be
coming<00:03:49.050> back<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.410> picking<00:03:49.590> up<00:03:49.709> different

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
one it's just one way down as one row

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.520 
one it's just one way down as one row
let<00:03:55.050> me<00:03:55.170> push<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.650> down<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.190> can<00:03:56.370> kind<00:03:56.610> of

let me push this down so you can kind of

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.480 
let me push this down so you can kind of
see<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.680> pattern<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.750> again<00:04:01.880> here<00:04:02.880> is

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
see the pattern and again here is

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.800 
see the pattern and again here is
the<00:04:05.490> pattern<00:04:05.880> if<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.000> need<00:04:06.240> to<00:04:06.360> see<00:04:06.600> that

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the pattern if you need to see that

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.200 
the pattern if you need to see that
again<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.610> this<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.910> your<00:04:09.240> long<00:04:09.510> stitch
