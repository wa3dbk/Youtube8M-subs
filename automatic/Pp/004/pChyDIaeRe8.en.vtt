for us I guess if we do this hard with

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.830 
for us I guess if we do this hard with
two<00:00:36.719> people<00:00:37.110> yeah<00:00:37.739> Justin<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.660> we're

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
two people yeah Justin so so if we're

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.150 
two people yeah Justin so so if we're
with<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.020> friends<00:00:40.440> we'll<00:00:40.559> make<00:00:40.710> skits<00:00:40.980> and
