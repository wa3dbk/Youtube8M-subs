they are contained in two layers of 30
pencils<00:00:52.210> each<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.800> before<00:00:54.399> we<00:00:54.579> start<00:00:55.030> we<00:00:55.359> need

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
pencils each so before we start we need

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.200 
pencils each so before we start we need
to<00:00:55.780> create<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.379> color<00:00:56.679> chart<00:00:56.949> showing<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.850> true

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
to create a color chart showing the true

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.989 
to create a color chart showing the true
color<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.600> each<00:00:59.199> one<00:00:59.679> of<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.829> sixty<00:01:00.489> pencils

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.829 
color of each one of the sixty pencils
so<00:01:01.569> take<00:01:01.899> a<00:01:02.109> black<00:01:02.620> sheet<00:01:03.159> of<00:01:03.339> paper<00:01:03.789> cut<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.659> to

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
so take a black sheet of paper cut it to

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.560 
so take a black sheet of paper cut it to
size<00:01:05.050> so<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:06.010> fits<00:01:06.340> in<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.670> head<00:01:06.940> of<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.210> box

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
size so it fits in the head of the box

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.680 
size so it fits in the head of the box
make<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.620> swatches<00:01:08.970> about<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.000> centimeter

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
make the swatches about a centimeter

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.990 
make the swatches about a centimeter

smudge guard and I start at the top left
hand<00:02:54.909> side<00:02:55.239> because<00:02:55.780> I'll<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:56.019> working<00:02:56.409> in

smudge my work with the back of my hand

smudge my work with the back of my hand
so<00:03:01.269> we'll<00:03:01.599> start<00:03:01.870> on<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.079> ear<00:03:02.519> for<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.639> colors

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
so we'll start on the ear for the colors

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.259 
so we'll start on the ear for the colors
I<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:04.930> impact<00:03:05.530> my<00:03:06.159> color<00:03:06.519> guide<00:03:06.849> here

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
I can just impact my color guide here

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.949 
I can just impact my color guide here
and<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.139> see<00:03:08.409> that<00:03:08.620> there's<00:03:08.889> a<00:03:09.099> six<00:03:09.959> there

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
and I can see that there's a six there

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.599 
and I can see that there's a six there
there's<00:03:11.889> some<00:03:12.220> white<00:03:12.780> number<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:14.609> there's

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
there's some white number one there's

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.020 
there's some white number one there's
some<00:03:15.909> purple<00:03:16.389> here<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.290> there's<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:18.220> twenty

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
some purple here so there's a twenty

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.140 
some purple here so there's a twenty
number<00:03:19.659> purple<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:22.799> what<00:03:23.799> else<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.250> there<00:03:24.639> I

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
number purple and what else is there I

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.869 
number purple and what else is there I
think<00:03:25.419> there's<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.109> number<00:03:26.500> fifty<00:03:27.280> sort<00:03:27.760> of

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
think there's a number fifty sort of

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.530 
think there's a number fifty sort of
dirty<00:03:28.329> orange<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.549> there's<00:03:30.549> some<00:03:30.909> charcoal

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
dirty orange and there's some charcoal

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.479 
dirty orange and there's some charcoal
and<00:03:33.030> fifty-nine<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.269> some<00:03:35.109> black<00:03:35.440> 60<00:03:36.220> so

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
and fifty-nine and some black 60 so

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.550 
and fifty-nine and some black 60 so
let's<00:03:36.699> get<00:03:36.879> to<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.659> whole<00:03:37.840> philosophy<00:03:38.109> I

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
let's get to it the whole philosophy I

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.069 
let's get to it the whole philosophy I
suppose<00:03:39.190> behind<00:03:39.699> this<00:03:39.970> process<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.780> color

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
suppose behind this process of a color

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.129 
suppose behind this process of a color

peel white to suggest the highlight then

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.460 
peel white to suggest the highlight then
I<00:05:08.740> can<00:05:09.009> create<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.669> other<00:05:09.820> eye<00:05:10.120> now<00:05:10.930> work<00:05:11.259> on

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
I can create the other eye now work on

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.740 
I can create the other eye now work on
the<00:05:11.620> fur<00:05:11.889> on<00:05:12.070> her<00:05:12.370> chest<00:05:12.789> and<00:05:13.090> for<00:05:13.660> this

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
the fur on her chest and for this

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.270 
the fur on her chest and for this
section<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.470> keep<00:05:15.130> my<00:05:15.400> strokes<00:05:16.000> long<00:05:16.830> now<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:17.860> lay

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
section I keep my strokes long now I lay

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.760 
section I keep my strokes long now I lay
a<00:05:18.310> base<00:05:18.610> coat<00:05:18.970> of<00:05:19.180> orange<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:19.780> then<00:05:20.289> yellow

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
a base coat of orange and then yellow

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.520 
a base coat of orange and then yellow
the<00:05:21.340> idea<00:05:21.760> with<00:05:22.000> this<00:05:22.270> is<00:05:22.539> that<00:05:22.870> when<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:23.169> lay

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
the idea with this is that when I lay

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.340 
the idea with this is that when I lay
the<00:05:23.590> white<00:05:23.919> over<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.430> top<00:05:24.760> it<00:05:25.240> will<00:05:25.660> tint<00:05:26.139> it

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
the white over the top it will tint it

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.159 
the white over the top it will tint it
thereby<00:05:27.130> suggesting<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:28.090> fur<00:05:28.360> is<00:05:28.630> slightly

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
thereby suggesting the fur is slightly

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.760 
thereby suggesting the fur is slightly
colored<00:05:29.800> well<00:05:30.340> this<00:05:30.820> is<00:05:31.000> really<00:05:31.660> taking<00:05:31.930> shape

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
colored well this is really taking shape

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.700 
colored well this is really taking shape
so<00:05:33.010> let's<00:05:33.550> paint<00:05:34.030> his<00:05:34.270> nose<00:05:34.510> and<00:05:35.229> I'm<00:05:35.349> using

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
so let's paint his nose and I'm using

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.170 
so let's paint his nose and I'm using
pink<00:05:36.340> number<00:05:36.820> eight<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:37.720> white<00:05:38.349> to<00:05:38.680> do<00:05:38.830> this

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
pink number eight and white to do this

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.870 
pink number eight and white to do this
so<00:05:40.180> I<00:05:40.210> lay<00:05:40.660> in<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:40.960> white<00:05:41.259> first<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:41.979> then<00:05:42.669> I

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
so I lay in the white first and then I

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.270 
so I lay in the white first and then I
lay<00:05:43.270> in<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.570> pink<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.080> blend<00:05:44.740> them<00:05:44.949> where

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
lay in the pink and blend them where

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.850 
lay in the pink and blend them where
they<00:05:45.460> meet<00:05:45.729> what<00:05:46.599> a<00:05:46.630> cute<00:05:47.020> little<00:05:47.199> nose<00:05:47.590> you

they meet what a cute little nose you
have<00:05:47.889> miss<00:05:48.310> tiger<00:05:48.789> now<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.660> lay<00:05:50.169> in<00:05:50.229> some<00:05:50.590> gray

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
have miss tiger now I lay in some gray

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.460 
have miss tiger now I lay in some gray
into<00:05:51.699> the<00:05:51.789> mouth<00:05:52.000> area<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:52.660> suggest<00:05:53.169> shadow

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
into the mouth area to suggest shadow

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.409 
into the mouth area to suggest shadow
and<00:05:53.919> into<00:05:54.460> that<00:05:54.639> I<00:05:54.880> add<00:05:55.360> the<00:05:55.570> white<00:05:57.060> time<00:05:58.060> now

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
and into that I add the white time now

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.379 
and into that I add the white time now
to<00:05:58.479> add<00:05:59.080> our<00:05:59.289> black<00:05:59.620> and<00:05:59.889> this<00:06:00.340> really<00:06:01.150> adds

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
to add our black and this really adds

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.870 
to add our black and this really adds
dimension<00:06:02.070> especially<00:06:03.070> because<00:06:03.220> this<00:06:03.550> black

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
dimension especially because this black

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.439 
dimension especially because this black
is<00:06:04.120> darker<00:06:05.050> than<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.260> paper<00:06:05.620> as<00:06:06.190> I<00:06:06.760> apply<00:06:07.090> my

lack of the paper show through for the
ultra<00:06:13.360> highlights<00:06:13.840> I<00:06:14.110> apply<00:06:14.590> some<00:06:14.620> white<00:06:15.159> with

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
ultra highlights I apply some white with

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.360 
ultra highlights I apply some white with

an ultra soft pastel this is optional

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.640
