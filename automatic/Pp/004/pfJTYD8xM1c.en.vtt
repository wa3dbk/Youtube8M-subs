00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
original pickup points there's a TPS

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.149 
original pickup points there's a TPS
here<00:01:19.090> it's<00:01:20.090> hooked<00:01:21.080> up<00:01:21.229> by<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.409> linkage<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.860> the

this<00:01:35.060> switch<00:01:35.360> here<00:01:36.130> activates<00:01:37.130> or

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
this switch here activates or

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.139 
this switch here activates or
deactivates<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:38.479> electric<00:01:38.840> motors<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:41.060> if

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
deactivates the electric motors so if

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.430 
deactivates the electric motors so if
you<00:01:41.240> want<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.420> drive<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:41.840> car<00:01:42.020> using<00:01:42.350> only

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
you want to drive for car using only

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.919 
you want to drive for car using only
electric<00:01:42.950> power<00:01:43.210> so<00:01:44.210> it's<00:01:44.330> just<00:01:44.509> switch<00:01:44.660> it<00:01:44.690> on

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
electric power so it's just switch it on

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.800 
electric power so it's just switch it on
without<00:01:45.350> turning<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.130> engine<00:01:46.660> push<00:01:47.660> this

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
without turning on the engine push this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.740 
without turning on the engine push this
button<00:01:47.990> here<00:01:50.110> click<00:01:52.210> it's<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.390> relays

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
button here click it's the relays

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.080 
button here click it's the relays
switching<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:55.000> then<00:01:56.000> all<00:01:56.119> we<00:01:56.210> have<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.360> do<00:01:56.630> put

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
switching on then all we have to do put

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:16.970 
switching on then all we have to do put
in<00:01:59.090> here<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:02.300> start<00:02:02.899> driving

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.110 

go<00:02:17.980> forward<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.460> have<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.670> get<00:02:18.790> back<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.090> stock

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
go forward we have to get back in stock

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:38.080 
go forward we have to get back in stock
first<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:21.010> then<00:02:21.220> move<00:02:21.430> into<00:02:21.610> drive

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.780 

there's<00:02:39.090> nothing<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.689> word<00:02:39.870> vengeance

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.149 

tries<00:02:47.790> about<00:02:48.120> as<00:02:48.329> well<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.680> did<00:02:49.860> with<00:02:50.069> the

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
tries about as well as you did with the

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.850 
tries about as well as you did with the
1<00:02:50.310> liter<00:02:50.459> engine<00:02:52.280> using<00:02:53.280> an<00:02:53.400> electric<00:02:53.879> power

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
1 liter engine using an electric power

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.789 
1 liter engine using an electric power
of<00:02:55.860> course<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.340> always<00:02:56.549> run<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.819> with<00:02:57.799> the

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
of course you can always run up with the

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:49.890 
of course you can always run up with the
engine<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.610> motors

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.449 

once<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.260> get<00:03:50.409> up<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.620> speed<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.040> doesn't<00:03:51.310> tell

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
once you get up to speed it doesn't tell

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.039 
once you get up to speed it doesn't tell
you<00:03:51.519> much<00:03:51.549> throttle<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.390> keep<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.690> Kresna

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
you much throttle just to keep it Kresna

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.030 
you much throttle just to keep it Kresna
alone

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
alone

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.310 
alone
so<00:03:56.040> see<00:03:56.280> how<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.460> guys<00:03:56.640> with<00:03:56.910> both<00:03:57.090> petrol<00:03:57.540> and

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
so see how it guys with both petrol and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:10.270 
so see how it guys with both petrol and
electric<00:03:59.280> power

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.940 

not<00:04:10.730> two<00:04:10.850> men<00:04:10.970> that<00:04:11.380> twice<00:04:12.380> as<00:04:12.560> good<00:04:12.710> as<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.920> was

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
not two men that twice as good as it was

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.160 
not two men that twice as good as it was
originally
