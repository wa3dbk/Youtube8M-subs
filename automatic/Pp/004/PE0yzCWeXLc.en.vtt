00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.500
 then we started 250 grams of 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.420
 chocolate 2 bars of butter of 90 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:44.650
 grams each 4 eggs 200 grams of 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.589
 sugar 70 grams of wheat flour one 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.010
 teaspoon of baking powder one 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.870
 pinch of salt to decorate chocolate for 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.150
 melt preferably be from a 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.120
 highlighting color 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.400
 in a single bowl we put the chocolate 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.550
 together with the two bars of 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.890
 butter and then put it in 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.830
 the microwave oven for periods 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.440
 20 to 20 seconds in a bowl we put 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.860
 the 4 complete eggs together with the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.840
 sugar meanwhile we verify that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.320
 so melted is our mixture of 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.020
 microwave we stir a little and we go back 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.210
 to enter another 20 seconds this in 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.030
 case of not being completely melted 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.270
 with a hand-held balloon we mix the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.580
 eggs and sugar we check again 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.150
 the mixture of the microwave and already melted 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.820
 we mix them with a shovel or spoon 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.550
 We stir this with the egg mixture and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.060
 sugar and mix very well so that it 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.060
 integrate 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.229
 apart we mix the dry ingredients 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.149
 flour for baking flour and salt and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.600
 add little by little to the mixture 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.600
 previous 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.620
 I recommend it to be with a balloon 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 hand so that we do not introduce much 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.300
 air our mix 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.300
 which should look more or less like this 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.810
 we enter and fill a mold 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.230
 medium we emptied all our 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.230
 mixture 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.640
 we introduce in the oven previously 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.159
 heated to 180 degrees centigrade 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.580
 while it is in the oven we put the 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.110
 bain marie chocolate to decorate 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.659
 we stir very well until it is 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.269
 completely melted after 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.040
 Approximately 20 minutes we verify 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.500
 with a knife on the top 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.709
 that is firm but somewhat moist that does not 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.299
 is liquid is left to cool and starting 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.870
 by the edges of the mold with a 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.269
 knife we cut into pictures we take out with 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.430
 take care of the brownie squares and the 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.349
 we place where we go to decorate 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.379
 with the chocolate that we had already 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.930
 melted and with a spoon we grate 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.790
 chocolate in our brownie for 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.000
 then add the dragees of your 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.000
 preference 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.460
 and ready and you have a recipe for you
