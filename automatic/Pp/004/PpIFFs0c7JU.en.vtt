out<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.510> everyone<00:04:25.110> has<00:04:25.229> made<00:04:25.410> errors<00:04:25.650> in

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
out is that everyone has made errors in

out is that everyone has made errors in
judgment<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.460> past

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
judgment in the past

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.500 
judgment in the past
but<00:04:27.620> right<00:04:27.950> now<00:04:28.010> at<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.580> moment<00:04:28.850> that<00:04:29.270> can

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
but right now at this moment that can

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.770 
but right now at this moment that can
change<00:04:29.980> they<00:04:30.980> can<00:04:31.250> change<00:04:31.580> but<00:04:32.360> how<00:04:32.570> are<00:04:32.600> they

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
change they can change but how are they

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.620 
change they can change but how are they
going<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.020> know<00:04:33.080> unless<00:04:33.470> we<00:04:33.530> tell<00:04:33.920> them<00:04:34.160> or

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
going to know unless we tell them or

going to know unless we tell them or
unless<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:35.780> choose<00:04:35.960> not<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.380> support<00:04:36.710> their

unless you choose not to support their
products<00:04:37.390> we<00:04:38.390> need<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.600> have<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.870> option<00:04:39.350> to
