to suck the way to call it the pesticide

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.870 
to suck the way to call it the pesticide
out<00:02:26.390> or<00:02:26.900> whatever<00:02:27.080> you're<00:02:27.380> spraying<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.950> then

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
out or whatever you're spraying and then

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.160 
out or whatever you're spraying and then
this<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:30.940> little<00:02:31.940> nozzle<00:02:32.150> here<00:02:32.600> they

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
this is just the little nozzle here they

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.020 
this is just the little nozzle here they
had<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.620> disassembled<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.520> guess<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:34.970> it

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
had it disassembled I guess so it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.840 
had it disassembled I guess so it
wouldn't<00:02:35.300> be<00:02:35.390> as<00:02:35.540> large<00:02:35.810> in<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.640> box

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
wouldn't be as large in the in the box
