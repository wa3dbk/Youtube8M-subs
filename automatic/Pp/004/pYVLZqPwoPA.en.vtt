00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 hey valentine is approaching ho 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.090
 thought therefore to make a gift 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.920
 homemade 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.580
 my idea was that of the logs 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.330
 coupons are practically tickets 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.810
 usable by our partner for 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.029
 several things eg certain breakfast 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
 in bed, massage your feet, whatever 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.179
 you want to write and it's a really idea 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.100
 very pretty, very easy to make 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:37.079
 which however is personal and unique and e 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.690
 half is a very pretty idea 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.100
 then I leave you a tutorial for how 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.800
 realize it to make the coupons 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 first we choose a form I have 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.510
 chosen that of a rectangle with a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.170
 hole reminiscent of cinema tickets 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.270
 Americans like those in the hall 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.629
 games 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:06.119
 this rectangle is 8 x 4 centimeters 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.760
 and all I did was fold it in half 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.210
 and cut a piece where leaving 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.189
 an inch anyway 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 at this point or copied back to the form 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:25.799
 of the ticket on a card on a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.369
 red card but you can anyway 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.560
 choose any type of color I have 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.150
 cut coupons in groups of two 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.790
 because I want to make them with themes 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.430
 different with different colors in short 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.000
 so once cut out I don't 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 other than to take some wrapping paper 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.790
 or in any case if you already have some cardboard 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.610
 with a print used is the one and ho 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.619
 simply chose the card a 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.399
 pochettino intimate valentine here 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.000
 they are roses here too instead 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.520
 red with can also then there are 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.660
 roses so I do nothing but 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.319
 paste my card to the card 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.319
 from packages 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.950
 cut out 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.040
 once you cut out coupons 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.220
 choose whether to register directly 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.230
 on the wrapping paper we say the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.990
 print sky, however, allow me if color 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.200
 the marker we use can be seen 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:54.320
 or we cut out another small piece 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:57.080
 of cardboard for example big anyway 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.810
 any other color to apply 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:05.320
 more or less in the center and where you can 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:10.720
 write the coupon sentence this 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:14.720
 rectangle I used I measure 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.480
 5 x 2 cm 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.640
 Now let's paste the card 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.640
 small on the coupon 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.080
 to be able to rip coupons once 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.300
 bound together we just have to mark 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.600
 on the side we say ugly of the 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.960
 card a margin of one centimeter and 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.120
 draw a line for example in pencil 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.820
 along this line then to practice gods 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.750
 holes with a needle anyway something 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.360
 very pointed so that though 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.330
 coupons held together will succeed in 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.990
 to tear without damaging 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.510
 let's say all the packaging this is 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.950
 the appearance of the card once 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.680
 made the holes we go to bend along 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.060
 the line on which we have just done 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:19.620
 out 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:21.090
 let's try to see if it tears you 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.860
 time to fill 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.070
 our coupons here you can really 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.920
 write everything from the foot massage 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.400
 breakfast in sweet and in bed 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.750
 I recommend writing to you 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.560
 of personal things 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.770
 meaning if your partner likes it 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.290
 something in particular insert it in 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.370
 so make these coupons really 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.970
 unique and personalized 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.340
 at this point there remains only that 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.750
 I say put them assemble together 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.520
 I also wanted to create a kind of 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.670
 cover but is completely optional 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.750
 however it is a simple rectangle without 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.690
 precisely this hole to put precisely 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.980
 at the beginning to assemble them I don't 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:17.570
 other than creating let's say a couple of 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.570
 holes at the ends 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.520
 at this point I take a tape I have 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:33.389
 chose a red one with white polka dots and lo 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.380
 I pass through a hole first and then 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.380
 for the other 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.969
 disappear from and you enjoyed me 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.699
 know 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.219
 the tips ideas for valentines other 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:59.329
 gift idea from foods is set then 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.329
