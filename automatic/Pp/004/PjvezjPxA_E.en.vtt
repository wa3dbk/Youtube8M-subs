00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.719
 very good to all I'm axel and we're in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.059
 this new video for presence in the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.240
 that we are going to show you the beta 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 of ios 7 on the ipad so let's see 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.540
 how is it like you can see the beta for 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.980
 ai for ios 7 beta for ipad is 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.860
 exactly like the iphone 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.110
 there are hardly any differences there are changes 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.210
 apart from the restructuring to a 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.460
 screen like it's much bigger logical 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.720
 There are different novelties, as 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.989
 you can see the notification center 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.910
 now it's much bigger before 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.220
 it was just a little eyelash that came down 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.130
 now occupies the whole screen thing that to 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.120
 I personally like more 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.520
 you use more the ipad screen the center 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.940
 of control is also occupies all the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.190
 width of the screen 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.770
 obviously it 's redesigned for the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.260
 much bigger ipad screen not 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.540
 we have the buttons for example of power 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.810
 turn on the flashlight because as it is 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.700
 logical the ipad does not have flash like 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.430
 we can see the icons are exactly 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.800
 the same as the version for 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.740
 iphone we can see the clock icon 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.730
 how is it moving based on the time 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.430
 is 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.250
 the adjustments are the same as those 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.580
 we have in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.340
 on the iphone what happens obviously 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.720
 redesigned for the ipad screen 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.470
 we have the notification center here 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.120
 which is exactly the same the center of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.580
 control we also have the same option 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.010
 which is the power to access on the screen 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.430
 blocking or not a very interesting thing 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.840
 I really like him 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.680
 of the iPad version is that now the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.780
 camera allows us to use hdr as we have 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.730
 here the option thing that before 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.830
 we had then we can take pictures 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.280
 with the hdr option it also allows us 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.220
 to square photos and as we 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.960
 the option of the on the iphone does not 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.020
 allows you to take panoramic photos but 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.410
 surely that later surely 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.760
 will come out at least on the third ipad 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.580
 generation that is from where I am 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.160
 recording the video we do not have that option 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.370
 but surely we can later on 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.880
 get the option of multitasking is 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.130
 exactly the same goes very smoothly inside 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.590
 of ipad2 maybe in the video you see it a 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.540
 little choppy but not for him not 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.910
 is for the ipad because I'm going to 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.310
 see if they see me perfectly smooth is because 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.080
 the program that I use to record but it's 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.050
 exactly the same, the truth is that the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.040
 conversion to ipad from this one 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.850
 of this sale of io s 7 really is very 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.890
 good here we can see the calendar that 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.190
 it's exactly the same as on the iphone 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.580
 but much more taken advantage of by the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.680
 ipad screen if we open safari 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.359
 we see what 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.610
 we do not have the option of the tabs 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:10.010
 how we had it on the iphone 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.910
 although if we see that it is very fluid we 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:19.070
 allows forgiveness allows us to share the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.200
 web pages add them to favorites or 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.880
 share them by mail by message by 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.550
 twitter and so on 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.910
 it's really also very fluid is 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.970
 pretty pretty quick reminders 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.760
 it has also changed slightly maybe 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.620
 does not have the visualization that we have 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.000
 inside the iphone but really the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.700
 change that has stuck 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.580
 compared to that 6 well it's pretty 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.940
 quite interesting that I also ccoo 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.430
 They have undergone a slight change you see 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.650
 the display is very different other 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.319
 of the changes we have in that 7 for 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:01.170
 ipad that is the same as on the iphone is 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:03.939
 the application of photographs we see that 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.400
 it's exactly the same as the iphone 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.670
 we have here we can separate them into 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.870
 different years we can separate it by 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.640
 events really this is fine 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.790
 because it allows us 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.700
 see the photos much better than the photos 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.420
 we have on the ipad or icloud and everything 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.100
 this allows us to see much more comfortable 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.680
 that as we had before the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.669
 photographs that we have on our ipad 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.560
 multi-touch gestures are also 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.050
 included in this beta of that 7 for 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.080
 ipad 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.430
 maybe they are not as fluid as 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.320
 should we have to think that this 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.680
 it's still a beta 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.430
 but but they are here really 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.440
 they work if we raise the four fingers 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.130
 up from the screen we 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.889
 Multitasking appears as it did until 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.740
 until now 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.110
 when we open an application the same 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.569
 If we put all fingers inward 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.749
 we are closed the application therefore 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:13.129
 multitouch gestures are still 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:14.840
 present inside this beta of ios the 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:19.520
 Maps application has also improved 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.430
 we see that it is much more faster 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.460
 It really is very 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.460
 it's very interesting lets us see with 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.320
 a softness as long as the wifi 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.810
 that we have allowed us 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.890
 it's fast but we see that it loads very very 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.570
 fast the fluidity of the maps also 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.570
 it's quite interesting 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.860
 we see that it loads pretty fast 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.890
 in standard mode as it is logical is 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.230
 even even faster another of the 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:00.240
 changes that is included in in this beta 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:02.000
 of ios 7 also for ipad is siri ya what 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.430
 I commented on him 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.860
 in the video that I made for beta 2 of 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.300
 io s 7 for the iphone and you me what 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.190
 you comment in the comments 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.110
 and esque 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.650
 the only way to change the 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.200
 genre of saying and putting him man or 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.010
 Only woman is available in 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.430
 English from the US is worth it if we put it in 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.430
 Spanish 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.409
 we do not have this option I imagine that 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:33.469
 later he will add us in this option 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:36.740
 for espanyol like they did when 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:39.590
 came out ozil and stops for the iphone that 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.629
 until a year later we could not have it 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.300
 in Spanish but I imagine that more 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.770
 forward then they will add it we see that 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.330
 we also have integration with the 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.120
 different social networks within 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.550
 about it we have twitter facebook and 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.400
 now we also have flicker and we have 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.830
 vimeo is worth so this also what 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.870
 We can add 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:06.740
 if we obviously want in 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:09.140
 in our social networks and this has 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.690
 been everything we have simply wanted 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:15.980
 check a bit how the beta works 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:17.720
 of ios 7 on our ipad we see that 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.410
 it works quite well it's pretty 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.240
 fluid is very similar practically to the 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.580
 of iphone as it is logical is simply 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:29.240
 with a slightly larger screen but 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:32.510
 it works very well and good if we see that 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.310
 different news come out or we find 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.420
 different details that are of interest 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:40.780
 Well, we will return to 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:43.030
 to comment on them in the blog so much for the 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.790
 blog as per youtube if it is 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:48.300
 necessary in agreement then we leave it 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:51.300
 here and see you in the next video 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.300
 goodbye
