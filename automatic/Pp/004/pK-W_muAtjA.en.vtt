00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.200
 preparation that the meatball have 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.410
 beef here preferably watches 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.989
 buy lean meat that means no 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.170
 has fat already has a little fat 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.079
 but good you buy without fat for 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.340
 that we give fat to children less 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.100
 animal so better 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.620
 Lean as you can do you can ask 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.500
 the butcher who grinds him guilty or 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.650
 blame 'great the bed was always 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.200
 pretty fat free very well let's 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.110
 add sesame in the conjunctiva give 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.420
 a lot of texture to our rich meatball 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.200
 a little bit of English sauce so that the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.820
 flavor 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.800
 onion remember that it has to be 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.320
 grated to blend perfectly 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.130
 can not miss wonderful low liter 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.520
 let's put salt 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.600
 enough know appointment and let's go 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.329
 dancing 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.300
 this also the taste sure we are going to 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:47.950
 put freshly ground pepper 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.460
 we mix very very well 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.250
 and to integrate everything we are going to put a 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.850
 egg 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.450
 so a little egg and a little bit of tan 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.610
 ground or wheat germ look at the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.120
 I made wheat germ with 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.130
 meatballs and do not know how thick it thickens 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.160
 incredible too I think suddenly 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.010
 I felt that the sauce makes it very dense 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.720
 that I suggest bread crushed then I looked 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.680
 for that I am to experiment in 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.290
 my house and here I bring you the best 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.910
 the tried and tested recipes and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.489
 that you do not have any 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.730
 problem at the time of nothing 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.820
 at the time of doing them very well we have 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.380
 already ready our mix my grandmother 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.470
 puts rice to the raw meatballs 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.060
 thanks jerry and I really liked it with rice 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.840
 but many roses with holly to see what you 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.630
 It seems 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.989
 we have here cooked green tomato a 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.690
 little bit of sesame seeds and look 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.090
 the beauty of this chili pepper that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.850
 it is not very used unfortunately but 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.020
 it is one 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.720
 marvel see how it is in its dry state 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.560
 and so is hydrated what color so 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.590
 cute and look is called bell because 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.980
 when shaking it sounds like a rattle and in 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.530
 screen we will see the states and the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.700
 degrees of chilies notice that a 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.880
 American in 1900 and its this scale 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.390
 is the vescovian scale and on this scale 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.020
 he started good to see how much they stung 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.270
 every chili then good he already 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.630
 knows the spiciest is the habanero and the 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.940
 less spicy is the poblano pepper and the 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.950
 bell pepper then good more 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.440
 ahead we will see the graph so that 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.290
 you appreciate it I will add the 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.860
 chilies 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.410
 chicken soup 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:54.590
 garlic let's put onion 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.890
 a little bit of cumin remember only one 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.250
 little bit and we had all the stew and 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.570
 you are going to see cumin and you will not like it 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.930
 then and the sesame there is and 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.930

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.470

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.470
 a little meat 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.420
 in the eyes 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.610
 then I prefer that they be from a 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.610
 medium size 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.960
