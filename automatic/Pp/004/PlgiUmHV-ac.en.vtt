again<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:49.170> looks<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.409> Levi<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
again it looks like Levi is going to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.620 
again it looks like Levi is going to
come<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.549> different<00:01:50.700> body<00:01:51.060> compared<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
come with different body compared to a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.200 
come with different body compared to a
Aaron<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.340> body<00:01:53.549> looks<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.060> more

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
slim a lot more straight so I think it's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.160

going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> different<00:01:57.210> body<00:01:57.509> compared<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
going to be a different body compared to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.639

Aaron

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
so like before a mixer is going to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.150 
so like before a mixer is going to
include<00:03:18.459> free<00:03:18.910> expressions<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:20.260> right<00:03:20.980> here

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
include free expressions so right here

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.710 
include free expressions so right here
is<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.310> sidelong<00:03:21.610> glance<00:03:21.910> which<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.330> again

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
is a sidelong glance which is again

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.330 
is a sidelong glance which is again
exclusive<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.620> initial<00:03:24.100> production

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
exclusive to the initial production

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.729 
exclusive to the initial production
batch<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:25.120> first<00:03:25.360> batch<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.630> mixer<00:03:26.380> figures

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
batch the first batch of mixer figures

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.680 
batch the first batch of mixer figures
they're<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.459> second<00:03:27.760> batch<00:03:27.880> will<00:03:28.150> not<00:03:28.330> come

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
with the sidelong glance expression so

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.820 
with the sidelong glance expression so
yeah<00:03:31.570> I'm<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.750> really<00:03:32.019> big<00:03:32.200> fan<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.410> Dion<00:03:32.620> me

to be a season 2 in 2015 which is quite
a<00:03:49.720> long<00:03:49.959> way<00:03:50.260> away<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:51.580> going<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.730> be

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
a long way away so it's going to be

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.310 
a long way away so it's going to be
quite<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> long<00:03:52.330> wait<00:03:52.570> but<00:03:52.840> I'm<00:03:52.959> sure<00:03:53.140> they'll

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
quite a long wait but I'm sure they'll

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.770 
quite a long wait but I'm sure they'll
give<00:03:53.530> us<00:03:53.650> something<00:03:53.860> special<00:03:53.950> in<00:03:54.250> 2015<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.060> so

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.320 
give us something special in 2015 and so
yeah<00:03:55.959> we<00:03:56.140> look<00:03:56.739> forward<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.100> but<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.150> was

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
yeah we look forward to that but I was

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.729 
yeah we look forward to that but I was
right<00:03:58.540> here<00:03:58.720> is<00:03:58.840> Harry<00:03:58.989> mixer<00:03:59.350> locked<00:03:59.590> with

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
right here is Harry mixer locked with

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.910 
right here is Harry mixer locked with
the<00:03:59.890> survey<00:04:00.340> corpse<00:04:00.820> cube<00:04:01.410> select<00:04:02.410> form<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.860> a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
the survey corpse cube select form in a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.900 
the survey corpse cube select form in a
really<00:04:03.160> material<00:04:03.549> probably

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
really material probably

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.880 
really material probably
and<00:04:05.360> if<00:04:05.510> I'm<00:04:05.630> at<00:04:05.750> freedom<00:04:06.170> most<00:04:06.410> likely<00:04:06.560> and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
and if I'm at freedom most likely and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.620 
and if I'm at freedom most likely and
here<00:04:07.520> is<00:04:07.640> how<00:04:07.790> she<00:04:07.850> ducked<00:04:08.150> with<00:04:08.270> all<00:04:08.450> the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
here is how she ducked with all the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.270 
here is how she ducked with all the
accessories<00:04:08.990> should<00:04:09.620> probably<00:04:09.800> commence<00:04:10.130> on

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
accessories should probably commence on

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.340 
accessories should probably commence on
them<00:04:10.490> extra<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.360> changeable<00:04:11.750> hands<00:04:12.020> as<00:04:12.170> well

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
them extra and changeable hands as well

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.550 
them extra and changeable hands as well
so<00:04:13.130> pretty<00:04:13.340> nice<00:04:13.510> next<00:04:14.510> figure<00:04:14.720> here<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.380> is

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
so pretty nice next figure here this is

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.550 
so pretty nice next figure here this is
army<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.160> really<00:04:17.060> like<00:04:17.300> the<00:04:17.450> character<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.200> army

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
army I really like the character of army

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.610 
army I really like the character of army
is<00:04:18.709> really<00:04:19.459> cool<00:04:19.610> character<00:04:20.530> MC<00:04:21.530> yeah

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
is really cool character MC yeah

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.870 
is really cool character MC yeah
definitely<00:04:22.040> looks<00:04:22.190> like<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.400> pretty<00:04:22.760> nice

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
definitely looks like a pretty nice

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.060 
definitely looks like a pretty nice
figure<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.380> again<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.620> think<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:24.920> might<00:04:25.040> come

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
figure and again I think it might come

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.150 
figure and again I think it might come
with<00:04:25.340> different<00:04:25.460> body<00:04:25.760> compared<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:27.160> Aaron

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
with different body compared to Aaron

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.040 
with different body compared to Aaron
and<00:04:28.310> Levite<00:04:28.760> this<00:04:29.000> one<00:04:29.120> looks<00:04:29.330> smaller<00:04:29.930> I

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
and Levite this one looks smaller I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.800 
and Levite this one looks smaller I
think<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.590> because<00:04:31.550> premature<00:04:32.090> army<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:32.780> a

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
think and because premature army is a

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.230 
think and because premature army is a
younger<00:04:33.140> character<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.650> believe<00:04:33.980> so<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:34.850> mean<00:04:35.210> I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
younger character I believe so I mean I

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.030 
younger character I believe so I mean I
think<00:04:35.360> that<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.750> body<00:04:36.110> is<00:04:36.290> going<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.530> be<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.650> lot

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
think that the body is going to be a lot

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.630 
think that the body is going to be a lot
smaller

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
smaller

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.340 
smaller
all<00:04:37.970> right<00:04:38.240> here<00:04:38.390> is<00:04:38.480> how<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.660> looks<00:04:38.750> with<00:04:39.170> the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
all right here is how it looks with the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.550 
all right here is how it looks with the
the<00:04:39.650> flare<00:04:39.920> gun<00:04:39.950> so<00:04:40.880> pretty<00:04:41.090> nice<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:42.350> so<00:04:42.530> I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
the flare gun so pretty nice and so I

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.660 
the flare gun so pretty nice and so I
think<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:42.950> figure<00:04:43.160> looks<00:04:43.310> pretty<00:04:43.520> good

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
think that the figure looks pretty good

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.450 
think that the figure looks pretty good
probably<00:04:44.120> won't<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.450> best<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.840> lot<00:04:45.230> so<00:04:45.410> far<00:04:45.680> rid

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
probably won't the best a lot so far rid

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.370 
probably won't the best a lot so far rid
of<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.880> Atheist<00:04:47.390> scope<00:04:47.600> looks<00:04:47.900> really<00:04:48.170> good

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
of the Atheist scope looks really good

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.680 
of the Atheist scope looks really good
and<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:49.340> before<00:04:49.640> he<00:04:49.850> will<00:04:50.000> cover<00:04:50.270> free

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
and so like before he will cover free

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.380 
and so like before he will cover free
facial<00:04:51.260> expressions<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.040> I<00:04:53.000> believe<00:04:53.270> that

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
facial expressions and I believe that

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.660 
facial expressions and I believe that
one<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.660> going<00:04:54.170> to<00:04:54.230> be<00:04:54.320> a<00:04:54.350> again<00:04:55.040> initial

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
one is going to be a again initial

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.360 
one is going to be a again initial
production<00:04:56.090> batch<00:04:56.450> exclusive<00:04:57.230> I<00:04:57.410> believe

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
production batch exclusive I believe

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.360 
production batch exclusive I believe
this<00:04:58.610> one<00:04:58.760> right<00:04:58.880> here<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.270> second<00:04:59.780> glance

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
this one right here the second glance

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.320 
this one right here the second glance
so<00:05:01.370> I'm<00:05:01.670> here's<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.830> server<00:05:03.830> core<00:05:04.070> clip<00:05:04.370> now

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
so I'm here's the server core clip now

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.550 
so I'm here's the server core clip now
in<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.510> next<00:05:05.660> figure<00:05:05.780> here<00:05:06.050> this<00:05:06.200> is<00:05:06.350> a<00:05:06.380> knee

in the next figure here this is a knee

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.370 
in the next figure here this is a knee
