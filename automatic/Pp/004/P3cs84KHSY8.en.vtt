00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.449
 and yes 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.260
 i 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.080
 is a small business micro company 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.470
 between my dad and me that we formed by 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.750
 I like the boixos cars and that's why I 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.110
 they like it a lot because it has enough 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.660
 technology a technological breakthrough in 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.660
 convert a reciprocal motor that is a 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.050
 piston engine of a large car in 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.070
 a small-scale engine that works 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.070
 in the same way 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.110
 good in a matter of games to the engine in 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.900
 carlos exist harold of scale 116 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.270
 that are more or less than 20 to 25 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.970
 centimeters long plus or minus you 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.980
 follow Carlos step or 10 is a car 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.100
 forty and fifty meters 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.830
 long already the cars 18 that are 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.620
 forms that all of these here that are a 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.170
 car of 45 or 50 centimeters long and 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.910
 there are 15 scale cars that are already 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.370
 large cars that use engines 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.800
 scythe of 26 cubic centimeters that 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.670
 can measure up to 80 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.670
 centimeters long 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.840
 this these categorized cars depend 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.720
 of the engine like here in Colombia 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.440
 we handle cubic centimeters this would 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.790
 more or less than 1 cubic centimeter up 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.010
 58 cubic centimeters that can have 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.410
 a car of these and the planes can 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.220
 get up to 10 15 cubic centimeters 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.220
 in smith engine 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.060
 has its axes has almost everything the same 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.060
 of a car has this brake theism 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.760
 in a car these start more or 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 less than 6 600 550 thousand pesos are Carlos 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.240
 then economic in scale 1 days that are 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.860
 smaller than the station of the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.840
 that we have here are cars that arrive 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.270
 more or less than 50 to 60 kilometers 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.300
 hour and competition cars like 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.680
 scale 18 15 can exceed the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.680
 60 kilometers per hour 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.980
 the competences normally of those of 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.890
 these cars is a competition more or 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.800
 less starts from 2 people up to 16 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.150
 more or less here in Medellin there are several 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.770
 clues as there is one of Juan Pablo 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.740
 second there is a clue 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.640
 no longer big there is a clue mind of the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.160
 which engineers 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.010
 There is another track in Mahalo 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.170
 and there is a track 50 meters above 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.790
 the final yellow school and also by 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.129
 choosing 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.129
 now the lid is now 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.470
 when I met them in stick with radios 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.750
 fm 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.840
 they had interference from any 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.599
 station that was here in Medellin 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.260
 you were very maluco driving a car 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.849
 Air boat 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.360
 already after there is a technology that 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.220
 called 2.4 ghz technology but one 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.680
 technology that is only handled by 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.420
 same car in your configuration you know 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.799
 no other car, no other 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.989
 station can interfere there also go 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.260
 updating controls in systems 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.170
 network reception there are controls that 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.200
 is taking out the company tracsa and is 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.940
 taking out controls that they use that are 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.400
 using the iphone to measure 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.500
 temperature speed and how the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.760
 efficiency of the car itself 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.569
 do not 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.569
 yes
