00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
four or five years where they basically

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.500 
four or five years where they basically
one<00:01:00.660> ninety<00:01:01.350> percent<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> Grand<00:01:02.219> Slams

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
one ninety percent of the Grand Slams

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.469 
one ninety percent of the Grand Slams
you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.840> were<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.489> right<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> think

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
you know they were and right now I think

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
you know they were and right now I think
it<00:01:06.930> gets<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.619> bit<00:01:07.799> more<00:01:07.979> interesting

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it gets a little bit more interesting

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.609 
it gets a little bit more interesting
for<00:01:08.760> our<00:01:09.090> sport<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> bigger

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
for our sport because there is a bigger

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.230 
for our sport because there is a bigger
group<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> players<00:01:11.460> including<00:01:12.000> myself

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
