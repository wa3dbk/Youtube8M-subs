00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
literally snow down there by school work

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.609

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
and sort of all sorts of stuff so uh

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.200

yeah<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.369> kind<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.760> take<00:00:23.910> priority

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
yeah I have to kind of take priority

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.540 
yeah I have to kind of take priority
because<00:00:24.930> school<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.920> little<00:00:26.279> bit<00:00:26.400> more

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
because school is a little bit more

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.210 
because school is a little bit more
important<00:00:27.029> than<00:00:27.300> YouTube<00:00:27.720> at<00:00:28.410> least<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.890> like

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
important than YouTube at least I like

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950 
important than YouTube at least I like
to<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.580> otherwise<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.779> probably

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
to think so otherwise I'm probably

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.350 
to think so otherwise I'm probably
wasting<00:00:31.230> my<00:00:31.500> time<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.920> school<00:00:32.189> well<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.239> know

I could be spending all the time just
making<00:00:35.010> videos<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:36.090> certainly<00:00:36.690> that's<00:00:36.960> not

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
making videos but certainly that's not
