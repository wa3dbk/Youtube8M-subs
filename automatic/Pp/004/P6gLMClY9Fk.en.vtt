hey everybody I'm Erin Edgar and in this

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.850 
hey everybody I'm Erin Edgar and in this
installment<00:00:08.690> of<00:00:08.900> the<00:00:08.990> polyrhythm<00:00:09.500> series

installment of the polyrhythm series

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.440 
installment of the polyrhythm series
we're<00:00:10.040> going<00:00:10.160> to<00:00:10.219> talk<00:00:10.400> about<00:00:10.430> six<00:00:10.969> over<00:00:11.240> five

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
we're going to talk about six over five

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.650 
we're going to talk about six over five
and<00:00:11.719> 6<00:00:12.260> over<00:00:12.410> 7<00:00:12.740> now<00:00:13.670> in<00:00:14.179> case<00:00:14.389> you<00:00:14.540> don't

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
and 6 over 7 now in case you don't

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.839 
and 6 over 7 now in case you don't
remember<00:00:14.809> from<00:00:15.170> previous<00:00:15.470> episodes<00:00:16.369> how<00:00:16.790> to

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
remember from previous episodes how to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.910 
remember from previous episodes how to
figure<00:00:17.390> these<00:00:17.509> out<00:00:17.689> the<00:00:18.050> easiest<00:00:18.650> way<00:00:18.860> to

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
figure these out the easiest way to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.519 
figure these out the easiest way to
think<00:00:19.160> about<00:00:19.279> it<00:00:19.550> would<00:00:19.670> be<00:00:19.730> for<00:00:20.689> example<00:00:20.720> 4<00:00:21.320> 6

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
think about it would be for example 4 6

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.760 
think about it would be for example 4 6
over<00:00:21.739> 5<00:00:21.919> if<00:00:22.220> we<00:00:22.340> took<00:00:22.489> a<00:00:22.610> bar<00:00:22.759> of<00:00:22.910> 5<00:00:23.239> 4<00:00:23.660> we<00:00:24.470> split

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
over 5 if we took a bar of 5 4 we split

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.920 
over 5 if we took a bar of 5 4 we split
it<00:00:24.860> up<00:00:24.950> into<00:00:25.160> groups<00:00:25.460> of<00:00:25.579> six<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:26.450> sixteenth

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
it up into groups of six so sixteenth

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.350 
it up into groups of six so sixteenth
note<00:00:27.169> triplets<00:00:27.649> and<00:00:27.800> played<00:00:28.220> every<00:00:28.669> fifth<00:00:29.029> one

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
note triplets and played every fifth one

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.540 
note triplets and played every fifth one
that<00:00:29.960> would<00:00:30.050> give<00:00:30.200> us<00:00:30.320> six<00:00:30.649> equally<00:00:31.279> spaced

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
that would give us six equally spaced

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.819 
that would give us six equally spaced
notes<00:00:31.849> over<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:32.540> course<00:00:32.750> of<00:00:32.930> five<00:00:33.290> equally

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
notes over the course of five equally

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.190 
notes over the course of five equally
spaced<00:00:34.070> notes<00:00:34.340> relative<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.000> our<00:00:35.090> pulse<00:00:35.360> now

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
spaced notes relative to our pulse now

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.069 
spaced notes relative to our pulse now
the<00:00:36.260> same<00:00:36.590> thing<00:00:36.859> is<00:00:36.890> true<00:00:37.190> for<00:00:37.399> 6<00:00:37.760> over<00:00:38.000> 7<00:00:38.210> same

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
the same thing is true for 6 over 7 same

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.549 
the same thing is true for 6 over 7 same
idea<00:00:39.410> let's<00:00:39.710> take<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:40.160> bar<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:40.760> 7/4<00:00:41.420> cut<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.440> up

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
idea let's take a bar of 7/4 cut it up

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.349 
idea let's take a bar of 7/4 cut it up
into<00:00:42.710> sixes<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:43.339> play<00:00:43.550> every<00:00:43.699> seventh<00:00:44.149> one

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
into sixes and play every seventh one

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.389 
into sixes and play every seventh one
well<00:00:44.870> it's<00:00:44.989> 6<00:00:45.260> equally<00:00:45.620> spaced<00:00:45.859> notes<00:00:46.160> over

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
well it's 6 equally spaced notes over

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.520 
well it's 6 equally spaced notes over
the<00:00:46.489> same<00:00:46.730> period<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.269> time<00:00:47.329> as<00:00:47.480> 7<00:00:48.109> equally

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
the same period of time as 7 equally

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.979 
the same period of time as 7 equally
spaced<00:00:48.769> notes<00:00:49.039> relative<00:00:49.609> to<00:00:49.760> our<00:00:49.850> pulse<00:00:50.120> we're

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
spaced notes relative to our pulse we're

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.419 
spaced notes relative to our pulse we're
going<00:00:51.109> to<00:00:51.170> use<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.530> same<00:00:51.829> sticking<00:00:52.309> that

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
going to use the same sticking that

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.400 
going to use the same sticking that
we've<00:00:52.609> used<00:00:52.879> for<00:00:53.300> most<00:00:53.629> of<00:00:53.809> our<00:00:53.899> 5<00:00:54.170> note

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
we've used for most of our 5 note

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.590 
we've used for most of our 5 note
groupings<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.280> far<00:00:55.519> in<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.730> series<00:00:56.089> we're

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
groupings so far in the series we're

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:36.220 
groupings so far in the series we're
going<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.809> use<00:00:56.899> right<00:00:57.379> left<00:00:57.859> right<00:00:58.129> right<00:00:58.640> left

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.810 

now<00:01:37.230> that<00:01:37.410> you<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> idea<00:01:38.010> of<00:01:38.160> that<00:01:38.370> let's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
now that you have the idea of that let's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.670 
now that you have the idea of that let's
check<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.150> some<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.660> its<00:01:39.720> permutations

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
check out some of its permutations

00:01:40.680 --> 00:02:00.260 
check out some of its permutations
let's<00:01:40.860> move<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> six<00:01:41.580> around<00:01:58.790> great<00:01:59.790> let's<00:02:00.180> do

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
let's move the six around great let's do

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.390 
let's move the six around great let's do
the<00:02:00.360> same<00:02:00.540> thing<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.990> seven<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.950> time<00:02:02.250> we're

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
the same thing for seven this time we're

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.760 
the same thing for seven this time we're
going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.550> use<00:02:02.790> right<00:02:03.240> left<00:02:03.690> right<00:02:03.960> left<00:02:04.200> right

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
going to use right left right left right

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:33.320 
going to use right left right left right
right<00:02:05.160> left

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:03:06.290 

and<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.450> course<00:02:34.720> some<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.080> permutations

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.520 

so<00:03:07.300> these<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.630> course<00:03:07.870> were<00:03:08.110> these<00:03:08.230> Pali

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
so these of course were these Pali

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.990 
so these of course were these Pali
rhythms<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:08.980> some<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.190> their<00:03:09.310> most<00:03:09.400> basic

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
rhythms and some of their most basic

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.400 
rhythms and some of their most basic
form<00:03:10.330> make<00:03:11.290> sure<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.590> spend<00:03:11.890> some<00:03:12.160> good<00:03:12.190> time

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
form make sure you spend some good time

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.930 
form make sure you spend some good time
internalizing<00:03:14.410> these<00:03:14.560> rhythms<00:03:14.770> because<00:03:15.700> in

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
internalizing these rhythms because in

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.670 
internalizing these rhythms because in
the<00:03:16.180> next<00:03:16.330> episode<00:03:16.840> we're<00:03:16.989> gonna<00:03:17.110> apply<00:03:17.410> them

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
the next episode we're gonna apply them

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.290 
the next episode we're gonna apply them
