that<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.180> has<00:00:31.780> no<00:00:31.960> collision<00:00:32.349> you<00:00:32.590> can<00:00:33.340> walk

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
that it has no collision you can walk

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.080 
that it has no collision you can walk
right<00:00:33.640> through<00:00:33.700> it

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
right through it

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.790 
right through it
so<00:00:34.239> before<00:00:34.810> we<00:00:34.960> start<00:00:35.290> what<00:00:35.350> we're<00:00:35.530> doing

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
so before we start what we're doing

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.680 
so before we start what we're doing
we're<00:00:35.950> going<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.160> go<00:00:36.460> back<00:00:36.579> over<00:00:36.850> here<00:00:36.880> double

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
we're going to go back over here double

we're going to go back over here double
click<00:00:37.720> on<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:38.050> door<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.860> click<00:00:39.040> on<00:00:39.190> collision

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
click on the door and click on collision

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.920 
click on the door and click on collision
we<00:00:39.579> see<00:00:39.730> it<00:00:39.790> has<00:00:39.970> none<00:00:40.270> so<00:00:40.480> I'll<00:00:40.570> go<00:00:40.690> over<00:00:40.780> here

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
we see it has none so I'll go over here

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.229 
we see it has none so I'll go over here
to<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.230> tab<00:00:41.500> this<00:00:41.739> collision<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.790> drop<00:00:43.030> down

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
to this tab this collision and drop down

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.450 
to this tab this collision and drop down
and<00:00:43.570> say<00:00:43.810> Auto<00:00:44.050> convex<00:00:44.530> collision<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.160> hit

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
and say Auto convex collision and hit

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.450 
and say Auto convex collision and hit
apply<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:46.149> there<00:00:46.899> you<00:00:46.989> go<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.380> door<00:00:47.530> has<00:00:47.860> some

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
apply and there you go the door has some

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.790 
apply and there you go the door has some
collision<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.390> if<00:00:49.450> we<00:00:49.510> minimize<00:00:49.840> this<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.470> we

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
collision so if we minimize this and we

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.220 
collision so if we minimize this and we
go<00:00:50.920> back<00:00:51.130> into<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.760> game<00:00:52.059> we<00:00:52.690> can<00:00:52.930> no<00:00:53.200> longer

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
go back into the game we can no longer

all right so now the boxes are selected

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.900 
all right so now the boxes are selected
we're<00:02:31.959> going<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.170> go<00:02:32.350> into<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:33.610> level

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
we're going to go into the level

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.240 
we're going to go into the level
blueprints<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:35.110> then<00:02:35.680> we're<00:02:35.770> going<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.920> call

blueprints and then we're going to call

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.960 
blueprints and then we're going to call
reference<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.570> collision<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.700> begin<00:02:39.700> overlap

at the Box trigger collision end overlap
at<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.300> Box<00:02:43.480> trigger<00:02:44.220> we're<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.430> call

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
at the Box trigger we're going to call

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.030 
at the Box trigger we're going to call
just<00:02:46.360> press<00:02:46.540> key<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.080> then<00:02:47.380> hit<00:02:47.410> enter

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
I like II as an interactive key it's

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.470 
I like II as an interactive key it's
just<00:02:50.290> what<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.090> then<00:02:52.209> we're<00:02:52.300> going<00:02:52.390> to

have<00:02:52.600> gamepad<00:02:53.140> map<00:02:54.130> at<00:02:54.340> top<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.780> would<00:02:55.989> be

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
have gamepad map at top this would be

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.990 
have gamepad map at top this would be
the<00:02:56.380> triangle<00:02:56.800> button<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.070> PS<00:02:57.370> controller<00:02:57.700> and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
you know controller compatible so you're

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.090 
you know controller compatible so you're
going<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.630> right<00:03:05.140> click<00:03:05.170> again<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.739> a<00:03:05.890> type<00:03:06.070> of

saying is if E is pressed or triangle or

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.610 
saying is if E is pressed or triangle or
Y<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.670> pressed<00:03:13.180> while<00:03:14.079> you're<00:03:14.290> standing

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
flip-flop so it's going to go between

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.580 
flip-flop so it's going to go between
the<00:03:39.940> two<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.510> make<00:03:40.690> sure<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.110> opening

animation play is a and the reverse
animation<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.340> B<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.840> basically<00:03:47.200> whenever<00:03:47.799> you

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
animation is B so basically whenever you

someone asked me to put this up for a

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.560 
someone asked me to put this up for a
download<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:14.760> they<00:05:14.940> could<00:05:15.090> take<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.270> look<00:05:15.360> out
