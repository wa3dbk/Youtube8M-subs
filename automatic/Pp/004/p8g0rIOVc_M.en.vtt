00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
balanced bourbon it's something that you

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.570 
balanced bourbon it's something that you
could<00:01:42.340> very<00:01:42.400> easily<00:01:42.640> mix<00:01:43.270> at<00:01:43.510> 90-proof

bourbon<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.540> what<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.690> mean<00:04:12.840> by<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.020> is<00:04:13.290> they

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
bourbon and what I mean by that is they

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.830 
bourbon and what I mean by that is they
take<00:04:13.590> credit<00:04:13.770> as<00:04:14.220> being<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:15.210> first<00:04:15.360> we<00:04:15.690> did

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
take credit as being the first we did

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.400 
take credit as being the first we did
