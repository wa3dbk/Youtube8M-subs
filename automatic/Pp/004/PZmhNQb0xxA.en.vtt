ahead<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.019> apply<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.799> it's<00:02:43.310> very<00:02:43.519> easy

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
ahead and apply that and it's very easy

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.530 
ahead and apply that and it's very easy
just<00:02:44.239> use<00:02:44.450> your<00:02:44.750> be<00:02:45.110> cosmetic<00:02:45.680> angle<00:02:45.980> brush

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.030 

in<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.709> corner<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:55.190> sometimes<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.270> need<00:02:56.390> to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
in the corner and sometimes you need to

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.089 
in the corner and sometimes you need to
let<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.220> glue<00:02:58.640> dry<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.650> it<00:03:00.650> becomes<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:01.010> little

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
let the glue dry so it becomes a little

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.910 
let the glue dry so it becomes a little
tacky<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.930> adheres<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.770> skin<00:03:04.040> faster

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
tacky and it adheres to the skin faster
