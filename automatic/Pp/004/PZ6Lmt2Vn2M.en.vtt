over a 20-year period if you look at
these<00:01:31.299> reports<00:01:31.509> I'll<00:01:31.990> suggest<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.500> has<00:01:32.560> about

these reports I'll suggest it has about
25<00:01:33.369> times<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.880> impact<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.390> co2<00:01:34.689> but<00:01:35.079> really

25 times the impact of co2 but really

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.690 
25 times the impact of co2 but really
when<00:01:35.500> it's<00:01:35.619> up<00:01:35.740> there<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.579> atmosphere

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.139 
when it's up there in the atmosphere
doing<00:01:37.299> its<00:01:37.450> work<00:01:37.630> it's<00:01:38.619> 72<00:01:38.950> times<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.789> impact

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
doing its work it's 72 times the impact

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.059 
doing its work it's 72 times the impact
and<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:41.110> makes<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.380> big<00:01:41.469> difference

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
and that that makes a big difference

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.779
