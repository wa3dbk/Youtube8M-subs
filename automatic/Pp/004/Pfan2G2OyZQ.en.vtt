 velvet ferrari 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.940
 photos of this car and saw on 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 facebook and i was very interested 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.930
 look at her 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.109
 I thought it would be real size 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.629
 it turned out that this is just a model tariqat 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.549
 Often a car model can get into 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.560
 Guinness Book of Records four times as 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.150
 the most expensive car that besides everything 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.820
 protects the display cabinet from bulletproof 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.770
 the glass has the most expensive logo 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.840
 also this is the only car made 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.380
 out of the 500 kilogram block of net 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.780
 gold 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.759
 awesome option 3 be yours for my 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 car look very good i love 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.119
 gold and diamonds 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.830
 but the truth is I would not have bought it, I 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.350
 I think that for the money you can buy 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.079
 something much more beautiful than a car 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.420
 rf all things down often to the base 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.880
 car gold plated made from 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.590
 carbon fiber headlights inlaid 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.049
 diamonds and in the design of each 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.810
 700 precious seats used 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.909
 Stones in Landan Iha nature in London 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.920
 same is called ramadan fever when 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.600
 all come to the capital of Britain and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.329
 take your luxury cars with you 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.100
 and then during their unloading they discuss 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.140
 whose car is better not like 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.909
 pastime is incomprehensible and I would 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.920
 never spent my money on 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.000
 it is but it is already said the matter is purely 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.979
 personal and what an outsider scan in my opinion 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.450
 This car is very relevant look dubai 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.189
 asu 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.440
 she is considering the fact that the police are here 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.470
 rides on porsche and lamborghini them on 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.120
 1000 Windu machine will appear 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.010
 to go under the hammer if there is 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.930
 buyer who decides to bypass the process 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.550
 bidding he will have to pay for 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.769
 car 7 million 800 thousand 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.239
 dollars anyway part of the money 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.940
 proceeds from the sale will go to 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.250
 charity 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.200
 but the site in my opinion is very good 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.180
 idea to transfer 10 percent of the funds 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 received from the sale of the car in favor 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.150
 Children's Day 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.330
 optimal food 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.099
 one cache it in a task is the only thing 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.660
 what makes me happy about this part 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.799
 proceeds go to 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.690
 charity 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.230
 but in general it seems to me that this car 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.750
 place in the museum of swarovski riply shells 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.610
 crystals after the show in dubai gold 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.799
 lamborghini heading to abu dhabi 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.599
 and then before you go to other cities 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.780
 in november will return to dubai on 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.000
 International auto show was going 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.180
 so dubai reaffirmed 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.160
 my title as the capital of the world of luxury and my 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.160
 kitchen bangin face buy bye
