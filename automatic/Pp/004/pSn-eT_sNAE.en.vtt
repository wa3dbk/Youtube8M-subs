moves are all from 2004 technology
already<00:04:44.510> implemented<00:04:45.140> in<00:04:45.200> 2k<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:45.950> is<00:04:46.250> it

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
already implemented in 2k this is it

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.020 
already implemented in 2k this is it
this<00:04:46.760> is<00:04:46.820> this<00:04:47.570> is<00:04:47.720> exactly<00:04:48.110> why<00:04:48.500> this<00:04:49.370> game<00:04:49.700> is

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
this is this is exactly why this game is

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.210 
this is this is exactly why this game is
truly<00:04:50.660> ahead<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.110> his<00:04:51.229> time<00:04:51.260> at<00:04:51.770> least<00:04:51.860> in<00:04:52.070> my

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.940 
truly ahead of his time at least in my
opinion<00:04:52.370> it's<00:04:53.180> truly<00:04:53.660> ahead<00:04:53.900> of<00:04:54.050> its<00:04:54.200> time<00:04:54.290> for

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
opinion it's truly ahead of its time for

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.610 
opinion it's truly ahead of its time for
the<00:04:55.070> sense<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.820> matter<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:57.500> know

the sense of the matter that you know

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.340 
the sense of the matter that you know
you<00:04:57.680> have<00:04:58.280> NC<00:04:58.760> double-a<00:04:59.240> saying<00:04:59.780> that<00:05:00.140> you

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
mean this is technology that's already

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.370 
mean this is technology that's already
out<00:07:05.610> there<00:07:05.910> so<00:07:06.180> I<00:07:06.360> just<00:07:06.570> wanted<00:07:07.050> to<00:07:07.080> put<00:07:07.320> that
