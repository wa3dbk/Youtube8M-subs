 Phang Nga 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.090
 What kind of use is it used, for example, flower system or 3 retirement 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.470
 It is Geez another amazing or another beating of the workbench 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.940
 Easy-to-use for how to use it placed this 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:27.770
 It Ne have Nante as to be burning a path to process a wide surface that this refers to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.880
 One more thing I have to name for you a narrow and tall thing 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:38.930
 Do you use more and more in the great'm past stability is bad for Tteyuu 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:42.030
 In such Weiss for safety in order to easy to process because I is hard to past 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.990
 I'm glad there be used in two's 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.790
 If you don't have a vise you can't do this, but in this case using vinegar 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.290
 I will come and fix it 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:56.430
 There is no long day inside but it is impossible with this one 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.370
 In the case of long life, I use two at home 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:06.680
 I think it was fixed but I say that I will process 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:11.069
 I well's in Well most because this stabilization force has been positive is the fall 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.740
 It is good and thinking not just not put Satoshi Kon to move to this obliquely 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.870
 Do it one stop if the taste dont masu 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:23.540
 One way to use 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.790
 Meide typing think not stable to have fleas fleas Nomi also to yes 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.260
 Hmmm 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:33.720
 You difference in some of the back Burari Hama is open stable if any 700 as was well everyone 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.610
 Another Origa 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:42.630
 I cut the water to the first trimmer side 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.110
 Sawato I want to go for an absolute period even this time used in various things 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.770
 How important is this to stabilize this with extra problems in the cup 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.050
 It seems like this 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.770
 This work pane Mr. Day 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:01.880
 Another But Nde was found that say Rutte can do the same 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.880
 But if interests there about say Na or not enter Weiss You may also dry 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.490
 I will do something again 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.490
 I removed it 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.870
 tan 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.430
 Methane is Kazuo 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.090
 This kind of is also easy to properly calm yourself 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:27.449
 That the Yes it 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:33.479
 It is only this kind of stop but this one touch there is a screw here and this 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:40.080
 This If you're using as a usual or crank that easily Hazuseru by removing 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:44.759
 Nyoki's puppy recession is when you want to use with Vice features 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:50.099
 If this is long , why is it 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:52.460
 It's okay to affirm with Frank this at the table there's a voice right here 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.389
 I assume this in the 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.389
 There in security, etc. 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.980
 Please assume 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.920
 This is the bread lord 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.920
 After all it is normal thinking how to put it here 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:17.539
 this 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:22.200
 It is easy to find how many times it is possible to operate exactly the same after that, and it's a long walk to the ruins 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:25.400
 I think it would be a great tool or a great tool to say 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.400
 Thank you
