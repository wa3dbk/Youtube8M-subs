00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.940
 then you expect collection tomorrow from 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.690
 even three hands 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.690
 bye, goodnight 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 yes they are sabrina here 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.580
 hello how are you mike all right and immature 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.150
 for you it is a problem for others already one 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.150
 solution 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.640
 uncle mike to the century michele tribuzio 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.790
 graduated in agricultural sciences professor 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.500
 of chemistry then agent and representative 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.800
 for many years but the joy of a society 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.990
 important trainer and coach editor 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.229
 sure you define yourself in a qualification 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.119
 precise professionalism would be an understatement 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.670
 I was also the pd is in the technician 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.830
 Eight years and then the track forms the name 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.740
 we have a story of artichoke orange break 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.149
 and 17 years to load stones but on his 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.350
 ID card what is written 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:37.800
 I don't know, I didn't notice 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.770
 here it is interesting the profession 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.320
 nothing but nothing is written and today 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.970
 it would be a cerebral rod to remove 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.960
 so much of that garbage that is in the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.600
 mind of the people 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.890
 or creatures of wings to make them fly 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.310
 but perhaps you should change yours 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 name from michele tribuzio in uncle mike da 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 where this possidonium sabrina comes from 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.289
 derives from many years 87 me equal 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.660
 when he starts to hear it he was often a 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.910
 familiar way they had of 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.670
 speak with me about the police or senses 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.470
 tom this familiar figure then i have 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.480
 always avoided doctor professor 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.940
 president of several companies also for the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.160
 title and bay self-esteem not then by these 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.349
 share you know it is said to lower the title 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.260
 and raise the pagan then become a 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.400
 constant use everywhere in Italy and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.849
 cleaning missing 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.920
 i like my mike coach and trainer 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.780
 today and this is your profession 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.569
 the main prevailing is the one that you 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.330
 passionate and funneled you 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.480
 total tour itinerary 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.090
 but what this tour consists of 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.730
 it is a beautiful job because the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.430
 ability to understand and understand 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.080
 quality of a man of a woman and therefore 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.200
 make sure he can respond to her 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.489
 life goal which is to be the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.670
 more beautiful expression of his 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.349
 existence and we are here today with several 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.970
 scientists who have come from all over 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.830
 italy to be able to show those that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.690
 are the studios so it's a problem of 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.040
 Obesity is a problem of smoking problems 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.260
 of cholesterol a problem of 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.019
 hypertension cancer problems law 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.640
 crash participates isernia pays because only 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.620
 paying prices and growing everything here 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.379
 choice to graduate in agricultural sciences e 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.260
 what derives from the activity of 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.180
 dad family ran 50 meters 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.739
 transcribed the vineyards and then I chose 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.079
 science degrees are thus saviors 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.260
 specialized once graduated who 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.359
 enter the family brothers for 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.120
 self hours that after two days of going to 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.280
 visit this beautiful company that I had to 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.620
 precisely carry on find the 2 of the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.359
 land surveyors not registered and without rent 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.269
 because there were these two but on don 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.980
 gesualdo dad and uncle and so decided not to 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.819
 take this nice flat road 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.459
 of our parents 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.409
 I embarked on another adventure 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.579
 by burning them you burn the ships this 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.329
 it's one of the imperatives you 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.010
 characterizes 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.769
 I have done this several times in my life 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.769
 burn ships hernán cortés we are 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.859
 around 1500 the attentions captain and 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.469
 500 soldiers they are luke ton 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.109
 in mexico to 5,000,000 of azecchi 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:15.120
 I killed anthropophagous in May 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.979
 oat in what climate they don't get there is 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.539
 clearly these soldiers are afraid 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.489
 terror of what can happen 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.220
 hernán cortés which burns at night 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.590
 ships sail already moored with the 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.300
 bow in the wind and these soldiers a 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.970
 they ask how we will get back home 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.160
 now because cortez had burned the ships 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.680
 of its crew there is advantageous 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.479
 cortes replied it's easy enough to win 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.520
 than going home with the ships of the 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.470
 moral vehicle at the crossroads 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.690
 only one possibility remains in fact the 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.849
 focus on your own skills on that 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.259
 which can be best expressed and set sail 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.259
 jump with good wind 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.790
 this office every day yes 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.770
 concretize your passage from 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.620
 managerial activity to the training one 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.510
 weighed in fact everything was born because in 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.060
 so many years over 30 years and I have 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.100
 selected 200 billion publishers as well 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.590
 steve harris and I studied man then 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.930
 there are then specialized mica teaches 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.300
 psychosomatic semiotics graphology of 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.980
 proxemic emulation and also pm le 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.670
 conditions of linguistics and of which I 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.500
 I'm a coach 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.750
 so all this gave me the 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.090
 possibility to understand that the heart is of 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.540
 these neurosciences and those who are alike 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.210
 Catches 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.620
 therefore we must seek in others 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.630
 what unites us and not what we are 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.610
 divides and studying all these sciences 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.200
 in 6 seconds I can tell you that you are 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.120
 if for example we give ourselves a hand 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.040
 now in the right hand to say that 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.600
 adiconsum armed this is why the 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.880
 greeting with the hand in this contact 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.010
 gauge the close and feel therefore that the 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.750
 parenting relationship that you have a think 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.450
 here and I look at the instinctual disk 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.120
 jaw chin and lips 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.250
 the emotional plane cheekbones nose eyes the 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.140
 intellectual level by the law of the nose 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.850
 the eventual planet of the hairline 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.920
 hair if they are missing just plug in yes 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.010
 see where you were six seconds 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:07.720
 you could tell me that I am but in six words 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.920
 could you tell me about 6 and 3 pupils but 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.569
 second to none 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.909
 six words chosen to play it 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.979
 the pallino a wish I had from many 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.110
 Sabrina years with a degree in science 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.149
 agrarian so living in a field from 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.369
 golf for those who know the context 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.059
 agronomic culture knows what 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:27.249
 it's inside 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:29.589
 think a little open in a millimeter 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:37.809
 cubic there are 5 billion beings 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:39.669
 living in the clinic what it means 

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:42.129
 play golf 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.589
 meanwhile it is a sport born between gentlemen i 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:46.629
 which are the first rule that are given and 

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:48.279
 what a judge should n't have been 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:50.979
 everyone would have been the judge of himself 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:53.860
 same now we will see he knew with the desks 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.319
 lakes trees are all obstacles and the 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.629
 how you react to the obstacle yes 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.490
 see how you mean your existence 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:02.139
 I even saw some break gods 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.979
 irons against a tree 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:08.709
 or anger, anger, swear to do 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.769
 fly the bats very comic things leadoff 

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:13.479
 allows you to have performances 

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:15.189
 extraordinary and the cucciolotto thinks of 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.229
 having come who knows where instead 

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:18.699
 game after and zero also because one 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:20.169
 Golf game does not last 10 minutes 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:22.330
 minutes but lasts four and a half hours 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:24.399
 six hours are six holes 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.789
 kilometers and a half 7 turning a little 

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:29.379
 10 12 km ahead back then it wants to 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:31.930
 say there is plenty of time to have it 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:35.069
 same cerebral then you in the moment 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.069
 who plays golf i feel 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:57.680
 life continues the show must go on e 

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.680
 set sail set sail with bonvento
