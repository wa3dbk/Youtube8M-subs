it<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:15.059> pretty<00:00:15.509> gummed<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> point

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it was pretty gummed up to the point

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.529 
it was pretty gummed up to the point
where<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.800> was<00:00:16.949> like<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> millimeter<00:00:17.820> larger

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
where it was like a millimeter larger

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.510 
where it was like a millimeter larger
than<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:18.960> supposed<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.470> typed<00:00:20.189> with

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
than I was supposed to be typed with

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.019 
than I was supposed to be typed with
grease<00:00:21.260> from<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.710> intake<00:00:23.130> which<00:00:23.550> had<00:00:23.789> grease

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
grease from my intake which had grease

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.720

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:53.650 
in it and oil and our water now have a
squeaking<00:00:30.480> sound<00:00:30.539> coming<00:00:31.170> from<00:00:31.320> somewhere

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:31.130 

Oh

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:54.800 

barring<00:01:32.140> going<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.710> pump<00:01:32.950> or<00:01:33.160> something

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.420

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
but also I have a ticking noise down

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:06.660 
but also I have a ticking noise down
here<00:01:57.460> somewhere

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.990 

my<00:02:07.670> check<00:02:07.939> engine<00:02:08.300> light<00:02:08.450> has<00:02:08.599> gone<00:02:08.840> away<00:02:08.989> I

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
my check engine light has gone away I

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.400 
my check engine light has gone away I
cleared<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.120> I've<00:02:11.510> had<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.840> running<00:02:12.019> for<00:02:12.349> a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
suppose if I take it for a drive I'll

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.610 
suppose if I take it for a drive I'll
probably<00:02:14.660> get<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.959> check<00:02:15.140> engine<00:02:15.170> light

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
