00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.669
 welcome people we start a new 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.590
 stage of history the league of 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.240
 legends in this new stage we will talk 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.700
 of the champions that make up the league 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.860
 and as I said on facebook the order 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.240
 which was chosen was alphabetically so 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.700
 so much in this chapter we will talk about 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.190
 atrox d'espadà in the dark and dear and 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.190
 the ancestral comedian we started 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.390
 the history of atrox is as old as 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.859
 the history of a land itself is said 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.390
 that there was a war between two great 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.369
 remembered features like the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.949
 protectorate and the sorcerer gentlemen 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.269
 over time the sorcerer gentlemen 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.309
 they had a series of crushing 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.559
 victories leaving protectorate to the edge 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.300
 of extermination on the day of the 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.220
 last battle the army of 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.860
 protectorate was outnumbered in numbers 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.920
 totally tired and was ill - equipped 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.149
 they prepared for an inevitable defeat 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.190
 just when all hope had been 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.559
 faded atrox appears between 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.510
 rows of the protectorate and with only a few 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.500
 few words convinced the soldiers of 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.469
 accelerate to the end 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.179
 to then launch into battle his 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.859
 presence inspired the soldiers to 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.840
 watch it wipe out any enemy that 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.149
 his body was put in front of him and 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.030
 swords moved in unison like a 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.649
 only to be immediately emerged a series 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.960
 of battles between the warriors and 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.520
 they followed cox some fighting with a 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.320
 extreme strength as if they were ten 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 people until they won that battle 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.390
 that one was already totally lost 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.040
 epic comeback 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.110
 after the battle to thrips 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.390
 disappearance by the new force of 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.010
 army of the protectorate not this 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.900
 surprising triumph because a 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.030
 series of continuous victories until 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.409
 they returned home victorious their 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.720
 compatriots welcomed us as heroes 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.910
 but they saved their civilization from 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.440
 the inevitable dark destruction that 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.890
 that the unknown warrior brought 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.590
 he remained in lamentations for something 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.700
 within them changed 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.830
 the memory of the bats is 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.350
 they vanished only to be replaced 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.690
 by a grim revelation his acts of 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 heroism were really brutal 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.250
 atrocities stories like these 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.270
 appear in the legends and myths of 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.550
 different cultures 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.050
 Strel realized this when in 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.880

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.049
 want it to be probably someone 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.989

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.930
 directing his soldiers to battle and 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.680

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.530
 strange dark silhouette and some engravings 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.840
 on the walls suggesting the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.579
 participation of that strange being in a 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.099
 battle in which the people of matter jury 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.139

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.480
 book that showed this being in a 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.250
 bet with twist of fate with some 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.680

 after the investigation this seemed 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.280

 destroying legions with a style that 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.549
 it is hypnotizing to contemplate with each 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.919
 defeated enemy atrox sword that 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.139
 appears to be alive and you see the blood of 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.910
 your opponents increasing your power and 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.660
 intensifying its brutal and elegant

 because of the arduous northern climate in a 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.210
 temporary settlement were ambushed 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.560
 at night while they were sleeping and although 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.660
 his warriors could repel the 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.580
 first wave of invaders were not 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.620
 prepared for that dark figure 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.540
 so mentioned in the sectors of that a 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.910
 the bench crossing his cruel sword 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.550
 living he inspired the invaders a 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.780
 insatiable thirst for blood the tribe of 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.790
 marble mane was quickly 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.220
 surpassed and without hope of 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.010
 defeat so enigmatic be he fell 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.750
 today he assumed his inevitable death 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.290
 the dark silhouette threw a spade 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.150
 mortally wounding the young barbarian 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.210
 but that story is already for another 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.210
 chance 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.050
 my greatest creation 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.210
 unlike other wandering foxes 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.040
 through the forests of the south of jong I will do 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.620
 always felt a strange connection with 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.320
 the magical world surrounding a connection 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.210
 that somehow was incomplete to 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.920
 deep inside he felt 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.090
 that the body in which he was born was 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.010
 an illness 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.830
 I dreamed of one day becoming 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.750
 human his goal seemed to be far from his 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.300
 reach until one day he woke up in 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.130
 medium of a battle between humans 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.540
 it was a terrible scene to witness the 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.520
 earth was obscured by the 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.550
 Silhouettes of wounded and dead soldiers 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.710
 I'm curious and approached one a 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.440
 man in a tunic wrapped by a 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.810
 magical work whose life went quickly 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.030
 exhausting he approached him and something in his 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.980
 interior shot up approaching 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.290
 man in a way that he could not 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.120
 understand if your life essence is 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.400
 introduced into it guided by a few ties 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.950
 magical invisible the feeling was 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.470
 intoxicating and overwhelming while this 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.390
 faded state discovered enchanted 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.640
 that something in her had changed in the 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.800
 family its white and shiny fur 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.170
 had disappeared and his body was 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.620
 elongated and agile resembling the shape of 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.660
 the humans that lay 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.220
 however although he had an appearance 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.800
 human knew that in reality his 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.810
 transformation was not complete was 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.400
 a creature this is and adapted to the 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.530
 customs of a human society and 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.600
 He took advantage of his gift of beauty to 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.400
 attract men entity mass for her 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.340
 could consume their vital essences 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.260
 when they were under his charm 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.360
 feeding on his desires took him more 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.000
 close to fulfilling his dream but while 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.800
 more goods took a strange sense of 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.120
 repentance began to arise in his 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.310
 inside 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.050
 she had reservations about actions that 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.389
 before they had never bothered him while 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.919
 he was a fox and he realized that he 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.320
 can bear the burdens of their 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.570
