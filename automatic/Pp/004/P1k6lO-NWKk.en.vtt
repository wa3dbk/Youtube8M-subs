yeah<00:00:05.149> ok<00:00:06.149> so<00:00:06.420> I'm<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.750> make<00:00:06.930> my<00:00:07.229> protein

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
yeah ok so I'm going to make my protein

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.999 
yeah ok so I'm going to make my protein
brownies<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:09.200> have<00:00:10.200> two<00:00:10.380> different<00:00:10.559> kinds<00:00:10.800> of

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:11.009 
brownies I have two different kinds of

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.459 
brownies I have two different kinds of
proteins<00:00:11.400> yet<00:00:11.700> I'm<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.969> casein<00:00:12.660> protein<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.440> I

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
proteins yet I'm a casein protein and I

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.650 
proteins yet I'm a casein protein and I
have<00:00:13.919> a<00:00:13.980> whey<00:00:14.160> protein<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.940> reason<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.539> is

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
have a whey protein the reason for it is

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.080 
have a whey protein the reason for it is
if<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.900> mix<00:00:16.200> way<00:00:16.530> with<00:00:16.830> water<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.670> gets<00:00:17.910> all

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
if you mix way with water it gets all

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.270 
if you mix way with water it gets all
soupy<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.510> shit<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.440> casein<00:00:19.890> add<00:00:20.070> some

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
soupy and shit and the casein add some

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.250 
soupy and shit and the casein add some
kind<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> consistency<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.870> just<00:00:22.020> use<00:00:22.110> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
kind of consistency you can just use a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.110 
kind of consistency you can just use a
regular<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.160> mix<00:00:23.370> protein<00:00:23.790> if<00:00:23.940> you<00:00:24.030> have

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 
regular kind of mix protein if you have

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.900 
regular kind of mix protein if you have
it<00:00:24.270> like<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.840> six<00:00:25.490> what<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.790> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
it like this it was six what I like to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.600 
it like this it was six what I like to
do<00:00:27.030> is<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.330> usually<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.780> add<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.580> or<00:00:29.580> two

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
do is I usually like to add one or two

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.600 
do is I usually like to add one or two
scoops<00:00:30.090> away<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.660> today<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.230> mad<00:00:31.530> one<00:00:32.340> scoop

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
scoops away but today I'm mad one scoop

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450 
scoops away but today I'm mad one scoop
of<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:34.320> we'll<00:00:35.250> build

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
of it in there and then we'll build

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.150 
of it in there and then we'll build
three<00:00:36.030> scoops<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.630> casein<00:00:37.170> protein<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
three scoops a casein protein in it and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160 
three scoops a casein protein in it and
like<00:00:39.060> I<00:00:39.090> said<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.720> have<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> mix

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
like I said if you just have a mix

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.100 
like I said if you just have a mix
protein<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.770> fine<00:00:41.040> too<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.989> hope<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
protein that's fine too I hope the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
protein that's fine too I hope the
battery<00:00:43.440> doesn't<00:00:43.650> die<00:00:43.800> him<00:00:44.070> video<00:00:44.810> but<00:00:45.810> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
battery doesn't die him video but it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
battery doesn't die him video but it
might<00:00:48.320> 23<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.560> you<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> hundred<00:00:50.070> grams<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
might 23 so you got a hundred grams of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
might 23 so you got a hundred grams of
protein<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.970> that<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.290> said<00:00:52.350> that's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
protein in that so like I said that's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.620 
protein in that so like I said that's
why<00:00:52.860> i<00:00:52.890> call<00:00:53.130> this<00:00:53.220> with<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> badass<00:00:53.700> protein

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
why i call this with a badass protein

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.130 
why i call this with a badass protein
brownie<00:00:55.940> peanut<00:00:56.940> butter<00:00:57.120> some<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> guys

throw an egg in there to give it even
more<00:01:33.040> consistency<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:34.450> other<00:01:34.600> reason<00:01:34.810> why

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
more consistency the other reason why

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.540 
more consistency the other reason why

like to mix it up I just dropped an egg
like<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.070> mix<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.430> up<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.670> there<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.850> little<00:01:55.000> bit

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
like to mix it up in there a little bit

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.970 
like to mix it up in there a little bit
what<00:01:56.050> I'd<00:01:56.140> like<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.290> do<00:01:56.440> is<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.890> add

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
what I'd like to do is I like to add

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.260 
what I'd like to do is I like to add
water<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:57.400> don't<00:01:57.550> really<00:01:57.640> have<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.880> measured

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
water I don't really have a measured

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.650 
water I don't really have a measured
amount<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.780> water<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.350> i<00:01:59.530> really<00:01:59.830> put<00:01:59.979> in

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
amount of water that i really put in

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.840 
amount of water that i really put in
consistency<00:02:01.660> is<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:01.960> key<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
consistency is the key here the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.120 
consistency is the key here the
substance<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.780> kind<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.170> play

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
substance of it so you kind of play

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.020 
substance of it so you kind of play
around<00:02:06.160> with<00:02:06.550> it<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.670> little<00:02:06.760> bit<00:02:08.820> it's<00:02:09.820> kind<00:02:09.940> of

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
around with it a little bit it's kind of
