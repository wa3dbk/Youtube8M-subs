00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.620
 move on to the section and schedule just 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.410
 change the text on the right, we can also 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.470
 if you want to change the font color size and 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.420
 I will show other parameters for an example how 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.010
 you can add a hexagon box like this 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.310

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.410
 It should be noted that all the necessary pages 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.540
 to create an event site already 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.580
 exists here you can write that 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.730

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.290
 add logo or image 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.690
 we need to edit the main 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.819
 page for this remove extra 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.090
 elements change the text and description 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.250
 items except the ability to download 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.290

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.239

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.110
 pictures all blocks are dynamic when 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.680
 changing the labels on the buttons is also important 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.599
 check which pages they lead to 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.280
 For example, create a registration button 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.110
 on the main page so that visitors 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.340
 site could immediately go to the right 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.739
 section and register on 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.420

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.100
 button and be sure to select the page

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.220
 there are social icons in our template 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.290
 networks that can also be easily 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.420
 configure register links to your 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.240
 resources change the buttons themselves or 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.010
 position order after we 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.200
