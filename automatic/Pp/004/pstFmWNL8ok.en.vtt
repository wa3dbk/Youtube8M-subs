00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.320
 Hello everyone in this tutorial 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.250
 I will explain to you 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.990
 as aged 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.090
 then 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.220
 I decided to grow old 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.350
 here is a picture I already have 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.869
 worked and on which I have already done a 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.490
 tutorial exactly the tutorial hdr 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.710
 because to this photo just applied 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.689
 to the hdr effect if you go to comb through 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.400
 among my slightly older videos 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.820
 you will find just this kind of 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.290
 tutorial here then let's start like this 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.129
 I show you exactly what I mean 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.739
 to age a photo first 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.629
 I have to give a different color 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.420
 photo then a color that is 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.989
 social or not so we start with the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.760
 do the sepia effect then holding 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.890
 pressed control 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.380
 I 'm explaining how to do all the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.960
 work using the keyboard but if you 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.969
 go to image settings 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.950
 here you find everything that I have now 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.009
 pressed against lu and the against lu 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.660
 corresponds as you see exactly to the 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.460
 window saturation hue 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.680
 so once it opens ios 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.700
 dot the item colors and i care i 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.210
 values ​​25 of saturation 10 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.039
 the brightness we leave it at zero e 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.800
 this is the sepia effect 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.979
 but I have to grow old then 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.080
 I have to yellow the control b mi therefore 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.920
 the color balance window opens 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.729
 and working on the yellow I go to 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.209
 increase point this color here until 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.360
 I don't find the gradation that suits me 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.750
 I like that I would leave it so maybe one 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.550
 little 'more 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:52.209
 here is so perfect now he did this 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.410
 I need to download filters from the web 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:58.780
 so if i go on google google 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.330
 images and I write simply old photo 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.530
 textures come out of a series of 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.610
 filters like these for example is that me 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.440
 I can download then use as like 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.239
 it's aging facts 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.830
 I downloaded these two this one 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.050
 because it has a bit of a border 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.239
 eaten and I liked this kind of 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.030
 effect this here because instead a 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.080
 see all these folds and tears 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.640
 so that make it to the photo 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.780
 particularly old so me 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.140
 both are unloaded 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.580
 therefore once you have saved 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.110
 the photos you want well open an io in 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.600
 this case got me this first 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.770
 I take it horizontally then image 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.959
 tried at 90 degree square and apple 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.330
 transport over to the photo I want 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.070
 grow old as you see the picture that 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.620
 I downloaded smaller but it is not a 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.070
 problem because pressing against the t 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.660
 I can go to enlarge apple and then 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.660
 to move where I want to 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.630
 ok and I'll leave it like this now 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.030
 casting method we select the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.709
 voice multiplies and as you see the photo of 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.420
 under my magically reappeared 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.170
 but leaving all the imperfections behind me 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.920
 of the aging filter then from the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.600
 photo I downloaded from the internet 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.510
 now as you can see the photo either 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.640
 particularly darkened I want that 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.989
 at least the subjects of the photo then in 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.610
 this case the buildings are a bit more 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.290
 clear because later I will have to apply a 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.049
 other type of filter and missy darken to 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.430
 true further with hiss I go to 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.310
 lighten up so I have to create one 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.760
 layer mask in this level 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.829
 here then in the last level where 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.470
 we are working 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:56.459
 by going to the layer mask level 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.620
 and selecting the item shows everything now 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.989
 I take my brush and make sure 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.410
 that black is the primary color 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.410
 I increase the size of the brush 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:16.190
 ok and step on all the buildings that like 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.190
 see slightly lighten up 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:29.010
 so maybe even ok if you want then 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.790
 you are even clearer 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.790
 a second pass 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.500
 if you keep holding the 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.350
 left mouse button he la 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.560
 therefore recognizes as a single pass 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.320
 it is not that if you pass several times on the 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.520
 same point by holding down the key 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.900
 left true skerries further no 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.610
 you will have to remove your finger from the button 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.630
 left and take it back and then 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:06.570
 repeating on that point there ok perfect 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:09.690
 so it's fine ok now I go to 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.990
 take the other photo I downloaded 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.640
 then the one with the frame 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.530
 same speech spoiled 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.820
 90 degree square wheel picture but 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.770
 simply because my picture and 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.140
 horizontal as vertical as the file 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.140
 original and same speeches as before 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:36.960
 I put it on top of the photo I am pressing 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:39.410
 against t I'm going to enlarge it like this 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.410
 ok 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.190
 perfect and new fusion method 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:52.090
 multiply here now but you see it is 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.979
 therefore particularly dark 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.580
 as before I have to create another 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.720
 layer mask on the second level 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.960
 on which we are working 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.009
 then level mask layer but 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.720
 this time hide everything 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.669
 and how you see me hide everything 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.199
 so now I have to make the effect 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.050
 reverse the respect as I did before 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.630
 then select the tool 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.840
 brush as primary color select 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:24.870
 white and so I'm going to get it 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.870
 see I am the frame 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.610
 so if you want to see more of it itself 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.120
 speech 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:44.060
 take another pass and as you can see, yes 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:51.170
 further accentuates the frame then vi 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:54.260
 I repeat here you can work in multiple ways 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:57.560
 and a depends on the personal tastes and 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:01.520
 so then one works according to what 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.770
 wants to reproduce was nando immagine yes 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.720
 feel it 's the same 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:10.250
 the retouching is over this is the effect 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.050
 I really like aged 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.480
 especially on photos like that it seems 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.430
 just a picture of old genoa 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.890
 these boccadasse genova really does seem 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:24.040
 a very very old photo 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:24.040
 just the tutorial is finished next time
