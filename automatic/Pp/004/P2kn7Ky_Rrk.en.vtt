about<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.840> internets<00:04:43.200> other<00:04:43.380> than<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.710> fact

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
about the internets other than the fact

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.000 
about the internets other than the fact
that<00:04:44.010> it's<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.400> series<00:04:44.790> of<00:04:44.820> tubes<00:04:45.290> but<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.500> mean

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
that it's a series of tubes but I mean

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.940 
that it's a series of tubes but I mean
this<00:04:47.580> type<00:04:48.030> of<00:04:48.060> thing<00:04:48.510> does<00:04:49.110> make<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.620> online

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
this type of thing does make the online

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.740 
this type of thing does make the online
community<00:04:50.160> look<00:04:50.550> kind<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:50.820> bad<00:04:50.970> specifically

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
community look kind of bad specifically

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.050 
community look kind of bad specifically
the<00:04:51.870> anonymous<00:04:52.350> hackers<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.950> would<00:04:53.640> this<00:04:53.820> be

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
the anonymous hackers and would this be

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.700 
the anonymous hackers and would this be
enough<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:54.600> reason<00:04:54.780> for<00:04:55.140> them<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.290> pass<00:04:55.530> the

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
enough of a reason for them to pass the

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.530 
enough of a reason for them to pass the
bill<00:04:55.830> out<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.070> spite<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.730> don't<00:04:57.210> know<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.510> I

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
bill out of spite I don't know that I

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.030 
bill out of spite I don't know that I
necessarily<00:04:57.660> think<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.010> case

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
necessarily think that that is the case

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.290 
necessarily think that that is the case
but<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.520> would<00:04:59.700> like<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.910> know<00:05:00.000> what<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.270> guys
