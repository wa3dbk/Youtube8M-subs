00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.290
 Hello 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:23.529
 diary of a bee hornet robe a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.000
 mum's parents is summer and we know 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.360
 very well that the children have more 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.430
 possibility to go out and summer out there 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.169
 they are also a lot of bugs beyond 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.030
 mosquitoes we read a lot 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.690
 of information and continue to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.000
 get there in the many don't have enough 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.110
 useful elements to inform yourself about this 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.880
 wasps bees hornets of Hymenoptera 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.160
 Insect family consisting of over 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.520
 100,000 characteristic species of their own 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.380
 the thin transparent and membranous wings 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.450
 the annoying bites of these insects 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.240
 they can really bring reactions 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.430
 gastric skin allergic type but 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.650
 also respiratory but let's go with order 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.750
 I give you some info that can be 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.970
 really useful, let's start by saying 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.100
 that to have allergic reactions i 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.320
 subjects must be prepared 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.300
 so not all of us are the same below 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.000
 this aspect does to reduce the risk 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.190
 of any bites and hassles is better 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.430
 put up some simple rules 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.100
 such as covering children in 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.140
 areas as exposed as the arms and the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.120
 legs especially if the child does 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.130
 outdoor activities avoid staying 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.870
 stop near by detours but also 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 near waste that can attract 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.350
 precisely the insects 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.420
 if you are having a picnic you keep 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 carefully the food because the wasps 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.580
 they just are attracted avoided 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 very strong scents some smells 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.240
 aromatic attract insects dress i 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.670
 children in light colors because those 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.729
 colored blacks just attract these me 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.520
 night and at home if possible taken 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.909
 mosquito nets 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.829
 but what do you do if a bee stings you run 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.810
 in milk mainly near 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.729
 of vegetable gardens just because she 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.219
 in fact it goes to impallinare the flowers 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.140
 generally it stings if it is provoked but 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.460
 the thing that has diversified it from wasps 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.129
 Hornets from it is his 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.049
 serrated stinger which must 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.780
 be absolutely removed the first 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.370
 possible in case of puncture you can 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 help you with a needle but also with the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.049
 your fingernail you have to try to extract 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.000
 the sting and the poison the first 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.160
 movements are usually possible 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.920
 from bottom to top just removed the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.269
 sting is useful to apply 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.579
 ice in the own area 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.099
 of the injection and possibly of the 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.829
 the heads are cortisone-based creams 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.360
 more aggressive and do not have the thread a 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.319
 the waters are really different 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.700
 unites and attacks even if they are not 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.519
 usually caused they have their nests 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.739
 does in their nests in sheltered areas 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.480
 we can try sea mountain everywhere 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.450
 even near the garbage bins 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.760
 because the sugary substances own 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.799
 they attract these insects have a 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.840
 smooth sting that allows them to 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.209
 prick again and again even i 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.819
 Hornets as wasps to sting 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.010
 without hook they are smooth and therefore can 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.750
 over and over again puncturing the culture of 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.250
 bumblebee can even reach 5 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.670
 centimeters of length therefore to the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.889
 larger species and precisely creates a lot 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.780
 pain lasts almost ten minutes 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.720
 could also give states of 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.010
 sickness fever also headache but 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.900
 these consequences are not 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.090
 necessarily resulted from one 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.190
 allergic reaction but could 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.200
 be due to the amount of poison 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.090
 we injected then summarize that in 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.519
 normal reactions if we can 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.250
 you can define them in this 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.900
 so remove the sting in case of 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.239
 a puncture to wash the part 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.040
 affected with soap and water apply 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.319
 of ice to reduce swelling and 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.720
 pain and vital to scratch the point for 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.730
 avoid infections 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.590
 resort to the use of gel or 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.419
 of aloe based creams or call and 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.579
 you'll also get a thousand blushes and 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.220
 in case of allergic reaction as it is 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.840
 must behave well as a first puncture 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.910
 in a child's life 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.400
 usually it does n't just come out 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.410
 reaction precisely because the body of the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.479
 still recognize a possible 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.120
 allergen to the second puncture however the 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:13.370
 hypersensitive subject obviously will go 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.709
 encountering an anaphylactic reaction i 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.380
 symptoms are usually tingling 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.419
 a little ends and hives on everything 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.850
 the body and localized swelling 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.729
 obviously after the skin can appear 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.370
 also a respiratory reaction then 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.710
 cough fatigue in more serious cases can 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.570
 degenerate even into bronchospasm precisely 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.970
 and can even lead to lethal death 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.620
 it can also be anaphylactic shock 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.660
 just that leads to hypotension then 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.880
 a sudden lowering of the 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.370
 pressure here that in fact cases of 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.350
 allergy is better to go immediately to 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.169
 emergency room 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.840
 in the immediate and have a life-saving la 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.340
 classic adrenaline administration 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.950
 of the minico head to the effect of 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.050
 counteract 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.270
 release of stamina and cortisone 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.650
 cures to the subsequent inflammation from 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.860
 as far as I know , one was launched 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.690
 campaign is called in vivo 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.970
 just to raise awareness in hospitals 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.070
 contact families in short , not to have 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.650
 rules on using adrenaline 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.030
 autoinjectable which is the only life saver 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.850
 in short, to avoid shocks 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.930
 anaphylactic at the limit try to scream 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.120
 and search the net 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.370
 more information about a 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.650
 greeting will have the congratulations for the 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.440
 birth of the little cousin says that i 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.560
 many wishes to valentia and her 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.920
 third creature was initially born 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.690
