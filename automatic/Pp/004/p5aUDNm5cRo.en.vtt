[Applause]

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.360 

okay<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.990> trap<00:01:07.320> set<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:08.100> real

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
okay that's one trap set it's real

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.940 
okay that's one trap set it's real
shallow<00:01:08.730> water<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.500> funnels<00:01:10.860> are

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
shallow water here but the funnels are

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
shallow water here but the funnels are
still<00:01:11.160> under<00:01:11.400> water<00:01:11.550> so<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> slows<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> bait

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
still under water so it slows the bait

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.300 
still under water so it slows the bait
so<00:01:13.080> there's<00:01:13.530> anything<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.160> hopefully

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so there's anything in here hopefully

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:41.530 
so there's anything in here hopefully
we'll<00:01:14.670> catch<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.609 

[Applause]

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
of the road and I have one on this side

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.109 
of the road and I have one on this side
of<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.920> road<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:58.219> another<00:01:58.369> Bayou<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:58.939> that

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
of the road and another Bayou but that

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.940 
of the road and another Bayou but that
is<00:01:59.329> way<00:01:59.929> up<00:02:00.200> there<00:02:00.350> ways

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
is way up there ways

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.399 
is way up there ways
anyway<00:02:01.880> it's<00:02:02.090> real<00:02:02.299> shallow<00:02:02.539> water<00:02:02.869> yesterday

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
anyway it's real shallow water yesterday

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.499 
anyway it's real shallow water yesterday
was<00:02:03.740> 81<00:02:04.159> degrees<00:02:04.460> here<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.119> problem

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
was 81 degrees here the problem

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.929 
was 81 degrees here the problem
everybody<00:02:06.079> is<00:02:06.200> saying<00:02:06.409> is<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.770> fact<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
everybody is saying is the fact that the

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.630 
everybody is saying is the fact that the
water<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.299> just<00:02:08.509> too<00:02:08.660> cold<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.830> everything<00:02:10.549> is

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
water is just too cold so everything is

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.170 
water is just too cold so everything is
shallow

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
shallow

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.520 
shallow
so<00:02:11.299> hopefully<00:02:11.480> heated<00:02:11.810> up<00:02:11.900> last<00:02:12.110> night<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.410> got

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
so hopefully heated up last night it got

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.440 
so hopefully heated up last night it got
down<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.709> about<00:02:12.860> 65<00:02:13.549> so<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.090> water<00:02:14.299> is

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
down to about 65 so that water is

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.610 
down to about 65 so that water is
starting<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.750> warm<00:02:14.930> up<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.260> maybe<00:02:15.410> they're

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
starting to warm up and maybe they're

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.759 
starting to warm up and maybe they're
coming<00:02:15.739> out<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:19.989> thought<00:02:20.989> this<00:02:21.230> road<00:02:21.470> just

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
coming out I thought this road just

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.680 
coming out I thought this road just
ended<00:02:22.250> right<00:02:22.430> there<00:02:22.489> I've<00:02:22.880> never<00:02:22.970> driven<00:02:23.390> up

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
ended right there I've never driven up

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.390 
ended right there I've never driven up
