00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
me like I know that sounds like

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.540 
me like I know that sounds like
counterintuitive<00:01:37.709> for<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.399> you're<00:01:38.520> trying

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
counterintuitive for what you're trying

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.510 
counterintuitive for what you're trying
to<00:01:38.789> do<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:40.979> makes<00:01:41.190> all<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to do but it really makes all the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.949 
to do but it really makes all the
difference<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.270> me<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> also<00:01:42.660> like

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
difference and then for me I also like

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.529 
difference and then for me I also like
to<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.319> hairspray<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:44.160> like<00:01:44.940> for<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.149> extra

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
to use hairspray just like for the extra

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.589 
to use hairspray just like for the extra
hold<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.080> styling<00:01:46.470> whatever<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.479> kind

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
hold and styling whatever so just kind

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
hold and styling whatever so just kind
of<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:48.810> them<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.319> like<00:01:49.500> to
