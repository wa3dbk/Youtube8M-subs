00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.279
 Come to another video here from our 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.440
 Today's River Channel A video that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.850
 I promised you a certain time and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.860
 A lot of people were asking when 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.650
 We leave maybe because today we go 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.070
 talk about the player notes on 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.050
 fifa 15 is that there guys is a video that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.370
 interests both people who like 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 mainly play career mode 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 as a player and wants to know how the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 your note and such and also that galera 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.590
 who has some doubt because the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.260
 that the player's scores on the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.489
 fifa here is dice is my weirdo nÃ© 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 face you often see a guy 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.619
 playing a game very well destroying and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.030
 then the guy ends up not being the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.160
 best of the match ends up taking note 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.619
 It's kind of weird, I'll go wrong. 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.259
 clarify for you why these 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.220
 notes are so say so disseminated 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.050
 that's right 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.960
 first people wanted to tell the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.479
 you have a slight advantage in the hour 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.170
 to give the team the winning note as 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.880
 like this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.620
 if we have, for example, two 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.810
 players with the same note but they are 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.700
 of different teams in the vast majority 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 of the times the best player of the match 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 will be the one who took the team note 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.930
 winner, the team that won all of them is another 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 which counts a lot when you 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.040
 to have a good face is your 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.690
 moving in the field and already pulling more 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.700
 by the player career mode side 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.890
 in case it is if you have a move 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.260
 following that little set that the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.060
 face goes indicating always you go 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.960
 get the reasonable grade not always 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.430
 that good note 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.439
 if you do anything else in the game of course 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.880
 that you do not take good note but if you 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.470
 If you move around well for sure you do not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.510
 will keep the note very low 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.610
 Now pay attention to one thing 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.290
 must be carried out not only without 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.180
 ball or with the ball has to be in both 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.979
 Moments you're without the ball you have 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.200
 to position the corner me you 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.930
 Ask your opponent's pass and / or thing 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.220
 of this type and if you have the team 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.760
 the team has the ball you should 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.379
 position in its home position 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.090
 You're a midfielder standing in the 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.599
 midfield has to shoot the attack 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.579
 direct 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.140
 if you are an attacker position yourself in the 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.430
 Do not try to stay in the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.189
 half-of-field all the time because otherwise 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.379
 This ends up affecting your grade. 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.840
 something very important drop out of 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.849
 be face molds touch the ball a lot 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.310
 touch the ball with short passes or 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.989
 but I tried to hit the passes 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.090
 do not try to make too many difficult passes 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.090
 what if you end up missing many passes 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.920
 the cable is fatally losing note 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.930
 another interesting thing is that you 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.420
 able to pass in depth not 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.980
 It needs to be an expensive master pass more 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.889
 that ball stuck to the side 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.900
 thrashing the striker did try 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.940
 come out in the face of the goal because 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.280
 even if it does not work, but if you 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.739
 has had the right intention at the time of 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.909
 pass the truth of the pass on a good idea 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.950
 if we have abuse at the time of giving 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.930
 I'm sure it was your note. 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.489
 increases you can be sure if you hit 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.739
 this space most of the time or 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.389
 have a good idea fifa sees you 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.340
 made the correct move so in these 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.739
 threaded ball you earn a 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.209
 score a little higher then k 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.030
 this is very important these balls in 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.340
 depth they receive much for 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.680
 talk about passes guy something else that gives 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.430
 very good score are the assists 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.989
 guys 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.090
 when you give assistance you win 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.010
 a score on the note as if it were 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.720
 almost a goal face practically the same 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.090
 thing of a little and goal also not 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.190
 I do not need to talk, the goal counts a lot 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.680
 also in your score is the score 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.079
 which increases with respect to the note is the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.579
 mouth but many times you just do 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.550
 one as if it ends up taking note still 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.320
 low 166 and mail 6 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.850
 if you can not meet the other 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.400
 things I said now if you 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.260
 achieve the goal and stand out in the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.000
 drive makes us all but then 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.980
 You'll get a good grade. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.380
 now guys, also something that 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.030
 account is more than your participation in 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.130
 a lot of people do not realize 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.110
 but this happens 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.240
 for example you did not give the assistance 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.640
 but let's say you played for the 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.440
 lateral or lateral crossed and left the goal 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.540
 You win, yes, you get a score. 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.970
 zinha in your note because you participated 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.130
 actively from the goal play many times 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.020
 So the guy takes a step towards you. 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.610
 It makes a light cut and then the player who comes 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.070
 behind you ends up doing goal 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.990
 you also earn a certain score if 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.580
 you pull the marking the player opened 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.290
 space and also to score a goal 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.570
 score my tip that I leave to 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.300
 You guys are not that selfish. 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.390
 face because finalization almost 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.620
 Tell me nothing if you're with the tap thinking. 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.850
 in making a middle finalization 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.590
 unpretentious 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.570
 calm down, touch the ball, you have to 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.520
 make a table with the move because 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.410
 Finishing mainly out not 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.940
 count absolutely nothing 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.460
 You kick a ball on the beam and there 's a 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.130
 ball on the moon is the same thing fifa is 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.840
 an error is k is a mistake and it was to be 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.370
 consider the issue of 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.500
 goals in the direction of the goal with 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.990
 goalkeeper defenses balls on the beam also 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.020
 but do what they do not consider to be 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.160
 One Ball Kick 40 Ball On The Board In The Game 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.990
 You're not going to raise anything to your 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.490
 score practically on the grade if the 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.410
 goalkeeper defending to try some 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.419
 thing but it's a little thing is not worth much 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.830
 Worth it so many times you're better 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.810
 try to be calmer when it comes to making 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.760
 a move to switch sides or gives 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.800
 Launch as I told you what to try 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.840
 get kicked straight trying to hit 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.700
 a kick once in a lifetime 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.740
 bringing to try to score 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.380
 Finally, there comes a last detail in the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.030
 your note what it is that increases both 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.630
 the note is the day that is the most 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.850
 important 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.670
 and few people know that few people 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.310
 even more influencing the score of the 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.010
 player is the phase that the player is 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.840
 living guys, that's it. 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.060
 you're often in a bad phase 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.190
 with the player doing what I say is 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.450
 When you 're in the dry of goals does 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.460
 time you do not have a good performance 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.410
 When you're with that little set to 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.790
 low summarizing practically nÃ© 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.160
 When are you going to start the game with seven? 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.980
 It's down, man, if you have it like this. 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.360
 You're going to have to fight a lot of fear each time. 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.010
 Like, you're going to have to do a registration. 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.290
 you take good note because face 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.120
 otherwise it is very complicated what 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.810
 happens when the player is in the 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.240
 normal or regular or poor depending on the 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.520
 phase face you team make two goals in 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.800
 I started the game with two goals. 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.840
 second time came back with the middle nine note 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.490
 but there during the second time in the note 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.670
 it was falling it was falling falling I finished 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.660
 with note 6 and a half also with note 7 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.240
 Sinhala this is because your 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.930
 phase is not good and fifa ends up falling 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.960
 your note 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.190
 I do not know why it's wrong but it's them 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.260
 end up doing this 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.270
 so what really matters most is the 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.190
 the question of its 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.230
 My tip that I leave to you is 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.010
 You are in the good phase then with the grade 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.810
 high 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.340
 It's okay that note will increase. 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.170
 always if you continue to play well 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.330
 hitting the launch passes but 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.410
 this was one more automatically the note 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.460
 Will you be increasing? Will you always? 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.560
 take a good note 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.780
 but if you are in the bad phase itu 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.790
 tactic in the middle of the second half of the game 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.830
 okay with good grade-eight and a half team 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.530
 is getting a headache for my tip 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.390
 asks to leave to be replaced because 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.010
 if you stay until the end of the game 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.080
 nationality only tends to fall when you 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.420
 sees that his name is beginning to fall there 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.950
 You'd better ask to come out clear. 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.110
 depending on the moment in your team if 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.210
 Do you think I do not need you anymore? 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.580
 in the game to try to win if not 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.890
 need the victory in such a case then 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.110
 ask her out is that half will juca 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.700
 finish with the highest note ok because 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.100
 what really makes the difference in this 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.360
