the max box and we'll show you them all
in<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.730> second<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.239> brief<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.110> use<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
in a second but in brief you can use it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.290 
in a second but in brief you can use it
on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> bench<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.760> use<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.059> instead

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
on the bench here you can use it instead

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
on the bench here you can use it instead
of<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.450> bipod<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.260> use<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.559> across<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> car

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
of a bipod you can use it across the car

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.709 
of a bipod you can use it across the car
and<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.730> also<00:00:44.879> use<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> bench

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
and you can also use it on the bench

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.790 
and you can also use it on the bench
when<00:00:45.899> you're<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.079> shooting<00:00:46.230> nice<00:00:46.500> little

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
when you're out shooting nice little

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.440 
when you're out shooting nice little
groups<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.000> there's<00:00:48.239> two

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
groups now you can see that there's two

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
groups now you can see that there's two
different<00:00:48.750> size<00:00:49.260> cutouts<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.219> two

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
different size cutouts here and two

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
different size cutouts here and two
different<00:00:50.850> heights<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.010> basically

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
different heights so you can basically

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
different heights so you can basically
put<00:00:53.850> any<00:00:54.120> rifle<00:00:54.570> or<00:00:54.690> fat<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.230> skinny<00:00:55.500> one

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
put any rifle or fat one or a skinny one

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.520 
put any rifle or fat one or a skinny one
at<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> higher<00:00:56.489> spot<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> lower<00:00:57.629> spot<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.410> it's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
at a higher spot or a lower spot so it's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
at a higher spot or a lower spot so it's
going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.710> fit<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.550> gun<00:00:59.670> pretty

cleaning fluids from cleaning the rifles

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.069 
cleaning fluids from cleaning the rifles
on<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> yeah<00:01:32.939> there's<00:01:33.210> no<00:01:33.329> damage<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.960> at

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
on it yeah there's no damage to that at

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.109 
on it yeah there's no damage to that at
all<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.560> it'll<00:01:34.680> last<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.640> magnets<00:01:36.000> are

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
all I think it'll last the magnets are

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.670 
all I think it'll last the magnets are
glued<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.420> place<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.320> won't<00:01:37.380> come<00:01:37.650> out

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
glued in place so don't won't come out

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.620 
glued in place so don't won't come out
it's<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.670> much<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.030> wrong<00:01:39.180> at<00:01:39.329> all

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it's not really much can go wrong at all

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's not really much can go wrong at all
out<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> field<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> max<00:01:40.920> box<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> very
