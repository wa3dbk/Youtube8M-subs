massive<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.570> say<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> disappointing

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
massive as I say it was a disappointing

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
massive as I say it was a disappointing
when<00:01:13.979> they're<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.549> luster<00:01:14.909> them<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.119> the
