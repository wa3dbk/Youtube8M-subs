fabric once you see how to do them
they're<00:00:46.480> actually<00:00:46.960> really<00:00:47.380> easy<00:00:47.890> at<00:00:48.550> first<00:00:48.610> I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
they're actually really easy at first I

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.930 
they're actually really easy at first I
did<00:00:49.330> not<00:00:49.360> like<00:00:49.900> short<00:00:50.230> rows<00:00:50.500> in<00:00:50.890> part<00:00:51.760> because

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
did not like short rows in part because

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.180 
did not like short rows in part because
the<00:00:52.180> way<00:00:52.210> I<00:00:52.540> was<00:00:52.570> initially<00:00:53.260> shown<00:00:53.530> really

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the way I was initially shown really

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.880 
the way I was initially shown really
made<00:00:54.370> things<00:00:54.519> very<00:00:54.640> tough<00:00:55.239> so<00:00:56.080> I've<00:00:56.440> kind<00:00:56.830> of

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
made things very tough so I've kind of

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.290 
made things very tough so I've kind of
worked<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.309> through<00:00:57.339> and<00:00:57.730> figured<00:00:57.970> out<00:00:58.059> what

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
worked it through and figured out what

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.990 
worked it through and figured out what
works<00:00:58.600> easiest<00:00:59.320> for<00:00:59.589> me<00:00:59.620> and<00:01:00.129> that's<00:01:00.640> what<00:01:00.850> I'm

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
works easiest for me and that's what I'm

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.450 
works easiest for me and that's what I'm
going<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.210> show<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:01.589> because<00:01:02.589> you<00:01:03.070> want<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.370> be

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
going to show you because you want to be

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.540 
going to show you because you want to be
able<00:01:03.580> to<00:01:03.760> work<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.089> short<00:01:04.390> row<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:06.250> really

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
able to work a short row and it really

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.290 
able to work a short row and it really
shouldn't<00:01:06.880> be<00:01:07.030> any<00:01:07.120> harder<00:01:07.840> than<00:01:08.790> doing<00:01:09.790> any

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
shouldn't be any harder than doing any

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.690 
shouldn't be any harder than doing any

tug you do not want to make your wrap

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.900 
tug you do not want to make your wrap
which<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:57.760> what<00:01:57.940> we've<00:01:58.090> done<00:01:58.120> here<00:01:58.920> tight<00:01:59.920> if

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
which is what we've done here tight if

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.170 
which is what we've done here tight if
you<00:02:01.360> make<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.780> tight<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:03.520> going<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.030> be

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
you make it tight it's going to be

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.690 
you make it tight it's going to be
really<00:02:04.720> difficult<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.290> work<00:02:05.650> so<00:02:06.370> it<00:02:06.490> is

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
really difficult to work so it is

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.609 
really difficult to work so it is
important<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.480> stays<00:02:07.780> loose<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.410> what<00:02:08.590> I

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
important that it stays loose so what I

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.979 
important that it stays loose so what I
usually<00:02:08.920> do<00:02:09.429> now<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:10.000> when<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.509> get<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.840> that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
usually do now is when I get to that

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.660 
usually do now is when I get to that
point<00:02:11.260> I'm<00:02:11.500> gonna<00:02:11.650> take<00:02:11.890> my<00:02:12.040> thumb<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.370> I'm

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
point I'm gonna take my thumb and I'm

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.330 
point I'm gonna take my thumb and I'm
gonna<00:02:12.819> hold<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.330> while<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.349> do<00:02:14.620> my<00:02:15.280> next

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
gonna hold that while I do my next

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.180 
gonna hold that while I do my next
stitch<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:17.140> I've<00:02:17.440> made<00:02:17.680> sure<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:17.860> that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
stitch now I've made sure that that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.880 
stitch now I've made sure that that
stays<00:02:18.519> loose<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> now<00:02:21.370> I'm<00:02:21.670> going<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.150> purl

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
stays loose so now I'm going to purl

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.440 
stays loose so now I'm going to purl
until<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> next<00:02:24.219> point<00:02:24.579> where<00:02:24.790> my<00:02:24.969> pattern

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
until the next point where my pattern

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.059 
until the next point where my pattern
might<00:02:25.689> tell<00:02:25.989> me<00:02:26.249> to<00:02:27.249> do<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.790> wrap<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.480> turn

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
might tell me to do a wrap and turn

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.630 
might tell me to do a wrap and turn
so<00:02:30.069> I'm<00:02:30.310> gonna<00:02:30.580> say<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.890> now<00:02:33.100> I've<00:02:33.310> reached<00:02:33.490> a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
so I'm gonna say that now I've reached a

just<00:05:17.560> going<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.710> transfer<00:05:17.950> the<00:05:18.310> other<00:05:18.460> stitch

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
just going to transfer the other stitch

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.260 
just going to transfer the other stitch
back<00:05:19.890> so<00:05:20.890> now<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.460> have<00:05:22.320> two<00:05:23.320> loops<00:05:23.530> on<00:05:24.270> the

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
back so now I have two loops on the

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.740 
back so now I have two loops on the
needle

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
needle

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.260 
needle
I<00:05:25.980> will<00:05:26.980> purl<00:05:27.460> those<00:05:28.120> two<00:05:28.180> loops<00:05:28.720> together<00:05:30.270> no

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
I will purl those two loops together no

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:45.440 
I will purl those two loops together no
I'll<00:05:31.810> keep<00:05:32.140> working<00:05:33.480> across<00:05:34.480> my<00:05:34.660> fabric

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.840 

and<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:47.000> is<00:05:48.440> all<00:05:49.440> there<00:05:49.650> is<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:50.400> doing<00:05:50.730> a

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
and that is all there is to doing a

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.990 
and that is all there is to doing a
short<00:05:51.150> row<00:05:51.480> in<00:05:51.810> making<00:05:52.740> a<00:05:52.890> wrap<00:05:53.100> and<00:05:53.130> turn<00:05:53.550> you

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
short row in making a wrap and turn you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.790 
short row in making a wrap and turn you
can<00:05:54.180> see<00:05:54.540> that<00:05:55.530> there's<00:05:55.860> a<00:05:55.950> little<00:05:56.660> pooch<00:05:57.800> that

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
can see that there's a little pooch that

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.130 
can see that there's a little pooch that
has<00:05:58.950> happened<00:05:59.370> I've<00:05:59.640> done<00:06:00.210> a<00:06:00.240> total<00:06:00.660> of<00:06:00.930> two

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
has happened I've done a total of two

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.500 
has happened I've done a total of two
short<00:06:01.470> rows<00:06:01.710> I<00:06:02.040> did<00:06:02.340> one<00:06:02.550> down<00:06:02.760> here<00:06:03.180> and<00:06:03.330> the

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
short rows I did one down here and the

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.670 
short rows I did one down here and the
one<00:06:03.690> that<00:06:03.840> I<00:06:03.900> showed<00:06:04.200> you<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:05.400> creates<00:06:05.880> an

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
one that I showed you and it creates an

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.490 
one that I showed you and it creates an
extra<00:06:07.680> amount<00:06:07.860> of<00:06:08.190> fabric<00:06:08.810> within<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:10.020> center

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
extra amount of fabric within the center

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.670 
extra amount of fabric within the center
so<00:06:10.890> you<00:06:10.980> can<00:06:11.310> create<00:06:11.610> say<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.450> toe<00:06:12.660> of<00:06:12.870> a<00:06:12.960> sock

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
so you can create say the toe of a sock

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.920 
so you can create say the toe of a sock
you<00:06:14.310> can<00:06:14.460> use<00:06:14.610> it<00:06:14.640> to<00:06:14.850> create<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.240> gusset<00:06:15.690> on<00:06:15.840> a

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
you can use it to create the gusset on a

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.710 
you can use it to create the gusset on a
glove<00:06:17.540> to<00:06:18.890> increase<00:06:19.890> some<00:06:20.160> space<00:06:20.580> in<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.360> bust

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
glove to increase some space in the bust

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.710 
glove to increase some space in the bust
of<00:06:22.050> a<00:06:22.140> sweater<00:06:22.530> or<00:06:22.680> in<00:06:23.040> the<00:06:23.160> shoulders<00:06:23.730> lots<00:06:24.510> of

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
of a sweater or in the shoulders lots of

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.080 
of a sweater or in the shoulders lots of
options<00:06:25.290> that<00:06:25.350> you<00:06:25.560> can<00:06:25.830> use<00:06:26.070> short<00:06:26.370> rows<00:06:26.610> for

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
options that you can use short rows for

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.390 
options that you can use short rows for
and<00:06:27.360> they're<00:06:28.290> all<00:06:28.560> going<00:06:28.740> to<00:06:28.800> use<00:06:28.980> that<00:06:29.190> same

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
and they're all going to use that same

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.780 
and they're all going to use that same
principle<00:06:29.640> of<00:06:30.240> knitting<00:06:30.630> to<00:06:30.780> a<00:06:30.810> certain<00:06:31.230> point
