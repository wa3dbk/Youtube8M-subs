just cutting a little lid off and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.150 
just cutting a little lid off and
leaving<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> tiny<00:00:58.649> bit<00:00:58.890> off<00:00:59.010> the

leaving you see just a tiny bit off the
top<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.730> get<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.809> we've<00:01:00.989> got

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
top so we can get in and now we've got

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.740 
top so we can get in and now we've got
to<00:01:01.260> holler<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> found<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.570> best

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to holler that out now I found the best

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
to holler that out now I found the best
thing<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.589> ice<00:01:04.710> cream<00:01:05.040> scoop<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
thing for that is an ice cream scoop you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270 
thing for that is an ice cream scoop you
could<00:01:06.420> probably<00:01:06.570> use<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> spoon<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.830> we've<00:01:08.159> got

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
could probably use a spoon but we've got

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.590 
could probably use a spoon but we've got
to<00:01:08.400> get<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to get that in there and we're going to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.080 
to get that in there and we're going to
be<00:01:09.689> drawing<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.229> all<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.830> flesh<00:01:11.090> without

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
be drawing out all the flesh without

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.700 
be drawing out all the flesh without
damaging<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.200> don't<00:01:13.380> want<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
damaging you really don't want to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.200 
damaging you really don't want to
puncture<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.630> inside<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.840> orange<00:01:16.159> peel
