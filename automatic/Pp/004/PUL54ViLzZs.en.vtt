00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and see if this trade would work itself

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.030 
and see if this trade would work itself
it<00:01:06.060> doesn't<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.960> trade<00:01:07.260> fails<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.979> the

reason the trade fails is because the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.630 
reason the trade fails is because the
