there's for leads in here and I tap into
those<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.479> how<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.630> run<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> motors<00:01:25.350> my

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
those and that's how I run the motors my

those and that's how I run the motors my
website<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:26.820> how-to<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.780> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
website is a little how-to with all of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.179 
website is a little how-to with all of
the<00:01:28.140> schematics<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> where<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> hook<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the schematics of where to hook that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.969 
the schematics of where to hook that
stuff<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.200> head<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.770> came

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
stuff up now this was the head that came

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.130 
stuff up now this was the head that came
on<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.540> I've<00:01:33.659> done<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
on this one and what I've done was it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
on this one and what I've done was it
I've<00:01:34.439> gutted<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> stuff<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> here

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I've gutted all of the stuff out of here

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
I've gutted all of the stuff out of here
that<00:01:36.329> ran<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.689> arms<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> arms<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:38.040> had<00:01:38.460> some

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that ran the arms the arms all had some

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.940 
that ran the arms the arms all had some
sort<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.150> mechanism<00:01:39.720> they<00:01:39.840> did<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.770> all

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
sort of a mechanism they did that's all

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.560 
sort of a mechanism they did that's all
gone<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.549> leaves<00:01:41.729> plenty<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.150> room<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> put

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
gone now it leaves plenty of room to put

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.139 
gone now it leaves plenty of room to put
things<00:01:42.720> inside<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.380> namely<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:44.070> seed<00:01:44.939> we

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
things inside there namely a seed we

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.940 
things inside there namely a seed we
know<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.049> an<00:01:46.170> Arduino<00:01:46.619> clone

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
know this one is it's an Arduino clone

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.679 
know this one is it's an Arduino clone
it's<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.759> bit<00:01:47.880> cheaper<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.390> it'll<00:01:48.570> do

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it's a little bit cheaper but it'll do

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990 
it's a little bit cheaper but it'll do
the<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:49.020> thing<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.290> Arduino<00:01:49.680> does<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the same thing in Arduino does so this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.999 
the same thing in Arduino does so this
will<00:01:51.149> all<00:01:51.329> go<00:01:51.360> together<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.500> hide

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
will all go together like this and hide

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.609 
will all go together like this and hide
inside<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:53.970> nicely<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:55.470> my

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
inside there very nicely and I can do my

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
inside there very nicely and I can do my
USB<00:01:56.159> stuff<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.000> back

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
USB stuff on the back

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.350 
USB stuff on the back
and<00:01:58.740> then<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.130> way<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.400> sees<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.300> ping

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
and then the way it sees is with a ping

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.130 
and then the way it sees is with a ping
ultrasonic<00:02:03.360> sensor<00:02:03.690> these<00:02:03.870> come<00:02:04.110> from

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
ultrasonic sensor these come from

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.460 
ultrasonic sensor these come from
parallel<00:02:04.980> parallax<00:02:06.080> electronics<00:02:07.080> they<00:02:07.260> cost

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
parallel parallax electronics they cost

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.919 
parallel parallax electronics they cost
about<00:02:07.590> $32<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.460> radio<00:02:08.820> shack<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.810> one

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
about $32 a radio shack and this one

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.360 
about $32 a radio shack and this one
will<00:02:09.990> go<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.320> like<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.500> oh<00:02:10.860> look<00:02:11.070> it's<00:02:11.250> got

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
will go in like this oh look it's got

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.110 
will go in like this oh look it's got
personality<00:02:11.580> now<00:02:12.410> I'm<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.620> cute<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:15.000> this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
personality now I'm that cute so this

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.300 
personality now I'm that cute so this
ultrasonic<00:02:15.630> sensor<00:02:16.200> will<00:02:16.410> send<00:02:16.710> out<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> sound

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
ultrasonic sensor will send out a sound

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.460 
ultrasonic sensor will send out a sound
wave<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.880> bounce<00:02:18.060> back<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.200> will<00:02:19.290> tell

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
wave and bounce back and it will tell

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.290 
wave and bounce back and it will tell
the<00:02:19.620> robot<00:02:19.800> I'm<00:02:20.250> coming<00:02:20.790> up<00:02:20.880> next<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the robot I'm coming up next to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.360 
the robot I'm coming up next to
something<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.840> need<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.080> turn<00:02:22.320> around<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.860> so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
something I need to turn around and so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.940 
something I need to turn around and so
the<00:02:23.490> code<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.180> simply<00:02:24.620> drive<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.920> crazy

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the code is just simply drive like crazy

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.040 
the code is just simply drive like crazy
until<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:27.180> an<00:02:27.270> object<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.690> front<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.960> you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
until you see an object in front of you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.780 
until you see an object in front of you
stop<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.710> then<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.920> runs<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.250> routine<00:02:29.610> where

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
stop and then it runs the routine where

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.760 
stop and then it runs the routine where
it<00:02:29.850> backs<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.300> turn<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.959> continues<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.650> its

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
it backs up turn and continues on its

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.030 
it backs up turn and continues on its
way<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.870> thing<00:02:34.080> with<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.320> ultrasonic

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
way and the thing with the ultrasonic

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.699 
way and the thing with the ultrasonic
sensor<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:36.240> it's<00:02:36.450> at<00:02:36.570> an<00:02:36.660> angle<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.440> won't

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
sensor is if it's at an angle it won't

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.410 
sensor is if it's at an angle it won't
always<00:02:37.890> pick<00:02:38.190> up<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.430> wall<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.970> then<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> do

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
always pick up a wall so then what I do

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.940 
always pick up a wall so then what I do
is<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.720> add<00:02:39.900> an<00:02:40.080> extra<00:02:40.320> couple<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.680> bumps

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
is I add an extra couple of bumps

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.220 
is I add an extra couple of bumps
switches<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.820> hits<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.120> wall<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.990> knows

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
switches so if it hits the wall it knows

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.590 
switches so if it hits the wall it knows
how<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.560> backup<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.580> away<00:02:44.700> from<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.510> then

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
how to backup and get away from and then

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.880 
how to backup and get away from and then
once<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:45.900> all<00:02:46.020> done<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.350> whole<00:02:46.500> thing<00:02:46.709> goes

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
once it's all done the whole thing goes

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.610 
once it's all done the whole thing goes
together<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.490> 9-volt<00:02:48.000> battery<00:02:48.360> runs<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
together a 9-volt battery runs the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.360 
together a 9-volt battery runs the
Arduino<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.030> bottom<00:02:51.450> are<00:02:51.570> four<00:02:52.280> double<00:02:53.280> A

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
Arduino in the bottom are four double A

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.280 
Arduino in the bottom are four double A
batteries<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:54.120> drive<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.480> motors<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.959> here

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
batteries that drive the motors in here

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.949 
batteries that drive the motors in here
and<00:02:55.470> they<00:02:56.190> will<00:02:56.370> last<00:02:56.580> about<00:02:56.940> an<00:02:57.360> hour<00:02:57.450> so

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
and they will last about an hour so

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.290 
and they will last about an hour so
driving<00:02:58.380> around<00:02:58.680> before<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.670> batteries<00:03:00.120> run

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
driving around before the batteries run

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.259 
driving around before the batteries run
down<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:02.130> how<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.400> build<00:03:02.640> Rumble

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
down and that's how you build Rumble

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.059 
down and that's how you build Rumble
robots

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.099 

Oh
