00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 if you have not seen, the son is lost 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.319
 of all the antenna mark 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:18.240
 in this video that will have a spoiler until 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:20.430
 the end of the brand has continued to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.859
 saga of the heroes of the Olympus to intrinsic 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.230
 solved, solved with them 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 with the United States to the House of Hades the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.830
 fourth book in the series the heroes of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 olimpo that by the way were better 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.719
 books of the river wrote because 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.750
 you compare the lightning thief with this 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.340
 here in much improved in type it 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.200
 improved because of the lack of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.219
 Same form of all books 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.930
 previous 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.789
 I mean the same way because it's the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 monster prophecy defeats all 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.550
 monsters a happy face the prophecy stays 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.260
 have if they have a day fulfills and knows 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.510
 started to get sick it gives a certain 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.250
 time until I was afraid that with 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.520
 afraid to read this book they ended up liking 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.859
 the same way but on the contrary 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.899
 I loved this free reminder that you tell 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.970
 from the had the mark had had 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.430
 exactly where it ended up at the end 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.430
 of this book here the profile on betty and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.520
 end up falling into the tartar and ends up like this 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.220
 and carla are firefighters good time 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 thinking that it could happen here already 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.100
 in this beautiful place in tori 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.200
 what does he put the following thing for 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.720
 my wonderful readers 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.189
 sorry for the last suspense 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 Not really in the serious zone right now. 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.990
 You guys, he made a lot of suspense. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.329
 luck the press was able to launch 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 along with the United States in this book 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.220
 that gaia that I will still come back with everything 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.950
 It's a certain day, and the seven have to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.470
 get coffee do not come back and close 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.600
 the doors of elyson death in a house of 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.640
 areas where monsters do not want to 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.040
 he goes there to be able to save 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.810
 your friends meanwhile by being open 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.490
 in tartan almost dying 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.579
 The cool thing about this book here is that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.440
 Rich rescues some characters 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.870
 monsters from previous years 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.770
 they appear in this one what the ricky 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.479
 did type 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.430
 I was very happy that he rescued a 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.740
 certain person 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.310
 finally the Greeks and Romans and 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.260
 together to get know how to instruct 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.450
 gaia to get her to vote in power 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.580
 inherent in this type of monsters that is 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.080
 impossible to defeat and that the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.640
 character does not know he will not 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.890
 get to vote because they are bigger 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.020
 Bigger Giants Earn Bigger Profits and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.090
 bleed and maybe they have a certain 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.060
 solution to leak is away from those 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.800
 round monsters I laugh a lot of face 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.130
 in this book here it was a little bit 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.620
 more chubby here but anyway he 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.950
 Quick as hell because it's my book. 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.610
 arrived on the 9th and the other 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.940
 I'll do 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.010
 I went on the cell phone in the blue house in 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.080
 the first chapters of the house 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.330
 of arias is as soon as possible I 've already finished 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.580
 from toney and cidinho it along with my 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.200
 friend renan who can read the same time 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.380
 more or less 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.260
 now we wait to get 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:16.730
 again book 5 that will be called 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:20.070
 new clean and free blood and hopefully 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:28.860
 I can not take it. 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:32.989
 the series it seems that what I say 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:38.550
 Love is very Norse mythology it is 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:41.900
 I think it 's very hard and I hope 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.860
 to continue like this in the fifth book 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.769
 because it is very good 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:53.610
 I did not like it here on video now I prefer 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.900
 whether it's Olympus or Jackson and the 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:02.630
 we'll see you guys like it more and 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:06.860
 videos are not tracked with my videos 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.860
 the world until the next
