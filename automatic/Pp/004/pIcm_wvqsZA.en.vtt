they're<00:03:18.299> basically<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.170> slam<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.860> as

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
they're basically I just slam it in as

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.920 
they're basically I just slam it in as
quickly<00:03:20.790> as<00:03:20.970> possible<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.599> don't<00:03:21.629> think

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
quickly as possible so I don't think

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.030 
quickly as possible so I don't think
about<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.170> grouping<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:22.769> think<00:03:22.950> about

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
about the grouping I just think about

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.770 
about the grouping I just think about
where<00:03:23.280> I'm<00:03:23.370> going<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.579> end<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.120> go

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
where I'm going to end it and then go

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.930 
where I'm going to end it and then go
