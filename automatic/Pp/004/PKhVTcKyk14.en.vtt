than that guys let's get right into the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.670 
than that guys let's get right into the
breakdown<00:00:40.820> video<00:00:40.970> so<00:00:41.870> quickly<00:00:42.290> getting<00:00:42.500> into

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
breakdown video so quickly getting into

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.050 
breakdown video so quickly getting into
some<00:00:42.830> of<00:00:42.890> these<00:00:42.980> stats<00:00:43.250> our<00:00:43.490> blast<00:00:43.700> shield<00:00:43.970> on

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
some of these stats our blast shield on

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.820 
some of these stats our blast shield on
first<00:00:44.300> off<00:00:44.420> like<00:00:44.540> to<00:00:44.630> point<00:00:44.900> out<00:00:45.080> that<00:00:45.590> I<00:00:45.650> think

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
first off like to point out that I think

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.500 
first off like to point out that I think
blast<00:00:46.280> shield<00:00:46.520> is<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.670> number<00:00:47.090> one<00:00:47.270> most

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
blast shield is the number one most

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.300 
blast shield is the number one most
underused<00:00:47.960> perk<00:00:48.200> in<00:00:48.350> modern<00:00:48.680> warfare<00:00:48.860> 3<00:00:49.010> guys

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
underused perk in modern warfare 3 guys

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.280 
underused perk in modern warfare 3 guys
and<00:00:49.460> once<00:00:50.060> you<00:00:50.210> get<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.480> chance<00:00:50.720> to<00:00:50.900> kind<00:00:51.230> of

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
and once you get the chance to kind of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.810 
and once you get the chance to kind of
read<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.740> hear<00:00:51.980> about<00:00:52.100> some<00:00:52.220> of<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.580> stats

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
read and hear about some of the stats

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.760 
read and hear about some of the stats
that<00:00:52.910> it<00:00:53.090> actually<00:00:53.480> does<00:00:53.630> provide<00:00:53.810> I<00:00:54.230> think<00:00:54.470> a

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
that it actually does provide I think a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.110 
that it actually does provide I think a
lot<00:00:54.920> of<00:00:54.950> you<00:00:55.070> guys<00:00:55.130> will<00:00:55.370> rethink<00:00:55.580> it<00:00:55.910> might

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
lot of you guys will rethink it might

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.610 
lot of you guys will rethink it might
actually<00:00:56.330> use<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:56.870> within<00:00:57.380> your

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
actually use this within your

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.800 
actually use this within your
competitive<00:00:58.130> or<00:00:58.340> just<00:00:58.550> normal<00:00:58.670> gameplay<00:00:59.090> so

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
competitive or just normal gameplay so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.060 
competitive or just normal gameplay so
first<00:01:00.020> off<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:00.230> guess<00:01:00.380> you<00:01:00.470> can<00:01:00.620> see<00:01:00.770> here<00:01:00.980> it

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
first off I guess you can see here it

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.370 
first off I guess you can see here it
basically<00:01:01.370> reduces<00:01:01.610> enemy<00:01:02.329> explosives<00:01:02.990> by<00:01:03.200> up

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
basically reduces enemy explosives by up

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.100 
basically reduces enemy explosives by up
to<00:01:03.410> 45%<00:01:04.159> now<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:04.939> HUGE<00:01:05.150> guys<00:01:05.360> things<00:01:05.960> like

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
to 45% now that is HUGE guys things like

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.380 
to 45% now that is HUGE guys things like
c4s<00:01:06.829> claymores<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:07.759> bouncing<00:01:08.119> Betties

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
c4s claymores and bouncing Betties

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.940 
c4s claymores and bouncing Betties
basically<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:08.990> have<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.200> really<00:01:09.560> great<00:01:09.740> chance

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
basically you have a really great chance

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.530 
basically you have a really great chance
of<00:01:10.130> surviving<00:01:10.579> them<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.000> once<00:01:11.210> again<00:01:11.299> you

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
of surviving them and once again you

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.300 
of surviving them and once again you
almost<00:01:11.720> have<00:01:11.899> a<00:01:11.929> 50%<00:01:12.469> better<00:01:12.859> chance<00:01:13.130> of

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
almost have a 50% better chance of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.800 
almost have a 50% better chance of
surviving<00:01:13.759> them<00:01:13.880> now<00:01:14.359> if<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.509> look<00:01:14.630> at<00:01:14.719> the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
surviving them now if you look at the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.179 
surviving them now if you look at the
pro<00:01:14.960> version<00:01:14.990> which<00:01:15.469> is<00:01:15.590> my<00:01:15.679> personal

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
pro version which is my personal

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.520 
pro version which is my personal
favorites<00:01:16.609> it<00:01:16.789> basically<00:01:17.420> reduces<00:01:17.689> stuns<00:01:18.350> and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
favorites it basically reduces stuns and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.099 
favorites it basically reduces stuns and
flashes<00:01:19.069> by<00:01:19.219> up<00:01:19.399> to<00:01:19.429> 50%<00:01:19.880> now<00:01:20.569> things<00:01:20.899> like

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
flashes by up to 50% now things like

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.039 
flashes by up to 50% now things like
once<00:01:21.439> again<00:01:21.679> the<00:01:21.799> concussion<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:23.060> flash<00:01:23.689> and

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
once again the concussion the flash and

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.020 
once again the concussion the flash and
I<00:01:24.200> think<00:01:24.499> even<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.889> EMP<00:01:25.280> grenade<00:01:25.549> applies<00:01:25.819> to

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
I think even the EMP grenade applies to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.340 
I think even the EMP grenade applies to
this<00:01:26.149> but<00:01:26.569> I'm<00:01:26.659> also<00:01:26.780> going<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.049> give<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.319> a

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
this but I'm also going to give you a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.020 
this but I'm also going to give you a
visual<00:01:27.649> comparison<00:01:28.069> on<00:01:28.369> how<00:01:28.549> each<00:01:28.789> of<00:01:28.819> these

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
visual comparison on how each of these

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.419 
visual comparison on how each of these
are<00:01:29.210> affected<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:29.869> at<00:01:30.740> first<00:01:30.950> I'd<00:01:31.069> like<00:01:31.189> to<00:01:31.280> go

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
are affected so at first I'd like to go

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.830 
are affected so at first I'd like to go
