00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.010
 hello how are they good today 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.950
 I bring the review of the main wilder 1.2.1 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:11.889
 that already has time left and I think that 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.230
 Exactly like a month ago but I did not 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.849
 makes good the main reason why not 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.439
 I read your videos because I did not have 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.170
 time and because my phone 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.689
 present some rays but now yes 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.670
 yes and I bring the re force as 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.310
 you will see few things that they added 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.050
 to what this new update would be 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.550
 which just added a new 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.440
 block that generated cars that is like 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.340
 a dispenser only that instead of 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.670
 generate dispense 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.380
 things dispenses only cars and serves 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.880
 if you put tracks but also added what 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.130
 which would be three types of shipowners 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.690
 different that would be the leather the 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.890
 iron 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.769
 with leather and iron leather and ayron 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 that says gold and as you will see in the 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.039
 video this is a modified version 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.930
 but what happens is that I have 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.270
 installed more and that's why you see four 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.210
 armor but itself in the version 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.159
 original contains only three when 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.880
 they were also added in new effects 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.110
 screen as they could see they are put 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.299
 the red edges when we're 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.650
 too many injured the gray edges 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.270
 when we are very hungry 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.270
 and I think that nothing else 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.730
 and what were the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.920
 animations regarding the movement of 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.700
 character and when to be in 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.580
 creative at the time of flying is added a 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.910
 effect or an animation of what would be 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.950
 when would our character be flying 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.740
 and so I think that would be all that 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.180
 they added so thank you for watching the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.190
 video remember that any like 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.600

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.430
