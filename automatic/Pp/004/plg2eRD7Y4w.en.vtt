00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
get this skill and you manage to manage

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.690 
get this skill and you manage to manage
to<00:02:56.989> develop<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.470> please<00:02:57.950> do<00:02:58.160> not<00:02:58.310> do<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.610> with

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
to develop it please do not do this with

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.280 
to develop it please do not do this with
somebody's<00:02:58.970> body<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.690> will<00:02:59.810> really<00:02:59.989> mess<00:03:00.200> them

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
somebody's body it will really mess them

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.670 
somebody's body it will really mess them
up<00:03:00.410> okay<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:02.510> will<00:03:02.660> probably<00:03:02.989> go<00:03:03.080> down<00:03:03.110> over

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
up okay that will probably go down over

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.280 
up okay that will probably go down over
the<00:03:04.250> next<00:03:04.310> half<00:03:04.640> hour<00:03:04.849> or<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.180> okay<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:06.080> may

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
the next half hour or so okay it may

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.750 
the next half hour or so okay it may
develop<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.680> little<00:03:06.830> bit<00:03:06.920> more<00:03:07.069> sometimes

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
develop a little bit more sometimes

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.949 
develop a little bit more sometimes
you'll<00:03:07.910> do<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.150> actual<00:03:08.420> blood<00:03:08.569> vessels

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
you'll do it in actual blood vessels

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.690 
you'll do it in actual blood vessels
will<00:03:09.080> burst<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.580> capillaries<00:03:10.580> in<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
will burst in the capillaries in the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.880 
will burst in the capillaries in the
skin<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.510> again<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:11.690> need<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.900> be<00:03:11.959> careful<00:03:12.140> but

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
skin so again you need to be careful but

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.620 
skin so again you need to be careful but
you<00:03:13.010> can<00:03:13.160> see<00:03:13.370> particularly<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.390> middle

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
you can see particularly that middle

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.360 
you can see particularly that middle
finger<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:14.989> this<00:03:15.110> one<00:03:15.319> you<00:03:15.709> can<00:03:15.739> really<00:03:16.220> see

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
finger on this one you can really see

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.039 
finger on this one you can really see
the<00:03:16.549> born<00:03:16.730> print<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.180> center<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.630> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
the born print in the center of it the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.259 
the born print in the center of it the
different<00:03:18.349> areas<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.980> hand<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.400> it

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
different areas of the hand I it

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.880 
different areas of the hand I it
separately<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.200> will<00:03:21.349> cost<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.590> lots<00:03:21.769> of

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
separately it will cost you lots of

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.500 
separately it will cost you lots of
money<00:03:22.099> for<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.430> amount<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:23.299> you're<00:03:23.420> actually

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
money for that amount so you're actually

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.120 
money for that amount so you're actually
making<00:03:23.780> your<00:03:23.959> own<00:03:24.049> personal<00:03:24.650> supply<00:03:24.920> if<00:03:25.040> you

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
making your own personal supply if you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.059 
making your own personal supply if you
like<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:26.090> iron<00:03:26.900> palm<00:03:27.079> wine<00:03:27.380> or<00:03:27.680> they<00:03:27.950> did

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
like of the iron palm wine or they did

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.400 
like of the iron palm wine or they did
their<00:03:28.220> job<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:29.450> we'll<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.870> mix<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.079> alcohol

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
their job so we'll just mix the alcohol

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.569 
their job so we'll just mix the alcohol
in<00:03:30.500> it's<00:03:30.620> very<00:03:30.799> straightforward<00:03:31.099> as<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.430> say

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
in it's very straightforward as I say

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.839 
in it's very straightforward as I say
any<00:03:31.819> any<00:03:32.150> brand<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.780> vodkas<00:03:33.110> fine<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:34.519> pour

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
any any brand of vodkas fine so you pour

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.809 
any any brand of vodkas fine so you pour
the<00:03:35.000> liquid<00:03:35.090> in<00:03:39.610> unfortunately<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:40.670> can't

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
the liquid in unfortunately you can't

00:03:40.819 --> 00:04:02.300 
the liquid in unfortunately you can't
drink<00:03:41.030> any<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.299> it

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.400 

and<00:04:03.310> basically<00:04:03.819> as<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.390> pour<00:04:04.569> liquid<00:04:04.870> it's

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
and basically as you pour liquid it's

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.690 
and basically as you pour liquid it's
just<00:04:05.590> going<00:04:05.740> to<00:04:05.800> work<00:04:06.010> it's<00:04:06.400> going<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.580> fill

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
just going to work it's going to fill

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.760 
just going to work it's going to fill
the<00:04:06.790> tub<00:04:06.940> up<00:04:07.120> don't<00:04:07.750> worry<00:04:07.959> about<00:04:08.080> stirring<00:04:08.470> it

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
the tub up don't worry about stirring it

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.960 
the tub up don't worry about stirring it
you<00:04:08.860> don't<00:04:09.010> need<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.160> steer<00:04:09.520> it<00:04:09.640> or<00:04:09.760> anything

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
you don't need to steer it or anything

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.020 
you don't need to steer it or anything
like<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.209> just<00:04:10.709> put<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.830> alcohol<00:04:12.130> in<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:15.030> and

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
like that just put the alcohol in it and

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.729 
like that just put the alcohol in it and
the<00:04:16.630> herbs<00:04:16.810> will<00:04:16.989> do<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.200> wrong<00:04:17.320> thing<00:04:17.590> within

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
the herbs will do the wrong thing within

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.259 
the herbs will do the wrong thing within
it<00:04:17.919> what<00:04:18.489> will<00:04:18.579> actually<00:04:18.669> happen<00:04:18.880> is<00:04:19.150> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
it what will actually happen is the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.819 
it what will actually happen is the
alcohol<00:04:19.600> will<00:04:19.840> absorb<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.350> properties<00:04:20.799> of

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
alcohol will absorb the properties of

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.090 
alcohol will absorb the properties of
the<00:04:21.070> herbs<00:04:23.520> last<00:04:24.520> bottle<00:04:25.140> and<00:04:26.140> that's<00:04:26.980> what

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
the herbs last bottle and that's what

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.740 
the herbs last bottle and that's what
we're<00:04:27.220> looking<00:04:27.430> at<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.180> when<00:04:28.510> we've<00:04:28.600> got<00:04:28.720> a

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
we're looking at so when we've got a

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.940 
we're looking at so when we've got a
