the electric mitsubishi triton has an

electric motor and a battery pack so

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.130 
electric motor and a battery pack so
it's<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.700> fully<00:00:24.029> electric<00:00:24.600> vehicle<00:00:24.990> it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
it's it's a fully electric vehicle it's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.800 
it's it's a fully electric vehicle it's
not<00:00:25.290> a<00:00:25.320> hybrid<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.770> any<00:00:25.920> type<00:00:26.810> the

environmental credentials of that

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.000 
environmental credentials of that
vehicle<00:00:29.490> really<00:00:30.029> depend<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.720> how<00:00:31.410> its<00:00:31.590> charged

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
vehicle really depend on how its charged

vehicle really depend on how its charged
so<00:00:32.580> there<00:00:33.090> are<00:00:33.180> two<00:00:33.330> ways<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.080> make

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so there are two ways that we can make

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.200 
so there are two ways that we can make

sustainability issues important because

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.259 
sustainability issues important because
we're<00:02:10.140> trying<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.590> run<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.769> profitable<00:02:11.269> family

we're trying to run a profitable family
farm<00:02:12.570> we<00:02:13.380> need<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.680> look<00:02:13.769> at<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.040> issues<00:02:14.489> but

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
farm we need to look at these issues but

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.300 
farm we need to look at these issues but
it's<00:02:15.870> also<00:02:16.079> important<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.950> people

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it's also important that people

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.550 
it's also important that people
recognize<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.060> product<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.780> comes<00:02:19.170> off<00:02:19.410> our

farm we will producers specifically if
if<00:02:22.620> people<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:23.519> see<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:24.000> will<00:02:24.419> produce<00:02:24.600> that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
if people can see that will produce that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.259 
if people can see that will produce that

detrimental effects to the environment

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.550 
detrimental effects to the environment
so<00:02:29.400> ever<00:02:29.610> only<00:02:30.270> positives<00:02:30.960> because<00:02:31.260> we

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
so ever only positives because we

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.320 
so ever only positives because we
sequest<00:02:32.040> carbon<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.670> what<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.030> what<00:02:33.150> we're

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
sequest carbon in what in what we're

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.540 
sequest carbon in what in what we're
doing<00:02:33.530> then<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.560> has<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.070> be<00:02:35.100> good<00:02:35.340> for<00:02:35.490> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
doing then that has to be good for the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.040 
doing then that has to be good for the
product<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:36.000> sell<00:02:36.180> which<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.510> wool<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
product we sell which is wool and I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.480 
product we sell which is wool and I
believe<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.920> most<00:02:38.070> environmentally

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
believe it's the most environmentally

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.330 
believe it's the most environmentally
friendly<00:02:39.000> fiber<00:02:39.210> in<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.450> world<00:02:39.950> we<00:02:40.950> still<00:02:41.190> do

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
friendly fiber in the world we still do

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.710 
friendly fiber in the world we still do
have<00:02:41.370> attractive<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.060> didn't<00:02:42.300> we<00:02:42.420> didn't<00:02:42.630> get

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
have attractive we didn't we didn't get

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.020 
have attractive we didn't we didn't get
rid<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> tractor<00:02:43.350> we<00:02:43.740> we've<00:02:44.640> got<00:02:44.850> some

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
rid of the tractor we we've got some

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.210 
rid of the tractor we we've got some
slight<00:02:45.270> limitations<00:02:45.900> with<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.980> range

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
slight limitations with the the range

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.180 
slight limitations with the the range
that<00:02:47.550> we<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:48.110> with<00:02:49.110> utilizing<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.800> electric

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that we can with utilizing the electric

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.760 
that we can with utilizing the electric
vehicle<00:02:51.150> we've<00:02:51.690> got<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.990> technology<00:02:52.290> has<00:02:52.530> got

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
vehicle we've got the technology has got

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.220 
vehicle we've got the technology has got
us<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.070> far<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:54.090> has<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.420> go<00:02:54.540> way<00:02:54.930> further

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
us so far it has to go way further

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.010 
us so far it has to go way further
before<00:02:55.770> we<00:02:56.070> could<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.459> know<00:02:56.540> fully<00:02:57.540> utilize

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
before we could you know fully utilize

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.570 
before we could you know fully utilize
it<00:02:58.170> commercially<00:02:58.620> having<00:02:58.980> said<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.250> it's

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
it commercially having said that it's

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.640 
it commercially having said that it's
only<00:02:59.760> about<00:02:59.970> profitability<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:00.930> people<00:03:01.560> were

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
only about profitability if people were

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.410 
only about profitability if people were
willing<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.950> pay<00:03:02.220> enough<00:03:02.489> money<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
willing to pay enough money to have a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.810 
willing to pay enough money to have a
product<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.900> was<00:03:04.320> produced<00:03:04.680> with<00:03:04.980> zero

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
product that was produced with zero

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.620 
product that was produced with zero
emissions<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:07.430> basically<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.790> farm<00:03:09.360> running

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
emissions and basically a farm running

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.390 
emissions and basically a farm running
on<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> Sun<00:03:10.110> then<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.680> guess<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.010> economics

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
on the Sun then I guess the economics

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.730 
on the Sun then I guess the economics
would<00:03:11.520> change
