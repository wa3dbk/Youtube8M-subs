00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 hey how about in this video I will try 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.750
 explain a little about the scenes 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.280
 post credits of what is the movie 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.110
 of anime 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.639
 obviously this video is full of 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.190
 spoilers so if you have not seen the 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.960
 movie run to see it and then 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.590
 come back and watch the video or see what's under their 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.610
 own risk 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.040
 finally we start 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.720
 in the first scene post credits we see 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.820
 a hands clean meeting one more time 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 with his daughter already at home and pink him 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.930
 mentions hope that there is something that has to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 see hank reveals that behind the wall 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.140
 where the suit was hidden 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 Antoine hid a door and that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.360
 door hid another suit this suit 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.040
 it was also from whatsapp however to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.110
 difference that his mother used that was 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
 identical to Anne Frank but with wings 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 this new looks more technological and is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 predominantly blue and silver 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.760
 to what he mentions emotional it's about 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.070
 time and now the damn time and what 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 this means the most obvious assumption that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.860
 job will become the superheroine and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.960
 he will take his mother's alias 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.550
 but in the movie you never see the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.710
 face of his mother as well as never 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.410
 check his death including 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.550
 director of the film to peyton reed 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.370
 he mentions that there is a hidden interest 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.780
 when scott becomes subatomic like that 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.600
 that there is a possibility that janet 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.760
 come back but if so, she would go back to 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.030
 take the role of whatsapp I would pass it to 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.520
 his daughter would both take it hidden mario 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.100
 know alias it is important to mention that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.670
 Gone are the comics but if there 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.440
 not in the regular universe in the 616 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.270
 but in an alternative universe where 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.220
 the heroes have aged and now their 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.830
 children are the ones who take control of 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.740
 all the problem is that he said it's a 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.140
 villain called red queen thing that is 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.940
 very unlikely that we see in the movie 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.979
 so we discard that idea the only thing 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.720
 sure is that we will see who using that 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.910
 new huaso costume 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.250
 we go to the second and last scene 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.080
 after credits which despite 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 being shorter is much more complete 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.130
 in this scene we see falcon who already 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.350
 appears in the movie in one of the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.900
 best scenes by the way meeting 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.420
 with the cap both in civilian clothes 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.680
 some kind of garage finally 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.480
 they found bo kyi who had 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.610
 disappeared at the end of captain america 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.320
 the wild winter soldier and now for 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.720
 some reason which we do not know 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.520
 finds in very bad conditions 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.890
 steve and falcon need help but not 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.060
 can call tony the cap and mention 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.760
 that is busy with something called 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.590
 chords even subtitled it as is 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.150
 acords did not translate it in order to what 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.290
 falcon responds that there is no 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.840
 problem 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.940
 he knows the obviously referring to 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.650
 man in fact just when he finishes 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.770
 say that phrase the message appears on the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.930
 screen the hands man will wheaton and 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.360
 well what the fuck are these chords 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.220
 I know what this gentleman means in the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.530
 literal translation into Spanish of the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.660
 word exact words 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.640
 well this is what brings us 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.010
 directly from the next movie of 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.840
 marvel studios and also to the next 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.840
 from captain america who is captain 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.090
 america remains the same 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.920
 apparently after the end of winter 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.599
 soldier when the government like no 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.400
 he is very in agreement with the superheroes 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.090
 but black widow mentions equal the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.069
 they need and by the end of those filters 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.950
 when it ends up destroying a city 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.769
 complete the government of the USA has 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.349
 created a law that will force the heroes 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.330
 to register by forcing them to act 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.510
 only when they ask for it and only 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.459
 when they allow them then 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.739
 Tony is busy with the government in 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.299
 these agreements in these deals so 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.650
 which can not help them and they need 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.650
 someone who is off the radar to 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.209
 someone like ans man then to us 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.160
 is going to take this is going to lead us to 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.840
 there is a division among the heroes that 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.360
 some agree with these pacts and 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.010
 others of our agreement in order is going to 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.220
 create an aeroman division will be 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.770
 please the cap will be against these 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.750
 agreements and a civil war will be created 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.850
 order this is my interpretation of these 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.590
 scenes after credits in attempt 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.270
 to explain them 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.740

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.750
