00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.059
 hello guys with you jov and this 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.369
 again heading the most nagiborskie 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.189
 position rubric that tells you 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.740
 where to stand and how to shoot it at all 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.020
 do to bend aki guys from 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.300
 na'vi or virtus.pro and so today we 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.270
 first position on the map of Karelia that we 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.160
 do we drive in the pants we pick them up 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.320
 we beat them and after that with 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.840
 our allies roll it very 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.370
 convenient position from which we can 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.200
 shoot the ninth 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 and zero line especially this of course 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.500
 concerns those opponents who sit 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.750
 in the swamp near the stones 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.730
 they certainly do not expect such trickery and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.350
 look completely the other way plus 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.089
 I would like to note that in this position 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.429
 You can not only shoot neatly playing 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.260
 through the tower but also roll back hiding from 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.629
 artillery though of course the moment the shot 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.829
 you and will be delivered in the general position 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.519
 pretty good so 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.519
 I recommend to try 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.380
 and the second position is on 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.630
 pass card 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.550
 imagine the situation you're on secular 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.170
 st drag as you can 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.480
 but the team somehow care about you 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.430
 brings and the center of the card is broken what is 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.500
 do in such a situation in such a situation 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.950
 need one or sovzvodnikov if he have 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.530
 you have a 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.600
 choking on point e 7 is possible and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.130
 another scenario you 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.320
 top base breaking through the bridge 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.940
 that no one David Type push-ups 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.980
 under the stone at this point playing through 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.690
 turret on low tanks can be very 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.700
 not bad shoot from enemies 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.300
 what actually did our hero who 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.890
 gets 500 gold for this position 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.890
 congratulations on this great typhus 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.979
 let be 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.840
 you 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.350
 gut monastery on the map 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.450
 long known as a place where butt 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.770
 tyazh today we will teach you how to butt 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.190
 on this flank as much as possible 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.680
 effectively what we need to take and 7 of 4 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.360
 st-1 or e100 but of course more 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.980
 preferably Soviet tanks because 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.050
 they are smaller and after that we 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.080
 We become here in this position and very 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.570
 well you tank damage hiding your nld and 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.430
 substituting only the board with screens or 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.980
 just with good armor place guys 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.870
 very convenient and allows you to restrain 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.550
 opponent's huge rush 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.350
 nuance guys who need to remember this then 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.780
 that you must have a path of support 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.030
 if there is no support then opponents 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.070
 a huge crowd just roll out on you 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.390
 and once dama plus, of course there is 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.930
 the probability that enemy artillery 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.940
 will be on the opposition of a8 and a9 and can 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.890
 from there on you throw but nonetheless 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.140
 if you see that the enemy has a bunch of cords and 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.930
 most likely they will go to the gut such 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.330
 position for your and 7 or c4 will be like 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.920
 can not be the way and our hero on and 7 for her 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.920
 gets 500 gold 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.560
 you 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.019
 not a bad position, we want to show you 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.019
 on the map live oks 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.450
 Again, it is not from the new and already me and not 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.860
 only I tested with more than once but every 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.290
 since she showed herself only with the best 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.700
 sides that we need to take the middle 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.250
 soviet tank or heavy soviet 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.750
 tank media I'm punching the tower and low 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.940
 silhouette after that we quickly 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.950
 roll on c4 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.930
 where from because of the small hill we can 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.030
 shoot all enemy rush which 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.280
 rides along the city trying to kill his 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.859
 enemies position is very comfortable and enemy 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.569
 tanks almost never get you but 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.090
 of course she has minuses 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.130
 if suddenly in battle there is artillery on this 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.720
 the position is better not to become because 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.300
 just be shot 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.419
 Well, if you suddenly use card with 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.419
 health 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.570
 another very difficult and aggressive 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.730
 position is on el hulluf card 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.850
 what we need to do at the very beginning of the battle 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.700
 quickly go to point a1 a2 and there 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.770
 take a position on the hill above while 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.690
 we shone through all enemy rush and sat down 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.550
 here of course there is a plus we start on 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.770
 agritize yourself with enemy cords and 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.450
 st which instead of pursing 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.340
 under one start with us 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.140
 shoot out if we have strong 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.210
 tower we roll out without problems 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.430
 and shoot and throw and throw 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.650
 if there is no strong tower then we are quick 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.980
 we leave we make one shot and we leave 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.600
 inviz 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.920
 to to to to to 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.920
 know the fist pass 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.780
 but thatâ€™s not the end of it if 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.490
 all of a sudden your allies fought and a 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.920
 still pushing your enemies 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.410
 you can also do it yourself from this position. 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.210
 51 and even pot out some damage 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.750
 here of course it all depends on your 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.330
 skill 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.910
 and the ability to play well, and our hero on the map 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.910
 el hulluf for this position as the best 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.130
 the release gets a whole thousand gold 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.380
 congratulations to him on this dear 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.030

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.190
 forget that we are constantly looking for new 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.280
 positions and for those that will be released 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.170
 we pay all authors about 500 gold and
