with<00:02:12.430> javelin<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:14.080> think<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:14.830> of

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
with javelin and I think this is one of

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.930 
with javelin and I think this is one of
the<00:02:14.950> best<00:02:15.100> rocket<00:02:15.430> launches<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.820> game

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
the best rocket launches in the game

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.770 
the best rocket launches in the game
plus<00:02:16.240> it's<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.900> only<00:02:17.350> avoid<00:02:18.000> exotic<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.630> it

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
plus it's the only avoid exotic so it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.150 
plus it's the only avoid exotic so it
might<00:02:19.930> be<00:02:19.960> worth<00:02:20.200> picking<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.590> up<00:02:20.710> just<00:02:20.950> for
