 the purpose of interior decoration 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.750
 is to leave behind any label or thought 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.960
 that the kitchen is a boring space 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.300
 thanks to the different tendencies of 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.000
 decoration of kitchens that are going 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.330
 presenting we can convert this 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 space in a nicer place 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.000
 animated comfortable and practical for us 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.920
 if the current image of your kitchen already 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.920
 it's boring do not let it 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.610
 Here are some ideas to renew the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.610
 kitchen 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.740
 touch up the decoration of the walls 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.340
 a very good idea would be to be able to renew 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 all the paint on the walls in what 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.860
 possible by changing the color and adding 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.730
 some decorative effect that increases the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.520
 attractive but if the budget does not 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.550
 reach for so much then we can 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 opt for some other more economical idea 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.950
 such as placing a vinyl 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.870
 Decorative with special design for 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.710
 kitchens 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.930
 this will not only beautify you to much more 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.260
 but it will also serve to conceal 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.410
 some flaws in the current paint and 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.920
 even to change the visual focus of 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.920
 the decoration 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.250
 2 replace some furniture 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.799
 maybe the table the countertop the bar or 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:17.020
 the kitchen drawers are not in 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.440
 a good condition 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.990
 and this is an ideal occasion to 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.880
 take advantage of the renovation of the kitchen and 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.880
 replace them with new ones 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.370
 If you are going to buy new furniture for the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.860
 kitchen we recommend you opt for 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.530
 furniture of a different style than the one 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.910
 had previously for that change 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.910
 can be noticed 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.130
 3 decorate the windows 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.210
 you can choose to change the curtains by 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.420
 one of most vivid or cheerful design or 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.940
 just remove it and add some 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.410
 details with fabric paint that the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.410
 make them look more attractive 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.040
 the windows are also perfect for 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.930
 hang napkins and tablecloths from them 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.380
 small ones always keeping the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.380
 prolixity 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.570
 i 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.019
 4 decorate the doors of the cabinets 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.330
 your kitchen would not look the same with 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.250
 doors of your cabinet in one color 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.130
 vibrant and attractive 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.910
 and getting this effect will be nothing 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.900
 difficult enough with a little paint and 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.900
 desire to work 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.200
 another alternative is to decorate the doors 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.990
 placing an adhesive vinyl is much 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.990
 easier but perhaps more expensive 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.690
 think also of the idea of ​​changing the 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.010
 door handles by others from 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.010
 more modern design 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.000
 5 new carpet 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.129
 and be able to renew all the coverage of the 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:26.470
 floor would be a fantastic idea and if 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:30.980
 you have the budget to do it and 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.990
 you want to renovate your kitchen do not hesitate 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.780
 Now if you are looking for an idea more 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.480
 economic then we will only limit ourselves 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.480
 to replace the current carpet 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.160
 6 exposing the kitchen utensils 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.550
 if in the decoration of your kitchen you expose 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.780
 the utensils and cutlery that you use 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.360
 it will be time to remove them 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.030
 They do not have anything bad but it's time to 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.910
 change the image of the kitchen and 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.920
 then at least for a time 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.910
 we will keep hidden 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.430
 Now, if you have not applied 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.520
 this decoration we can previously 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.850
 play with her exposing the utensils 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.290
 and other elements on the walls 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.290
 shelves or over the counter 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.040
 always verify that they are in a 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.450
 good condition so that they contribute to the 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.450
 decoration of the environment
