00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello just a little 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.950
 introduction before launching the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.540
 video it's just to tell you that my 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.910
 advice is not advice 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.019
 professionals it's true but opinion on 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.089
 the products but little advice to me 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.230
 to help you that's all it's easy 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.230
 in this video we will not delay 1 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.720
 so like the title on Monday that we're going 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.670
 talk about shoes all care 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.320
 capillaries 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.310
 because so I go through a 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.340
 period when it was no longer possible 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.990
 I had dry hair Chereches death 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.050
 breaking it was really a horror 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.130
 so I tested a lot of products that 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.450
 even begin to give up 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.309
 until I come across a range 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.190
 So I present to you first it 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.600
 there was the shampoo dessange so 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.250
 Professional skills 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.020
 so it's shampoo range 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.589
 concentrate of nutrition health and for 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.920
 straight hair and dry term 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.370
 so there is a gingham in 2000 donald and of 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.850
 sesame 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.739
 so it nourishes restores softness 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.440
 and with the wii I can read very well 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.879
 a label 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.760
 otherwise my opinion on it is really 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.440
 great he is awesome 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.409
 in addition the loaders it is a killiie 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.510
 saint fromond the hair they are 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.409
 much more fluid and less heavy 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.290
 it's easier to brush they are 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.760
 a lot less sex sees the effectiveness 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.790
 a few days after only useful the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.200
 launch of use and I think 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.540
 as we go 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.050
 see improving the progress of which I 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.820
 I really recommend it and the awesome 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.140
 I cracked on wisteria and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.750
 way I buy them for sure and 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.180
 certain 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.950
 it really makes them fluid and silky 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.680
 without weighing down it's really great 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.930
 I recommend it to all frankly even 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.210
 those who do not have dry hair 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.230
 but there remains what frankly it 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.950
 makes it much easier to brush so 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.020
 it's really a change and that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.590
 is for everyone in fact so here it is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.590
 I recommand it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.110
 and as I wanted to say I was 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.970
 really desperate new hair 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 So suddenly I actually took the pass 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.860
 also with so it's still in the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.990
 same range a cargo in the mask 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.350
 nutrition concentrate always in the 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.080
 range one cries extreme wealth for the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.790
 very dry hair and a thing there 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
 is really great it's a bonus that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.060
 brings tone to the hair is 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.950
 really a complement of the shampoo 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.540
 those who are not despairing nor your 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.490
 hair you can widely you 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.750
 content with the only point otherwise you 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.340
 take the masses that I recommend 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.530
 also signal after it may not be necessary 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.670
 prick all every day in the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.080
 week every time you wash the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.690
 hair is that there are some they do that 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.130
 with the masks washing them with chavot who 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.180
 wash your hair you need a mask I 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.650
 think that after the blow hair 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.700
 get used to it's not really the deep and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.140
 the mask there I think two to one to 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.670
 twice a week is enough or 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.519
 twice a week is enough 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.840
 ample to feed the hair here 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.060
 so I really recommend this range 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.690
 the home of skills 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.250
 professional 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.250
 they are really great 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.310
 not always for hair problems 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.600
 and it's up to me I had a problem it's 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.840
 that I had all the time I galérais 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.610
 all the time going to unravel it was 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.300
 really it's morning it's in 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.980
 coming out of the shower 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.920
 it was really a horror so 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 coup I found this detangler there is the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.920
 garnier fructis disentangling either 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.160
 instant rinse-free range 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.260
 nutri landmark three oils it is 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.200
 really great i recommend it 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.940
 really really it's always for 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.690
 dry hair damaged his molasses dice 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.130
 expectations instantly without weighing down 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.750
 really it shows right away if a 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.360
 choice is something magical 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.460
 I really recommend it to everyone for the 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.010
 little anecdote before finishing this 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.200
 video as I was really desperate 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.220
 level be I wanted to say I thought 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.630
 that if his grave was not the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.400
 shampoo that I had to just go 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.560
 a good old method that now 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.730
 I know and complete claude no one so I 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.530
 wash my hair a little less 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.400
 often 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.270
 it was really not the right thing 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.200
 actually do 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.610
 so I use it because it was 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.780
 very good for the hair of the end of 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.550
 the island had less often it was 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.230
 less the one that dries up but here 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.920
 it was a little dirty more used of 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.000
 dry shampoo and and I told myself 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.380
 after that it was really a horror 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.480
 was even more rough and brittle 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.970
 hard to brush was not fluid 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.440
 it was really ugly 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.730
 so I thought it was the mark of 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.070
 dry shampoo 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.270
 after I tested the racks estérel thing 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.070
 in fact it's just the leaning bread 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.900
 dry so really when you have them 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.260
 dry hair do not use that all 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.419
 days 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.270
 it's really a horror it's going to do 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:46.270
 that worsening the condition of the hair is even 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.290
 not worth it because I use 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.200
 still still occasionally 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.669
 because sometimes mornings and all 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.500
 hair is a disaster so the one 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.240
 this is a very good brand so 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.640
 it's the ultra soft singing stuck 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.890
 with it's really these new tracking 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.480
 a very great so here is where 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.290
