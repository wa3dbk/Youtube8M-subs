00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
going to get caught up like it did in

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.469 
going to get caught up like it did in
the<00:06:30.350> sandbox<00:06:30.680> when<00:06:31.639> it<00:06:31.729> was<00:06:31.820> just<00:06:32.000> that<00:06:32.090> small

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
the sandbox when it was just that small

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.719 
the sandbox when it was just that small
area<00:06:32.750> it<00:06:33.229> would<00:06:33.320> just<00:06:33.500> get<00:06:33.650> caught<00:06:33.979> and<00:06:34.220> then

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
area it would just get caught and then

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.400 
area it would just get caught and then
dig<00:06:35.000> its<00:06:35.180> way<00:06:35.270> down<00:06:35.660> and<00:06:35.930> then<00:06:36.050> it<00:06:36.169> wouldn't

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
dig its way down and then it wouldn't

dig its way down and then it wouldn't
get<00:06:36.500> out<00:06:36.680> and<00:06:36.889> then<00:06:37.340> the<00:06:37.430> tall<00:06:37.760> grass<00:06:38.030> will<00:06:38.240> get
