00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello to all so I'm doing a little tutorial 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.280
 to show you how one wants his 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.880
 ports on a v5 freebox that affects a 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.679
 new interface 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.799
 so suddenly now I do it for 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.470
 the freebox v6 so you have to you 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.970
 return to my freebox free point fr you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.270
 need to type your sweat password 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.590
 of your freebox if you do not know 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.850
 you click on I forgot my word of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 happening there will be something that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.269
 will be displayed on the screen and you can 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.670
 choose your password on the screen 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.250
 of your freebox server I mean that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.480
 where via their which is displayed so once 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.210
 that you have your password you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.070
 are connected you will notice that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.420
 here it is your ip right so for 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.860
 redirect your pores you need you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 go to the local network tab and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.910
 port forwarding then you 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.980
 notice that here I already have road and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.190
 a lot of things I drive and oussalÃ© 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.469
 rest the rest is already road and for 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.899
 for boxing so this is the port 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.690
 external that you finally have there finally he 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.640
 must go down the paroxysm that you 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 must add these 25 1565 so anticipate 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.590
 with the ip and your pc so that's 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.689
 a little simpler because ip of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.360
 your pc stays fixed from the wolf you have 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.000
 road and a port to this guy is so 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 as a reminder you open your menu 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.710
 start you at pc md and once in 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.320
 the cmd you type ipconfig to have 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.509
 your ip and so as I wanted to said 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.390
 in in the tutorial this for freebox v5 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.670
 you have ethernet card connection to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.140
 local network so with your address 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.049
 ipv4 and that finally ends me it's without 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 492 points 138 points 0.8 so you 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.220
 type point 0.8 the internal plane is 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.689
 exactly the same as comment 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.020
 you can put for example minecraft 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.969
 right on to find out what's like 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 as a port we add it to you 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.780
 know how to score in bar direction added 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.700
 you go down for exactly 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.170
 with the same port this time onu dp 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.170
 to retype the -p -Ã© 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.940
 here are points 8 the internal port is 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.840
 exactly the same and the commentary 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.440
 you can also put minecraft in 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.690
 added 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.580
 there no need to restart the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.540
 boxing that's what's the advantage of the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.550
 life 6 I'll put you in annotations 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.470
 link to which you explain how 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.570
 avoid typing your ip but all 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.770
 simply an address that ends for 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.330
 a loan hd point free.fr so I you 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.190
 wish a good evening 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.150
 finally good day I do not know who 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.300
 so watch this video anyway 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.300
