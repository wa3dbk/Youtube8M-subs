00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.940
 welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.830
 computer chips 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 It can be a long time since the last one can be there 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.639
 The consequence was simply that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.279
 Among other things, we are on the gamescom track 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.680
 and there was, among other trainz 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.310
 Simulator 2015 presented 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.289
 What's new is what's better and what's that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.910
 Everything can or offers 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.910
 We took a closer look 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.500
 train simulator shifting it's about time 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.809
 again as far as a new version of the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.540
 Trailers is appeared the train 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.280
 simulator 2015 also in the new version 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 Of course you can drive trains again 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.360
 build a stretch and much more what you can 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.850
 already known from the previous version 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 So the question remains what is really 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.920
 new in train simulator 2015 the first one 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.839
 what is noticeable in the start menu is the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.489
 academy as the name suggests 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.890
 lets hide behind this 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.870
 feature a kind of lure school in the man 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 the function of individual signals the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.830
 Operation of different types and types 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 much more can be learned in principle 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.509
 So a tutorial in small parts 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.160
 in addition to this completely new feature there 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.390
 there are still some improvements in the new one 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.100
 train simulator 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.869
 even if the animated figures in the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.910
 unfortunately still play something strange 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.490
 they still have movement 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.170
 learned something so you meet now 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.759
 on the platform people the far 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.330
 More than just on the clock 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.300
 watch 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.250
 the weather was optimized as well 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.229
 you also have some flight simulators 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 in train simulator three-dimensional 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.259
 clouds 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 if you need them in a situation 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.920
 is, however, finally questionable 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.959
 you should rather be on the rails 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.940
 and focus on the signals 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.950
 sky and the differences are only 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.750
 marginal 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.160
 otherwise have menu as well 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.110
 stretch editor light optical 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.940
 Changes on the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.620
 function and operation in the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.120
 essential to the predecessor 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.790
 Owner of previous version received 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.310
 automatically and free of charge the update 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.910
 the transporter 2015 with the new ones 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.770
 features 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.010
 So why should you choose the new one? 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.770
 Buy jetta because you actually save 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.660
 Can when buying train simulator 2015 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.190
 in the standard edition for just under 30 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.590
 You get three different euros 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.660
 addons stretch when you look at them 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.980
 individually, each would buy just under 30 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.890
 would cost euro 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.810
 the scope of delivery of the train simulator 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.300
 In 2015, the tracks include new york new 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.020
 haven munich garmisch partenkirchen and 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.459
 discos mail a london peterborough 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.590
 each with appropriate rolling stock 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.920
 as well as a completely new train 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.840
 hitachi 801 making the tracks and trains 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.120
 visually a very positive impression 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.739
 but in matters close to reality and the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.370
 operation is still significantly after air 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.650
 above 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.390
 In addition, unfortunately, some switches and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.610
 buttons in the driver's cab just nice 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.709
 not to be seen but to use 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.050
 Well and then there are still missed 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.090
 extremely species in the station kings cross 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.299
 namely during a career 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.190
 scenarios crowds in front of the train 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.709
 the rails during a few tracks 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.489
 continues to move in with open doors 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.500
 that should urgently be improved 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.660
 Let's come to the conclusion of the graphic 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.880
 got in train simulator 2015 in the 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.650
 not much done compared to the predecessor 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.440
 Compared to other train simulators 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.090
 the graphics are very good overall though 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.940
 rather average to good 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.040
 For example, the textures are despite 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.579
 highest setting often blurry 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.560
 We therefore have 65 out of 100 points 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.510
 the sound at the included 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.459
 Vehicles and stretch is good though 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.500
 also not perfect because partially 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.209
 sneak nasty grind in a 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.610
 or you have the feeling that the 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.500
 volume was not adjusted properly 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.140
 because the sound but not otherwise 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.390
 Bad parents are there for 75 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.709
 has 100 points in terms of gameplay 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.299
 hardly anything was done 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.980
 you still drive trains 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.049
 different stretches while being meticulous 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.090
 Make sure you do not have to 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.430
 the controls and the fast drive are fast 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.620
 scope of functions are quite neat 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.440
 could be on some trains but still 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.910
 be better and more extensive 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.550
 in total there is the gameplay of us 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.520
 So 65 of 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.300
 scores 55 points in terms of 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.150
 realism 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.070
 Although the train simulator 2015 offers the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.820
 possibility of train security systems too 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.010
 simulate 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.890
 however, you need expensive addons here 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.480
 that is frightening and moves too 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.100
 supplied material with this 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.810
 security system 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.700
 however, it quickly hits his 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.200
 borders and not many 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.170
 operable switches fall during 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.420
 Rolling stock negative for the mission 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.010
 there are 60 points from us 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.630
 varied and in different 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.000
 difficulty levels divided 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.560
 So you have almost always in easy mission 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.510
 green while in difficult 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.540
 missions well on signals and 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.880
 instructions should pay attention to the ki on the 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.560
 railroads master most of their job 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.540
 perfect with one here again 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.550
 experienced train with open doors from 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.100
 Station King's Cross A field that is 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.960
 but more of an exception 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.880
 The passengers seem quite strange 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.660
 still gets on the platforms 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.950
 ki 65 out of 100 points of the monitor trainz 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.380
 brings the atmosphere of the 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.200
 railway operations well over it 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.030
 graphic sound but also the fact that 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.430
 through some moving animations 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.520
 train simulator 2015 breathed life 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.520
 There are 80 points for this 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.790
 In total, kate winslet 2015 will come 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.550
 on 66 points what do you say to this dlc 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.040
 Politics at the train simulator in the apron 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.710
 was already discussed about it violently 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.990
 under the preview video from gamescom 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.400
 there were some advocates as well 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.770
 many many opponents 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.360
 Write your opinion on it below 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.890
 in the comments would be glad if 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.460
 we'll discuss it a bit 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.919
 could 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.900
 otherwise, as always praise and criticism applies 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.760
 are of course always in the comments 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.490
 desired if you liked it last 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.260
 happy to thumb up there if you 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.930
 always want to stay up to date follows us 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.850
 on facebook follows us on google + 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.169
 I hope we look forward to the next one 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.169
 bye bye
