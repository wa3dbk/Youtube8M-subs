00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.150
 the pasture popularly known as 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.610
 zacatal owes its name to lacking 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.639
 trees and their predominant vegetation are 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.980
 the pasture is usually located 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.160
 after a maternal hair ojito and gives 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 step to a temperate mountain forest is 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.040
 say is an intermediary between both 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.190
 ecosystems develops among the 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.980
 1,100 and 2,500 meters above the level of 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.850
 sea ​​in regions with temperatures that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.079
 They range between 12 and 20 degrees Celsius 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.929
 it presents few rains after its 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.929
 drought season is long hard to 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:45.809
 six to nine months the precipitation 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:50.120
 Annual average is between 3,000 to 6,000 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.460
 millimeters with nine to six dry months 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.219
 with a dry steppe climate and desert 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.140
 its distribution is uniform throughout 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.400
 the year but its highest level of 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.740
 concurrency is in spring and autumn in 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.320
 regarding the thermal amplitudes these 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.780
 they increase towards the west that is to 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.450
 as we move away from the sea and so 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.120
 much of the moderating influence that the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.460
 water exerts on the temperature 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.370
 It is estimated that this ecosystem covers 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.350
 10% of the country can be found in 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.750
 states of aguascalientes chihuahua 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.920
 durango guanajuato hidalgo jalisco 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.950
 oaxaca puebla san luis potosí tlaxcala and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.950
 Zacatecas 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.740
 its typical vegetation includes numerous 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:47.170
 cactáceas this legume grasses 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.109
 type of vegetation is dominated 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.439
 by grasses or grasses shrubs 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.479
 and trees are scarce they are scattered and 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.370
 they only concentrate on the margins of 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.620
 rivers and streams 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.490
 within this abyss we can find 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:09.460
 three types of vegetation steppe prairie 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.460
 grammy nosa and vega de sipe thanks 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.620
 as for the fauna this is 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.370
 predominant herbivore and possess habits 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.220
 diggers runners and jumpers with 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.560
 a perfect adoption to the medium without 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.500
 However, most of them concentrate on 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.879
 lagoons and bathes 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.660
 we found a lot of insects 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.989
 birds like the duck the gallareta the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.140
 stork damaging birds of prey like the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.670
 alcohol the chimango and the owl of 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.450
 vizcachas 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.050
 rodents hare vizcacha and carnivores 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.420
 like for example the wildcat fox and 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.580
 the puma that practically today 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.940
 they find missing 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.250
 its common fauna groups royal eagles 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.920
 pronghorn falcons prairie experts 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.920
 and safe deer among others 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.870
 this topic is also the greatest 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.489
 importance for the country since the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.709
 pastures served as resources 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.560
 forages essential in livestock breeding 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.920
 the tail and for the expansive activity 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.459
 agricultural since the late 19th century and 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.769
 early twentieth century for it also 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.840
 you could say it's one of the biomes 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.989
 more modified by the action of the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.260
 name through cattle breeding 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:36.200
 cultivation of cereals and oilseeds and the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.450
 installation of large cities question 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.290
 which practically do not exist areas 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.000
 currently with original formations 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.760
 this is because the plant cover 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.340
 has been replaced by crops or 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.410
 modified for grazing if 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.720
 we observe today this region we see 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.599
 species of pasture trees and shrubs 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.319
 but all of them have been implanted 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.319
 by man
