00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
gets unlocked at level 40 and is

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.580 
gets unlocked at level 40 and is
relatively<00:00:11.360> easy<00:00:11.720> if<00:00:11.930> you<00:00:12.050> approach<00:00:12.349> it<00:00:12.559> from

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
relatively easy if you approach it from

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.919 
relatively easy if you approach it from
the<00:00:12.769> right<00:00:13.010> angle<00:00:13.360> now<00:00:14.360> I<00:00:14.389> could<00:00:14.690> have<00:00:14.720> just

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
the right angle now I could have just

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.899 
the right angle now I could have just
run<00:00:15.139> back<00:00:15.290> and<00:00:15.559> got<00:00:15.679> my<00:00:15.860> car<00:00:16.070> here<00:00:16.340> but<00:00:16.579> it's

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:16.909 
run back and got my car here but it's

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.909 
run back and got my car here but it's
really<00:00:16.999> not<00:00:17.509> necessary<00:00:17.570> because<00:00:18.320> it's<00:00:18.739> a

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:18.919 
really not necessary because it's a

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.589 
really not necessary because it's a
really<00:00:19.339> short<00:00:19.369> run<00:00:19.759> to<00:00:19.909> where<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.179> truck<00:00:20.419> is

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
really short run to where the truck is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.169 
really short run to where the truck is
if<00:00:21.499> you<00:00:21.829> do<00:00:22.009> have<00:00:22.039> your<00:00:22.460> car<00:00:22.609> with<00:00:22.789> you<00:00:22.909> just

if you do have your car with you just

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.460 
if you do have your car with you just
drive<00:00:23.480> around<00:00:23.659> the<00:00:23.869> right<00:00:24.050> side<00:00:24.079> of<00:00:24.409> those

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
drive around the right side of those

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.380 
drive around the right side of those
containers<00:00:24.890> there<00:00:25.220> and<00:00:25.429> you'll<00:00:25.759> wind<00:00:26.089> up<00:00:26.239> in

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
containers there and you'll wind up in

the same spot that I'm running to now

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.390 
the same spot that I'm running to now
you're<00:00:33.530> gonna<00:00:33.620> pull<00:00:33.860> out<00:00:33.980> your<00:00:34.130> assault

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
between the containers shoot the two

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
guys standing by the truck and hop in

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.660 
guys standing by the truck and hop in
and<00:00:41.710> don't<00:00:42.710> touch<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.920> gas<00:00:43.220> or<00:00:43.400> anything

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
and don't touch the gas or anything

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.850 
and don't touch the gas or anything
until<00:00:43.880> after<00:00:44.060> you've<00:00:44.510> closed<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.780> door<00:00:45.110> you

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
until after you've closed the door you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.050 
until after you've closed the door you
want<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.100> turn<00:00:46.220> a<00:00:46.250> little<00:00:46.670> bit<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.030> left

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
want to turn a little bit to the left

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.700 
want to turn a little bit to the left
first<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:47.660> that<00:00:47.690> you're<00:00:47.930> at<00:00:48.020> a<00:00:48.050> better<00:00:48.320> angle

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
first so that you're at a better angle

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.830 
first so that you're at a better angle
and<00:00:48.890> have<00:00:49.010> more<00:00:49.340> momentum<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.000> move<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:50.480> SUV

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
and have more momentum to move that SUV

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.410 
and have more momentum to move that SUV
out<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.290> way<00:00:57.610> and<00:00:58.610> then<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:58.940> just<00:00:59.120> have<00:00:59.270> to

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
out of the way and then you just have to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.569 
out of the way and then you just have to
wait<00:00:59.540> for<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.810> gate<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.170> open<00:01:00.200> and<00:01:00.590> follow<00:01:01.460> the

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
wait for the gate to open and follow the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.280 
wait for the gate to open and follow the
GPS<00:01:01.910> until<00:01:02.390> after<00:01:02.780> you've<00:01:02.930> crossed<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
GPS until after you've crossed the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:21.010 
GPS until after you've crossed the
bridge

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.810 

once<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.200> across<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.650> bridge<00:01:22.860> take<00:01:23.610> your

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
once you're across the bridge take your

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.910 
once you're across the bridge take your
first<00:01:24.120> left<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.630> follow<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.350> straight<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
first left and follow it straight up to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.990 
first left and follow it straight up to
the<00:01:26.010> train<00:01:26.220> tracks<00:01:31.190> then<00:01:32.190> turn<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.760> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the train tracks then turn right and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.740 
the train tracks then turn right and
follow<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.870> GPS<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.410> rest<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
follow the GPS the rest of the way the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
follow the GPS the rest of the way the
reason<00:01:37.050> why<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.290> took<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.620> route<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.010> because

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
reason why we took this route is because

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.890 
reason why we took this route is because
the<00:01:38.460> GPS<00:01:38.850> was<00:01:39.120> going<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.360> take<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.660> through<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the GPS was going to take you through a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900 
the GPS was going to take you through a
more<00:01:40.140> treacherous<00:01:40.530> route<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.280> less<00:01:41.640> room

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
more treacherous route with less room

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.480 
more treacherous route with less room
for<00:01:41.940> error<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:43.500> way<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.979> more<00:01:44.370> of<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
for error and this way is more of a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.749 
for error and this way is more of a
straight<00:01:44.790> forward<00:01:45.060> path<00:01:45.390> with<00:01:45.660> fewer<00:01:45.990> turns

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.240 

and<00:01:54.229> from<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.440> it's<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.830> about<00:01:56.009> avoiding

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and from here it's just about avoiding

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
and from here it's just about avoiding
stupid<00:01:56.790> drivers<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.300> SUVs<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.229> never

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
stupid drivers and SUVs and you never

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
stupid drivers and SUVs and you never
want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.800> hit<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.250> SUVs<00:02:02.820> head-on<00:02:03.240> if

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
want to hit one of those SUVs head-on if

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.600 
want to hit one of those SUVs head-on if
you<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.259> hit<00:02:04.410> them<00:02:04.650> try<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.430> the

you have to hit them try going for the

you have to hit them try going for the

back end if you hit them head-on
nine<00:02:08.459> times<00:02:08.820> out<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> ten<00:02:09.330> you're<00:02:09.929> dead

another thing that I try to do is give

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.770 
another thing that I try to do is give
the<00:02:21.400> other<00:02:21.519> cars<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.060> road<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.239> little<00:02:22.450> bump

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
the other cars on the road a little bump

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.080 
the other cars on the road a little bump
to<00:02:22.959> make<00:02:23.170> them<00:02:23.349> spin<00:02:23.650> out<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.040> possibly<00:02:24.519> slow

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
to make them spin out and possibly slow

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.850 
to make them spin out and possibly slow
down<00:02:25.330> or<00:02:25.569> take<00:02:25.750> out<00:02:25.900> any<00:02:26.080> vehicles<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.709> might
