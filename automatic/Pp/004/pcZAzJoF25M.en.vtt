00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
that's not leave me in space depending

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.470

on<00:03:45.769> how<00:03:45.980> much<00:03:46.489> sprout<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:46.910> like<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.330> can

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
on how much sprout you like you can

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.789 
on how much sprout you like you can
obviously<00:03:47.690> put<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.930> lot<00:03:47.989> more<00:03:48.110> than<00:03:48.410> this<00:03:48.560> but<00:03:49.450> I

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
obviously put a lot more than this but I

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.990 
obviously put a lot more than this but I
think<00:03:51.799> this<00:03:52.099> is<00:03:52.190> about<00:03:52.400> right<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.790> get<00:03:52.910> the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
think this is about right to get the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.680 
think this is about right to get the
right<00:03:53.150> level<00:03:53.329> of<00:03:53.480> white<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:56.120> there's<00:03:56.480> the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
right level of white so there's the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.339 
right level of white so there's the
sprouts<00:03:58.299> then<00:03:59.299> we<00:03:59.450> have<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:01.040> spring
