00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello and welcome to this news 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.980
 video for once we are post 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.180
 diot so I'm jérôme not the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.670
 photographers and trainer in 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.200
 photography and today I'm going to 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.030
 present a tutorial a little bit 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.219
 particular since it addresses the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 times to photographers rather 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.150
 wedding and model photographers 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 rather the wedding patterns but not 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.350
 necessarily for the photography in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.960
 the occurrence it will be to see 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.420
 how to ride in a vehicle with 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.960
 a wedding dress so for that I 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.399
 asked marion kindly my 6t 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 and maybe it'll even be sooner 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.680
 reverse so marion hello hello and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.930
 so we'll see how to climb to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.399
 inside the vehicle 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.690
 so I'll first explain and then 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.350
 marion will demonstrate 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.730
 so here we are lucky because 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.440
 the opening is still rather wide 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.539
 we took care of advanced the wake at 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.780
 maximum for that the maximum of place 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.820
 inside and marion is going to have to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.789
 make up for it drag the flap in front of her 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.090
 then we will have to slip into 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 rear inside the car 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.260
 stepped inside and a 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.939
 times the feet raised pivoting for 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.950
 bring in the knees then I 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.570
 will come to help him to finalize so at his 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.619
 finished going inside the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.450
 trailing inside the vehicle 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.460
 yeah it's pretty simple but you have to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.210
 well respect the steps so we go 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.650
 ask marion to show us so 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.689

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.240

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.200

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.790

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.390

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030
