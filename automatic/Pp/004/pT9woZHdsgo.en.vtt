on<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> school<00:00:32.160> project<00:00:32.219> right<00:00:32.879> now<00:00:33.289> and<00:00:34.289> i

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
on a school project right now and i

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.229 
on a school project right now and i
thought<00:00:35.160> i<00:00:35.429> might<00:00:35.609> as<00:00:35.760> well<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> vlog

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
thought i might as well do a vlog

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.729 
thought i might as well do a vlog
because<00:00:36.539> i've<00:00:36.809> wanted<00:00:37.019> to<00:00:37.170> make<00:00:37.289> video<00:00:37.620> i<00:00:37.679> just

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
because i've wanted to make video i just

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.720 
because i've wanted to make video i just
have<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.100> had<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.429> time<00:00:38.899> or<00:00:40.460> really<00:00:41.460> i'm

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
have really had the time or really i'm

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.040 
have really had the time or really i'm
not<00:00:41.909> gonna<00:00:41.999> say<00:00:42.179> I'm<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> had<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> time<00:00:42.870> because

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
not gonna say I'm I had the time because

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.779 
not gonna say I'm I had the time because
I've<00:00:43.320> obviously<00:00:43.949> been<00:00:44.249> doing<00:00:44.550> other<00:00:44.699> things

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
I've obviously been doing other things

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.029 
I've obviously been doing other things
and<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.269> chose<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> spend<00:00:45.899> my<00:00:46.050> time<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.289> those<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and I chose to spend my time on those so

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.279 
and I chose to spend my time on those so
I<00:00:47.309> guess<00:00:47.999> that's<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.359> reasoning<00:00:48.780> behind<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
I guess that's the reasoning behind it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.959 
I guess that's the reasoning behind it
for<00:00:49.890> those<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.129> wondering<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.760> I'm<00:00:50.879> gonna

a set I personally have the vortex for

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.640 
a set I personally have the vortex for
the<00:03:54.940> xbox<00:03:55.269> 360<00:03:55.750> they<00:03:55.959> work<00:03:56.109> really<00:03:56.349> well<00:03:56.470> for

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
the xbox 360 they work really well for

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.129 
the xbox 360 they work really well for
most<00:03:57.310> situations<00:03:57.669> they<00:03:58.239> have<00:03:58.419> some<00:03:58.720> sticks

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
most situations they have some sticks

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.140 
most situations they have some sticks
specifically<00:04:00.129> meant<00:04:00.340> for<00:04:00.370> sniping<00:04:00.849> or<00:04:01.030> so

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
specifically meant for sniping or so

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.969 
specifically meant for sniping or so
specifically<00:04:01.900> my<00:04:02.019> for<00:04:02.229> close<00:04:02.379> quarters<00:04:02.590> I

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
specifically my for close quarters I

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.500 
specifically my for close quarters I
like<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.519> vortex<00:04:03.970> because<00:04:04.180> they're<00:04:04.329> really

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
like the vortex because they're really

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.059 
like the vortex because they're really
effective<00:04:04.930> all<00:04:05.049> around<00:04:05.379> so<00:04:05.739> that's

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
effective all around so that's

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.069 
effective all around so that's
definitely<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.489> good<00:04:06.639> option<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.690> they're

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
definitely a good option and they're

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.420 
definitely a good option and they're
really<00:04:08.229> cheap<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.650> think<00:04:08.799> they're<00:04:08.919> like<00:04:09.069> 13

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
really cheap I think they're like 13

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.780 
really cheap I think they're like 13
bucks<00:04:09.669> so<00:04:10.049> definitely<00:04:11.049> worth<00:04:11.229> picking<00:04:11.260> up

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
bucks so definitely worth picking up

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.699 
bucks so definitely worth picking up
