00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
work for me to stamp the balloon strings

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.129 
work for me to stamp the balloon strings
so<00:06:38.020> what<00:06:38.200> I<00:06:38.230> did<00:06:38.320> was<00:06:38.530> took<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.830> piece<00:06:39.070> of<00:06:39.100> thread

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
so what I did was took a piece of thread

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.080 
so what I did was took a piece of thread
I<00:06:40.169> just<00:06:40.439> tied<00:06:40.680> a<00:06:40.710> very<00:06:41.099> simple<00:06:41.580> knot<00:06:41.819> around

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
I just tied a very simple knot around

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.270 
I just tied a very simple knot around
the<00:06:42.479> balloon<00:06:42.810> and<00:06:43.110> then<00:06:43.650> now<00:06:43.800> I'm<00:06:43.889> popping

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
the balloon and then now I'm popping

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.100 
the balloon and then now I'm popping
them<00:06:44.430> up<00:06:44.580> with<00:06:44.969> some<00:06:45.240> foam<00:06:45.449> tape<00:06:45.479> kind<00:06:46.020> of

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
them up with some foam tape kind of

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.040 
them up with some foam tape kind of
clustering<00:06:46.680> them<00:06:46.979> up<00:06:47.219> into<00:06:47.520> the<00:06:48.030> left<00:06:48.270> top

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
clustering them up into the left top

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.839 
clustering them up into the left top
corner<00:06:49.080> of<00:06:49.590> the<00:06:49.740> card<00:06:50.099> and<00:06:50.340> then<00:06:50.430> what<00:06:50.580> I'll<00:06:50.669> do

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:50.849 
corner of the card and then what I'll do

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:52.640 
corner of the card and then what I'll do
once<00:06:51.029> I<00:06:51.150> get<00:06:51.210> these<00:06:51.479> all<00:06:51.689> arranged<00:06:52.199> how<00:06:52.319> I<00:06:52.349> want

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
once I get these all arranged how I want

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.920 
once I get these all arranged how I want
them<00:06:52.800> to<00:06:52.830> go<00:06:53.069> pop<00:06:53.490> locked<00:06:53.939> and<00:06:54.180> loaded<00:06:54.270> with

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
them to go pop locked and loaded with

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.339 
them to go pop locked and loaded with
the<00:06:55.560> foam<00:06:55.949> tape<00:06:56.189> I'll<00:06:56.400> take<00:06:56.669> my<00:06:56.849> scissors<00:06:57.120> and

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
the foam tape I'll take my scissors and

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:01.010 
the foam tape I'll take my scissors and
I<00:06:58.349> will<00:06:58.560> trim<00:06:58.919> off<00:06:59.159> one<00:06:59.669> side<00:06:59.999> of<00:07:00.389> that<00:07:00.599> thread

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
I will trim off one side of that thread

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.649 
I will trim off one side of that thread
so<00:07:01.259> we<00:07:01.289> only<00:07:01.469> need<00:07:01.710> one<00:07:01.740> string<00:07:02.550> per<00:07:03.240> balloon

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:03.659 
so we only need one string per balloon

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:05.959 
so we only need one string per balloon
so<00:07:04.409> one<00:07:04.860> side<00:07:05.099> is<00:07:05.189> gonna<00:07:05.370> be<00:07:05.550> just<00:07:05.849> a<00:07:05.939> short

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969 
so one side is gonna be just a short

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:10.159 
so one side is gonna be just a short
little<00:07:07.400> tail<00:07:08.400> and<00:07:08.699> then<00:07:09.180> the<00:07:09.330> other<00:07:09.509> side<00:07:09.900> of

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
little tail and then the other side of

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:11.899 
little tail and then the other side of
the<00:07:10.319> thread<00:07:10.529> will<00:07:10.650> be<00:07:10.740> the<00:07:10.860> long<00:07:11.099> string

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909 
the thread will be the long string

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.480 
the thread will be the long string
that'll<00:07:12.300> go<00:07:12.479> into<00:07:12.719> Lila's<00:07:13.409> hands<00:07:13.919> and<00:07:14.129> we're

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
that'll go into Lila's hands and we're

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.309 
that'll go into Lila's hands and we're
gonna<00:07:14.639> hold<00:07:14.909> that<00:07:15.060> down<00:07:15.389> with<00:07:15.750> a<00:07:15.779> little<00:07:16.080> glue

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 
gonna hold that down with a little glue

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.379 
gonna hold that down with a little glue
dot<00:07:16.349> and<00:07:16.889> it<00:07:17.370> will<00:07:17.490> hold<00:07:17.639> perfectly<00:07:17.879> and<00:07:18.300> it

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
dot and it will hold perfectly and it

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.080 
dot and it will hold perfectly and it
looks<00:07:18.569> so<00:07:18.810> fun<00:07:19.229> having<00:07:19.889> these<00:07:20.189> actual<00:07:20.580> strings

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
looks so fun having these actual strings

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.990 
looks so fun having these actual strings
going<00:07:21.930> into<00:07:22.199> her<00:07:22.319> hand<00:07:22.699> so<00:07:23.699> here<00:07:23.879> I'm<00:07:23.969> just

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000

going into her hand so here I'm just
kind<00:07:24.330> of<00:07:24.360> gathering<00:07:24.870> them<00:07:25.020> up<00:07:25.169> and<00:07:25.439> seeing<00:07:26.129> how

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
kind of gathering them up and seeing how

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.559 
kind of gathering them up and seeing how
that<00:07:26.310> works<00:07:26.669> and<00:07:26.879> then<00:07:26.939> I'll<00:07:27.090> put<00:07:27.270> a<00:07:27.300> little

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:27.569 
that works and then I'll put a little

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.140 
that works and then I'll put a little
glue<00:07:27.750> dot<00:07:27.779> I<00:07:28.289> kind<00:07:28.949> of<00:07:29.039> roll<00:07:29.279> up<00:07:29.520> the<00:07:29.699> glue<00:07:29.939> dot

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
glue dot I kind of roll up the glue dot

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.969 
glue dot I kind of roll up the glue dot
in<00:07:30.330> my<00:07:30.509> hand<00:07:30.810> just<00:07:31.050> to<00:07:31.529> give<00:07:31.740> it<00:07:31.860> a<00:07:31.889> little

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 
in my hand just to give it a little

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.760 
in my hand just to give it a little
dimension<00:07:32.550> so<00:07:32.699> it's<00:07:32.849> thicker<00:07:33.330> and<00:07:33.689> it<00:07:34.169> goes

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770 
dimension so it's thicker and it goes

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.649 
dimension so it's thicker and it goes
well<00:07:35.039> with<00:07:35.099> the<00:07:35.370> foam<00:07:35.580> tape<00:07:35.849> kind<00:07:36.150> of<00:07:36.240> pops<00:07:36.479> it

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:36.659 
well with the foam tape kind of pops it

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.360 
well with the foam tape kind of pops it
off<00:07:36.839> of<00:07:37.020> the<00:07:37.139> card<00:07:37.409> and<00:07:37.650> then<00:07:38.099> I'll<00:07:38.219> add<00:07:38.339> a

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:38.370 
off of the card and then I'll add a

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.950 
off of the card and then I'll add a
little<00:07:38.520> bit<00:07:38.639> of<00:07:38.789> foam<00:07:38.969> tape<00:07:39.150> to<00:07:39.210> the<00:07:39.509> rest<00:07:39.810> of

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 
little bit of foam tape to the rest of

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.019 
little bit of foam tape to the rest of
her<00:07:40.139> body<00:07:40.349> and<00:07:40.770> then<00:07:41.189> you'll<00:07:41.310> see<00:07:41.520> here<00:07:41.789> how<00:07:41.969> we

her body and then you'll see here how we

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:44.629 
her body and then you'll see here how we
just<00:07:42.389> gather<00:07:42.659> the<00:07:42.930> strings<00:07:43.289> together<00:07:43.740> kind<00:07:44.580> of
