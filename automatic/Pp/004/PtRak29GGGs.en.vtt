then I'm going to brush it out again and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.190 
then I'm going to brush it out again and
I'm<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> start<00:01:56.700> Bantu<00:01:57.149> nodding<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.689> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
can see I left a little bit of space at

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.850 
can see I left a little bit of space at
the<00:02:00.119> top<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.600> don't<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> twist<00:02:01.320> really

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
at your scalp because as you twist

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
at your scalp because as you twist
around<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.670> tighter<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

tighter<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.200> really<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.860> hurt<00:02:08.009> so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
tighter and it's really going to hurt so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.840 
tighter and it's really going to hurt so
you<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> leave<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> little<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.479> of

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
pins because this is just going to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.450 
pins because this is just going to
unravel<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.840> me<00:02:26.020> if<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.320> don't<00:02:26.380> even<00:02:26.860> if<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.190> tuck
