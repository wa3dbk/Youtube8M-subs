00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
position so if we take the serve forward

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.920 
position so if we take the serve forward
past<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.490> trophy<00:01:11.970> now<00:01:12.479> there's<00:01:12.720> some<00:01:12.900> things

past the trophy now there's some things
we<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.470> improve<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> shoulder<00:01:14.549> turn

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we can improve with the shoulder turn

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
we can improve with the shoulder turn
here<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.960> racket<00:01:16.710> moves

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
here and with the way the racket moves

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
here and with the way the racket moves
but<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:18.930> is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
but what I really want to get into is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this drackett drop so that would be

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570 
this drackett drop so that would be
considered<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> trophy<00:01:22.950> position<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
considered the trophy position that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.890 
considered the trophy position that
needs<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> work<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.630> watch

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
is higher here but we really need to get

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.110 
is higher here but we really need to get
more<00:03:02.840> relaxation<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:03.829> if<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.790> player<00:03:05.090> can

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
more relaxation so if this player can

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.000 
more relaxation so if this player can
focus<00:03:05.660> on<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:06.110> he's<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.560> get<00:03:06.769> more

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
focus on that he's going to get more

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.860 
focus on that he's going to get more
power<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.610> way<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.819> do<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.690> do

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
power and the way to do that is to do

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.860 
power and the way to do that is to do
some<00:03:09.140> continuous<00:03:09.890> swings<00:03:10.370> with<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.569> hand

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
much lower on the racket not really to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.339 
much lower on the racket not really to
hit<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.269> ball<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:14.690> just<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.079> feel<00:03:15.319> that

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349
