collect all of it and does give a
similar<00:03:07.550> levels<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.120> that's<00:03:08.420> gonna<00:03:08.630> be

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
similar levels so that that's gonna be

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.720 
similar levels so that that's gonna be
good<00:03:08.960> for<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.770> whole<00:03:09.950> enchanting<00:03:10.430> session

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
good for the whole enchanting session

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.460 
good for the whole enchanting session
but<00:03:10.820> i<00:03:10.880> think<00:03:11.090> i'm<00:03:11.480> not<00:03:11.870> sure<00:03:12.050> if<00:03:12.140> i'm<00:03:12.230> correct

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
but i think i'm not sure if i'm correct

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.170 
but i think i'm not sure if i'm correct
here<00:03:12.860> when<00:03:12.980> i<00:03:13.010> say<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.460> but<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.700> think<00:03:13.790> what

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
here when i say this but I think what

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.730 
here when i say this but I think what
happens<00:03:14.570> is<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:14.990> it'll<00:03:15.230> show<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.440> how<00:03:15.590> many

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
happens is like it'll show you how many

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.440 
happens is like it'll show you how many
lapiz<00:03:15.950> lazuli<00:03:15.980> need<00:03:16.520> but<00:03:16.940> it's<00:03:17.060> actually<00:03:17.150> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
lapiz lazuli need but it's actually the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.840 
lapiz lazuli need but it's actually the
level<00:03:17.810> as<00:03:17.960> well<00:03:17.990> of<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.070> chance<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.670> for

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
level as well of the in chance so for

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.160 
level as well of the in chance so for
example<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.150> want<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.360> get<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.540> level<00:03:20.720> 1<00:03:20.990> inch

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
example you want to get a level 1 inch

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.960 
example you want to get a level 1 inch
an<00:03:21.350> you'll<00:03:21.470> need<00:03:21.590> one<00:03:21.800> lapiz<00:03:22.130> lazuli<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:22.880> if

an you'll need one lapiz lazuli but if

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.190 
an you'll need one lapiz lazuli but if
you<00:03:23.030> want<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.180> level<00:03:23.330> 50<00:03:23.720> inch<00:03:23.900> an<00:03:24.080> you're

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
you want to level 50 inch an you're

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.110 
you want to level 50 inch an you're
going<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.380> need<00:03:24.530> 50<00:03:25.220> lapis<00:03:25.490> lazuli<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:25.970> let's

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
going to need 50 lapis lazuli so let's

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.030 
going to need 50 lapis lazuli so let's
just<00:03:26.330> test<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.630> theory<00:03:26.960> in<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.560> second<00:03:27.950> once

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
just test that theory in a second once

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.010 
just test that theory in a second once
we<00:03:28.190> collect<00:03:28.430> all<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:28.910> should<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:29.960> a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
we collect all of this should be just a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.750 
we collect all of this should be just a
couple<00:03:30.200> more<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.650> i<00:03:30.890> met<00:03:31.070> put<00:03:31.250> splitters<00:03:31.610> back

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
couple more and i met put splitters back

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.070 
couple more and i met put splitters back
on<00:03:31.910> because<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.480> actually<00:03:32.600> really<00:03:32.810> weird

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
on because this is actually really weird

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.610 
on because this is actually really weird
for<00:03:33.290> me<00:03:33.350> using<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:34.370> default<00:03:35.200> control<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.380> just

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
the helmet we have we've got nothing

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.490 
the helmet we have we've got nothing
what<00:05:51.910> is<00:05:52.030> this<00:05:52.210> we<00:05:52.630> can<00:05:52.810> enchant<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.200> helmet

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
what is this we can enchant the helmet

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.950 
what is this we can enchant the helmet
because<00:05:53.590> it's<00:05:54.090> 80<00:05:55.090> that's<00:05:55.450> how<00:05:55.570> many<00:05:55.720> levels

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
because it's 80 that's how many levels

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.590 
because it's 80 that's how many levels
you<00:05:56.230> need<00:05:56.530> okay<00:05:57.310> but<00:05:57.460> only<00:05:57.640> uses<00:05:57.910> one<00:05:58.120> of<00:05:58.390> your

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
you need okay but only uses one of your

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.120 
you need okay but only uses one of your
levels<00:05:58.900> when<00:05:59.350> you're<00:05:59.500> in<00:05:59.560> Chancellor<00:05:59.890> but<00:06:00.040> I'm

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
levels when you're in Chancellor but I'm

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.050 
levels when you're in Chancellor but I'm
not<00:06:00.250> sure<00:06:00.340> that's<00:06:00.460> a<00:06:00.580> glitcher<00:06:00.850> but<00:06:00.940> that's

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
not sure that's a glitcher but that's

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.210 
not sure that's a glitcher but that's
actually<00:06:01.180> how<00:06:01.450> it<00:06:01.480> works<00:06:01.810> but<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.620> can<00:06:02.740> see<00:06:02.950> ya

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
actually how it works but you can see ya

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.740 
actually how it works but you can see ya
okay<00:06:03.640> so<00:06:03.700> we<00:06:03.880> can't<00:06:04.120> actually<00:06:04.210> get<00:06:04.510> it<00:06:04.630> because

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
okay so we can't actually get it because

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.780 
okay so we can't actually get it because
we<00:06:04.840> don't<00:06:04.960> have<00:06:05.020> enough<00:06:05.440> levels<00:06:05.830> okay<00:06:06.610> so<00:06:06.700> we

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
we don't have enough levels okay so we

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
we don't have enough levels okay so we
actually<00:06:06.910> need<00:06:07.120> to<00:06:07.180> get<00:06:07.330> more<00:06:07.420> levels<00:06:07.690> before

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
actually need to get more levels before

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.600 
actually need to get more levels before
we<00:06:07.990> can<00:06:08.110> chat<00:06:08.290> anything<00:06:08.560> else<00:06:08.680> I<00:06:08.740> guess<00:06:08.920> unless

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
we can chat anything else I guess unless

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.610 
we can chat anything else I guess unless
we<00:06:09.760> try<00:06:09.940> doing<00:06:10.240> something<00:06:10.510> like<00:06:10.630> the<00:06:10.840> pickaxe
