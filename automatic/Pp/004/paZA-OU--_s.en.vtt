and this is kind of like the bond part
of<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.889> just<00:04:55.889> to<00:04:56.040> see<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:58.229> can<00:04:58.380> just<00:04:58.560> place<00:04:58.860> it

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
of it just to see you can just place it

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.540 
of it just to see you can just place it
back<00:04:59.160> on<00:04:59.340> it's<00:05:00.060> really<00:05:00.270> simple<00:05:00.510> on<00:05:01.430> here<00:05:02.430> it

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
back on it's really simple on here it

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.460 
back on it's really simple on here it
has<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:03.030> handle<00:05:03.450> so<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.810> can<00:05:04.020> move<00:05:04.139> it<00:05:04.320> back

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
has the handle so you can move it back

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.460 
has the handle so you can move it back
and<00:05:04.680> forth<00:05:04.740> or<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.820> guess<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.840> open<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.260> brush

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
and forth or I guess to open the brush

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:15.500 
and forth or I guess to open the brush
so<00:05:07.889> you<00:05:08.010> can<00:05:08.190> clean<00:05:08.400> it<00:05:12.020> it's<00:05:13.020> back<00:05:13.229> in<00:05:13.440> safe<00:05:14.510> so

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
so you can clean it it's back in safe so

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.650 
so you can clean it it's back in safe so
basically<00:05:16.139> when<00:05:16.410> you<00:05:16.500> press<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:16.830> down<00:05:17.660> this

basically when you press it down this

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.409 
basically when you press it down this
whole<00:05:19.080> eyes<00:05:19.680> light<00:05:20.520> up<00:05:20.900> p<00:05:23.000> it's<00:05:24.000> pretty<00:05:24.180> much

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
whole eyes light up p it's pretty much

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.100 
whole eyes light up p it's pretty much
off<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.960> can<00:05:25.110> move<00:05:25.260> it<00:05:25.520> like<00:05:26.520> this<00:05:26.789> I<00:05:27.210> need<00:05:27.990> to

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
off you can move it like this I need to

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:36.350 
off you can move it like this I need to
move<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:29.600> yeah<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:32.390> that's<00:05:33.390> off<00:05:34.850> the<00:05:35.850> handle<00:05:36.240> is

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
move it yeah so that's off the handle is

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.010 
move it yeah so that's off the handle is
removable<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:37.220> as<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:39.300> can<00:05:39.390> see<00:05:39.570> on<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.780> sides

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020
