possibilities in the airframe and it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.110 
possibilities in the airframe and it
sounded<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.040> something<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
sounded like something that I think that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600 
sounded like something that I think that
would<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.360> cool<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.140> volunteered<00:00:38.010> he<00:00:38.370> went

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
would be cool so I volunteered he went

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
would be cool so I volunteered he went

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.490 
says the base trains both pilots that
haven't<00:01:47.430> flown<00:01:47.700> before<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.390> those<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.229> flew

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
haven't flown before and those that flew

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.370 
haven't flown before and those that flew
other<00:01:49.799> types<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.369> planes<00:01:50.640> they<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.240> train<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
other types of planes they also train a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.370 
other types of planes they also train a
new<00:01:52.860> rp8<00:01:53.310> pilots<00:01:53.820> from<00:01:53.909> scratch<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.229> our

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
new rp8 pilots from scratch and so our

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.780 
new rp8 pilots from scratch and so our
challenge<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> train<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.460> those

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
challenge is to train that those

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.780 
challenge is to train that those
brand-new<00:01:57.290> student<00:01:58.290> pilots<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> same

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
brand-new student pilots up to the same

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.580 
brand-new student pilots up to the same
level<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.570> experienced<00:02:01.110> pop<00:02:01.320> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
level as the experienced pop that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.690 
level as the experienced pop that
crosses<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.130> from<00:02:02.159> another<00:02:02.490> platform

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
crosses over from another platform

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.850 
crosses over from another platform
either<00:02:03.149> way<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> most<00:02:03.840> important<00:02:04.439> challenge

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
either way the most important challenge

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.340 
either way the most important challenge
is<00:02:05.040> doing<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.549> lot<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.939> things<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.450> once<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:07.020> think

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
is doing a lot of things at once I think

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.570 
is doing a lot of things at once I think
the<00:02:07.500> hardest<00:02:07.710> thing<00:02:07.829> about<00:02:07.979> opera<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the hardest thing about opera in the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.779 
the hardest thing about opera in the
platform<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
platform is that

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.500 
platform is that
there<00:02:10.750> are<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:11.829> many<00:02:11.950> different<00:02:12.310> forms<00:02:13.299> of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
there are so many different forms of

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.459 
there are so many different forms of
communication<00:02:14.200> coming<00:02:14.890> into<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> GCS<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.959> so

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
communication coming into a GCS and so

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.890 
communication coming into a GCS and so
it's<00:02:17.680> multitasking<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.269> biggest

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
it's multitasking is the biggest

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.099 
it's multitasking is the biggest
challenge<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:21.760> pilots<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.329> learn<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:22.810> they<00:02:22.989> go

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
challenge for pilots to learn as they go

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.050 
challenge for pilots to learn as they go
through<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.379> program<00:02:23.700> using<00:02:24.700> remotely

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
through the program using remotely

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.750 
through the program using remotely
piloted<00:02:25.390> planes<00:02:25.719> make<00:02:26.379> sense<00:02:26.739> they<00:02:27.129> cost<00:02:27.430> less

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
piloted planes make sense they cost less

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.970 
piloted planes make sense they cost less
and<00:02:27.819> use<00:02:28.209> fewer<00:02:28.569> resources<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.470> more

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
and use fewer resources and more

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.920 
and use fewer resources and more
importantly<00:02:30.489> they<00:02:30.700> keep<00:02:30.939> pilots<00:02:31.390> safe<00:02:31.629> on<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
importantly they keep pilots safe on the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.869 
importantly they keep pilots safe on the
ground<00:02:31.959> if<00:02:32.409> something<00:02:33.099> were<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> happen<00:02:33.400> to

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
ground if something were to happen to

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.580 
ground if something were to happen to
one<00:02:33.909> of<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.209> planes<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:35.019> pretty<00:02:35.260> much<00:02:35.409> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
one of the planes it's pretty much the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.899 
one of the planes it's pretty much the
way<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.889> future<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.430> know<00:02:36.519> there's<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.760> lot

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
way of the future you know there's a lot

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.250 
way of the future you know there's a lot
of<00:02:37.030> things<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.389> a<00:02:37.420> lot<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.569> capabilities<00:02:38.139> that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
of things and a lot of capabilities that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.679 
of things and a lot of capabilities that
this<00:02:38.409> aircraft<00:02:38.859> has<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:40.150> going<00:02:40.299> to<00:02:40.359> help<00:02:40.569> us

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
this aircraft has it's going to help us

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.720 
this aircraft has it's going to help us
in<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> future<00:02:41.079> so<00:02:41.439> I've<00:02:41.920> been<00:02:42.159> excited<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.609> be

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
in the future so I've been excited to be
