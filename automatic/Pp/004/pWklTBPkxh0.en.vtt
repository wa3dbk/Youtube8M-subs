00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
sharpen knives quickly so what we design

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.969 
sharpen knives quickly so what we design
what<00:01:31.719> we<00:01:31.810> want<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.140> do<00:01:32.229> when<00:01:32.380> we<00:01:32.500> design<00:01:32.799> this

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
what we want to do when we design this

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.859 
what we want to do when we design this
tool<00:01:33.189> is<00:01:33.429> create<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.030> knife<00:01:34.299> sharpener

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
tool is create a knife sharpener

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.169 
tool is create a knife sharpener
the<00:01:35.229> sharpen<00:01:35.649> knives<00:01:35.859> quickly<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:36.609> where<00:01:37.060> you

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
the sharpen knives quickly and where you

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.810 
the sharpen knives quickly and where you
got<00:01:37.329> a<00:01:37.359> good<00:01:37.630> result<00:01:37.810> every<00:01:38.500> time<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:39.729> we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
got a good result every time what we

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.029 
got a good result every time what we
came<00:01:39.969> up<00:01:40.149> with<00:01:40.359> is<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.869> flexible<00:01:41.380> belt<00:01:41.530> system

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
came up with is a flexible belt system

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.859 
came up with is a flexible belt system
and<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.369> what<00:01:42.609> we<00:01:42.729> have<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.770> tool<00:01:45.280> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and so what we have is a tool that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.719 
and so what we have is a tool that
powers<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:46.899> flexible<00:01:47.619> belt<00:01:47.799> why<00:01:48.159> flexible

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
powers a flexible belt why flexible

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.580 
powers a flexible belt why flexible
belts<00:01:49.030> because<00:01:49.630> that's<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.990> way<00:01:50.109> knives<00:01:50.380> were

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
belts because that's the way knives were

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.959 
belts because that's the way knives were
made<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:50.950> first<00:01:51.159> place<00:01:51.399> if<00:01:51.609> you<00:01:51.700> go<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.880> a

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
made in the first place if you go to a

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.029 
made in the first place if you go to a
knife<00:01:52.210> shop<00:01:52.479> they<00:01:52.719> shape<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.170> knife<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.619> then

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
knife shop they shape the knife and then

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.319

the<00:02:03.670> edge<00:02:03.789> on<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.479> we<00:02:04.600> thought<00:02:04.780> why<00:02:05.200> not<00:02:05.380> use

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
the edge on so we thought why not use

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.980 
the edge on so we thought why not use
that<00:02:05.590> same<00:02:06.039> system<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:07.060> been<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.240> huge

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
that same system it's been a huge

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.950 
that same system it's been a huge
advance<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.740> take

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
advance and take

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.350

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
to cut both go ahead and I think what we

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.270 
to cut both go ahead and I think what we

want to beat up the competition but they

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.650

grind<00:02:29.660> your<00:02:29.960> knife<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.410> way<00:02:30.560> where<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.890> get

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
grind your knife in a way where you get

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.150 
grind your knife in a way where you get
a<00:02:31.040> sound<00:02:31.250> like<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:33.410> think<00:02:33.650> grinding

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
a sound like and we think grinding

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.880 
a sound like and we think grinding
should<00:02:34.340> be<00:02:34.430> more<00:02:34.640> subtle<00:02:34.850> than<00:02:35.120> that

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
should be more subtle than that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.530 
should be more subtle than that
so<00:02:36.890> what's<00:02:37.520> what<00:02:37.850> we<00:02:37.940> really<00:02:38.150> have<00:02:38.300> is

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
so what's what we really have is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.210 
so what's what we really have is
flexible<00:02:38.990> belts<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> reason<00:02:39.800> they<00:02:39.950> work

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
flexible belts and the reason they work

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.340 
flexible belts and the reason they work
is<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.910> there's<00:02:41.090> been<00:02:41.270> huge<00:02:41.540> advancements

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
is that there's been huge advancements

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.410 
is that there's been huge advancements
in<00:02:42.470> industrial<00:02:43.070> abrasives<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.790> we've<00:02:44.180> taken

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
in industrial abrasives and we've taken

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.240 
in industrial abrasives and we've taken
advantage<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.680> instead<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.100> them

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
advantage of that but instead of them

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.430 
advantage of that but instead of them
being<00:02:46.610> on<00:02:46.790> huge<00:02:47.090> machines<00:02:47.540> they're<00:02:48.110> on<00:02:48.230> this

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
being on huge machines they're on this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.650 
being on huge machines they're on this
little<00:02:48.620> sharpener<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.760> simple<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.240> use<00:02:50.420> what

unit a 40 degree guide and a 50 degree

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.600 
unit a 40 degree guide and a 50 degree
guide<00:02:56.120> if<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> thin<00:02:57.500> bladed<00:02:58.460> knife

like a kitchen knife or a fillet knife
then<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.730> use<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.330> 40<00:03:02.630> degree<00:03:02.960> bevel<00:03:03.800> if<00:03:04.340> you

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
then you use the 40 degree bevel if you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.640 
then you use the 40 degree bevel if you
have<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> thick<00:03:05.270> bladed<00:03:05.660> knife<00:03:05.690> like<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.320> gut

hook or your pocket knife then you would

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.830 
hook or your pocket knife then you would
use<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.800> 50<00:03:10.130> degree<00:03:10.400> bill<00:03:10.580> what<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.540> do<00:03:11.690> is

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
use the 50 degree bill what you do is

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.150 
use the 50 degree bill what you do is
you<00:03:11.960> start<00:03:12.230> with<00:03:12.350> 220<00:03:13.250> grit<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:15.410> fits<00:03:15.890> right

get to the burr because we know it's
already<00:04:44.950> there<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:46.960> each<00:04:47.110> side

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.410 

all<00:04:54.190> we're<00:04:54.400> doing<00:04:54.670> here<00:04:54.850> is<00:04:54.970> honing<00:04:55.240> that

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
all we're doing here is honing that

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.470 
all we're doing here is honing that
night<00:04:55.890> right<00:04:56.890> at<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.250> edge<00:04:57.370> now<00:04:57.970> we're<00:04:58.360> just

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
night right at the edge now we're just

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:13.360 
night right at the edge now we're just
taking<00:04:58.690> away<00:04:58.990> all<00:04:59.200> this

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.830 

now<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.640> knife<00:05:14.850> would<00:05:15.120> go<00:05:15.270> through<00:05:15.600> any

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
now that knife would go through any

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.440 
now that knife would go through any
salmon<00:05:16.460> any<00:05:17.460> kind<00:05:17.700> of<00:05:17.760> fish<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:17.970> want<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.300> cut

salmon any kind of fish you want to cut

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.700 
salmon any kind of fish you want to cut
but<00:05:18.630> just<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.870> give<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.110> an<00:05:19.200> idea<00:05:19.320> of<00:05:19.590> its

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
but just to give you an idea of its

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.830 
but just to give you an idea of its
sharpness<00:05:20.010> you<00:05:20.910> can<00:05:21.060> see<00:05:21.240> how<00:05:21.330> it<00:05:21.390> just<00:05:21.480> shaves

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
sharpness you can see how it just shaves

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.820 
sharpness you can see how it just shaves
my<00:05:22.080> arm<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:23.370> really<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.440> get<00:05:25.440> rid<00:05:25.620> of<00:05:25.710> that

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
my arm and really that get rid of that

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.270 
my arm and really that get rid of that
DNA<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:26.730> took<00:05:27.030> what<00:05:27.450> a<00:05:27.660> couple<00:05:28.050> minutes

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
DNA that took what a couple minutes

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.830 
DNA that took what a couple minutes
that's<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.430> same<00:05:29.730> process<00:05:30.240> for<00:05:30.270> every<00:05:30.660> night

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
that's the same process for every night

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.400 
that's the same process for every night
it's<00:05:31.380> super<00:05:31.740> sharper<00:05:32.510> so<00:05:33.510> how<00:05:33.720> often<00:05:34.170> would

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
it's super sharper so how often would

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.400 
it's super sharper so how often would
you<00:05:35.180> sharpen<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.300> knife<00:05:36.330> like<00:05:36.750> this<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:37.020> fillet

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
you sharpen a knife like this a fillet

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.880 
you sharpen a knife like this a fillet
knife

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
knife

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.270 
knife
well<00:05:38.630> it's<00:05:39.630> gonna<00:05:39.900> sound<00:05:40.140> funny<00:05:40.260> but<00:05:40.620> as<00:05:40.710> often

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
well it's gonna sound funny but as often

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.520 
well it's gonna sound funny but as often
as<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:41.550> needs<00:05:41.760> it<00:05:41.910> so<00:05:41.940> if<00:05:42.540> you<00:05:42.780> started<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.380> get

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
as it needs it so if you started to get

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.380 
as it needs it so if you started to get
unhappy<00:05:43.920> with<00:05:44.280> how<00:05:44.430> that<00:05:44.490> knife<00:05:44.820> was<00:05:45.000> cutting

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
unhappy with how that knife was cutting

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.940 
unhappy with how that knife was cutting
then<00:05:45.810> I<00:05:45.840> wouldn't<00:05:46.290> go<00:05:46.380> through<00:05:46.560> that<00:05:46.740> first

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
then I wouldn't go through that first
