00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.220
 over many horses people is the topic 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.829
 a serum tiresome topic statistics 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.780
 According to 80 percent or more 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.030
 everything would not have or at all 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.790
 partly not because of that we have from 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.980
 Horse inside.com decided on a video 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.659
 to do the ambitious too 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.629
 to show laity 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.850
 fits my whopping or not on which 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.399
 Points must pay special attention and 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.379
 which side types fit for mine 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.280
 theoretically best 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.790
 we were able to stay here 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.700
 Eberhard knows 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.270
 he also knows the cynical author 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.950
 art teaching a currently published 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.159
 Huawei's latte is over 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.310
 15 years and is known for classic 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.080
 horsemanship 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.880
 have fun 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 First you brought the saddle and the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.010
 Passion items 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.680
 that you are asking zwiesel that 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.479
 behind zwiesel or the sa bi trans 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.900
 moving up the suspension 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.470
 has the advantage that there first evil 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.450
 can not push so no one 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.880
 case here can arise the disadvantage 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 if you are in the springsattel 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.400
 uses wear relatively fast 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.280
 so he would have for and resources or for 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.710
 Hiker note suitable where the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.340
 Lock is not overused 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.950
 because it can only be charged to a limited extent 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.950
 rear part of the last group here 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.299
 have in the breast 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.060
 this time is actually 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.420
 resilient part and still resilient 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.310
 this is partly from bow 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.310
 who does not drop too steep yet 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.540
 the parts are the back too 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.489
 different pain sensitive 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.980
 this part here the scapula 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.480
 globally it is highly sensitive to pain 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.660
 may therefore during the movement 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.530
 not abut the saddle forward 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.930
 the radius of movement of this cartilage it 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.810
 about up to three inches 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.440
 the saddle comes but wants to 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.510
 horses almost through that first time up 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.960
 put on the horse and check the series 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.280
 after some criticism the first one 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.610
 criterion and the satellite 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.560
 three fingers over the again completely 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.700
 the reason is that the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.760
 load on claim or strong 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.980
 forward movement does not matter if not with the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.519
 there continue the spine in 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.700
 contact come second criterion 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.700
 i have to be charged when said 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.690
 continue to sit on the front here with the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.880
 hand under the pillow still light 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.720
 The contact can start from the top 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.920
 The edge of it is a little less than 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.569
 at the bottom of the child this is 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.390
 with me here the tree ends 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.200
 So yes the saddle slightly more contact 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.200
 as up here 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.269
 that means in this case over the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.340
 Papis had to push too close that pushes 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.069
 horse in full behind the back because it 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.530
 the upright of the pik has no place 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.510
 and push away the saddle is the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.829
 sentence 4 is the anatomy of 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.250
 horses far enough 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:03.099
 then the middle of the sentence remains over 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.400
 the middle of the spine lie here 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.040
 through the collection 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.250
 slight friction occurred 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.709
 when the couple maybe if 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.709
 I was on the sets but then concluded when 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.650
 the saddle is an unplanned movement 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.680
 There is no pressure from there 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.259
 but indicates that the horse 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.860
 to have not quite to the saddle to 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.860
 Rande come
