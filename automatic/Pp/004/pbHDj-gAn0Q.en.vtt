00:00:05.448 --> 00:00:12.448
 Prepare PE that will be the ceiling thread. This time is Dyneema 0.4. 

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:22.334
 Let Lilian pass through. 

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:37.902
 Make two round knots. I will not tighten here. 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:52.729
 We will vise with PE 0.8. 

00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:32.853
 Because it is Dyneema, 15 times of knitting are necessary. 

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:45.616
 One final match 

00:01:49.632 --> 00:02:08.632
 Tie the end of the ceiling thread into the ring of the final knot again. 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:40.919
 Pass the PE in the same direction to the knot made in advance. 

00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:59.904
 I usually take time and effort because I have disconnected from the vice. 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:45.509
 Prepare 3 threads and tighten them to the bottom. 

00:03:50.456 --> 00:04:15.456
 Make a tie in the same way. 

00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:31.743
 The ceiling thread tightens the wad to fix the knot. 

00:05:32.748 --> 00:05:41.748
 The extra thread is cut off and the braiding is complete. 

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:59.459
 There is no need for this braiding, but if it is marked it is easy to identify when adjusting. 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:10.900
 It is also easy to adjust the length if you mark on the main line. 

00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:30.418
 The tape is pasted to make it easy to understand if the knitting slips. 

00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:39.397
 Lilian usually stops with a lasso as usual. 

00:06:43.513 --> 00:06:50.513
 Now let's apply the load with a plastic bottle. 

00:06:52.395 --> 00:07:00.395
 It is 500g. 

00:07:00.807 --> 00:07:09.807
 It is 850g. 

00:07:10.438 --> 00:07:18.438
 It is 1000g. 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:29.320
 It is 1350g, but it's still fine. 

00:07:31.082 --> 00:07:40.082
 I will live 1500g. 

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:55.416
 I do not need more strength than this. 

00:07:54.488 --> 00:08:03.488
 I'm not slipping at all, and I can not escape Lilian.
