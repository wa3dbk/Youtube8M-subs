00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.060 
out of control
I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.990> drivers<00:01:19.410> are<00:01:19.530> showing<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.800> lot<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I think the drivers are showing a lot of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.930 
I think the drivers are showing a lot of
discipline<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.759> should

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
discipline right now we just should

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.040 
discipline right now we just should
