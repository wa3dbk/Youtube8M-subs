00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.790 
called dungeon heroes you can go watch
my<00:00:21.480> review<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.900> see<00:00:21.930> how<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> play<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.619> game

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
my review to see how to play this game

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.429 
my review to see how to play this game
its<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> 2<00:00:23.070> player<00:00:23.430> dungeon<00:00:23.939> deduction<00:00:24.570> game<00:00:24.779> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
its a 2 player dungeon deduction game so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.779 
its a 2 player dungeon deduction game so
if<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.650> doesn't<00:00:26.130> make<00:00:26.189> any<00:00:26.369> sense<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.699> you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
if that doesn't make any sense to you

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.220 
if that doesn't make any sense to you
you<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> go<00:00:27.300> watch<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.539> review<00:00:28.050> first

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
you need to go watch that review first

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
you need to go watch that review first
but<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> very<00:00:29.099> small<00:00:29.279> expansion

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
but this is for a very small expansion

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.299 
but this is for a very small expansion
the<00:00:30.630> Dragon<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> damsel<00:00:31.859> wait<00:00:32.540> or<00:00:34.309> lord

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the Dragon and the damsel wait or lord

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.119 
the Dragon and the damsel wait or lord
of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.489> undead<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:36.420> expansions<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.230> ok

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
of the undead two expansions in one ok

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520 
of the undead two expansions in one ok
now<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.879> guess<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:40.170> expansion

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
now I guess it's really one expansion

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.229 
now I guess it's really one expansion
with<00:00:40.829> different<00:00:41.129> modules<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.760> use<00:00:41.969> both

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
with different modules you can use both

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
with different modules you can use both
modules<00:00:42.480> very<00:00:43.230> simple<00:00:43.710> add<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.550> game

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
modules very simple add some to the game

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.369 
modules very simple add some to the game
for<00:00:45.480> those<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.840> how<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> game<00:00:46.140> works

heroes<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.890> dungeon<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.790> notice

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
heroes in the dungeon but if you notice

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.750 
heroes in the dungeon but if you notice
each<00:03:15.329> one<00:03:15.719> of<00:03:15.750> these<00:03:15.930> has<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.500> number<00:03:17.159> on<00:03:17.340> them

each one of these has a number on them

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
each one of these has a number on them
and<00:03:17.909> that's<00:03:18.060> how<00:03:18.180> much<00:03:18.329> experience<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:19.170> have

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
and that's how much experience you have

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.339 
and that's how much experience you have
to<00:03:19.409> use<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.099> let's<00:03:20.609> say<00:03:20.790> for<00:03:21.000> example<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:22.290> one

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
to use so let's say for example this one

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.459 
to use so let's say for example this one
here<00:03:22.739> costs<00:03:23.010> 16<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.849> I<00:03:24.359> have<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.629> trap<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.079> has

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:25.469 
here costs 16 and I have a trap that has

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.589 
here costs 16 and I have a trap that has
a<00:03:25.500> value<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.859> 6<00:03:26.189> I<00:03:26.489> have<00:03:26.849> another<00:03:27.030> trap<00:03:27.390> that's

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
a value of 6 I have another trap that's

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.780 
a value of 6 I have another trap that's
a<00:03:27.689> value<00:03:28.049> of<00:03:28.079> 4<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.739> I've<00:03:29.129> killed<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.549> dragon

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
a value of 4 and I've killed the dragon

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.569 
a value of 4 and I've killed the dragon
48<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:30.569> that's<00:03:30.720> 18<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.920> enough<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.400> can

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
48 so that's 18 I have enough and I can

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.280 
48 so that's 18 I have enough and I can
spend<00:03:32.849> those<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.239> buy<00:03:33.390> those<00:03:33.659> items<00:03:33.900> and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
spend those to buy those items and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.229 
spend those to buy those items and
that's<00:03:34.890> how<00:03:35.040> those<00:03:35.280> work<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:35.849> these<00:03:35.939> are<00:03:36.000> very

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
that's how those work so these are very

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.119 
that's how those work so these are very
two<00:03:36.480> small<00:03:36.780> expansions<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.319> can<00:03:37.470> use<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:37.950> or

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
two small expansions you can use one or

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.210 
two small expansions you can use one or
both<00:03:38.760> even<00:03:39.750> though<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.170> Dragons<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.799> pain<00:03:41.010> in

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
both even though the Dragons a pain in

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.660 
both even though the Dragons a pain in
the<00:03:41.250> butt<00:03:41.430> creature<00:03:41.879> I<00:03:42.889> think<00:03:43.889> adding<00:03:44.549> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
the butt creature I think adding the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.020 
the butt creature I think adding the
damn<00:03:44.909> Celyn<00:03:45.299> certainly<00:03:46.079> skews<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.280> towards

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
damn Celyn certainly skews it towards

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.770 
damn Celyn certainly skews it towards
the<00:03:48.120> heroes<00:03:48.599> certainly<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:50.239> just<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.480> really

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the heroes certainly I just I really

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.830 
the heroes certainly I just I really
think<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.139> such<00:03:52.409> true<00:03:53.329> when<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.480> Lords<00:03:54.780> of

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
think that such true when the Lords of

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.569 
think that such true when the Lords of
the<00:03:54.900> undead<00:03:55.200> are<00:03:55.379> in<00:03:55.530> even<00:03:56.040> though<00:03:56.250> there's<00:03:56.489> a

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
the undead are in even though there's a

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.270 
the undead are in even though there's a
store<00:03:57.180> where<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.750> buy<00:03:57.959> stuff<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.980> think

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
store where you can buy stuff I think

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.339 
store where you can buy stuff I think
it's<00:03:59.669> skews<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.540> toward<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.780> dungeon<00:04:01.109> master

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
it's skews it toward the dungeon master

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.830 
it's skews it toward the dungeon master
player<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:02.010> how<00:04:02.250> do<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.430> fix<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.909> I<00:04:03.120> think<00:04:03.750> you

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
player so how do I fix that I think you

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.390 
player so how do I fix that I think you

actually like the the dance and the
dragon<00:04:40.470> better<00:04:40.949> I<00:04:41.220> think<00:04:41.699> that<00:04:41.820> adds<00:04:42.030> some

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.700 
dragon better I think that adds some
cool<00:04:42.389> things<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:42.930> gives<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.169> hero<00:04:43.470> one

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
cool things and it gives that hero one

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.810 
cool things and it gives that hero one
more<00:04:43.860> thing<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:44.099> look<00:04:44.220> for<00:04:44.400> where's<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.669> damn

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
more thing to look for where's the damn

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.820 
more thing to look for where's the damn
so<00:04:44.940> let's<00:04:45.120> free<00:04:45.330> her<00:04:45.360> find<00:04:46.050> her<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.349> then<00:04:46.680> she

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
so let's free her find her and then she

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.230

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
if you like the original game I think

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.640 
if you like the original game I think
this<00:04:50.159> is<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.310> must<00:04:50.580> buy<00:04:51.229> certainly<00:04:52.229> fits<00:04:52.470> into

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
this is a must buy certainly fits into

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.070 
this is a must buy certainly fits into
the<00:04:52.830> original<00:04:53.190> box<00:04:53.310> very<00:04:53.610> easily<00:04:53.849> so<00:04:54.599> that's

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
the original box very easily so that's

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.320 
the original box very easily so that's
