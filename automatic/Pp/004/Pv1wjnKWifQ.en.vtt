00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.070
 creative world 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.230

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.240
 download and use the game has 13 which is a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.600
 The bold project to draw a lot is to have the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.119
 gaming law that has much to be done 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.279
 example, that washing the debt does not 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.369
 support games such as this one 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.519
 link point which is a very heavy game 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.290
 then it is used to have games joyful 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.940
 well even if the video card with 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.690
 support when the video card and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.080
 supports at least 11 is good match handles 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.250
 but it gets very light and at most is the game 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.160
 do not roll 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.750
 then this program he knows at 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.780
 sometimes there are too many times to do 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.260
 games run on pcs that in 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.880
 are not considerably wheel is not 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.320
 used for this let's go let's not be 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.840
 download and use here we will leave the link 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.689
 that the site in a country that serves to 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.850
 you lowered the embaixa and began to 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.490
 To think that it is a short time 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:25.460
 will go download will normal download ready 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:27.979
 low installed April shows that bolt 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.170
 will have this problem from here 36 games - the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.210
 point at which games here is already standard 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.590
 when the computer is already winding 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:45.950
 add a game is this 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:46.819
 here to add more and ready there and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.649
 put there 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.329
 or else you just pick up the game and 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.679
 cracks down here safe right 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.740
 and drag 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.889
 but as I already voted point blank 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.249
 drag for example even there as it does 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:03.829
 To there and to open zh someone searches 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:07.130
 choose your game and click on 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.509
 a stock exchange program and perform standby 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.509
 for a while until you load this bar 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.820
 When you upload, wait a few seconds. 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.010
 April.com black when you are not 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.830
 play the point blank will already be without lag 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.720
 for example if the ps has with law pelÃ© 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.020
 when you play then and not the law 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.520
 closing the games back right here 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.020
 even though you did it appears this 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.720
 belly that wants to beat the normal way 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:45.140
 because it's a hoax economy it 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.830
 He uses all of it. 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.900
 how can I explain it is the others 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.440
 other programs look like they are 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:58.490
 slow because it uses all the resources 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.709
 computer to use the foot in the game that 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.580
 opened not to give joyful 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.800
 but he also has other 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.640
 features such as the diagnosis here 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.940
 O analyzed a diagnosis of your pc but 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.130
 It's too big a law to send there. 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.970
 see how was your pc or something 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.980
 like this 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.170
 also we are not going here in tools to 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.580
 justice is already at peak performance 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.580
 so it does not need any adjustment 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.010
 diagnose if I choose a game for 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.370
 please choose here for example 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.360
 You can play with me even for me. 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.090
 Sorry to diagnose me in defragment 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:51.290
 fragment the game transvestite in some 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:54.560
 thing for a few moments 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.170
 okay load because I know it's a game 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.900
 the heaviest 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.769
 I'm going to stop there so I will not be long. 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.060
 video lesson but never so much our 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.620
 no training at the time I was 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.980
 searching and also has the drivers going 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.760
 analyze 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.100
 It took some people to think I'm going to give a 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.709
 pausa aquino has already been sued and needs 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.540
 being updated is not good and also 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.350
 has a fps that is used to record 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.770
 videos 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.260
 incredibly lag free looking like no law 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.530
 come on you will get 15 in the name of 11 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.560
 who does not use a lot here but since the 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.080
 Rock video capture f7 to start 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.210
 capture the video and also finalize the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.180
 pause and automatically record the 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.200
 quality video quality 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.430
 I prefer to leave and the quality of 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.650
 video in resolution and quality and in this 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.990
 here is the video gets pregnant and it stays 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.700
 Too bad, that's more or less. 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.750
 It's not good, but it's not as good. 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.970
 bad and if it gets normal it's normal already 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.130
 which can get bad because it's kinda heavy 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.550
 and this is much heavier recommend 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.160
 chak mo of him, and here he proves his 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.110
 capture microphone it does not capture is the 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.700
 chapter play sound to your voice 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.820
 One day, because of this, here it is. 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.919

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.780

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.810

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.060
 press will apply 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.340
 here is also to choose where 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.280
 is that your videos are saved or that 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.040

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.229
 You chose to leave, it's going to happen. 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.340
 logo in the game appears one of the most 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.570
 or less here I think it's more or 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.040
 less here on the screen for that you 're f 7 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.110

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.419
 start to stop recording 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.860
 Then I know , I stopped recording. 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.560
 Are you going to play more, are not you going to use someone else? 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:02.000
 search will not record more click here in 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.970
