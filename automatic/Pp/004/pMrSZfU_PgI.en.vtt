00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.260
 Look, I 'm just saying w 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.570
 would risk 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.840
 our increased demand for healthcare is 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.060
 of traffic accident 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.710
 is within this context of 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.919
 Traffic accident 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.169
 much of that sound inside the 470 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:31.460
 people a significant amount of 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:34.400
 calls and on the br that is a highway 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.559
 ac is a road network that matters almost 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.790
 18 km of our town is taken 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.519
 small is large and very busy 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.090
 and observing the law during the day the flow 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:54.170
 house 470 is all day for it 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.210
 I really wanted the most 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.390
 moved within the city that also 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.879
 has a greater volume of accidents but 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.800
 inside the pot 70 people get almost 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.560
 daily minor accidents 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.660
 edge and large proportion 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.210
 when they leave here in the hope of 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:17.280
 save face 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.440
 I do not know but it's hard to deal with. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.440
 we do our computing 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.000
 and there is more is very complicated then you 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.450
 has arrived 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.580
 Now look at the attacks in the works there 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.540
 We will always in what is or is not 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.710
 one a serious business, and that the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.710
 people can be back 11 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.149
 I hope it never your worst right 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.149
 but sometimes we come across 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.750
 with a sad thing, right? 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.729
 had a lot of accidents so we 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.680
 we were very impressed by people 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.250
 always seeks after accidents to 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.149
 people because always an emotional load 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.880
 too strong is too big but for 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.000
 What do you have that was hot with the passing 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.650
 of years to work on this issue but you 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.560
 always receives a very emotional 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.290
 is how accidents have a very 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.600
 strong we try as far as 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.819
 can send this we have 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.959
 working conditions and has some 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.910
 internal routines and has the purpose 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.610
 of state just give a relieved 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.980
 this emotional burden are many meetings 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.330
 and after other serious diseases to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.490
 the impact 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.860
 Do not do business called fashion show that 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.870
 have shown that is the time when the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.380
 team brings together the entire team 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.800
 emergence of severe emergency 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.860
 60 and discuss contextual and 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.930
 aspects of the emotional point of view it 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.600
 It's the moment to download all the attention. 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.800
 The emotion is time to cry It 's time to 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.650
 to discuss 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.900
 so that helps a lot is our team 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.900
 already worked with this national issue 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.020
 but it is still small but there is 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:16.020
 all this project to duplicate 470 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:20.150
 but faith and should be two things 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.340
 470 and the conscience of those who 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.800
 use the highway is the responsibility of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.530
 should also be doubled, and then the 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.980
 people already have a significant reduction 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.980
 of accidents
