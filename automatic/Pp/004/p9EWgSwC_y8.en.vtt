we know we have an injury and Casey
still<00:00:48.809> coming<00:00:49.110> back<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:50.100> an<00:00:50.309> asset<00:00:50.460> she

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

and<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> versatility<00:00:56.039> I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and all but it was the versatility I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420 
and all but it was the versatility I
think<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.670> stood<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.960> her<00:00:58.250> Laura<00:00:59.250> was

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
think that stood up for her Laura was

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
think that stood up for her Laura was
great<00:00:59.609> played<00:01:00.210> center<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.840> wing<00:01:00.960> defence<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
great played center and wing defence and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.460 
great played center and wing defence and
grace<00:01:02.510> played<00:01:03.510> beautifully<00:01:03.899> at<00:01:03.960> wing<00:01:04.110> attacks

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
grace played beautifully at wing attacks

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
grace played beautifully at wing attacks
