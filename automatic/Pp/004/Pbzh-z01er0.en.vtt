revert back to once it's run out of fuel
and<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:03.960> doing<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.650> collecting

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and what I'm doing now is collecting

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.620 
and what I'm doing now is collecting
collecting<00:01:05.970> fuel<00:01:06.479> tanks<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:08.330> diamonds<00:01:09.330> which

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
collecting fuel tanks and diamonds which

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.070 
collecting fuel tanks and diamonds which
get<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> points<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.630> they<00:01:12.630> wouldn't<00:01:12.900> say

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
get you points and they wouldn't say

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.820 
get you points and they wouldn't say
fuel<00:01:13.740> tanks<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.570> obviously<00:01:15.570> fuel<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
fuel tanks get you obviously fuel the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
fuel tanks get you obviously fuel the
objective<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> get<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.299> far<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
objective is to get as far as you can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.410 
objective is to get as far as you can
without<00:01:19.140> colliding<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.979> any<00:01:20.189> other<00:01:20.420> vehicle

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
without colliding with any other vehicle

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.590 
without colliding with any other vehicle
or<00:01:22.310> or<00:01:23.310> hitting<00:01:24.150> an<00:01:24.509> electric<00:01:24.990> fence

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
or or hitting an electric fence

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
or or hitting an electric fence
basically<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.840> happen<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.770> slide<00:01:29.579> with

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
basically what happen if you slide with

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.429 
basically what happen if you slide with
so<00:01:30.030> many<00:01:30.210> vehicles<00:01:30.360> you'll<00:01:30.900> eventually

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so many vehicles you'll eventually

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.100 
so many vehicles you'll eventually
plummet<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.280> ground<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.659> game<00:01:33.840> will<00:01:34.020> be

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
plummet to ground and the game will be

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.370 
plummet to ground and the game will be
over<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.340> round<00:01:35.549> will<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.790> over<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:37.200> can

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
over or the round will be over you can

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
over or the round will be over you can
get<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.650> far<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.150> don't

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
get as far as you can I think I don't

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.789 
get as far as you can I think I don't
think<00:01:39.509> there's<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> way<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> complete<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
think there's a way to complete it you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.670 
think there's a way to complete it you
can<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.840> might<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.020> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
can just go on and on there might be but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.609 
can just go on and on there might be but
obviously<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.310> haven't<00:01:44.700> been<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.090> yet<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.619> I
