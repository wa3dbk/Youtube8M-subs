think<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.309> very<00:00:41.340> important<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.559> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
think this is very important because it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
think this is very important because it
is<00:00:43.680> worldwide<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.460> first<00:00:44.760> time<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:47.450> sperm

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
is worldwide the first time that sperm

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.310 
is worldwide the first time that sperm

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
created in the laboratory and now we

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.680 
created in the laboratory and now we
have<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> system<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.120> example<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.960> study<00:00:58.739> how

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
have a system for example to study how

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.969 
have a system for example to study how
genes<00:01:00.859> regulate<00:01:02.809> sperm<00:01:03.809> production<00:01:04.170> the

scientists took ones which had the

scientists took ones which had the

potential to become sperm cells and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.300 
potential to become sperm cells and
develop<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:18.990> using<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> substance<00:01:19.979> called

develop them using a substance called

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.090 
develop them using a substance called
retinoic<00:01:21.000> acid<00:01:21.259> they<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.439> became<00:01:22.710> cells

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
retinoic acid they then became cells

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.710 
retinoic acid they then became cells
which<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> ability<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> pass<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.570> their

genetic material to future generations

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
genetic material to future generations
the<00:01:27.570> next<00:01:27.840> step<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.229> split<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:28.890> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the next step was to split them so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
the next step was to split them so
called<00:01:29.400> meiosis<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.869> only<00:01:31.049> one

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
called meiosis so they have only one

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.380 
called meiosis so they have only one
half<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> chromosome<00:01:32.490> set<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.240> like

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
half of the chromosome set just like

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.700 
half of the chromosome set just like

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.160

then<00:01:36.580> some<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.120> those<00:01:37.240> continue<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.810> grow

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
then some of those continue to grow

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.380 
then some of those continue to grow
developing<00:01:38.710> tales<00:01:39.010> and<00:01:39.369> more<00:01:39.670> sperm<00:01:40.180> like
