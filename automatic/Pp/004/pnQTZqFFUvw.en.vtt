00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
very important stat but essentially it's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.080 
very important stat but essentially it's

you<00:01:38.790> get<00:01:38.940> two<00:01:39.150> after<00:01:39.660> that<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.960> only<00:01:40.110> gain<00:01:40.350> one

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
you get two after that you only gain one

you get two after that you only gain one
now<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> interesting<00:01:41.970> thing<00:01:42.210> about

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
now the interesting thing about

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.180 
now the interesting thing about
endurance<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> lower<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.830> endurance

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
endurance is that the lower of endurance

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.650 
endurance is that the lower of endurance
and<00:01:44.310> adaptability<00:01:44.940> will<00:01:45.300> actually<00:01:45.570> raise

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
and adaptability will actually raise

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.080 
and adaptability will actually raise
your<00:01:45.870> poise<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.410> around<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.700> ratio

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
your poise of around one to one ratio

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.210 
your poise of around one to one ratio
somewhere<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.870> so<00:01:49.770> let's<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.040> ahead<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
somewhere in that so let's go ahead and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.040 
somewhere in that so let's go ahead and
talk<00:01:50.430> about<00:01:50.670> adaptability<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> moment

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
talk about adaptability for a moment

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.410 
talk about adaptability for a moment
it's<00:01:52.590> actually<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.980> very<00:01:53.130> controversial<00:01:53.760> stat

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it's actually a very controversial stat

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.140 
it's actually a very controversial stat
nom<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.470> does<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.370> bit<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.790> lot<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
nom it does a little bit to a lot of

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.540 
nom it does a little bit to a lot of
different<00:01:57.390> things<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.690> gives<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.250> at<00:01:59.250> higher

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
different things it gives you at higher

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.820 
different things it gives you at higher
amount<00:01:59.940> it<00:02:00.150> will<00:02:00.450> lower<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:00.930> flask<00:02:01.320> drinking

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
amount it will lower your flask drinking

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.340 
amount it will lower your flask drinking
time<00:02:02.010> by<00:02:02.250> around<00:02:02.550> half<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.090> second<00:02:03.480> it<00:02:03.660> raises

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
time by around half a second it raises

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.110 
time by around half a second it raises
your<00:02:04.560> dodge<00:02:04.950> timing<00:02:05.550> which<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.820> very

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
your dodge timing which is very

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.089 
your dodge timing which is very
important<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:07.050> can<00:02:07.470> raise<00:02:07.620> your<00:02:07.800> shield

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
important you can raise your shield

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.149 
important you can raise your shield
faster<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:09.469> some<00:02:10.469> people<00:02:10.709> say<00:02:10.859> that<00:02:11.039> it

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
faster it some people say that it

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.649 
faster it some people say that it
actually<00:02:11.310> makes<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.700> shoot<00:02:11.909> your<00:02:11.999> bow<00:02:12.209> faster

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
actually makes you shoot your bow faster

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.270 
actually makes you shoot your bow faster
that's<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.959> maybe<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.890> course<00:02:13.920> it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
that's a maybe and of course it

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.160 
that's a maybe and of course it
raises<00:02:14.670> various<00:02:15.000> resistances<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:16.020> main

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
raises various resistances the main

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.449 
raises various resistances the main
thing<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.440> note<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.100> first<00:02:17.310> ten

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
thing to note is that the first ten

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.800 
thing to note is that the first ten
points<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.910> don't<00:02:18.090> get<00:02:18.240> very<00:02:18.360> much<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.630> a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
points you don't get very much of a

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.710 
points you don't get very much of a
bonus<00:02:19.170> from<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.440> after<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.819> gain<00:02:21.030> for

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
bonus from it after that you gain for

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.480 
bonus from it after that you gain for
every<00:02:21.750> ten<00:02:22.140> points<00:02:22.470> around<00:02:22.709> seven<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.310> eight

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
every ten points around seven to eight

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.290 
every ten points around seven to eight
more<00:02:24.150> agility<00:02:24.690> bonus<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.970> be<00:02:27.120> a

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
more agility bonus and so it can be a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.350 
more agility bonus and so it can be a
pretty<00:02:27.540> big<00:02:27.750> deal<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.260> I've<00:02:28.410> noticed<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.040> is

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
pretty big deal and I've noticed it is

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.410 
pretty big deal and I've noticed it is

if you want to wear heavy armor vitality
break<00:02:41.250> point<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.670> after<00:02:41.910> 30<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.989> spin<00:02:43.319> as<00:02:43.440> much

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
break point is after 30 so spin as much

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.920 
break point is after 30 so spin as much
as<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.160> want<00:02:44.400> into<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.270> after<00:02:45.390> 30<00:02:45.690> you're

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
as you want into it but after 30 you're

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.590 
as you want into it but after 30 you're
not<00:02:46.170> going<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.620> getting<00:02:46.769> as<00:02:47.269> much<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.540> a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
not going to be getting as much of a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.630 
not going to be getting as much of a
benefit<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.320> that's<00:02:49.500> where<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.769> would<00:02:50.070> stop<00:02:50.400> if

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
benefit so that's where I would stop if

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.970 
benefit so that's where I would stop if
I<00:02:50.820> were<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.150> now<00:02:51.660> moving<00:02:51.989> on<00:02:52.170> into<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.860> next

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
I were you now moving on into the next

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.199 
I were you now moving on into the next
one<00:02:53.220> we're<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.519> talk<00:02:53.670> about<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.880> tune

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
one we're going to talk about a tune

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.550 
one we're going to talk about a tune
mitt<00:02:54.390> for<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.600> second<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.080> Truman<00:02:55.260> does<00:02:55.530> a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
mitt for a second so it Truman does a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.140 
mitt for a second so it Truman does a
couple<00:02:55.769> things<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.160> actually<00:02:56.670> raise<00:02:56.850> your

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
couple things it actually raise your

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.520 
couple things it actually raise your
casting<00:02:57.989> speed<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.160> also<00:02:59.310> gives<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.760> more

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
casting speed but it also gives you more

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.990 
casting speed but it also gives you more
slots<00:03:01.530> for<00:03:02.220> actually<00:03:02.880> having<00:03:03.500> spells<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.920> cast

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
slots for actually having spells to cast

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.780 
slots for actually having spells to cast
so<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.350> basically<00:03:07.350> goes<00:03:07.800> like<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.580> get

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
so it basically goes like this you get

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.860 
so it basically goes like this you get
one<00:03:09.630> at<00:03:09.930> 10<00:03:10.500> another<00:03:11.310> at<00:03:12.200> 13<00:03:13.200> 16<00:03:13.860> 20<00:03:14.550> 25<00:03:15.480> and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
one at 10 another at 13 16 20 25 and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.440 
one at 10 another at 13 16 20 25 and
then<00:03:16.050> 30<00:03:16.380> pretty<00:03:17.010> much<00:03:17.190> after<00:03:17.430> 30<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.090> when<00:03:18.120> it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
then 30 pretty much after 30 is when it

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.090 
then 30 pretty much after 30 is when it
starts<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.780> slow<00:03:18.989> down<00:03:19.140> dramatically<00:03:19.799> that's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
starts to slow down dramatically that's

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.750 
starts to slow down dramatically that's
it's<00:03:20.310> real<00:03:20.549> breaking<00:03:20.970> point<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:22.860> so

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
it's real breaking point and so so

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.060 
it's real breaking point and so so
you're<00:03:23.850> going<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.030> be<00:03:24.180> spinning<00:03:24.840> 10<00:03:25.410> per<00:03:25.860> point

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you're going to be spinning 10 per point

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.210 
you're going to be spinning 10 per point
after<00:03:26.370> 30<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.299> soft<00:03:27.600> cap<00:03:27.810> at<00:03:27.959> 20<00:03:28.290> another<00:03:28.890> hard

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
after 30 so soft cap at 20 another hard

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.920 
after 30 so soft cap at 20 another hard
cap<00:03:29.430> at<00:03:29.579> 30<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.209> that's<00:03:30.420> pretty<00:03:30.570> much<00:03:30.690> where

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
cap at 30 and that's pretty much where

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.650 
cap at 30 and that's pretty much where
you<00:03:31.019> want<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.260> stay<00:03:31.470> now<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.640> next<00:03:33.120> couple<00:03:33.450> of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you want to stay now the next couple of

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.340 
you want to stay now the next couple of
stats<00:03:34.049> are<00:03:34.380> actually<00:03:35.870> pretty<00:03:36.870> much<00:03:37.079> all

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
stats are actually pretty much all

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.630 
stats are actually pretty much all
lumped<00:03:37.769> together<00:03:37.829> here<00:03:38.250> I'm<00:03:38.400> going<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.579> talk

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
lumped together here I'm going to talk

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.580 
lumped together here I'm going to talk
about<00:03:38.760> strength<00:03:39.180> dexterity<00:03:39.590> intelligence

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
about strength dexterity intelligence

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.680 
about strength dexterity intelligence
and<00:03:40.799> faith<00:03:41.040> all<00:03:41.310> as<00:03:41.820> one<00:03:42.000> because<00:03:42.360> they<00:03:42.480> all

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
and faith all as one because they all

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.349 
and faith all as one because they all
are<00:03:43.019> very<00:03:43.049> similar<00:03:43.739> other<00:03:44.489> than<00:03:44.790> allowing<00:03:45.120> you

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
are very similar other than allowing you

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.810 
are very similar other than allowing you
to<00:03:45.510> equip<00:03:45.870> certain<00:03:46.680> items<00:03:47.100> by<00:03:47.310> having<00:03:47.700> the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
to equip certain items by having the

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.400 
to equip certain items by having the
required<00:03:48.829> stat<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.549> associated<00:03:50.820> with<00:03:51.180> it

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
required stat that is associated with it

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.170 
required stat that is associated with it
strength<00:03:52.410> for<00:03:52.859> example<00:03:53.220> will<00:03:53.370> modify<00:03:53.609> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
strength for example will modify the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.599 
strength for example will modify the
scaling<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.140> strength<00:03:55.709> based<00:03:55.890> weapons<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.459> it

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
scaling on strength based weapons but it

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:57.920 
scaling on strength based weapons but it
also<00:03:56.730> adds<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.150> little<00:03:57.209> bit<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.450> defense<00:03:57.810> to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
also adds a little bit of defense to

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.710 
also adds a little bit of defense to
your<00:03:58.260> setup<00:03:58.590> dexterity<00:03:59.400> will<00:03:59.670> add<00:03:59.910> extra

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
your setup dexterity will add extra

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.930 
your setup dexterity will add extra
damage<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.799> decks<00:04:01.950> based<00:04:02.310> scaling<00:04:02.700> but<00:04:02.850> it

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
damage to decks based scaling but it

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.390 
damage to decks based scaling but it
also<00:04:03.060> adds<00:04:03.390> poison<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.200> bleed<00:04:04.890> bonus

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
also adds poison and bleed bonus

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.220 
also adds poison and bleed bonus
whenever<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.180> level<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.930> intelligence

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
whenever you level of intelligence

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.319 
whenever you level of intelligence
you're<00:04:07.650> going<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:07.980> increase<00:04:08.820> your<00:04:08.850> fire

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
you're going to increase your fire

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.270 
you're going to increase your fire
damage<00:04:09.810> as<00:04:09.989> well<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:10.350> magic<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.829> course<00:04:11.040> and

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
damage as well as magic of course and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.660 
damage as well as magic of course and
then<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.170> engineer<00:04:13.170> faith<00:04:13.440> will<00:04:13.799> actually<00:04:14.130> up

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
then and engineer faith will actually up

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.000 
then and engineer faith will actually up
your<00:04:15.269> lightning<00:04:15.600> damage<00:04:16.079> now<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.769> cool

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
your lightning damage now the cool

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.060 
your lightning damage now the cool
interaction<00:04:17.760> between<00:04:18.060> faith<00:04:18.630> and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
interaction between faith and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.349 
interaction between faith and
intelligence<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.850> lower<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.329> the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
intelligence is that the lower of the

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.510 
intelligence is that the lower of the
two<00:04:21.539> will<00:04:22.260> actually<00:04:22.560> modify<00:04:22.919> your<00:04:23.159> dark

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
two will actually modify your dark

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.850 
two will actually modify your dark
damage<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.599> that's<00:04:25.020> pretty<00:04:25.289> much<00:04:25.380> for<00:04:25.800> hexes

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
damage so that's pretty much for hexes

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.890 
damage so that's pretty much for hexes
and<00:04:26.979> stuff<00:04:27.430> like<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.639> one<00:04:28.449> more<00:04:28.629> thing<00:04:28.659> to

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
and stuff like that one more thing to

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.649 
and stuff like that one more thing to
note<00:04:29.080> about<00:04:29.520> when<00:04:30.520> you're<00:04:30.729> wildung<00:04:31.180> weapons

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
note about when you're wildung weapons

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.080 
note about when you're wildung weapons
if<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:32.319> to<00:04:32.560> hand<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:33.129> sword<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:33.789> will<00:04:33.939> actually

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
if you to hand a sword it will actually

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.320 
if you to hand a sword it will actually
double<00:04:34.629> your<00:04:34.780> strength<00:04:35.379> so<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:37.120> actually

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
double your strength so you you actually

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.450 
double your strength so you you actually
have<00:04:37.629> less<00:04:37.810> requirements<00:04:38.500> as<00:04:38.650> well<00:04:39.219> as<00:04:39.340> the

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
have less requirements as well as the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.890 
have less requirements as well as the
fact<00:04:39.580> that<00:04:39.729> this<00:04:40.030> scaling<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.599> a<00:04:40.629> little<00:04:40.810> bit

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
fact that this scaling is a little bit

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.529 
fact that this scaling is a little bit
more<00:04:41.080> now<00:04:41.289> dual<00:04:41.590> wielding<00:04:42.099> and<00:04:42.330> if<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:43.419> want

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
more now dual wielding and if you want

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.600 
more now dual wielding and if you want
to<00:04:43.569> go<00:04:43.689> into<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.050> power<00:04:44.319> stance<00:04:44.740> which<00:04:45.430> is

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
to go into the power stance which is

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.820 
to go into the power stance which is
where<00:04:45.819> you<00:04:46.120> actually<00:04:46.449> have<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.930> special<00:04:47.469> attack

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
where you actually have a special attack

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.189 
where you actually have a special attack
with<00:04:48.129> two<00:04:48.430> weapons<00:04:49.419> at<00:04:49.599> once<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:50.050> actually

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
with two weapons at once you actually

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.379 
with two weapons at once you actually
need<00:04:50.469> one<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.069> a<00:04:51.129> half<00:04:51.159> times<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.969> required

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
need one and a half times the required

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.029 
need one and a half times the required
amount<00:04:52.539> of<00:04:52.750> status<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:53.319> that's<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.830> little

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
amount of status so that's just a little

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.719 
amount of status so that's just a little
side<00:04:54.729> note<00:04:54.759> for<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:55.599> as<00:04:55.689> far<00:04:55.900> as<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.729> the

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
side note for you but as far as the the

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.860 
side note for you but as far as the the
fall<00:04:58.030> off<00:04:58.240> for<00:04:58.930> damage<00:04:59.469> on<00:04:59.729> these<00:05:00.729> stats<00:05:01.419> it's

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
fall off for damage on these stats it's

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.749 
fall off for damage on these stats it's
actually<00:05:02.050> very<00:05:02.259> interesting<00:05:02.830> because<00:05:02.949> they

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
actually very interesting because they

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.059 
actually very interesting because they
they<00:05:04.360> all<00:05:04.479> have<00:05:04.659> kind<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.139> mediocre<00:05:05.560> amount

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
they all have kind of a mediocre amount

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.730 
they all have kind of a mediocre amount
of<00:05:06.310> scaling<00:05:06.819> up<00:05:06.969> until<00:05:07.300> 30<00:05:07.719> but<00:05:08.110> between<00:05:08.319> 30

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
of scaling up until 30 but between 30

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.490 
of scaling up until 30 but between 30
and<00:05:08.830> 40<00:05:09.279> you<00:05:09.639> get<00:05:09.789> the<00:05:09.939> most<00:05:10.090> massive<00:05:10.569> bonus<00:05:11.289> on

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
and 40 you get the most massive bonus on

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.920 
and 40 you get the most massive bonus on
the<00:05:12.279> damage<00:05:12.849> scaling<00:05:13.150> from<00:05:13.479> these<00:05:13.629> stats

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
the damage scaling from these stats

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.100 
the damage scaling from these stats
after<00:05:14.889> that<00:05:15.099> you<00:05:15.819> have<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.210> pretty<00:05:16.659> big<00:05:16.840> fall

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
after that you have a pretty big fall

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.679 
after that you have a pretty big fall
off<00:05:17.289> after<00:05:17.500> 40<00:05:18.129> and<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.849> just<00:05:19.029> kind<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.270> goes

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:19.689 
off after 40 and it just kind of goes

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.260 
off after 40 and it just kind of goes
steady<00:05:20.080> up<00:05:20.379> until<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:21.400> very<00:05:21.430> last<00:05:21.699> level<00:05:22.090> at

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
steady up until the very last level at

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.070 
steady up until the very last level at
99<00:05:22.779> so<00:05:23.169> so<00:05:24.159> the<00:05:24.310> idea<00:05:24.430> here<00:05:24.610> is<00:05:24.879> always<00:05:25.629> take

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
99 so so the idea here is always take

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.999 
99 so so the idea here is always take
your<00:05:26.800> stat<00:05:27.189> up<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.819> level<00:05:28.120> up<00:05:28.779> to<00:05:28.990> 40<00:05:29.349> points

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
your stat up to level up to 40 points
