00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.970 

so<00:00:06.960> today<00:00:07.170> we're<00:00:07.259> going<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.440> try<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.680> do<00:00:07.770> some

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
so today we're going to try and do some

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.220 
so today we're going to try and do some
laser<00:00:08.220> diffraction<00:00:08.870> hopefully<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> view

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
laser diffraction hopefully with a view

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.480 
laser diffraction hopefully with a view
ultimately<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.950> creating<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.630> famous

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
ultimately to creating the the famous

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.250 
ultimately to creating the the famous
cross<00:00:14.490> shape<00:00:14.750> diffraction<00:00:15.750> pattern<00:00:15.990> from<00:00:16.109> the

cross shape diffraction pattern from the
helix<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.710> Watson<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.760> Crick<00:00:17.970> observed

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
helix that Watson and Crick observed

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.550 
helix that Watson and Crick observed
when<00:00:18.720> they<00:00:18.840> were<00:00:18.900> doing<00:00:19.080> their<00:00:19.260> x-ray

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
when they were doing their x-ray

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.970 
when they were doing their x-ray
diffraction<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.720> DNA<00:00:21.720> first<00:00:22.529> mistake<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.920> the

diffraction of DNA first mistake of the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.380 
diffraction of DNA first mistake of the
film<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.519> wasn't<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.910> course<00:00:23.939> Crick<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
film it wasn't of course Crick and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.849 
film it wasn't of course Crick and
Watson<00:00:24.449> who<00:00:24.779> did<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> x-ray<00:00:25.350> diffraction

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
Watson who did the x-ray diffraction

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
Watson who did the x-ray diffraction
work<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.189> DNA<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:27.150> was<00:00:27.470> roughly<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:30.179> first<00:00:30.390> I

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
work on DNA it was roughly so first I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.749 
work on DNA it was roughly so first I
need<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:30.960> get<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> laser<00:00:31.529> obviously<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
need to go and get the laser obviously I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.430 
need to go and get the laser obviously I
thought<00:00:33.180> I'd<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.329> her<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.540> here<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:33.899> turns

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
thought I'd have her in here but turns

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:50.869 
thought I'd have her in here but turns
out<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.590> don't<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:48.440> have<00:00:49.440> no<00:00:49.770> idea<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.579> last

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
out I don't I have no idea when my last

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
out I don't I have no idea when my last
video<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:57.020> 70<00:00:58.020> something<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.440> there

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
video so 70 something going on there

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.860 
video so 70 something going on there
when<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:59.420> pull<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> wire<00:01:00.750> into<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> beam

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.750 

okay<00:01:06.870> so<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.200> looks<00:01:07.410> a<00:01:07.650> bit<00:01:08.430> more

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
okay so this looks a bit more

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.980 
okay so this looks a bit more
convincingly<00:01:09.300> like<00:01:09.510> we've<00:01:09.660> got<00:01:09.780> something

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
convincingly like we've got something

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.510 
convincingly like we've got something
interesting<00:01:10.230> happening<00:01:10.800> pretty<00:01:11.040> definitely

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
interesting happening pretty definitely

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820 
interesting happening pretty definitely
a<00:01:11.550> diffraction<00:01:11.880> pattern<00:01:12.500> going<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.620> there

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
a diffraction pattern going on there

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.030 
a diffraction pattern going on there
little<00:01:14.130> dog<00:01:14.340> some<00:01:15.150> nice<00:01:15.300> dark<00:01:15.830> fringes<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
little dog some nice dark fringes and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.440 
little dog some nice dark fringes and
light<00:01:17.220> fringes<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.760> bit<00:01:17.940> of<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> mess<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
light fringes have bit of a mess in the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.150 
light fringes have bit of a mess in the
middle<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:18.900> spreading<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> way<00:01:19.980> over

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
middle but spreading all the way over

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.990 
middle but spreading all the way over
here<00:01:20.190> there's<00:01:20.430> definitely<00:01:20.550> something<00:01:20.970> going

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
here there's definitely something going

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.220 
here there's definitely something going
on<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.800> what's<00:01:22.950> happening<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
on so so what's happening is that the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.250 
on so so what's happening is that the
the<00:01:25.230> laser<00:01:25.410> beam<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.810> effectively<00:01:27.810> being<00:01:27.900> cut

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
the laser beam is effectively being cut

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.880 
the laser beam is effectively being cut
into<00:01:28.500> two<00:01:28.650> by<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.890> wire<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.430> wire<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.890> narrow

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
into two by the wire the wire is narrow

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440 
into two by the wire the wire is narrow
and<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.310> beam<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.820> beam<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.090> passing

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and the beam so the beam is passing

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and the beam so the beam is passing
around<00:01:33.540> both<00:01:33.810> sides<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
around both sides the you see all the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.510 
around both sides the you see all the
nice<00:01:40.620> little<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.490> nice<00:01:41.940> pattern<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:43.520> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
nice little the nice pattern of the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.290 
nice little the nice pattern of the
waves<00:01:44.700> add<00:01:44.910> up<00:01:45.150> you<00:01:45.480> get<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> bright<00:01:46.640> they<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.240> it

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
waves add up you get a bright they so it

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.370 
waves add up you get a bright they so it
so<00:01:48.420> anyway<00:01:48.660> they<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.080> get<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so anyway they get they get to the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.140 
so anyway they get they get to the
screen<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.790> because<00:01:50.790> they<00:01:50.910> both<00:01:51.060> traveled

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
screen and because they both traveled

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.730 
screen and because they both traveled
not<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.210> same<00:01:54.390> amount<00:01:54.510> of<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> same

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
not the same amount of not the same

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:16.070 
not the same amount of not the same
distance<00:01:58.310> anyway<00:02:11.270> Oh<00:02:14.840> didn't<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.020> just

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
distance anyway Oh didn't what you just

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.479 
distance anyway Oh didn't what you just
did<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.560> was<00:02:16.650> good<00:02:16.830> yeah<00:02:17.040> okay<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:19.489> don't

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
did but it was good yeah okay so don't

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.729 
did but it was good yeah okay so don't
mind<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.000> little<00:02:21.270> light<00:02:22.170> exclusion

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
mind this little light exclusion

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.550 
mind this little light exclusion
apparatus<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.700> had<00:02:23.820> design<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.150> here

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
apparatus we just had design up here

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.380 
apparatus we just had design up here
can't<00:02:25.560> really<00:02:25.760> block<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.000> light<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
can't really block out the light in the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.240 
can't really block out the light in the
prep<00:02:27.540> for<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.750> moment<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.230> then<00:02:28.410> we're<00:02:29.040> having

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
prep for a moment so then we're having

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.030 
prep for a moment so then we're having
to<00:02:29.340> improvise<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.630> see<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.860> much

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to improvise but so you can see so much

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.770 
to improvise but so you can see so much
more<00:02:32.100> structure<00:02:32.580> now<00:02:32.730> obviously<00:02:33.330> with

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
more structure now obviously with

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.530 
more structure now obviously with
because<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.590> slightly<00:02:35.400> crazy<00:02:35.820> assortment

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
because of the slightly crazy assortment

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.810 
because of the slightly crazy assortment
of<00:02:36.600> wires<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.200> we've<00:02:37.320> set<00:02:37.920> up<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.310> we've<00:02:38.700> got

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
of wires that we've set up but we've got

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.040 
of wires that we've set up but we've got
diffraction<00:02:39.239> going<00:02:39.390> off<00:02:39.510> all<00:02:39.630> over<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> place

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
diffraction going off all over the place

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.890 
diffraction going off all over the place
and<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.320> really<00:02:40.470> look<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:41.810> when<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.870> look

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and if you really look in when you look

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.420 
and if you really look in when you look
into<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.410> structure<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> pattern<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
into the structure of the pattern you

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.759 
into the structure of the pattern you
can<00:02:44.580> see<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.690> sort<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.440> fine

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
can see it sort of is really fine

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.590 
can see it sort of is really fine
structure<00:02:47.220> throughout<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.820> two-dimensional

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
structure throughout the two-dimensional

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.990 
structure throughout the two-dimensional
field<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:49.830> imagine<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.850> we

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
field but you can imagine that if we

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.340 
field but you can imagine that if we
went<00:02:51.180> through<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.420> whole<00:02:51.540> process<00:02:51.750> backwards

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
went through the whole process backwards

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.960 
went through the whole process backwards
you<00:02:52.860> could<00:02:53.010> work<00:02:53.160> out<00:02:53.310> from<00:02:53.519> this<00:02:53.670> pattern

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
you could work out from this pattern

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.460 
you could work out from this pattern
where<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.300> those<00:02:54.480> wires<00:02:54.660> are<00:02:54.959> because<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.350> you

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
where all those wires are because if you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.890 
where all those wires are because if you
if<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.010> move<00:02:56.130> any<00:02:56.310> one<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.580> those<00:02:56.730> wires<00:02:57.030> then

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
if you move any one of those wires then

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.570 
if you move any one of those wires then
the<00:02:58.709> diffraction<00:02:58.980> pattern<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.489> to

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
the diffraction pattern is going to

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.270 
the diffraction pattern is going to
change<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.019> could<00:03:01.350> if<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.739> if<00:03:02.100> you

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
change so so you could if you if you

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.310 
change so so you could if you if you
could<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.180> could<00:03:03.269> do<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> math<00:03:03.720> then<00:03:04.290> you

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
could do you could do the math then you

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560 
could do you could do the math then you
could<00:03:04.620> work<00:03:04.800> out<00:03:05.040> exactly<00:03:05.820> where<00:03:06.269> all<00:03:06.390> those

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
could work out exactly where all those

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.509 
could work out exactly where all those
wires<00:03:06.750> were<00:03:06.989> from<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.290> pattern<00:03:07.519> imagine

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
wires were from this pattern imagine

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.970 
wires were from this pattern imagine
then<00:03:08.640> doing<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:09.060> not<00:03:09.870> with<00:03:10.050> laser<00:03:10.440> light<00:03:10.709> but

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
then doing that not with laser light but

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.860 
then doing that not with laser light but
with<00:03:11.100> x-rays<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.880> instead<00:03:12.239> not<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:12.630> wires

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
with x-rays and instead not with wires

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.410 
with x-rays and instead not with wires
but<00:03:13.230> with<00:03:13.410> atoms<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.300> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
but with atoms and that that is the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.370 
but with atoms and that that is the
basis<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.870> x-ray<00:03:16.470> crystallography

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
basis of x-ray crystallography

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.990 
basis of x-ray crystallography
another<00:03:19.380> day<00:03:19.590> another<00:03:19.620> diffraction<00:03:20.370> target

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:55.830 

remove<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.150> glasses<00:03:24.560> carefully<00:03:25.560> as<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.740> can

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.510 

so<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.410> think<00:03:56.530> we've<00:03:56.770> got<00:03:56.800> well<00:03:57.310> got<00:03:57.489> a

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
so I think we've got well got a

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.949 
so I think we've got well got a
depression<00:03:57.940> pattern<00:03:58.180> there<00:03:58.360> it's<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.750> very

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
depression pattern there it's a very

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.979 
depression pattern there it's a very
very<00:03:59.739> sort<00:03:59.890> of<00:03:59.950> flat<00:04:00.190> cross<00:04:00.580> but<00:04:01.000> actually<00:04:01.870> to

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
very sort of flat cross but actually to

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.600 
very sort of flat cross but actually to
the<00:04:02.080> Cross<00:04:02.230> very<00:04:02.440> close<00:04:02.590> together<00:04:02.890> but<00:04:03.160> I

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
the Cross very close together but I

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.650 
the Cross very close together but I
think<00:04:04.060> that's<00:04:04.180> sort<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.330> what<00:04:04.420> you'd<00:04:04.569> expect

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
think that's sort of what you'd expect

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.420 
think that's sort of what you'd expect
from<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:05.110> from<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.440> call<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:05.830> this<00:04:06.040> because

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
from a from a call like this because

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.880 
from a from a call like this because
it's<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.150> very<00:04:07.330> it's<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.900> very<00:04:07.959> tight<00:04:08.290> coil<00:04:08.650> if

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
it's a very it's a very tight coil if

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.130 
it's a very it's a very tight coil if
you<00:04:08.980> remember<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.970> diffraction<00:04:10.690> pattern<00:04:10.840> we

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
you remember the diffraction pattern we

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.070 
you remember the diffraction pattern we
got<00:04:11.319> from<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.680> from<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.459> vertical<00:04:12.819> wires

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
got from the from the vertical wires

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.890 
got from the from the vertical wires
spread<00:04:14.080> out<00:04:14.230> this<00:04:14.440> horizontal<00:04:15.010> pattern

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
spread out this horizontal pattern

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.789 
spread out this horizontal pattern
basically<00:04:16.900> we've<00:04:16.989> got<00:04:17.019> we've<00:04:17.500> got<00:04:17.650> that

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
basically we've got we've got that

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.710 
basically we've got we've got that
happening<00:04:18.190> from<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.060> core<00:04:19.239> from<00:04:19.450> two

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
happening from the core from two

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.599 
happening from the core from two
different<00:04:20.260> but<00:04:20.410> not<00:04:20.500> not<00:04:20.950> quite<00:04:21.220> perfectly

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
different but not not quite perfectly

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.700 
different but not not quite perfectly
aligned<00:04:21.910> sets<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.510> vertical<00:04:22.900> wires<00:04:23.110> we've<00:04:23.530> got

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
aligned sets of vertical wires we've got

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.280 
aligned sets of vertical wires we've got
these<00:04:24.550> sort<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.850> line<00:04:25.120> on<00:04:25.480> one<00:04:25.720> side<00:04:25.990> on<00:04:26.200> the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
these sort of line on one side on the

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.810 
these sort of line on one side on the
near<00:04:26.440> side<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.770> coil<00:04:26.980> so<00:04:27.580> they've<00:04:27.700> all

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
near side of the coil so they've all

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.820 
near side of the coil so they've all
lined<00:04:28.060> up<00:04:28.240> together<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.930> then<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.440> far<00:04:29.620> side

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
lined up together and then the far side

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.740 
lined up together and then the far side
of<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.979> coil<00:04:30.160> we've<00:04:30.430> got<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:31.000> same<00:04:31.180> thing<00:04:31.240> but

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
of the coil we've got the same thing but

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.810 
of the coil we've got the same thing but
shifted<00:04:32.530> very<00:04:32.680> slightly<00:04:32.950> as<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.340> coil<00:04:33.520> sort

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
shifted very slightly as the coil sort

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.680 
shifted very slightly as the coil sort
of<00:04:33.880> winds<00:04:34.780> itself<00:04:34.990> around<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.300> think<00:04:37.419> I

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
of winds itself around so I think I

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.270 
of winds itself around so I think I
think<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.200> is<00:04:38.380> what<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.650> would<00:04:38.830> have<00:04:38.979> expected

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
think this is what I would have expected

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.379 
think this is what I would have expected
to<00:04:39.460> happen<00:04:39.669> and<00:04:40.660> if<00:04:41.620> we<00:04:41.800> using<00:04:42.639> my<00:04:42.760> surgical

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
to happen and if we using my surgical

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.830 
to happen and if we using my surgical
tweezers<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.560> we<00:04:44.740> just<00:04:44.950> sort<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:45.330> tease<00:04:46.330> the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
tweezers if we just sort of tease the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.469 
tweezers if we just sort of tease the
filament<00:04:47.590> out<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.770> bit<00:04:48.180> hopefully<00:04:49.180> as<00:04:49.300> though

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
filament out a bit hopefully as though

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.540 
filament out a bit hopefully as though
as<00:04:49.720> we<00:04:49.840> extend<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.260> coil<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.770> we<00:04:50.860> accentuate

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
as we extend the coil and we accentuate

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.310 
as we extend the coil and we accentuate
the<00:04:51.639> difference<00:04:51.970> between<00:04:52.150> between<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.139> sort

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
the difference between between the sort

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.320 
the difference between between the sort
of<00:04:53.350> front<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.680> back<00:04:53.889> of<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.160> coil<00:04:54.370> we<00:04:55.120> should

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
of front and back of the coil we should

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.750 
of front and back of the coil we should
see<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:56.500> cross<00:04:57.220> open<00:04:57.790> out<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> bit<00:04:59.370> yeah<00:05:00.370> it's

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
see the cross open out a bit yeah it's

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.240 
see the cross open out a bit yeah it's
kind<00:05:01.000> of<00:05:01.060> doing<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.620> probably<00:05:02.620> only<00:05:02.830> so<00:05:03.039> far

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
kind of doing that probably only so far

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.270 
kind of doing that probably only so far
I<00:05:03.280> can<00:05:03.580> pull<00:05:03.789> this<00:05:03.910> before<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.390> breaks<00:05:04.570> but

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
I can pull this before it breaks but

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.320 
I can pull this before it breaks but
yeah<00:05:06.280> that's<00:05:06.430> quite<00:05:06.640> nice<00:05:09.000> so<00:05:10.000> we've<00:05:10.120> got<00:05:10.240> this

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
yeah that's quite nice so we've got this

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.150 
yeah that's quite nice so we've got this
really<00:05:10.870> lovely<00:05:10.960> diffraction<00:05:11.680> pattern<00:05:11.919> just

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
really lovely diffraction pattern just

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.610 
really lovely diffraction pattern just
from<00:05:12.310> our<00:05:12.690> light<00:05:13.690> bulb<00:05:13.900> filament<00:05:14.020> over<00:05:14.440> there

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
from our light bulb filament over there

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.700 
from our light bulb filament over there
and<00:05:14.800> this<00:05:15.729> this<00:05:16.720> is<00:05:16.870> very<00:05:17.020> characteristic<00:05:17.590> of

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
and this this is very characteristic of

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.070 
and this this is very characteristic of
the<00:05:18.190> diffraction<00:05:18.580> you<00:05:18.760> get<00:05:18.910> from<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.240> helix<00:05:19.960> or

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
the diffraction you get from a helix or

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.450 
the diffraction you get from a helix or
a<00:05:20.140> coil<00:05:20.410> or<00:05:20.560> something<00:05:20.860> like<00:05:20.979> that<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.340> it's

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
a coil or something like that and it's

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.490 
a coil or something like that and it's
what<00:05:21.640> rosalind<00:05:22.450> Franklin<00:05:22.780> saw<00:05:22.960> when<00:05:23.229> he<00:05:23.260> was

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
what rosalind Franklin saw when he was

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.070 
what rosalind Franklin saw when he was
doing<00:05:23.770> her<00:05:24.010> x-ray<00:05:24.789> diffraction<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.270> DNA<00:05:25.600> and

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
doing her x-ray diffraction of DNA and

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.750 
doing her x-ray diffraction of DNA and
it<00:05:26.530> really<00:05:26.710> influenced<00:05:27.039> quick<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:27.340> Watson<00:05:27.610> in

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
it really influenced quick and Watson in

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.790 
it really influenced quick and Watson in
determining<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.389> structure<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:29.050> finding

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
determining the structure and finding

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.159 
determining the structure and finding
this<00:05:29.919> famous<00:05:30.490> double<00:05:30.880> helix<00:05:30.910> that<00:05:31.330> is<00:05:31.630> DNA<00:05:31.990> and

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
this famous double helix that is DNA and

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.900 
this famous double helix that is DNA and
we've<00:05:32.889> produced<00:05:33.310> something<00:05:33.520> pretty<00:05:33.760> similar

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
we've produced something pretty similar

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.820 
we've produced something pretty similar
here<00:05:34.440> with<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.520> light<00:05:36.520> bulb<00:05:36.729> when<00:05:36.910> a<00:05:37.560> laser<00:05:38.560> pen

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
here with a light bulb when a laser pen

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.860 
here with a light bulb when a laser pen
and<00:05:39.039> I<00:05:39.760> think<00:05:40.060> it's<00:05:40.150> pretty<00:05:40.330> good<00:05:40.450> I'm<00:05:40.690> quite

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
and I think it's pretty good I'm quite

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:52.740 
and I think it's pretty good I'm quite
pleased<00:05:41.080> with<00:05:41.110> it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.810
