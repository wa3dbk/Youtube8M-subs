00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
event that they are actually watching my

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.300 
event that they are actually watching my
locker<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:21.430> source<00:04:21.729> engine<00:04:22.020> no<00:04:23.020> no<00:04:23.440> it's<00:04:24.009> kind

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
locker the source engine no no it's kind

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.810 
locker the source engine no no it's kind

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
of time to not to stop using the source

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.800 
of time to not to stop using the source
engine<00:04:28.030> it's<00:04:28.960> really<00:04:29.770> really<00:04:30.610> getting<00:04:31.360> old

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
engine it's really really getting old

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.670 
engine it's really really getting old
like<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:33.759> horsepower<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.780> physics<00:04:35.560> and

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
like the horsepower and the physics and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.589 
like the horsepower and the physics and
everything<00:04:36.009> else<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.460> awesome<00:04:37.150> but<00:04:37.300> the

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
everything else is awesome but the

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.540 
everything else is awesome but the
graphics<00:04:38.080> they're<00:04:38.650> just<00:04:39.070> not<00:04:39.460> there<00:04:40.360> just<00:04:40.389> not

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
graphics they're just not there just not

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.680 
graphics they're just not there just not
this<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.729> 2009<00:04:43.539> soon-to-be<00:04:44.139> 2010<00:04:45.539> you<00:04:46.539> need

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
this is 2009 soon-to-be 2010 you need

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.689 
this is 2009 soon-to-be 2010 you need
something<00:04:46.930> with<00:04:47.139> better<00:04:47.349> graphics<00:04:47.699> you

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
something with better graphics you

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:49.680 
something with better graphics you
should<00:04:48.849> probably<00:04:48.940> use<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.330> source<00:04:49.539> engine

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
should probably use the source engine

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.790 
should probably use the source engine
