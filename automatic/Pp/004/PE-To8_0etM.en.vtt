the<00:01:34.290> idea<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> durability<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.939> light<00:01:36.150> weight

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the idea of durability and light weight

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.929 
the idea of durability and light weight
and<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.770> best<00:01:37.950> way<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.159> achieve<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and the best way to achieve that is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
and the best way to achieve that is
through<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.329> use<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> carbon<00:01:39.960> fiber<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
through the use of carbon fiber it is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.219 
through the use of carbon fiber it is
the<00:01:41.460> strongest<00:01:41.909> lightest<00:01:42.659> highest

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the strongest lightest highest

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.490

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
performance material known and I think

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.139 
performance material known and I think
it's<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:47.040> cool<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.820> think

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it's just really cool you know think

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.410 
it's just really cool you know think
