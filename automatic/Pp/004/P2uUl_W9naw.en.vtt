00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
whatever it's going to be about centered

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.820 
whatever it's going to be about centered
maybe<00:01:08.790> even<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.320> then

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
maybe even a little to the right then

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
maybe even a little to the right then
you're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.460> level<00:01:12.450> medium<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.260> his

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
you're going to go level medium for his

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.929 
you're going to go level medium for his
ear<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.119> that's<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:16.670> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.790> like

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
ear and that's going to be kind of like

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.570 
ear and that's going to be kind of like
pointing<00:01:18.420> off<00:01:18.950> fairly<00:01:20.960> well<00:01:22.310> out<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pointing off fairly well out of the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.179 
pointing off fairly well out of the
picture<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.770> you're<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> have

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
picture and then you're going to have

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.929 
picture and then you're going to have
the<00:01:26.549> inside<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> his<00:01:27.090> ear<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.640> as<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.909> see

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the inside of his ear and as you can see

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.880 
the inside of his ear and as you can see
I<00:01:30.119> chose<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> color<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.290> three<00:01:31.619> left

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
I chose a color that's like three left

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.660 
I chose a color that's like three left
from<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> black<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:35.750> next<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.950> heat<00:01:38.159> mighty

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
from the black and next the heat mighty

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.330 
from the black and next the heat mighty
mouse<00:01:38.909> has<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:41.479> weird<00:01:43.159> different<00:01:44.159> color

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
mouse has on the weird different color

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.730 
mouse has on the weird different color
face<00:01:44.700> from<00:01:45.060> his<00:01:45.180> skin<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> used<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:47.210> 3<00:01:48.210> rounded

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
face from his skin so I used a 3 rounded

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.899 
face from his skin so I used a 3 rounded
and<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.100> thought<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.369> worked<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.820> pretty

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and I thought that worked out pretty

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.319 
and I thought that worked out pretty
well<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.070> would<00:01:53.369> definitely<00:01:53.399> advise<00:01:54.000> using

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
well so I would definitely advise using

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.960 
well so I would definitely advise using
that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
that

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.560 
that
and<00:01:56.480> then<00:01:56.870> from<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:58.490> little<00:01:58.790> thing<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.360> has

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
and then from the little thing that has

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.660 
and then from the little thing that has
mouth<00:02:01.210> part<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.560> going<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.620> i'm<00:02:03.830> using<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.310> beret

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
mouth part is going to i'm using a beret

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.889 
mouth part is going to i'm using a beret
and<00:02:05.090> then<00:02:05.930> change<00:02:06.230> that<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.770> flesh<00:02:07.130> color

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
and then change that to the flesh color

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.300 
and then change that to the flesh color
and<00:02:11.170> here<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.440> can<00:02:12.620> kind<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.890> mix<00:02:13.070> around

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
and here you can kind of mix around

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.040 
and here you can kind of mix around
these<00:02:13.670> steps<00:02:14.000> whichever<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.780> like<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:17.050> you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
these steps whichever you like but I you

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.650 
these steps whichever you like but I you
went<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:18.800> put<00:02:18.980> his<00:02:19.070> on<00:02:19.280> next<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.510> that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
went and put his on next it's in that

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.070 
went and put his on next it's in that
top<00:02:20.990> little<00:02:21.380> alcove<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:23.360> would<00:02:23.510> call<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.840> that

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
top little alcove you would call it that

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.950 
top little alcove you would call it that
i'm<00:02:24.230> not<00:02:24.380> sure<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:24.710> anyways<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:25.790> put<00:02:26.090> ival

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
i'm not sure but anyways just put ival

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.570 
i'm not sure but anyways just put ival
medium<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.650> then<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.790> circle<00:02:29.660> as<00:02:29.780> its<00:02:29.959> pupil

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
medium and then a circle as its pupil

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.090 
medium and then a circle as its pupil
then<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.820> can<00:02:31.940> put<00:02:32.120> his<00:02:32.209> nose<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:33.010> will<00:02:34.010> be

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
then you can put his nose on will be

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.760 
then you can put his nose on will be
around<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.400> tip<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.880> beret<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.770> that'll

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
around the tip of the beret and that'll

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.040 
around the tip of the beret and that'll
be<00:02:36.860> black<00:02:37.130> i<00:02:37.400> think<00:02:37.610> i<00:02:37.700> use<00:02:37.850> another<00:02:38.150> pencil

medium for that as well and then here

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.660 
medium for that as well and then here
this<00:02:43.459> is<00:02:43.760> probably<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.240> most<00:02:44.510> essential<00:02:44.840> part

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
this is probably the most essential part

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.490 
this is probably the most essential part
there's<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.760> big<00:02:46.940> cap<00:02:47.300> right<00:02:47.570> there<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.170> you're

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
there's a big cap right there and you're

there's a big cap right there and you're
going<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.680> want<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.830> fill<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.760> use<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
going to want to fill that in I use the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.780 
going to want to fill that in I use the
Oval<00:02:51.140> medium<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.680> made<00:02:51.920> flesh<00:02:52.250> color<00:02:52.580> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
Oval medium and made flesh color and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.630 
Oval medium and made flesh color and
then<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.000> kind<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.240> want<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.510> move<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.080> that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
then you kind of want to move it so that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.949 
then you kind of want to move it so that
it<00:02:55.720> evens<00:02:56.720> out<00:02:56.900> with<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.230> circle<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.959> anyways

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
it evens out with the circle and anyways

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.860 
it evens out with the circle and anyways
you<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.410> tweak<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.920> little<00:03:01.220> bit<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.870> make

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
you can tweak that a little bit and make

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.520 
you can tweak that a little bit and make
it<00:03:03.080> look<00:03:03.230> good<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.300> just<00:03:05.600> use<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.019> curve<00:03:06.320> law

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
it look good then I just use a curve law

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.180 
it look good then I just use a curve law
obviously<00:03:07.010> small<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:08.360> found<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.530> not<00:03:09.739> many<00:03:10.010> of

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.600 
obviously small I found that not many of
the<00:03:10.340> smiles<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.940> are<00:03:11.630> given<00:03:11.870> as<00:03:12.140> layers

the smiles that are given as layers

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.170 
the smiles that are given as layers
