00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
was mentioning in the beginning of this

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.880 
was mentioning in the beginning of this
video<00:00:41.300> that<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.780> called<00:00:42.989> vehicle<00:00:43.590> bounds

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
video that on is called vehicle bounds

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
video that on is called vehicle bounds
and<00:00:44.280> why<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.520> add-on<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.270> helpful<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and why this add-on is so helpful is
