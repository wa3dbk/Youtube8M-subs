00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.880
prison if convicted.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.450
Could gangs be back in

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.490
Kalihi? An increase in

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.090
violent youth is just one

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.890
of the concerns for the

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.920
Kalihi community.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.560
KITV 4's Paul Drewes

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.230
takes a look at some the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.630
negative problems facing

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.430
this neighborhood.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.000
Parts of North King

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.130
Street are still dim,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.730
five months after 55 year

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.040
old dominador aguilar

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.670
junior was hit and killed

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.740
in Kalihi. One of many of

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.370
the deadly pedestrian

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.880
fatalies this year. Where

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.040
he died, a pair of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.610
brighter LED lights have

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.240
gone in, but residents

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.150
are still waiting for the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.710
rest of the dark road to

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.180
be lit up. daniel@1:!3

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.810
there have been

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.410
fatalities here in Kalihi

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.050
in the past few months,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.850
over a quarter mile strip

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.480
of road, we just want to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360
make the situation better

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.190
While the city

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.790
plans to switch the

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.230
lampost lighting to the

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.800
brighter LEDs -- a

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.430
timetable to do that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.230
hasn't been given to the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.830
community. Dim

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.400
streetlights aren't the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.070
only reason Kalihi is

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.770
going through a dark

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.310
time. 2:33 we are having

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.640
youth violence, gang

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.140
violence it seems to be

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.740
centered around

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.780
farrington violence like

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.410
this captured on video

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.420
has some worried about a

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.120
resurgence of gangs and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.450
the problems they bring.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.050
37:20 they're seeing more

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.960
of the weapons and more

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.560
of the fights 3:13 there

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.130
have been big fights, a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160
woman said they were

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.730
running through the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.300
housing project with

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.300
knives and a handgun.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.930
When it gets to that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.700
level something needs to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.330
be done Just this past

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.870
Monday, a teen pulled out

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.900
a gun on the Kalihi

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.470
street. But that was not

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.740
the only surprise from

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.340
area youth. malakai@38:14

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.910
they're not afraid when

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.310
it comes to fighting,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.880
recently there was

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.550
firearm branded and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.900
nobody ran. In fact, many

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.590
gather around. Crowds of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.420
spectators come out to

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.020
see the violence, even

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.620
given advanced notice of

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.460
fights or challenges on

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.060
social media posted by

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.130
gang members. 36:29 they

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.760
have been taught how to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.330
use this technology, and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.900
they are using to do

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.370
negative behaviors.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.930
Posting things,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.300
challenging people to

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.840
fight from other

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.210
communities.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.810
To help deal with the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.410
increase in violence, a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.980
task force formed to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.640
bring together those

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.910
impacted by it, and those

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.950
who may be able to reach

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.580
the teens themselves. The

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.080
group says combating the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.920
violence will be a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.520
challenge, without any

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.090
city or state funds and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.890
some in the community

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.460
don't even want to admit

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.810
there is a problem to
