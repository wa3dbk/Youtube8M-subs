while<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.410> was<00:00:01.589> first<00:00:02.120> diagnosed<00:00:03.120> with<00:00:03.300> breast

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
while I was first diagnosed with breast

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.629 
while I was first diagnosed with breast
cancer<00:00:03.600> in<00:00:03.959> 2001<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:06.230> my<00:00:07.230> immediate<00:00:07.639> reaction

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
cancer in 2001 and my immediate reaction

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.280 
cancer in 2001 and my immediate reaction
was<00:00:08.690> this<00:00:09.690> wasn't<00:00:09.929> possible<00:00:10.230> because<00:00:10.920> that

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
was this wasn't possible because that

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.230 
was this wasn't possible because that
was<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.429> things<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.880> had<00:00:15.089> never

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
was one of the things that I had never

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.480 
was one of the things that I had never
worried<00:00:15.599> about<00:00:15.800> anyway<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.949> got<00:00:17.130> through<00:00:17.340> that

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
worried about anyway we got through that

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.300 
worried about anyway we got through that
initial<00:00:17.970> thing<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.900> initial<00:00:19.350> diagnosis<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
initial thing the initial diagnosis and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
initial thing the initial diagnosis and
all<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> treatment<00:00:20.939> for<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.240> year<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:23.330> then

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
all the treatment for that year and then

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.029 
all the treatment for that year and then
I<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.660> continued<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.439> checkups<00:00:25.710> every

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
I just continued to have checkups every

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.089 
I just continued to have checkups every
year<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.019> gradually<00:00:28.019> over<00:00:28.050> time<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.830> kind<00:00:29.010> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
year and gradually over time it kind of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.790 
year and gradually over time it kind of
faded<00:00:29.490> from<00:00:29.640> my<00:00:29.849> memory<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:31.199> past<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
faded from my memory I I got past it I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.470 
faded from my memory I I got past it I
was<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.309> oh<00:00:32.430> yeah<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.969> something<00:00:33.180> that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
was like oh yeah that was something that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
was like oh yeah that was something that
happened<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> me<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> long<00:00:34.260> time<00:00:34.320> ago<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.100> it

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
happened to me a long time ago and it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.200 
happened to me a long time ago and it
wasn't<00:00:35.910> fun<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.559> I'm<00:00:37.559> done<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:37.829> it

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
wasn't fun but I'm done with it

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
wasn't fun but I'm done with it
so<00:00:40.280> unfortunately<00:00:41.360> just<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.570> February<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
so unfortunately just in February of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.970 
so unfortunately just in February of
2009<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.820> found<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.230> cancer<00:00:46.649> had

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
2009 I found out that the cancer had

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.479 
2009 I found out that the cancer had
recurred<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.110> bones<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.100> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
recurred and it was in my bones and so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.799 
recurred and it was in my bones and so
then<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.680> unfortunately<00:00:52.680> incurable

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
then it is unfortunately incurable

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.000 
then it is unfortunately incurable
originally<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> was<00:00:55.230> diagnosed<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
originally when I was diagnosed I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.459 
originally when I was diagnosed I
thought<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.550> could<00:00:57.180> die<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.320> could

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
thought I could die you know this could

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.069 
thought I could die you know this could
be<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.039> could<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.539> taken<00:01:00.539> away<00:01:00.719> from<00:01:00.780> my

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
be it I could be taken away from my

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.060 
be it I could be taken away from my
family<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.100> year<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.030> two<00:01:03.239> years<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.809> then

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
family in a year or two years and then

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.190 
family in a year or two years and then
when<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.309> seemingly<00:01:05.729> cured<00:01:06.150> those<00:01:06.840> fears

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
when I was seemingly cured those fears

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590 
when I was seemingly cured those fears
were<00:01:07.740> gone<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.580> didn't<00:01:09.150> even<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.420> about

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
were gone and I didn't even think about

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.980 
were gone and I didn't even think about
them<00:01:09.900> anymore<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.590> time<00:01:11.360> it's<00:01:12.360> real<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
them anymore and this time it's real I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:22.660 
them anymore and this time it's real I
mean<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.350> true<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.460> realized<00:01:21.330> that

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
mean it's true and so I realized that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.980 
mean it's true and so I realized that
this<00:01:23.670> time

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.590 

this<00:01:31.560> time<00:01:31.920> they're<00:01:32.159> typically<00:01:32.700> West<00:01:32.939> could

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
this time they're typically West could

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.710 
this time they're typically West could
be<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> minute<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.700> would<00:01:35.880> most<00:01:36.119> likely<00:01:36.210> be

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
be a minute and it would most likely be

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
be a minute and it would most likely be
because<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> cancer<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:40.610> my<00:01:41.610> biggest

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
because of the cancer and my biggest

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.740 
because of the cancer and my biggest
concern<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.659> point<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.799> my<00:01:43.950> family

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
concern at that point was for my family

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.740 
concern at that point was for my family
are<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.380> sad<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.920> them<00:01:47.750> because

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
are you know really sad for them because

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.600 
are you know really sad for them because
I<00:01:48.899> knew<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.229> hard<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:50.039> to<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.369> for

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
I knew how hard it was going to be for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.649 
I knew how hard it was going to be for
them<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.869> felt<00:01:52.110> sad<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.350> me<00:01:52.679> because<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
them and I felt sad for me because I

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.620 
them and I felt sad for me because I
really<00:01:54.659> wanted<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:55.640> spend<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.880> much<00:01:57.030> time<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.360> I

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
really wanted to spend as much time as I

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.399 
really wanted to spend as much time as I
could<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:57.990> my<00:01:58.170> grandchildren<00:01:58.679> and<00:02:00.170> be<00:02:01.170> there

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
could with my grandchildren and be there

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.090 
could with my grandchildren and be there
to<00:02:01.530> watch<00:02:01.649> them<00:02:02.009> grow<00:02:02.189> up<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:04.110> such

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
to watch them grow up that I have such

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.980 
to watch them grow up that I have such
an<00:02:05.280> incredible<00:02:05.399> family<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.659> love

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
an incredible family that I just love

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.749 
an incredible family that I just love
spending<00:02:07.350> time<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.920> them<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.340> being<00:02:08.519> with

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
spending time with them and being with

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.999 
spending time with them and being with
them<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.959> was<00:02:10.080> really<00:02:10.110> hard<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.619> me<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
them and it was really hard for me to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.720 
them and it was really hard for me to
realize<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.700> wasn't<00:02:11.940> going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.330> happen

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
realize that that wasn't going to happen

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.820 
realize that that wasn't going to happen
but<00:02:14.730> at<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> same<00:02:15.269> time<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:16.250> realized<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.640> I

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
but at the same time I realized that I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.559 
but at the same time I realized that I
wasn't<00:02:19.830> guaranteed<00:02:20.519> any<00:02:20.880> time<00:02:21.120> here<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.540> earth

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
wasn't guaranteed any time here on earth

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.390 
wasn't guaranteed any time here on earth
and<00:02:22.080> I've<00:02:22.650> never<00:02:22.890> thought<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:25.250> guess<00:02:26.250> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and I've never thought that I guess I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.250 
and I've never thought that I guess I
can<00:02:26.580> say<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.819> never<00:02:27.390> thought<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.810> I've<00:02:27.959> been

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
can say I never thought that I've been
