gonna hit the B key for brush and I'm

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.120 
gonna hit the B key for brush and I'm
going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> paint

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
going to go in here and I like to paint

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.999 
going to go in here and I like to paint
just<00:01:17.610> inside<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.570> around<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> middle<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
just inside I around the middle I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.560 
just inside I around the middle I
usually<00:01:20.310> avoid<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> whites<00:01:20.850> although

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
usually avoid the whites although

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
usually avoid the whites although
sometimes<00:01:21.780> i<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.110> painting<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.590> usually<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
sometimes i do painting but usually it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
sometimes i do painting but usually it
ends<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.729> looking<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.240> too<00:01:24.450> fake<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
ends up looking a little too fake and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
ends up looking a little too fake and
plasticky<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:25.920> i'm<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> avoid<00:01:26.790> that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.429
