a very long time we're gonna you're
gonna<00:00:10.200> spawn<00:00:10.530> generally<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.730> side<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
gonna spawn generally on the side of the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.330 
gonna spawn generally on the side of the
mountain<00:00:12.210> somewhere<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:13.380> as<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.769> take<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
mountain somewhere but as you can take a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.400 
mountain somewhere but as you can take a
look<00:00:14.639> at<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.599> pretty<00:00:15.660> huge<00:00:16.199> you're

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
look at it it's pretty huge you're

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.599 
look at it it's pretty huge you're
pretty<00:00:16.619> far<00:00:16.949> up<00:00:16.980> already

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
pretty far up already

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.890 
pretty far up already
I<00:00:17.640> mean<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.119> don't<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.660> too<00:00:18.720> far

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I mean you don't have to go too far

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.870 
I mean you don't have to go too far
until<00:00:19.770> you're<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> top<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
until you're on the top of it

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.420 
until you're on the top of it
which<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.930> about<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.859> 180

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
which is at about I think like 180

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.130 
which is at about I think like 180
aren't<00:00:26.430> 78

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
aren't 78

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.810 
aren't 78
but<00:00:28.140> anyways<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> seed<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.099> gonna<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.609> right

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
but anyways a seed is gonna be right

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490 
but anyways a seed is gonna be right
there<00:00:30.119> also<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.720> description<00:00:31.170> box<00:00:31.289> to

which<00:00:54.899> could<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.320> used<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> build<00:00:56.640> some<00:00:56.969> pretty

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
which could be used to build some pretty

coordinates<00:04:54.560> for<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:54.800> real<00:04:55.010> quick<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.490> I'll

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
coordinates for this real quick and I'll

is negative 152 but anyways that is
pretty<00:05:13.700> much<00:05:13.850> it<00:05:14.150> um<00:05:14.620> I'm<00:05:15.620> thinking<00:05:16.130> about

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
pretty much it um I'm thinking about

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.670 
pretty much it um I'm thinking about
might<00:05:16.910> be<00:05:16.940> doing<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.510> video<00:05:17.960> every<00:05:18.110> other<00:05:18.380> day

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
might be doing a video every other day

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.890 
might be doing a video every other day
or<00:05:19.160> if<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.400> do<00:05:19.460> on<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:20.030> day<00:05:20.270> that<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.510> normally

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
or if I do on the day that I normally

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.180 
or if I do on the day that I normally
wouldn't<00:05:21.290> do<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.500> video<00:05:21.710> I'd<00:05:21.860> do<00:05:21.980> like<00:05:22.010> a

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
wouldn't do a video I'd do like a

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.800 
wouldn't do a video I'd do like a
different<00:05:22.460> type<00:05:22.580> of<00:05:22.610> Minecraft<00:05:23.060> video<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.630> do

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.810 
minecraft seed videos every other day
that<00:05:26.120> way<00:05:27.040> because<00:05:28.040> people<00:05:28.250> don't<00:05:28.730> really

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
that way because people don't really

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.510 
that way because people don't really
seem<00:05:29.210> to<00:05:29.240> care<00:05:29.360> for<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:30.340> playthrough<00:05:31.340> type

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.180 
seem to care for the playthrough type
videos<00:05:31.880> or<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.390> other<00:05:33.200> stuff<00:05:33.320> type<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:33.950> videos
