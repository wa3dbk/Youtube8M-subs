00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 for him 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 one 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 I 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.230
 that debate is expected 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.570
 we need 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.810
 a glass container a florist scissors 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.630
 and a sprinkler with water we started the assembly of the day center 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.140
 We cut 20 branches of steelmakers about 15 centimeters long 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.400
 It is worth clarifying that the importance of these two initial branches because they are the ones that go 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.340
 to speak length to the network muqui of them will depend the final size 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.610
 let's follow the arrangement 90 degrees 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.420
 we added another two branches of roasting January in the same way as the previous ones 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.920
 one on each side forming a cross 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.520
 the objective in this case to place these first branches and even 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.829
 points out that nuances the work, optimizing many what it imposes 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.099
 armed especially says that prepares number of arrangements 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.189
 to complete the outline we place branches of knowledge 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.689
 ona next to each other putting the empty spaces 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.839
 Once the outline is completed we give height the arrangement 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.839
 placing a branch spend in the center 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.779
 to achieve quorum in you dome shape of the region we place branches of 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.019
 interim grill 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.489
 and approximately two centimeters below the central branch we're going 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.079
 throwing container and completing all empty spaces form back until 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.179
 finish 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.089
 once the assembly of pits and 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:03:00.829
 we started to place the flowers we chose 5 daisies of the same color in this 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.179
 yellow case 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.599
 we are located as follows 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.439
 2 on the edge of the container one on each side respecting the length 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.609
 we make a half kilo of containers and place two more margaritas hello 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.259
 mom again the cross 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:22.329
 the remaining daisy is placed in the center giving the maximum height 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.239
 region 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.219
 now we choose daisies of another color 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.579
 in this case white and we add them in the base of the container 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.549
 to work in volume we incorporate daisies of varied colors 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.859
 contemplating distributing the tones and placing them in an indignant manner 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.759
 we respect the maximum height and can achieve a round goal format 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.659
 ospina 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:35.710
 yes
