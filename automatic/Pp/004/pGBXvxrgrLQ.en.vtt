00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 faces one more beautiful than the other 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.460
 and it is worth every single facet 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.200

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.560

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.560
 advantages 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.380
 worse when one car on his 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.840

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.360
 Wanderbus is kreutzer quarter as well as to 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.040

 tyrol on the way 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.880
 my personal highlight is he 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.160
 smiles 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.100
 the best signposted cycle path is 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.350

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.010
 for families and cyclists it is enjoyable 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.710
 along the river 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.310
 I start my turin stands and then 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 to Rome 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.570
 From time to time I also approve one 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.970
 break at one of the many 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.970
 different cookies directly on the net 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.450
 easy downhill along the lech along with great 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.740
 then back for me and that was the wheel 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.740
 free by bus 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.640
 high and in the middle of ours 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.100
 Great throw comes with ours 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.729
 free or reduced summer 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.729
 catch on 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.860
 He traveled quite comfortably to gain height 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.450
 and enjoy the two to the fullest 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.920
 a tour I can recommend you here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.480
 is the hike over the lechtaler 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.340
 Panorama as a hiker is easy 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.190
 the free mountain railway with the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.170
 church top bach and his hike 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.170
 then already at 1800 meters altitude 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.909
 the hike on the panoramic path to the railway 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.680
 has three hours and is a great one 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.039

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.039
 scenery 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.330
 So consider swinging it says and 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.950

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.060
