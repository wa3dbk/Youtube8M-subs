00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello girls good today I bring you a 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.529
 different video in 23 months will be 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.990
 taking a treatment I will be doing 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.000
 an experiment with oils for 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.210
 well that as they grow 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.130
 eyelashes lengthen them in pink and I 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.500
 the idea arose when buying this mascara of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.680
 ibm when reading your ingredients I gave 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.670
 mind that he had castor oil oil 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.439
 of mamey bone avocado oil 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.250
 also vitamin e I bought it several 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.520
 jars with these oils the bone 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.520
 mamey 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.030
 avocado oil 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.160
 Castor oil 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.010
 and I also bought this almond 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.450
 and I mixed all of them in this boat our 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.360
 dough 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.440
 in equal parts 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.859
 I will place a drop 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.969
 and what I will do will be with soft touches 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.969
 without rubbing 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.610
 I will not put in all the roots the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.610
 tabs 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.180
 and also here along the tab 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.030
 preventing it from entering our eye 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.640
 and I'm also going to put here 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.030
 in the lower 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.660
 if I'm going to keep my eye from coming in 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.940
 may cause me some irritation or I 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.130
 You can put as blurred vision 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.860
 this I will be doing all the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.990
 nights after removing makeup and before 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.330
 to sleep I prefer to do it this way 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.870
 using a cotonete that a disc of 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.780
 cotton because I think it's wasted more 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.040
 salt more oil using the disk 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.070
 seen here on youtube also that 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.619
 They recommend removing makeup using 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.350
 a combination of oils 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.200
 I would not use it so after 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.390
 make-up remover I always wash my face and 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.490
 I think it would not cause the great effect on 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.220
 my eyelashes would not absorb it well 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.810
 my eyelashes as I tell them I'm going to 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.100
 leave all night and in the morning 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.780
 next I'll be playing 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.850
 during a good time at the end of the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.250
 I'll show you the treatment 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.610
 before and after pictures to see if 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.020
 yes yes it works or if it does not work well 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.240
 girls I hope you liked the video 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.610
 If you have any questions 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.470
 Any comments, suggestions or 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.780
 some tip that we want to leave 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.470
 they do not write it down here and we 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.470
 we see in the next
