 traffic lights and traffic signs the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.310

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.100
 vial 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.920
 and let's talk about a very advice 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.460
 important about something that few people 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.460
 knows 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.170
 it is very risky to drive stuck to the 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.000
 garrison you can find obstacles 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.800
 like pedestrian or car sewers 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.870
 parked that could force from 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.099
 perform a dangerous maneuver in 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.930
 high speed streets 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.900
 you must circulate in the right half of the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.019
 Lane in narrow streets positions t in 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.160
 the center of these the idea is not to leave 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.200
 spaces that invite 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.090
 motorists to overtake you dangerous 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.800
 minute you have the right to occupy a 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 complete lane to circulate through the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.640
 city if a driver is reached 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.480
 despair shows a kind attitude and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.480
 thank you for your wait 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.740
 this advice is about something we have 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.740
 what to do when stopping at traffic lights 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.709
 never forget to stand in front of 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.349
 cars when you stop at a traffic light 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.390
 this is very important because you 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.640
 it allows you to start before and everyone 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.190
 see clearly so you will be much more 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.140
 sure at the crossings the way you 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.790
 we stand can help protect us 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.260
 when driving by bicycle the most 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.150
 important is that the drivers of 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.239
 auto have us always in your field of 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.239
 view 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.170
 there is a big difference between playing and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.710
 circulate on the street and can be very 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.710
 important 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.640
 how 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.469
 driving on a bike and zigzagging can be 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.709
 fun but the streets are not the 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.879
 place for it do not risk your life 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.730
 sexuality can be a sample of 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.260
 irresponsibility as cyclist always 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.659
 you must follow a predictable path 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.130
 the best way is to try to keep yourself 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.290
 in line with the other vehicles 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.320
 take care do not play with your bike in the 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.320
 city 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.280
 and this advice is very important for you 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.280
 security 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.780
 public transport and taxis do 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.940
 stops all the time to go up and 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.620
 lower passage there are also trucks 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.859
 load that can be stopped at any 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.479
 moment you have to be very alert to 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.880
 time to pass any truck or 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.860
 taxi that stands do it carefully and 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.570
 always on the left you should have 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.500
 all your senses put in front 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.500
 while you drive 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.200
 this is a key advice when you do not 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.670
 harden cracks are a place where 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.670
 you must act in a special way 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.680
 remember to always stay in line with 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.229
 the cars while you are giving 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.300
 turn to a gazebo otherwise you 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.039
 can box very carefully in 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.870
 the cracks because when placed in a 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.270
 end of the lane the cars can 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.440
 ignore that you're there until 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.440
 predictable trajectory 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.309
 we are all pedestrians at some point 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.619
 we have to walk the streets of the 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:10.369
 city when riding a bike is important 

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:10.369
 that you respect them 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.050
 always keep in mind the people who 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.940
 walk on the sidewalks that is an area 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.770
 for people not for bikes and 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.060
 we must respect them is important not 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.190
 stand on the steps 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.350
 pedestrians but the green areas of 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.720
 wait cyclist adjacent to the steps 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.180
 pedestrian that has not been a pedestrian 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.410
 time the place for you and for your bike is 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.410
 the street not the sidewalks 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.729
 let's talk about something a bit obvious 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.729
 but not many do 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.219
 i 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.049
 not because we ride a bike and be a 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:51.719
 means of transport smaller than 

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:53.819
 cars we can go in the opposite direction is 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.499
 very dangerous because pedestrians and 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.659
 car drivers coming out of 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.309
 garages always look in the sense of 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.099
 circulation to join or 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:03.889
 crossing the street is also a lack of 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.209
 transit regulations 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.769
 it does not matter if it's going to be a big street 

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:09.769
 or girl circle in the right sense 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.029
 if you have to move by bike at night 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.530
 You must know the perfection of 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:22.470
 next 15 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.720
 and 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.160
 If you travel on your bike at night you should 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.070
 keep in mind several things 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.110
 the lights must work correctly 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.180
 wear visible clothing and always stay 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.130
 alert if in the day you should be alert 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.780
 in the night much more do that the 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.100
 motorists see you and not you 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.100
 distract for my reasons 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.120
 we have reached the end of this great 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.410
 ride while riding a bicycle 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.960
 city you have to be very careful 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.200
 pay attention and obey all 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.780
 Signs behind salt walk the subject no 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.190
 Smart is free and saves time and 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.210
 do not forget all the advice that you 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.210
 we have given in this video
