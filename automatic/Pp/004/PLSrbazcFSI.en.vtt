00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
temperature and the seconds day you can

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.410 
temperature and the seconds day you can
also<00:01:13.680> adjust<00:01:13.890> different<00:01:14.400> modes<00:01:14.580> big<00:01:15.180> thing<00:01:15.360> on

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
also adjust different modes big thing on

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.010 
also adjust different modes big thing on
this<00:01:16.130> is<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> different<00:01:17.640> modes<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:18.810> even

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
this is the different modes they even

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.780 
this is the different modes they even
said<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.260> able<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.800> done<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.980> V<00:01:20.220> will<00:01:20.520> see

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
said it's able to just done a V will see

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.580 
said it's able to just done a V will see
which<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.390> wet<00:01:21.600> weather<00:01:21.870> then<00:01:22.560> we

which is for like wet weather then we
start<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.010> to<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.280> maybe<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.360> could<00:01:24.510> be

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
start on to see maybe go could be

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.930 
start on to see maybe go could be
actually<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.680> quite<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> nice<00:01:26.010> three<00:01:26.280> runs<00:01:26.550> 18
