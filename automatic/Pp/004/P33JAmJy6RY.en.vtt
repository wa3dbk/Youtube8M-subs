this laptop you guys never really see it

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.470 
this laptop you guys never really see it
on<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.110> show<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:15.220> because<00:02:15.370> wanted<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.760> work

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480

laptop and don't really use it for
personal<00:02:18.160> reasons<00:02:18.580> but<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.780> reason<00:02:19.959> why<00:02:20.110> i'm

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
personal reasons but the reason why i'm

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.300 
personal reasons but the reason why i'm
using<00:02:20.410> this<00:02:20.470> laptop<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.860> because<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.190> actually

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
using this laptop is because it actually

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.890 
using this laptop is because it actually
has<00:02:21.520> bent<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:21.970> bottom<00:02:22.270> for<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.660> really

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
has bent on the bottom for it and really

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.740 
has bent on the bottom for it and really
benefit<00:02:23.319> from<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.650> laptop<00:02:23.890> cooler<00:02:24.490> my<00:02:25.120> lenovo

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
benefit from a laptop cooler my lenovo

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.300 
benefit from a laptop cooler my lenovo
has<00:02:25.900> no<00:02:26.230> vents<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.709> bottom<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
has no vents on the bottom and the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.820 
has no vents on the bottom and the
reason<00:02:27.610> for<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.870> don't<00:02:29.230> know<00:02:29.349> why<00:02:29.560> but

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
reason for that is I don't know why but

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.290 
reason for that is I don't know why but
lenovo<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> way<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.580> designer<00:02:30.880> things<00:02:31.180> is

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
lenovo the way the designer things is

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.699 
lenovo the way the designer things is
really<00:02:31.540> good<00:02:31.660> actually<00:02:31.900> use<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.200> casing<00:02:32.620> as

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
really good actually use the casing as

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.740 
really good actually use the casing as
heat<00:02:32.890> sink<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.520> runs<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.060> efficient<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
heat sink so it runs so efficient the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.630 
heat sink so it runs so efficient the
laptop<00:02:35.110> cooler<00:02:35.349> did<00:02:35.739> absolutely<00:02:35.950> nothing<00:02:36.190> to

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
it it just made the bottom feel colder

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.530 
it it just made the bottom feel colder
but<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.200> temperatures<00:02:38.530> didn't<00:02:38.800> go<00:02:39.010> anywhere

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
but the temperatures didn't go anywhere

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.610 
but the temperatures didn't go anywhere
but<00:02:40.540> with<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:40.780> laptop<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.230> laptop<00:02:41.590> with

because<00:03:21.510> it's<00:03:21.990> no<00:03:22.440> clips<00:03:22.770> no<00:03:22.980> nothing<00:03:23.340> it's

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
because it's no clips no nothing it's

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.650 
because it's no clips no nothing it's
not<00:03:23.640> really<00:03:23.850> going<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.090> break<00:03:24.300> from<00:03:24.480> that

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
not really going to break from that

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.050 
not really going to break from that
because<00:03:25.590> it's<00:03:25.800> all<00:03:25.890> magnets<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.670> there's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
because it's all magnets so there's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
because it's all magnets so there's
about<00:03:27.180> eight<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.570> them<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.780> hold<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:27.959> all

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
about eight of them that hold it all

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.470 
about eight of them that hold it all
together<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.560> Bill<00:03:29.310> it'll<00:03:29.520> be<00:03:29.580> like<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.360> it's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
together and Bill it'll be like so it's

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.210 
together and Bill it'll be like so it's
got<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:30.750> nice<00:03:30.930> sturdy<00:03:31.380> piece<00:03:31.740> of<00:03:31.920> metal<00:03:32.070> here

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
got this nice sturdy piece of metal here

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.460 
got this nice sturdy piece of metal here
let<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.850> go<00:03:33.000> flex<00:03:33.270> to<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.510> at<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.440> very

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
let it go flex to it at all so very

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.680 
let it go flex to it at all so very
strong<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.610> got<00:03:35.730> these<00:03:35.850> ed<00:03:36.000> millimeter<00:03:36.420> fans

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
strong you got these ed millimeter fans

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.330 
strong you got these ed millimeter fans
to<00:03:36.959> get<00:03:37.080> two<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.260> them<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.160> look

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
to get two of them and you can look

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.860 
to get two of them and you can look
check<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.700> out<00:03:38.820> look<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.180> can<00:03:39.330> pick<00:03:39.480> them<00:03:39.600> up<00:03:39.690> and

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
check it out look I can pick them up and

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.199 
check it out look I can pick them up and
move<00:03:39.930> them<00:03:40.260> wherever<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.830> want<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.150> the

to wear this laptop gets hot so I know

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.710 
to wear this laptop gets hot so I know
the<00:04:04.980> CPU<00:04:05.430> stuff<00:04:05.820> sits<00:04:06.060> around<00:04:06.180> here<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:06.630> we're

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
the CPU stuff sits around here so we're

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.110 
the CPU stuff sits around here so we're
going<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.900> move<00:04:07.019> one<00:04:07.590> here<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.160> one<00:04:08.220> here<00:04:08.760> like

this because the Rams about here so I'm
going<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.920> cool<00:04:11.100> my<00:04:11.250> ram<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.330> CPU<00:04:13.140> intake

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
going to cool my ram and the CPU intake

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.660 
going to cool my ram and the CPU intake
air<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.800> about<00:04:13.980> here<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.250> I'm<00:04:14.310> going<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.459> cool

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
air is about here so I'm going to cool

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.250 
air is about here so I'm going to cool
that<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.330> this<00:04:15.420> is<00:04:15.480> going<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.690> blow<00:04:15.810> cool<00:04:16.080> air

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
that so this is going to blow cool air

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.370 
that so this is going to blow cool air
on<00:04:16.470> my<00:04:16.650> cpu<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.280> GP<00:04:17.580> in<00:04:17.790> my<00:04:18.000> ram<00:04:18.239> actually<00:04:18.720> and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
on my cpu and GP in my ram actually and

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.490 
on my cpu and GP in my ram actually and
also<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.130> can<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.609> can<00:04:20.760> position<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.840> USB

cable on the left and the right side of

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.290 
cable on the left and the right side of
the<00:04:25.260> cooler<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:26.190> pretty<00:04:26.520> cool<00:04:26.669> stuff<00:04:27.950> so<00:04:28.950> let's

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
the cooler so pretty cool stuff so let's

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.740 
the cooler so pretty cool stuff so let's
put<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.419> there<00:04:30.800> line<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:31.950> up<00:04:32.510> takes<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:33.660> in

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
put it there line this up takes it in

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.080 
put it there line this up takes it in
looks<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.080> nice<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.470> easy<00:04:34.590> it's<00:04:35.040> light<00:04:35.250> thin<00:04:35.700> so

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
looks a nice and easy it's light thin so

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.520 
looks a nice and easy it's light thin so
ain't<00:04:36.840> know<00:04:36.900> what<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.020> best<00:04:37.200> thing<00:04:37.350> about

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
ain't know what the best thing about

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.990 
ain't know what the best thing about
laptop<00:04:37.919> one<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.340> best<00:04:38.460> things<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.790> reason

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
laptop one of the best things the reason

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.790 
laptop one of the best things the reason
why<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:39.540> wouldn't<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.380> only<00:04:40.530> reason<00:04:40.650> why

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
why like I wouldn't the only reason why

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.560 
why like I wouldn't the only reason why
I<00:04:40.830> would<00:04:40.950> ever<00:04:41.070> buy<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.250> laptop<00:04:41.490> cooler<00:04:42.060> one<00:04:42.479> of

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
I would ever buy a laptop cooler one of

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
I would ever buy a laptop cooler one of
the<00:04:42.630> reasons<00:04:42.870> why<00:04:42.990> is<00:04:43.200> because<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.470> raises

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
the reasons why is because it raises

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.020 
the reasons why is because it raises
laptop<00:04:44.130> up<00:04:44.280> gives<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> bit<00:04:44.640> of<00:04:44.760> an<00:04:44.880> angle

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
laptop up gives it a bit of an angle

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.490 
laptop up gives it a bit of an angle
makes<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.780> bit<00:04:45.870> easier<00:04:45.900> when<00:04:46.260> you're<00:04:46.320> typing

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
makes it a bit easier when you're typing

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.990 
makes it a bit easier when you're typing
or<00:04:46.830> also<00:04:47.070> say<00:04:47.190> you're<00:04:47.340> sitting<00:04:47.640> on<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.729> bed<00:04:47.970> or

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
or also say you're sitting on a bed or

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.020 
or also say you're sitting on a bed or
something<00:04:48.710> when<00:04:49.710> using<00:04:49.860> your<00:04:50.070> laptop<00:04:50.160> makes<00:04:50.940> a

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
something when using your laptop makes a

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.340 
something when using your laptop makes a
lot<00:04:51.210> easier<00:04:51.240> so<00:04:51.660> i<00:04:51.690> just<00:04:51.900> plugged<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.229> in

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
lot easier so i just plugged it in

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.130 
lot easier so i just plugged it in

you<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.590> report<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:58.979> you<00:04:59.070> guys<00:04:59.190> back<00:04:59.400> with<00:04:59.610> the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
you a report to you guys back with the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.230 
you a report to you guys back with the
temperatures

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
temperatures

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.050 
temperatures
and<00:05:00.479> also<00:05:00.900> verna<00:05:01.680> take<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.099> little<00:05:02.280> our

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
and also verna take the little our

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.460 
and also verna take the little our
little<00:05:03.300> heat<00:05:03.419> gun<00:05:03.599> here<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.080> measures

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
little heat gun here and measures

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
little heat gun here and measures
actually<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.800> temperatures<00:05:05.160> of<00:05:05.190> what's

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
actually the temperatures of what's

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.620 
actually the temperatures of what's
coming<00:05:05.580> out<00:05:05.759> of<00:05:05.819> the<00:05:05.910> back<00:05:06.060> of<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.270> laptop<00:05:06.389> and

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
coming out of the back of the laptop and

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
coming out of the back of the laptop and
see<00:05:06.960> if<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.080> actually<00:05:07.139> does<00:05:07.440> make<00:05:07.470> a

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
see if it actually does make a

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.350 
see if it actually does make a
difference<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.250> physical<00:05:08.910> temperatures<00:05:09.240> of

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
difference so physical temperatures of

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.760 
difference so physical temperatures of
the<00:05:09.389> bomb<00:05:09.569> a<00:05:09.599> laptop<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.319> side<00:05:10.500> alright

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
the bomb a laptop and the side alright

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.010 
the bomb a laptop and the side alright
guys<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.310> our<00:05:11.460> conclusions<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.330> temperatures

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
guys so our conclusions and temperatures

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.450 
guys so our conclusions and temperatures
so<00:05:13.199> we<00:05:13.289> saw<00:05:13.470> about<00:05:13.710> a<00:05:13.770> three<00:05:14.069> to<00:05:14.160> four<00:05:14.340> degrees

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
so we saw about a three to four degrees

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.370 
so we saw about a three to four degrees
difference<00:05:15.060> on<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.389> actual<00:05:15.599> core<00:05:15.930> temp<00:05:16.229> and

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
difference on the actual core temp and

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.409 
difference on the actual core temp and
on<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.130> surface<00:05:17.310> temp<00:05:17.669> so<00:05:17.819> when<00:05:17.940> we<00:05:18.030> tempt<00:05:18.330> it

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
on the surface temp so when we tempt it

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.820 
on the surface temp so when we tempt it
here<00:05:18.630> like<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:18.930> we<00:05:19.110> saw<00:05:19.259> a<00:05:19.289> little<00:05:19.530> bit<00:05:19.710> of<00:05:19.770> a

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
here like this we saw a little bit of a

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.400 
here like this we saw a little bit of a
difference<00:05:20.160> which<00:05:20.310> was<00:05:20.460> great<00:05:21.199> one<00:05:22.199> thing

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
difference which was great one thing

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.809 
difference which was great one thing
I've<00:05:22.530> really<00:05:22.830> liked<00:05:23.009> to<00:05:23.130> note<00:05:23.280> mention<00:05:23.669> though

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
I've really liked to note mention though

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.730 
I've really liked to note mention though
your<00:05:24.090> temperatures<00:05:24.479> will<00:05:24.780> vary<00:05:24.990> totally<00:05:25.650> on

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
your temperatures will vary totally on

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.800 
your temperatures will vary totally on
your<00:05:25.770> laptop<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:26.520> many<00:05:26.639> lab<00:05:26.819> every<00:05:27.150> laptops<00:05:27.509> so

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
your laptop so many lab every laptops so

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.689 
your laptop so many lab every laptops so
different<00:05:28.349> nowadays<00:05:28.500> there's<00:05:29.280> no<00:05:29.490> real

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
different nowadays there's no real

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.339 
different nowadays there's no real
standardization<00:05:30.479> of<00:05:30.539> how<00:05:30.690> their<00:05:30.900> cases<00:05:31.259> are

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
standardization of how their cases are

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:32.689 
standardization of how their cases are
which<00:05:31.650> is<00:05:31.770> good<00:05:31.949> because<00:05:32.069> then<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.340> get<00:05:32.430> cool

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
which is good because then you get cool

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.629 
which is good because then you get cool
really<00:05:33.030> cool<00:05:33.060> designs<00:05:33.830> but<00:05:34.830> this<00:05:34.979> will<00:05:35.130> laptop

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
really cool designs but this will laptop

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.490 
really cool designs but this will laptop
laptop<00:05:35.880> coolers<00:05:36.419> in<00:05:36.539> general<00:05:36.960> not<00:05:37.080> just<00:05:37.139> this

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
laptop coolers in general not just this

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.290 
laptop coolers in general not just this
one<00:05:37.650> alone<00:05:37.919> laptops<00:05:38.639> village<00:05:38.880> general<00:05:39.210> will

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
one alone laptops village general will

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.350 
one alone laptops village general will
only<00:05:39.509> work<00:05:39.930> on<00:05:40.139> laptops<00:05:41.069> that<00:05:41.190> have<00:05:41.460> bottom

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
only work on laptops that have bottom

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.270 
only work on laptops that have bottom
mounted<00:05:42.780> ventilation<00:05:43.620> so<00:05:43.740> like<00:05:43.860> this<00:05:44.009> one<00:05:44.159> has

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
mounted ventilation so like this one has

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.740 
mounted ventilation so like this one has
the<00:05:44.699> holes<00:05:45.030> on<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.210> bottom<00:05:45.330> where<00:05:45.539> the<00:05:45.599> fan

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
the holes on the bottom where the fan

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.969 
the holes on the bottom where the fan
actually<00:05:45.900> sucks<00:05:46.319> in<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.560> cool<00:05:46.680> air<00:05:46.800> from<00:05:46.889> the

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
actually sucks in the cool air from the

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.740 
actually sucks in the cool air from the
bottom<00:05:47.310> laptop<00:05:47.639> and<00:05:47.819> ports<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.360> out<00:05:48.419> the<00:05:48.539> side

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
bottom laptop and ports it out the side

bottom laptop and ports it out the side
now<00:05:49.409> this<00:05:49.650> Lenovo<00:05:50.130> I<00:05:50.159> have<00:05:50.430> which<00:05:50.610> we

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
now this Lenovo I have which we

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.070 
now this Lenovo I have which we
originally<00:05:51.090> tested<00:05:51.389> on<00:05:51.449> didn't<00:05:51.780> do<00:05:51.840> anything

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
originally tested on didn't do anything

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.600 
originally tested on didn't do anything
because<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:52.500> doesn't<00:05:52.800> suck<00:05:52.919> any<00:05:53.130> air<00:05:53.340> from<00:05:53.520> the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
because it doesn't suck any air from the

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.939 
because it doesn't suck any air from the
bottom<00:05:53.940> now<00:05:54.120> it<00:05:55.080> did<00:05:55.229> make<00:05:55.319> the<00:05:55.380> bottom<00:05:55.830> of<00:05:55.889> the

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
bottom now it did make the bottom of the

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.559 
bottom now it did make the bottom of the
laptop<00:05:56.069> run<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.460> bit<00:05:56.610> cooler<00:05:56.909> probably<00:05:57.449> made<00:05:57.539> a

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
laptop run a bit cooler probably made a

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.330 
laptop run a bit cooler probably made a
few<00:05:57.780> components<00:05:58.050> run<00:05:58.349> cooler<00:05:58.500> but<00:05:59.009> not<00:05:59.190> your

few components run cooler but not your
CPU<00:05:59.729> and<00:05:59.819> GPU<00:05:59.880> I<00:06:00.240> saw<00:06:00.449> no<00:06:00.720> temperature

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
CPU and GPU I saw no temperature

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.350 
CPU and GPU I saw no temperature
difference<00:06:01.830> because<00:06:02.430> it<00:06:02.669> sucks<00:06:02.880> all<00:06:03.090> its<00:06:03.210> cool

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360

degrees<00:06:23.460> as<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:23.729> said<00:06:23.969> and<00:06:24.120> also<00:06:24.750> it<00:06:24.870> might<00:06:24.960> make

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
degrees as I said and also it might make

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.659 
degrees as I said and also it might make
your<00:06:25.259> hard<00:06:25.469> drive<00:06:25.650> run<00:06:25.830> cooler<00:06:25.949> if<00:06:26.190> it's<00:06:26.340> near

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
your hard drive run cooler if it's near

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.629 
your hard drive run cooler if it's near
that<00:06:26.849> area<00:06:27.139> because<00:06:28.139> it's<00:06:28.380> it's<00:06:29.219> not<00:06:29.370> just

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
that area because it's it's not just

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.100 
that area because it's it's not just
blowing<00:06:29.849> air<00:06:30.180> into<00:06:30.210> those<00:06:30.569> holes<00:06:30.780> but<00:06:30.960> it's

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
blowing air into those holes but it's

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.360 
blowing air into those holes but it's
how<00:06:31.169> blowing<00:06:31.500> it<00:06:31.590> all<00:06:31.710> around<00:06:31.889> the<00:06:32.009> Banda

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
how blowing it all around the Banda

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.950 
how blowing it all around the Banda
laptop<00:06:32.729> so<00:06:32.849> overall<00:06:33.240> a<00:06:33.270> general<00:06:33.599> temperature

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
laptop so overall a general temperature

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.170 
laptop so overall a general temperature
will<00:06:34.259> run<00:06:34.469> cooler<00:06:34.650> which<00:06:34.979> is<00:06:35.099> great<00:06:35.310> so<00:06:35.759> laptop

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
will run cooler which is great so laptop

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.490 
will run cooler which is great so laptop
clear<00:06:36.360> do<00:06:36.539> a<00:06:36.599> good<00:06:36.750> job<00:06:36.810> on<00:06:36.960> that<00:06:37.080> but<00:06:37.380> this

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
clear do a good job on that but this

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.649 
clear do a good job on that but this
one's<00:06:37.740> better<00:06:37.979> than<00:06:38.250> other<00:06:38.729> ones<00:06:39.000> because<00:06:39.539> you

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
one's better than other ones because you

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.300 
one's better than other ones because you
have<00:06:39.810> the<00:06:39.930> magnets<00:06:40.319> you<00:06:40.409> can<00:06:40.560> chip<00:06:40.860> your<00:06:41.039> fans

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
have the magnets you can chip your fans

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.649 
have the magnets you can chip your fans
where<00:06:41.490> exactly<00:06:41.759> where<00:06:42.090> you<00:06:42.210> want<00:06:42.449> them<00:06:42.539> you

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
where exactly where you want them you

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:44.689 
where exactly where you want them you
can<00:06:42.810> pinpoint<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:43.469> hot<00:06:43.650> areas<00:06:43.889> so<00:06:44.550> if<00:06:44.610> you

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
can pinpoint the hot areas so if you

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:45.620 
can pinpoint the hot areas so if you
could<00:06:44.759> have<00:06:44.969> one<00:06:45.000> of<00:06:45.180> these<00:06:45.270> and<00:06:45.419> just<00:06:45.449> go

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
could have one of these and just go

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.180 
could have one of these and just go
around<00:06:45.750> the<00:06:46.349> bottom<00:06:46.560> your<00:06:46.680> laptop<00:06:46.949> trying<00:06:47.130> to

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
around the bottom your laptop trying to

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.370 
around the bottom your laptop trying to
find<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.370> hot<00:06:47.520> spot<00:06:47.870> so<00:06:48.870> that's<00:06:49.050> cool<00:06:49.199> so<00:06:49.349> I

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
find the hot spot so that's cool so I

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.659 
find the hot spot so that's cool so I
actually<00:06:49.469> notice<00:06:49.830> the<00:06:49.949> actual<00:06:50.190> keyboard<00:06:50.340> is

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
actually notice the actual keyboard is

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.339 
actually notice the actual keyboard is
no<00:06:50.789> longer<00:06:50.969> hot<00:06:51.240> that's<00:06:51.810> one<00:06:52.020> problem<00:06:52.199> with

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
no longer hot that's one problem with

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.730 
no longer hot that's one problem with
this<00:06:52.409> laptop<00:06:52.650> it<00:06:52.979> does<00:06:53.130> run<00:06:53.280> very<00:06:53.610> hot<00:06:53.849> um<00:06:54.740> and

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
this laptop it does run very hot um and

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.770 
this laptop it does run very hot um and
that's<00:06:55.800> really<00:06:56.039> about<00:06:56.159> it<00:06:56.430> it's<00:06:57.030> as<00:06:57.360> I<00:06:57.539> said

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
that's really about it it's as I said

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.390 
that's really about it it's as I said
it's<00:06:57.930> super<00:06:58.229> portable<00:06:58.469> it's<00:06:58.770> it's<00:06:59.190> pretty

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
it's super portable it's it's pretty

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.980 
it's super portable it's it's pretty
thin<00:06:59.639> for<00:06:59.940> a<00:06:59.969> laptop<00:07:00.090> cooler<00:07:00.509> I<00:07:00.569> like<00:07:00.810> the

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
thin for a laptop cooler I like the

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.499 
thin for a laptop cooler I like the
design<00:07:01.169> of<00:07:01.349> the<00:07:01.530> magnets<00:07:01.889> that's<00:07:02.069> really<00:07:02.250> cool

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:02.509 
design of the magnets that's really cool

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:04.430 
design of the magnets that's really cool
but<00:07:03.509> at<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.780> end<00:07:03.840> of<00:07:03.960> day<00:07:04.050> it<00:07:04.139> slow<00:07:04.289> just

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
but at the end of day it slow just

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.080 
but at the end of day it slow just
laptop<00:07:04.800> cooler<00:07:05.069> they're<00:07:05.310> very<00:07:05.580> dependent<00:07:06.030> on

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
laptop cooler they're very dependent on

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.019 
laptop cooler they're very dependent on
your<00:07:06.419> setup<00:07:06.900> and<00:07:07.110> how<00:07:07.319> really<00:07:08.219> your<00:07:08.460> laptop<00:07:08.849> is

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:09.029 
your setup and how really your laptop is

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:10.969 
your setup and how really your laptop is
so<00:07:09.210> temperatures<00:07:09.659> really<00:07:09.960> will<00:07:10.229> vary<00:07:10.440> you<00:07:10.710> may

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 
so temperatures really will vary you may

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:12.439 
so temperatures really will vary you may
see<00:07:11.039> maybe<00:07:11.400> two<00:07:11.610> to<00:07:11.729> three<00:07:11.760> degrees<00:07:12.180> you<00:07:12.330> might

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:12.449 
see maybe two to three degrees you might

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:12.800 
see maybe two to three degrees you might
even<00:07:12.479> say

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
even say

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.070 
even say
10<00:07:13.080> on<00:07:13.110> some<00:07:13.470> laptops<00:07:13.680> you<00:07:14.130> really<00:07:14.370> don't<00:07:14.550> know

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 
10 on some laptops you really don't know

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.200 
10 on some laptops you really don't know
so<00:07:16.080> laptop<00:07:16.560> coolers<00:07:16.800> work<00:07:17.070> and<00:07:17.310> then<00:07:18.060> at<00:07:18.180> the

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
so laptop coolers work and then at the

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.340 
so laptop coolers work and then at the
same<00:07:18.270> time<00:07:18.510> they<00:07:18.660> might<00:07:18.780> not<00:07:18.930> work<00:07:19.080> for<00:07:19.230> your

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
same time they might not work for your

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.570 
same time they might not work for your
setup<00:07:19.590> but<00:07:19.710> the<00:07:19.800> best<00:07:20.040> thing<00:07:20.160> I<00:07:20.340> think<00:07:20.400> about

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
setup but the best thing I think about

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.760 
setup but the best thing I think about
them<00:07:20.880> is<00:07:21.060> not<00:07:21.419> really<00:07:21.720> temperature<00:07:22.230> wise<00:07:22.470> is

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
them is not really temperature wise is

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.400 
them is not really temperature wise is
yerga<00:07:23.669> nomics<00:07:24.030> raises<00:07:24.780> your<00:07:24.870> laptop<00:07:25.200> up<00:07:25.320> a

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.410 
yerga nomics raises your laptop up a

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.620 
yerga nomics raises your laptop up a
little<00:07:25.620> bit<00:07:25.710> it<00:07:25.980> makes<00:07:26.190> it<00:07:26.280> a<00:07:26.310> nice<00:07:26.430> lot<00:07:27.300> easier

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
little bit it makes it a nice lot easier

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.330 
little bit it makes it a nice lot easier
to<00:07:27.990> type<00:07:28.110> I<00:07:28.290> find<00:07:28.530> that's<00:07:28.919> what<00:07:29.100> I<00:07:29.160> like<00:07:29.280> about

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
to type I find that's what I like about

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.040 
to type I find that's what I like about
it<00:07:29.550> ultimately<00:07:30.060> I<00:07:30.270> really<00:07:30.660> care<00:07:30.840> about<00:07:30.870> the

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
it ultimately I really care about the

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.900 
it ultimately I really care about the
components<00:07:31.560> on<00:07:31.650> laptop<00:07:31.950> coolers<00:07:32.280> actually<00:07:32.730> I

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:32.910 
components on laptop coolers actually I

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.300
