00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
map it can get a little annoying if

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.700 
map it can get a little annoying if
you're<00:00:52.980> using<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.670> full<00:00:54.000> speed

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
you're using if you have a full speed

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.779 
you're using if you have a full speed
zombie<00:00:55.710> running<00:00:56.010> after<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> time

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
zombie running after you all the time

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.920 
zombie running after you all the time
while<00:00:57.030> you're<00:00:57.120> trying<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> look<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.600> corners

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
while you're trying to look in corners

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
while you're trying to look in corners
and<00:00:58.050> stuff<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.559> would<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.489> even<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and stuff it would be and even with the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.580 
and stuff it would be and even with the
crawler<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.050> still<00:01:01.230> annoying<00:01:01.410> because

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
crawler it's still annoying because

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.959 
crawler it's still annoying because
those<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.039> bleed<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.520> black<00:01:02.609> ops<00:01:02.850> 2

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
those can bleed out in black ops 2

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.149 
those can bleed out in black ops 2
unlike<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> first<00:01:03.750> black<00:01:03.930> apps<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.799> basically

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
unlike the first black apps so basically

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
unlike the first black apps so basically
this<00:01:05.339> will<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> crawler<00:01:05.970> invincible<00:01:06.659> he

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
this will make the crawler invincible he

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
this will make the crawler invincible he
will<00:01:06.930> never<00:01:07.110> die<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.159> only<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
will never die and the only way the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.950 
will never die and the only way the
crawler<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.360> die<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
crawler can actually die is if you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.450 
crawler can actually die is if you
actually<00:01:10.080> shoot<00:01:10.530> him<00:01:10.710> while<00:01:10.890> he's<00:01:11.040> carrying

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
actually shoot him while he's carrying

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
actually shoot him while he's carrying

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
him and on the screen right now you can

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
him and on the screen right now you can
see<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.920> shoot<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.430> crawler<00:01:14.700> Leroy<00:01:15.570> gets

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
see if you shoot the crawler Leroy gets

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.510
