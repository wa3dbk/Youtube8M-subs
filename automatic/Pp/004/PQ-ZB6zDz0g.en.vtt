00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.300 
the inherent problems with augers the
problems<00:02:30.390> with<00:02:30.569> cold<00:02:30.870> weather<00:02:31.110> start<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
problems with cold weather start and and

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.470 
problems with cold weather start and and
and<00:02:33.000> then<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.459> by<00:02:35.459> not<00:02:35.670> using<00:02:35.849> augers<00:02:36.299> we

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
and then the by not using augers we

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.350 
and then the by not using augers we
don't<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.920> problems<00:02:37.920> with<00:02:38.090> people<00:02:39.090> getting

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
don't have problems with people getting

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.830 
don't have problems with people getting
caught<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.860> augers<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.910> developed

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
caught in the augers so we developed

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.750 
caught in the augers so we developed
rather<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.200> simple<00:02:43.470> system<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.459> could

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
rather a simple system here that could

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
rather a simple system here that could
be<00:02:44.819> adapted<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.599> almost<00:02:45.780> any<00:02:46.230> place<00:02:46.500> all<00:02:46.769> we

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
be adapted to almost any place all we

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.970 
be adapted to almost any place all we
all<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.489> need<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.879> bank<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:49.709> sides

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
all you need is a bank and the sides

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.280 
all you need is a bank and the sides
could<00:02:50.310> be<00:02:50.459> made<00:02:50.700> out<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:50.940> Timbers<00:02:51.599> or<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.110> this

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
could be made out of Timbers or in this

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.259 
could be made out of Timbers or in this
case<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.739> use<00:02:52.980> steel<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:56.670> trucks<00:02:57.000> drive

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
case we use steel the trucks drive

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.220 
case we use steel the trucks drive
overtop<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.840> dump<00:02:58.379> into<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.959> bottom<00:03:00.959> part

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
overtop and dump into the bottom part

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.940 
overtop and dump into the bottom part
here<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:02.129> just<00:03:02.400> come<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.120> with<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.329> loader

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
here and we just come in with a loader

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.800 
here and we just come in with a loader
we<00:03:04.950> use<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.160> cat<00:03:05.910> loader<00:03:06.209> but<00:03:06.480> could<00:03:06.660> be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
we use a cat loader but could be

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.500 
we use a cat loader but could be
attractive<00:03:07.380> with<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> loader<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.269> move<00:03:09.269> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
attractive with a loader and move the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.870 
attractive with a loader and move the
product<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.230> way<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.950> operator<00:03:11.370> never<00:03:11.670> has

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
product that way the operator never has

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.640 
product that way the operator never has
to<00:03:12.060> get<00:03:12.180> out<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.540> machine<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.410> loader

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
to get out of the machine in the loader

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.879 
to get out of the machine in the loader
in<00:03:14.069> transferring<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.000> stuff<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.709> really<00:03:16.709> like

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
in transferring the stuff I really like

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.509 
in transferring the stuff I really like
this<00:03:17.160> system<00:03:17.549> because<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:18.299> not<00:03:18.870> only<00:03:19.049> makes

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
this system because it not only makes

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.900 
this system because it not only makes
transfer<00:03:20.519> product<00:03:21.030> more<00:03:21.209> efficient<00:03:21.840> but

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
transfer product more efficient but

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.640 
transfer product more efficient but
we're<00:03:23.910> reducing<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.750> hazard<00:03:25.169> by<00:03:25.319> having

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
we're reducing the hazard by having

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.490 
we're reducing the hazard by having
somebody<00:03:26.040> get<00:03:26.220> caught<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.700> augers<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.500> it

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
somebody get caught in augers and it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.140 
somebody get caught in augers and it
keeps<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.919> employees<00:03:29.370> happier<00:03:29.910> because

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
keeps the employees happier because

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.120 
keeps the employees happier because
they're<00:03:30.480> not<00:03:30.630> messing<00:03:31.200> around<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.799> cold

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
they're not messing around in the cold

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.759 
they're not messing around in the cold
with<00:03:32.569> machinery<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.840> doesn't<00:03:34.200> always<00:03:34.380> start

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
with machinery that doesn't always start

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.640 
with machinery that doesn't always start
easy<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.700> part<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.150> our<00:03:36.269> safety<00:03:36.959> plan<00:03:37.260> here

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
easy it's part of our safety plan here

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.339 
easy it's part of our safety plan here
and<00:03:37.799> it's<00:03:37.919> a<00:03:38.040> simple<00:03:38.459> easy<00:03:39.299> system<00:03:40.019> put<00:03:40.319> in

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
and it's a simple easy system put in

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.440 
and it's a simple easy system put in
place
