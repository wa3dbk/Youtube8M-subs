00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.530
Hello i'm john Taylor and this is the
Corpus clock, it's just struck three.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.230
We're in the workshop just outside
Cambridge

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.500
where it's being built. I'd like to show
you something about it.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.550
So where are the hands?

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.310
I wanted to create a new and a different way

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.530
of showing time. this is not a computer
generation

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
but a true mechanical clock. the face of the clock depicts

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.270
time as a wave coming out from the
center of the universe

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.490
every second runs around the dial

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.119
a pulse of light showing time racing away.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.750
to me time passes slowly

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.940
or more quickly depending on the
circumstances

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.160
time is relative and as Einstein said

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.670
an hour sitting with a pretty girl
passes like a minute

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.790
but a minute sitting on a hot stove seems
like an hour.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.130
I wanted my clock to catch the observers
attention

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.380
and to make them think. its
heritage

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.649
stretches back nearly 300 years

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.649
 to John Harrison and his invention of the
grasshopper escapement.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.520

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.570

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.660
F or the corpus clock I've enhanced the
image of a grasshopper into a Chronophage 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.660
who munches a minute every 60 seconds

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.010
this escape wheel is 50 times larger
than harrison's original

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.330
but it works in the same way. it is
controlled mechanically

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.330
by the pallets which are the legs of the chronophage. 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.060
the time is displayed by a series of Vernier slits and lenses.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.160

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.880
Hours, minutes and seconds.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.860
the time his 11 o'clock precisely

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.860

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.959
The vernier slits allow the passage of light

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.130
from a bank of LEDs  that are always illuminated.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.610
and incidentally

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.550
the whole bank only uses 60 Watts. on
the inside of the escape wheel

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.760
is the disc of slits for the seconds

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.550
the escape wheel is driven by the clock
springs through these gears

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.200
this carries forward the drive

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.959
for the minutes disc and then

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.959
the hours disc.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.760
I would be delighted

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.690
if you would accept my invitation to
come to the inauguration

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.020
of the corpus Clark and celebrate the
release of the chronophage

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.360
and relative time onto the unsuspecting
citizens at Cambridge
