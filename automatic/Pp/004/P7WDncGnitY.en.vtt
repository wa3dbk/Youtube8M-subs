00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
wire so you get a lot of vibration and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.950 
wire so you get a lot of vibration and
he's<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.300> little<00:01:27.570> cupped<00:01:28.050> front<00:01:28.830> blade<00:01:29.960> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
he's got a little cupped front blade so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.860 
he's got a little cupped front blade so
no<00:01:31.350> matter<00:01:31.560> how<00:01:31.770> slow<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.159> reel<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.870> that

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
no matter how slow you reel it that

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.600 
no matter how slow you reel it that
blade<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> front<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.830> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.010> turn<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
blade in the front is going to turn and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.850 
blade in the front is going to turn and
then<00:01:35.760> that<00:01:35.970> back<00:01:36.210> blade<00:01:36.510> is<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.140> sample<00:01:37.590> ball

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
then that back blade is on a sample ball

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.180 
then that back blade is on a sample ball
bearing<00:01:38.840> swivel<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.560> doesn't<00:01:40.830> take<00:01:40.980> much

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
bearing swivel so it doesn't take much

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.330 
bearing swivel so it doesn't take much
to<00:01:41.370> even<00:01:41.580> turn<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> back<00:01:42.479> blade<00:01:42.750> either<00:01:43.340> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
to even turn that back blade either the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.340 
to even turn that back blade either the
reason<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.729> choose<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.150> half-ounce<00:01:45.659> blade<00:01:46.050> in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
reason I choose a half-ounce blade in

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
reason I choose a half-ounce blade in
the<00:01:46.500> spring<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> lot<00:01:47.940> of<00:01:48.030> times<00:01:48.240> I'm

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the spring is because a lot of times I'm

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.320 
the spring is because a lot of times I'm
going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.750> fishing<00:01:49.050> in<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.940> through<00:01:51.150> all

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
going to be fishing in and through all

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.649 
going to be fishing in and through all
this<00:01:51.450> brush<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.430> lot<00:01:53.610> easier<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.150> fish

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
this brush and it's a lot easier to fish

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.100 
this brush and it's a lot easier to fish
it<00:01:54.810> through<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.110> brush<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.540> cast<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.780> into

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it through the brush and cast it into

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.660 
it through the brush and cast it into
those<00:01:58.229> little<00:01:58.409> lanes<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.979> stuff<00:01:59.159> without<00:01:59.460> it

those little lanes and stuff without it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.800 
those little lanes and stuff without it
being<00:01:59.820> too<00:01:59.909> heavy<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.360> falling<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.750> and

being too heavy and falling down and
getting<00:02:01.020> stuck<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:04.140> color<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.650> shad<00:02:05.120> you

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
getting stuck the color is the shad you
