00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hi, I'm Samantha Clayton, expert in 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.309
 wellness and former competitive sprinter 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.400
 I work with erbol light to help 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.200
 achieve an active and healthy life already 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.900
 did the point exercise the lateral 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.329
 basic and is trying to improve its 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.050
 abdominal strength and its balance if the 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:30.480
 answers if what is coming is for you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 Adopts the perfect position of the point 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.129
 lateral lying on the right side and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.110
 the legs straight this time with the feet 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.320
 together because this will help for your 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.320
 Balance 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.330
 support the body on the elbow and 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.860
 forearm and make sure that the 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.860
 shoulder is aligned with the elbow 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.000
 lift the hip until it forms a 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.590
 straight line from the ankles to the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.830
 shoulders and place the left hand 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.690
 behind the head now take the elbow 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.630
 left towards the right hand and 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.339
 come back up stretching the chest 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.339
 go down and go back to the starting position 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.600
 try to keep the chain in the angle 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.600
 straight during the movement 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.600
 now if you want to increase the intensity a 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.170
 abdominal challenge I tried this bending 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.479
 for the public 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.549
 let's adopt the position of the bridge 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.580
 side now lift one leg with the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.500
 Now we do push-ups 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.500
 laterals moving the leg towards the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.540
 elbow so 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.290
 elbow to the knee and hold a 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.290
 straight line 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.970
 this variation exercises the muscles 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.700
 oblique and also the flexors of the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.530
 hip and shoulders as you can see 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.480
 this exercise does not require much 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.340
 space so it's great for the 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.520
 resistance you can do when you go 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.560
 trip with the comfort of your home you choose 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.080
 the exercise that feels most appropriate 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.340
 and remember to focus on the alignment 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 of the spine and neck
