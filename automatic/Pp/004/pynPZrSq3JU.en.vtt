okay so I'll credit to this guy now that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.950 
okay so I'll credit to this guy now that
part<00:02:40.890> has<00:02:41.010> been<00:02:41.190> done<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:42.270> again<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.570> did<00:02:42.840> it

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
part has been done and again I did it

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.190 
part has been done and again I did it
really<00:02:43.260> quickly<00:02:43.380> okay<00:02:44.480> we<00:02:45.480> got<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.840> we're

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
really quickly okay we got that we're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.740 
really quickly okay we got that we're
gonna<00:02:46.350> go<00:02:46.620> back<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.310> our<00:02:47.520> polygons<00:02:48.090> menu

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
gonna go back to our polygons menu

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.790 
gonna go back to our polygons menu
we're<00:02:49.170> gonna<00:02:49.290> go<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> edit<00:02:50.100> mesh<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:51.740> what<00:02:52.740> do

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
we're gonna go to edit mesh and what do

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.610 
we're gonna go to edit mesh and what do
you<00:02:52.860> go<00:02:53.390> duplicate<00:02:54.710> face<00:02:55.710> right<00:02:56.640> there<00:02:56.880> and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
you go duplicate face right there and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.100 
you go duplicate face right there and
then<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:59.040> are<00:02:59.190> going<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.520> hit<00:03:00.240> for<00:03:00.720> for<00:03:00.990> our

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
then we are going to hit for for our

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.140 
then we are going to hit for for our
frame<00:03:01.350> oh<00:03:03.410> there<00:03:04.410> we<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.820> we're<00:03:05.820> gonna<00:03:05.880> select

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
frame oh there we go we're gonna select

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.870 
frame oh there we go we're gonna select
our<00:03:06.360> objects<00:03:08.600> like<00:03:09.600> object<00:03:10.170> mode<00:03:10.400> now<00:03:11.400> right

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
our objects like object mode now right

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.440 
our objects like object mode now right
now<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.330> see<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.600> have<00:03:13.160> selected<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.580> piece

five<00:04:17.790> thousand<00:04:18.299> frames

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.220 

actually<00:04:21.800> that's<00:04:22.010> even<00:04:22.280> 50<00:04:22.670> that's<00:04:22.910> fine<00:04:23.230> I'm

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
actually that's even 50 that's fine I'm

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.980 
actually that's even 50 that's fine I'm
just<00:04:24.410> gonna<00:04:24.500> hit<00:04:24.650> play<00:04:24.710> now<00:04:25.510> as<00:04:26.510> you<00:04:26.600> can<00:04:26.720> see

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
just gonna hit play now as you can see

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.810 
just gonna hit play now as you can see
there's<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.470> good<00:04:28.130> amount<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.490> particles

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
there's a good amount of particles

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.170 
there's a good amount of particles
coming<00:04:29.300> out<00:04:29.540> here<00:04:29.930> right<00:04:31.060> but<00:04:32.060> they're

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
coming out here right but they're

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.960 
coming out here right but they're
falling<00:04:32.330> down<00:04:32.480> as<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:32.960> can<00:04:33.110> see<00:04:33.370> now<00:04:34.370> we<00:04:34.820> need

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
falling down as you can see now we need

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.120 
falling down as you can see now we need
to<00:04:35.060> fix<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.930> way<00:04:36.110> we<00:04:36.290> can<00:04:36.410> fix<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.830> is

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
to fix that the way we can fix that is

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.960 
to fix that the way we can fix that is
to<00:04:37.160> set<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.640> gravity<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.570> zero<00:04:39.070> okay<00:04:40.070> so<00:04:40.760> in

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
to set the gravity to zero okay so in

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.220 
to set the gravity to zero okay so in
our<00:04:41.060> nucleus<00:04:41.450> one<00:04:41.660> tab

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
our nucleus one tab

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.130 
our nucleus one tab
we're<00:04:42.410> gonna<00:04:42.530> bring<00:04:42.800> gravity<00:04:43.400> down<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.850> zero

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
we're gonna bring gravity down to zero

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.370 
we're gonna bring gravity down to zero
okay<00:04:45.140> gonna<00:04:46.010> go<00:04:46.190> back<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.400> frame<00:04:46.700> 1<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.380> hit

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
okay gonna go back to frame 1 and hit

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.090 
okay gonna go back to frame 1 and hit
play<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:49.930> as<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:51.020> can<00:04:51.140> see<00:04:51.200> their<00:04:51.620> particles

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
play and as you can see their particles

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.780 
play and as you can see their particles
are<00:04:52.280> starting<00:04:52.640> to<00:04:52.850> form<00:04:53.240> on<00:04:54.020> my<00:04:54.380> object<00:04:54.790> all

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
are starting to form on my object all

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:04.030 
are starting to form on my object all
right<00:04:57.280> we'll<00:04:58.280> just<00:04:58.550> give<00:04:58.730> that<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:58.970> sec<00:05:03.040> just

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
right we'll just give that a sec just

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.450 
right we'll just give that a sec just
hit<00:05:04.280> stop<00:05:04.610> there<00:05:04.940> let's<00:05:05.740> go<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.800> our<00:05:06.950> particle

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
hit stop there let's go to our particle

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.350 
hit stop there let's go to our particle
shape<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.770> what<00:05:10.550> we'll<00:05:10.730> do<00:05:11.060> is<00:05:11.390> we<00:05:12.050> will

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
shape and what we'll do is we will

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:21.400 
shape and what we'll do is we will
increase<00:05:14.390> oops<00:05:14.840> that's<00:05:15.140> a<00:05:15.290> bit<00:05:15.410> much<00:05:20.410> let's

increase oops that's a bit much let's

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:28.840 
increase oops that's a bit much let's
see<00:05:21.680> if<00:05:21.830> we<00:05:21.980> set<00:05:22.220> that<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.400> one<00:05:27.640> that's<00:05:28.640> not<00:05:28.820> too

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
see if we set that to one that's not too

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.250 
see if we set that to one that's not too
bad<00:05:29.150> okay<00:05:31.390> so<00:05:32.390> we've<00:05:32.540> got<00:05:32.690> that<00:05:32.870> we're<00:05:33.170> gonna

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
bad okay so we've got that we're gonna

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.760 
bad okay so we've got that we're gonna
stop<00:05:33.560> there<00:05:34.900> we<00:05:35.900> are<00:05:35.930> going<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.440> make<00:05:36.740> sure

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
stop there we are going to make sure

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.180 
stop there we are going to make sure
that<00:05:37.370> we<00:05:37.460> have<00:05:37.670> our<00:05:37.700> particles<00:05:38.420> selected<00:05:39.200> like

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
that we have our particles selected like

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.420 
that we have our particles selected like
so<00:05:40.660> we're<00:05:41.660> gonna<00:05:41.750> go<00:05:42.020> up<00:05:42.200> to<00:05:42.910> modify<00:05:44.380> convert

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
so we're gonna go up to modify convert

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.730 
so we're gonna go up to modify convert
and<00:05:46.430> particles<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:47.420> polygons<00:05:48.520> like<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:50.740> and

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
and particles to polygons like that and

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.990 
and particles to polygons like that and
then<00:05:52.310> we<00:05:52.820> are<00:05:53.060> going<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.450> right-click<00:05:55.000> assign

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
then we are going to right-click assign

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.980 
then we are going to right-click assign
new<00:05:56.150> material<00:05:56.800> Lambert<00:05:58.450> change<00:05:59.450> the<00:05:59.600> color<00:05:59.840> to

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
new material Lambert change the color to

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.500 
new material Lambert change the color to
white<00:06:01.000> and<00:06:02.000> then<00:06:02.750> we<00:06:03.140> are<00:06:03.290> going<00:06:03.620> to<00:06:04.450> go<00:06:05.450> to

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
white and then we are going to go to

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.600 
white and then we are going to go to
display<00:06:06.580> show<00:06:07.580> all<00:06:08.450> and<00:06:09.350> get<00:06:09.920> back<00:06:10.130> our<00:06:10.340> house

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
display show all and get back our house

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.200 
display show all and get back our house
if<00:06:11.030> you<00:06:11.150> will<00:06:11.800> our<00:06:12.800> birdhouse<00:06:13.220> then<00:06:14.090> we're

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
if you will our birdhouse then we're

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.900 
if you will our birdhouse then we're
gonna<00:06:14.300> hit<00:06:14.450> 5<00:06:14.840> and<00:06:15.320> we're<00:06:16.220> gonna<00:06:16.370> hit<00:06:16.700> our

checkered<00:06:17.480> box<00:06:17.750> here<00:06:18.760> I'm<00:06:19.760> gonna<00:06:19.970> go<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.240> view

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
checkered box here I'm gonna go to view

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.830 
checkered box here I'm gonna go to view
bookmark<00:06:21.710> and<00:06:22.010> go<00:06:22.340> to<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:22.850> bookmark<00:06:23.420> that<00:06:23.810> I

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
bookmark and go to the bookmark that I

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:47.890 
bookmark and go to the bookmark that I
created<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:25.490> let's<00:06:25.910> give<00:06:26.150> this<00:06:26.360> a<00:06:26.600> render

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:57.010 

we'll<00:06:48.900> give<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.230> render<00:06:49.500> a<00:06:49.530> few<00:06:49.830> more<00:06:49.950> seconds

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.540 

but<00:06:58.020> as<00:06:58.140> you<00:06:58.230> can<00:06:58.350> see<00:06:58.410> it's<00:06:58.830> a<00:06:59.070> fairly

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
but as you can see it's a fairly

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.990 
but as you can see it's a fairly
realistic<00:07:00.030> scene<00:07:00.540> and<00:07:00.840> again<00:07:01.730> the<00:07:02.730> more

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
realistic scene and again the more

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.430 
realistic scene and again the more
detailed<00:07:03.620> and<00:07:04.620> more<00:07:05.280> time<00:07:05.700> you<00:07:05.910> take<00:07:06.180> to<00:07:06.440> apply

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 
detailed and more time you take to apply

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.940 
detailed and more time you take to apply
the<00:07:07.500> the<00:07:08.370> snowy<00:07:08.730> phases<00:07:09.390> if<00:07:09.570> you<00:07:09.690> will<00:07:09.950> the

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950 
the the snowy phases if you will the

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.240 
the the snowy phases if you will the
birds<00:07:11.220> gonna<00:07:11.370> look<00:07:11.610> and<00:07:12.590> in<00:07:13.590> this<00:07:13.770> case<00:07:14.040> you

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
birds gonna look and in this case you

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.030 
birds gonna look and in this case you
could<00:07:14.400> also<00:07:14.550> add<00:07:15.150> some<00:07:15.600> snow<00:07:15.870> to<00:07:16.050> the<00:07:16.380> chain

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
could also add some snow to the chain

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.660 
could also add some snow to the chain
and<00:07:17.780> you<00:07:18.780> know<00:07:18.900> to<00:07:19.170> the<00:07:19.470> corners<00:07:19.950> as<00:07:20.280> you<00:07:20.460> sort

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
and you know to the corners as you sort

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.110 
and you know to the corners as you sort
of<00:07:20.730> build<00:07:20.970> up<00:07:21.380> but<00:07:22.380> in<00:07:22.830> essence<00:07:23.190> this<00:07:23.640> is<00:07:23.880> the

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
of build up but in essence this is the

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.410 
of build up but in essence this is the
other<00:07:24.450> method<00:07:24.840> to<00:07:25.020> do<00:07:25.140> this<00:07:26.000> I'll<00:07:27.000> just<00:07:27.060> give

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420 
other method to do this I'll just give

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:37.810 
other method to do this I'll just give
the<00:07:27.600> render<00:07:28.170> a<00:07:28.200> few<00:07:28.410> more<00:07:28.530> seconds<00:07:28.830> here

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.950 

almost<00:07:38.660> done<00:07:39.100> all<00:07:40.100> right<00:07:40.480> well<00:07:41.480> this<00:07:41.690> is<00:07:41.840> it
