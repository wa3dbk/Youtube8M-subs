00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
video in a long long time because I'm in

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.910 
video in a long long time because I'm in
college<00:00:08.510> i<00:00:09.510> just<00:00:10.110> bought<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.320> GTS<00:00:11.070> 450<00:00:12.920> probably

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
college i just bought a GTS 450 probably

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.400 
college i just bought a GTS 450 probably
wondering<00:00:14.219> why<00:00:14.370> because<00:00:14.820> like<00:00:15.299> i<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.630> 4890

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
wondering why because like i have a 4890

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.109 
wondering why because like i have a 4890
so<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.859> seems<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.190> it'd<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> downgrade<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
so it seems like it'd be a downgrade and

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.269 
so it seems like it'd be a downgrade and
it<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:19.010> but<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.970> only<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.710> 90<00:00:22.710> bucks<00:00:23.070> at

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
it is but it was only a 90 bucks at

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.009 
it is but it was only a 90 bucks at
newegg<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.880> there's<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> ten-dollar<00:00:24.630> rebate

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
newegg and there's a ten-dollar rebate

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.320 
newegg and there's a ten-dollar rebate
so<00:00:25.230> it'd<00:00:25.320> only<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.560> 80<00:00:25.859> after<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
so it'd only be 80 after that and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.120 
so it'd only be 80 after that and
basically<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.380> i'm<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.830> I'm

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
finally managed to get it out of the box

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
finally managed to get it out of the box
we've<00:00:56.430> got<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:57.680> pci<00:00:58.680> express<00:00:59.100> adapter<00:00:59.960> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
we've got a pci express adapter to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.230 
we've got a pci express adapter to
school<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.670> then<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.940> DVI<00:01:03.570> VGA<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.030> i<00:01:06.030> think

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
school and then a DVI VGA and i think

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.630 
school and then a DVI VGA and i think
this<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.570> mini<00:01:07.189> hdmi<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.250> DVI<00:01:10.520> something<00:01:11.520> like

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
this is mini hdmi to DVI something like

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.380 
this is mini hdmi to DVI something like
that<00:01:12.110> that's<00:01:13.110> cool<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.939> it's<00:01:14.939> pretty<00:01:15.180> basic

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that that's cool like it's pretty basic

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.020 
that that's cool like it's pretty basic
but<00:01:15.950> those<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.220> stuff<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.850> some

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
but those are some stuff that like some

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
but those are some stuff that like some
cars<00:01:18.270> don't<00:01:18.420> even<00:01:18.689> come<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.490> got

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
cars don't even come with so and we got

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.610 
cars don't even come with so and we got
drivers<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.479> quick<00:01:21.659> start<00:01:21.990> guide

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.400 

this<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.430> like<00:01:28.760> pretty<00:01:29.270> weird<00:01:29.570> packaging<00:01:30.110> but

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
this is like pretty weird packaging but

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:46.900 
this is like pretty weird packaging but
I<00:01:30.440> guess<00:01:30.650> it<00:01:30.800> works<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:41.570> there<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.440> is<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:45.910> yeah

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
I guess it works and there it is so yeah

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.990 
I guess it works and there it is so yeah
it's<00:01:47.240> got<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.450> pretty<00:01:48.520> big<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:49.670> think<00:01:49.820> that's<00:01:49.940> a

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
it's got a pretty big I think that's a

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.850 
it's got a pretty big I think that's a
80<00:01:50.150> ml<00:01:50.330> m<00:01:50.420> irfan<00:01:50.540> but<00:01:51.110> it's<00:01:51.230> like<00:01:51.440> 15

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
80 ml m irfan but it's like 15

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.360 
80 ml m irfan but it's like 15
millimeters<00:01:52.340> wide<00:01:53.350> fan<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.680> then<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.070> priest

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
millimeters wide fan and then the priest

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.610 
millimeters wide fan and then the priest
small<00:01:55.640> heat<00:01:55.880> sink<00:01:56.150> they<00:01:56.990> just<00:01:57.170> make<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.380> look

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
small heat sink they just make it look

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.950 
small heat sink they just make it look
big<00:01:57.920> by<00:01:58.160> putting<00:01:58.430> a<00:01:58.580> plastic<00:01:59.030> shroud<00:01:59.450> over<00:01:59.510> it

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
big by putting a plastic shroud over it

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.570 
big by putting a plastic shroud over it
but<00:02:00.640> then<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.850> shroud<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:03.560> kind<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:03.950> indented

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
but then the shroud is kind of indented

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.650 
but then the shroud is kind of indented
to<00:02:05.150> let<00:02:05.300> more<00:02:05.480> air<00:02:05.510> flow<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.260> sli<00:02:10.660> power

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
to let more air flow in a sli power

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.430 
to let more air flow in a sli power
connector<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> back<00:02:13.660> only<00:02:14.660> one<00:02:14.870> SLI

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.040 
connector in the back only one SLI
connector<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.370> no<00:02:17.120> trial<00:02:17.480> salai<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.870> does

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
connector so no trial salai and it does

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.650 
connector so no trial salai and it does
have<00:02:21.230> some<00:02:21.410> ram<00:02:21.650> chips<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:23.150> other<00:02:23.330> side

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
have some ram chips on the other side

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.870 
have some ram chips on the other side
which<00:02:24.560> won't<00:02:24.830> get<00:02:25.010> any<00:02:25.160> air<00:02:25.280> flow<00:02:25.580> from<00:02:25.730> the

which won't get any air flow from the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.880 
which won't get any air flow from the
fan<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:26.720> might<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.990> problem<00:02:27.230> as<00:02:27.860> far

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
fan so there might be a problem as far

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.400 
fan so there might be a problem as far
as<00:02:28.160> overclocking<00:02:28.850> I'm<00:02:28.910> not<00:02:29.060> sure<00:02:29.290> might<00:02:30.290> need

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
as overclocking I'm not sure might need

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.890 
as overclocking I'm not sure might need
to<00:02:30.500> get<00:02:30.620> some<00:02:30.830> ram<00:02:31.460> heat<00:02:31.730> sinks<00:02:32.090> for<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:33.190> and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
to get some ram heat sinks for that and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.800 
to get some ram heat sinks for that and
then<00:02:35.900> just<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.980> DV<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.820> then<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.090> mini

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
then just to DV is and then the mini

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.500 
then just to DV is and then the mini
HDMI<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.700> there<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:43.209> obviously<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> lot

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
HDMI so there it is obviously it's a lot

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.160 
HDMI so there it is obviously it's a lot
smaller<00:02:44.690> than<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.110> 4890<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.890> think<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:47.330> 250<00:02:48.050> or

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
smaller than a 4890 I think the 250 or

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.800 
smaller than a 4890 I think the 250 or
450<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.040> only<00:02:49.190> like<00:02:49.400> eight<00:02:49.610> inches<00:02:49.910> long<00:02:50.500> so

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.530 

the<00:02:57.739> pretty<00:02:57.920> much<00:02:58.040> fits<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.489> like<00:02:58.520> any<00:02:58.790> case<00:02:59.209> so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
the pretty much fits in like any case so

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
the pretty much fits in like any case so
that's<00:02:59.690> nice<00:03:01.900> I've<00:03:02.900> been<00:03:03.170> messing<00:03:03.500> around

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
that's nice I've been messing around

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.059 
that's nice I've been messing around
with<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.860> 450<00:03:04.520> bit<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.050> looks<00:03:06.200> like<00:03:06.290> when

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
with the 450 bit and it looks like when

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.380 
with the 450 bit and it looks like when
it's<00:03:07.220> overclock<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.730> actually<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.360> pretty

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
it's overclock it actually is pretty

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:23.080 
it's overclock it actually is pretty
good<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:12.340> stock<00:03:13.340> clocks<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:18.430> was<00:03:19.430> getting<00:03:21.310> 15<00:03:22.310> 851

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
good a stock clocks I was getting 15 851

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:32.800 
good a stock clocks I was getting 15 851
and<00:03:25.959> 3dmark<00:03:26.959> 06<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.850> when<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:31.880> overclocked<00:03:32.540> it

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
and 3dmark 06 and when I overclocked it

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.800 
and 3dmark 06 and when I overclocked it
to<00:03:34.510> 920<00:03:35.510> core<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.140> 2000<00:03:36.980> memory<00:03:37.569> it<00:03:38.569> was

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
to 920 core and 2000 memory it was

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.630 
to 920 core and 2000 memory it was
getting<00:03:40.930> 1705<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.290> 3d<00:03:42.709> marks<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.330> with<00:03:44.480> a

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
getting 1705 for 3d marks this is with a

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.580 
getting 1705 for 3d marks this is with a
phenom<00:03:46.640> 2<00:03:46.819> 9<00:03:47.090> 55<00:03:47.510> at<00:03:47.870> 3.8<00:03:48.380> gigahertz<00:03:50.319> but<00:03:51.319> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
phenom 2 9 55 at 3.8 gigahertz but the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.690 
phenom 2 9 55 at 3.8 gigahertz but the
4890<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.430> stock<00:03:52.730> was<00:03:52.970> getting<00:03:56.530> 17<00:03:57.530> 183<00:03:58.400> which

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
4890 it stock was getting 17 183 which

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.060 
4890 it stock was getting 17 183 which
is<00:03:58.910> like<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.239> hundred<00:03:59.540> points<00:03:59.690> more<00:04:00.019> and<00:04:00.290> then

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
is like a hundred points more and then

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.460 
is like a hundred points more and then
of<00:04:01.190> course<00:04:01.220> he<00:04:01.640> overclocked<00:04:02.120> 4898<00:04:03.019> got<00:04:03.260> like

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
of course he overclocked 4898 got like

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.110 
of course he overclocked 4898 got like
18,000<00:04:04.430> something<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.730> think<00:04:07.820> I'm<00:04:08.030> probably

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
18,000 something so I think I'm probably

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.670 
18,000 something so I think I'm probably
going<00:04:08.359> to<00:04:08.450> go<00:04:08.570> back<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.780> my<00:04:09.019> 4890<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:12.500> the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
going to go back to my 4890 and but the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.920 
going to go back to my 4890 and but the
450<00:04:13.340> in<00:04:13.519> my<00:04:13.700> folding<00:04:14.359> where<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.600> at<00:04:14.750> home

450 in my folding where you at home

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.590 
450 in my folding where you at home
