00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
bit quality to it and that tells me it's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
bit quality to it and that tells me it's
had<00:01:47.280> enough<00:01:47.369> kneading<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.420> yeast<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
had enough kneading all that yeast is

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.410 
had enough kneading all that yeast is
alive<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> ready<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> go<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:51.270> it
