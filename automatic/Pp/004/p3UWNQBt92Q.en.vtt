00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.590 
the way out there and hold it because
you<00:01:43.399> have<00:01:43.520> leverage<00:01:43.909> it's<00:01:44.060> like<00:01:44.179> bone<00:01:44.390> on<00:01:44.570> bone

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
you have leverage it's like bone on bone

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.870 
you have leverage it's like bone on bone
at<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.049> end<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:45.890> just<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:46.429> stuck<00:01:46.700> like

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
at the end it's just it's stuck like

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.209 
at the end it's just it's stuck like
this<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:48.200> muscles<00:01:48.500> are<00:01:48.590> contracting<00:01:49.070> but

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
this and the muscles are contracting but

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.190 
this and the muscles are contracting but
it's<00:01:49.369> an<00:01:49.969> easy<00:01:50.149> contraction<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.049> much

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
it's an easy contraction it's so much

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.450 
it's an easy contraction it's so much
leverage<00:01:51.469> you<00:01:51.679> can<00:01:51.799> pretty<00:01:51.950> much<00:01:52.039> stay<00:01:52.310> there

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
leverage you can pretty much stay there

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.179 
leverage you can pretty much stay there
all<00:01:52.579> day<00:01:52.789> if<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.420> were<00:01:53.539> back<00:01:53.689> like<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.409> can

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
all day if I were back like this I can

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.349 
all day if I were back like this I can
normally<00:01:55.520> have<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.700> lot<00:01:55.939> more<00:01:56.060> weight<00:01:56.240> than

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
normally have a lot more weight than

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.950 
normally have a lot more weight than
this<00:01:56.509> but<00:01:56.689> for<00:01:57.310> demonstrating<00:01:58.310> purposes<00:01:58.960> you

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
this but for demonstrating purposes you

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.679 
this but for demonstrating purposes you
want<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:01.070> don't<00:02:01.219> want<00:02:01.249> to<00:02:01.509> sit<00:02:02.509> out<00:02:02.600> there

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
want to you don't want to sit out there

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.910 
want to you don't want to sit out there

and hold or even for a second or two

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.529 
and hold or even for a second or two
because<00:02:04.189> what<00:02:04.579> happens<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.939> muscles<00:02:05.270> recover

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
because what happens the muscles recover

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.010 
because what happens the muscles recover
okay

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
okay

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.220 
okay
you<00:02:08.650> want<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.860> breathe<00:02:09.010> out<00:02:09.190> as<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.340> push<00:02:09.610> out

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
you want to breathe out as you push out

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.920 
you want to breathe out as you push out
maybe<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.350> slight<00:02:11.800> pause<00:02:12.130> or<00:02:12.670> not<00:02:13.450> even<00:02:13.750> that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
maybe a slight pause or not even that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.230 
maybe a slight pause or not even that
and<00:02:14.140> slowly<00:02:14.950> back<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.520> basically<00:02:15.940> tell

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
and slowly back so I basically tell

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.310 
and slowly back so I basically tell
people<00:02:16.480> when<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.630> go<00:02:16.720> out<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:16.990> is<00:02:17.140> a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
people when you go out like this is a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.840 
people when you go out like this is a
little<00:02:17.710> bit<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.950> turn<00:02:18.160> around<00:02:18.310> right<00:02:18.610> away

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
little bit of a turn around right away

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.240 
little bit of a turn around right away
and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.180> slow<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.540> down<00:02:19.830> now<00:02:20.830> with<00:02:20.890> hand

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
and then slow it down now with hand

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.980 
and then slow it down now with hand
position<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.210> don't<00:02:22.330> want<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> go<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.660> why

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
position you don't want to go to why

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.240 
position you don't want to go to why
just<00:02:23.320> like<00:02:23.410> with<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.650> push-ups<00:02:24.010> go<00:02:24.130> that's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
just like with the push-ups go that's

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.200 
just like with the push-ups go that's
going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> put<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> lot<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.760> stress<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
going to put a lot of stress on the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.760 
going to put a lot of stress on the
shoulder<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.960> don't<00:02:26.110> want<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.290> go<00:02:26.350> too<00:02:26.410> narrow

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
shoulder you don't want to go too narrow

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.170 
shoulder you don't want to go too narrow
either<00:02:27.100> maybe<00:02:27.340> once<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.760> while<00:02:27.910> for<00:02:27.940> a

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
either maybe once in a while for a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.580 
either maybe once in a while for a
variety<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:28.720> when<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.900> go<00:02:28.990> narrow<00:02:29.320> it's

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
variety but when you go narrow it's

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.320 
variety but when you go narrow it's
using<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.860> triceps<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.400> little<00:02:30.610> bit<00:02:30.730> more<00:02:30.880> you

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
using the triceps a little bit more you

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.910 
using the triceps a little bit more you
pretty<00:02:31.480> much<00:02:31.570> want<00:02:31.780> your<00:02:31.960> your<00:02:32.290> forearms

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
pretty much want your your forearms

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.490 
pretty much want your your forearms
parallel<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.580> each<00:02:33.700> other<00:02:33.900> when<00:02:34.900> they're<00:02:35.050> when

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
parallel to each other when they're when

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.080 
parallel to each other when they're when
they're<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:35.860> stretch<00:02:36.100> position<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.760> think

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
they're in this stretch position I think

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.850 
they're in this stretch position I think
mine<00:02:37.240> are<00:02:37.270> about<00:02:37.630> there<00:02:37.870> right<00:02:38.020> now<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.380> you

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
mine are about there right now and you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.110 
mine are about there right now and you
also<00:02:38.980> make<00:02:39.310> sure<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.670> your<00:02:39.790> grip<00:02:39.970> is

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
also make sure that your grip is

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.910 
also make sure that your grip is
symmetrical<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.840> if<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.020> look<00:02:41.140> at<00:02:41.290> these<00:02:41.410> hand

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
symmetrical so if you look at these hand

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.710 
symmetrical so if you look at these hand
grips<00:02:42.130> my<00:02:42.250> thumb's<00:02:42.490> are<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.790> same<00:02:43.330> distance

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
grips my thumb's are the same distance

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.990 
grips my thumb's are the same distance
from<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.020> end<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.250> ideally

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
from the end and then you can ideally

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.520 
from the end and then you can ideally
put<00:02:46.300> your<00:02:46.420> thumbs<00:02:46.600> around<00:02:46.750> use<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.140> opposable

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
put your thumbs around use the opposable

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.710 
put your thumbs around use the opposable
thumbs<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.520> make<00:02:48.640> sure<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.360> handle

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
thumbs to to make sure the the handle

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.970 
thumbs to to make sure the the handle
doesn't<00:02:49.960> slip<00:02:50.170> off<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.350> lot<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.620> people<00:02:50.710> I<00:02:50.950> see

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
doesn't slip off a lot of people I see

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.920 
doesn't slip off a lot of people I see
put<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.880> thumb<00:02:52.030> on<00:02:52.150> top<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.570> but

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
put the thumb on top like this but

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.900 
put the thumb on top like this but
there's<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.260> risk<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.650> slipping<00:02:54.430> off<00:02:54.730> when

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
there's the risk of slipping off when

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.800 
there's the risk of slipping off when
you're<00:02:55.030> doing<00:02:55.210> this<00:02:55.300> if<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.660> lot<00:02:55.780> of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
you're doing this if you have a lot of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.730 
you're doing this if you have a lot of
weight<00:02:55.990> that's<00:02:56.140> kind<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.320> danger<00:02:56.560> especially

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
if it's on a barbell you're on a bench I

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.020 
if it's on a barbell you're on a bench I
hate<00:03:00.010> seeing<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.340> when<00:03:00.550> people<00:03:00.640> are<00:03:00.880> like

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
hate seeing that when people are like

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.240 
hate seeing that when people are like
this<00:03:01.360> with<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.690> thumbs<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.050> top<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.530> bench

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
this with the thumbs on top on a bench

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.160 
this with the thumbs on top on a bench
press<00:03:03.520> because<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:03.970> your<00:03:04.540> hand<00:03:04.690> slips<00:03:04.960> off

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170

bumpers and just as you just heard but

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.950 
bumpers and just as you just heard but
it's<00:03:09.400> best<00:03:09.580> not<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.730> drop<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.090> weights<00:03:10.240> so

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
it's best not to drop the weights so

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.449 
it's best not to drop the weights so
it's<00:03:11.320> breathing<00:03:11.710> out<00:03:11.830> on<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.040> two<00:03:12.190> or<00:03:12.310> three

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
it's breathing out on the two or three

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.800 
it's breathing out on the two or three

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
count like this slight pause if any and

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.340 
count like this slight pause if any and
then<00:03:17.350> slowly<00:03:17.709> back<00:03:18.180> now<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.330> is<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.570> hammer

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350

is<00:03:23.920> also<00:03:24.100> good<00:03:24.340> for<00:03:24.459> variety<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.970> can<00:03:25.030> go<00:03:25.180> out

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
is also good for variety you can go out

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.220 
is also good for variety you can go out
like<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.750> alternate<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.560> movements<00:03:28.230> so

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
like this and alternate the movements so

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.690 
like this and alternate the movements so
you<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.410> do<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.590> kind<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:29.860> thing<00:03:29.920> alternate

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
you can do that kind of thing alternate

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.970 
you can do that kind of thing alternate
like<00:03:30.850> this<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.870> but<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.620> do<00:03:32.740> have<00:03:32.950> any

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
like this but but if you do have any

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.470 
like this but but if you do have any
kind<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.370> ice<00:03:33.490> lateral<00:03:33.910> machines<00:03:34.240> in<00:03:34.390> your

kind of ice lateral machines in your

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.120 
kind of ice lateral machines in your
facility<00:03:34.630> it's<00:03:35.440> good<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.740> use<00:03:35.890> them<00:03:36.040> because

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
facility it's good to use them because

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.920 
facility it's good to use them because
these<00:03:36.459> 25<00:03:36.910> pounds<00:03:37.360> even<00:03:37.480> though<00:03:37.660> they're<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
same on each side usually the body is

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.910 
same on each side usually the body is
not<00:03:40.240> symmetrical<00:03:40.810> okay<00:03:41.260> unless<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.590> strength

not symmetrical okay unless you strength
train<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.160> lot<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.640> you're<00:03:43.030> you're<00:03:43.840> used<00:03:44.080> to

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
train a lot and you're you're used to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.750 
train a lot and you're you're used to
doing<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.770> it<00:03:44.860> evens<00:03:45.370> out<00:03:45.490> when<00:03:45.670> you

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
doing this and it evens out when you

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.760 
doing this and it evens out when you
first<00:03:46.000> start<00:03:46.300> you're<00:03:47.290> definitely<00:03:47.470> going<00:03:47.709> to

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
first start you're definitely going to

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.500 
first start you're definitely going to
be<00:03:47.860> stronger<00:03:48.310> on<00:03:48.340> your<00:03:48.490> dominant<00:03:48.610> side<00:03:48.910> but

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
be stronger on your dominant side but

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.940 
be stronger on your dominant side but
what<00:03:49.660> happens<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:50.290> they<00:03:50.709> say<00:03:50.830> I'm

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
what happens is they say I'm

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.590 
what happens is they say I'm
right-handed<00:03:51.160> my<00:03:51.820> Dominus<00:03:52.180> sides<00:03:52.330> gonna<00:03:52.510> be<00:03:52.570> a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
right-handed my Dominus sides gonna be a

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.360 
right-handed my Dominus sides gonna be a
little<00:03:52.720> bit<00:03:52.870> stronger<00:03:53.080> but<00:03:53.709> as<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:53.980> strength

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
little bit stronger but as you strength

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.510 
little bit stronger but as you strength

train the non-dominant side has to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.680 
train the non-dominant side has to
basically<00:03:57.520> it's<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:57.910> it's<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.180> neuromuscular

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
basically it's a it's a neuromuscular

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.150 
basically it's a it's a neuromuscular
response<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:59.110> has<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.320> contract<00:03:59.680> more<00:03:59.800> muscle

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
response it has to contract more muscle

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.199 
response it has to contract more muscle
fibers<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.550> do<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.790> same<00:04:00.910> amount<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.150> work

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
because it's not as coordinated so say

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.160 
because it's not as coordinated so say

neuromuscular<00:04:10.480> Lee<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:11.110> so<00:04:11.739> more<00:04:11.920> muscle

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
neuromuscular Lee it is so more muscle

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.350 
neuromuscular Lee it is so more muscle
fibers<00:04:12.489> are<00:04:12.580> contracting<00:04:13.060> they're<00:04:13.180> going<00:04:13.300> to

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
fibers are contracting they're going to

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.940 
fibers are contracting they're going to
get<00:04:13.450> bigger<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:13.780> stronger<00:04:13.959> faster<00:04:14.350> until

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
get bigger and stronger faster until

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.130 
get bigger and stronger faster until
they<00:04:15.310> even<00:04:15.640> out<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.510> what<00:04:16.660> happens<00:04:17.020> is

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
they even out and what happens is

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.450 
they even out and what happens is
usually<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.560> non-dominant<00:04:18.070> sides<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.430> little

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
usually the non-dominant sides a little

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.740 
usually the non-dominant sides a little
bit

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
bit

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.650

than the dominant side after months or

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.760 
than the dominant side after months or
years<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.960> strength<00:04:23.170> training<00:04:23.380> because<00:04:23.650> it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
years of strength training because it

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.420 
years of strength training because it
has<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:23.980> that<00:04:24.430> super<00:04:25.420> compensation<00:04:26.020> response<00:04:26.440> I

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
has a that super compensation response I

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.220
