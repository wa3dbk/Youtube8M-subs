quick kit tutorial which is an idea
originally<00:01:15.810> developed<00:01:16.229> by<00:01:16.560> ethoslab<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
originally developed by ethoslab that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
originally developed by ethoslab that
he's<00:01:18.060> built<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.380> basically<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
he's built on and it's basically a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.640 
he's built on and it's basically a
machine<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.299> quickly<00:01:21.630> give<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.380> all

after you've died so it definitely takes

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
after you've died so it definitely takes
some<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> pain<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.470> dying<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.400> looks

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
some of the pain out of dying it looks

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
some of the pain out of dying it looks
very<00:01:29.939> cool<00:01:30.240> indeed<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.500> full

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
very cool indeed so that's a full

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.460 
very cool indeed so that's a full
tutorial<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.820> map<00:01:33.030> download<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.079> last

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
video was sent to me by Anthony for 2808

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
video was sent to me by Anthony for 2808
and<00:01:38.009> he's<00:01:38.310> done<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> really<00:01:38.790> cool<00:01:39.119> little

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and he's done a really cool little

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.109 
and he's done a really cool little
invention<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.290> captures<00:01:40.920> zombies<00:01:41.490> when

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
invention that captures zombies when

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.060 
invention that captures zombies when
they<00:01:42.329> break<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.990> door<00:01:43.229> which<00:01:43.860> is

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
they break down your door which is

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.069 
they break down your door which is
obviously<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.579> new<00:01:44.820> feature<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> snapshot

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
obviously a new feature in the snapshot

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.859 
obviously a new feature in the snapshot
and<00:01:46.380> coming<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.070> 1.2<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> really

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and coming up in 1.2 so this is a really

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.319 
and coming up in 1.2 so this is a really
good<00:01:49.170> defense<00:01:49.590> mechanism<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.759> can't<00:01:51.060> yet

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
good defense mechanism if you can't yet

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.289 
good defense mechanism if you can't yet
afford<00:01:51.530> iron<00:01:52.530> doors<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.549> go<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.759> check<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.149> out

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
afford iron doors so go and check it out

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.510 
afford iron doors so go and check it out
it's<00:01:54.659> pretty<00:01:55.110> ingenious

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.539 

and<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.119> fun<00:02:00.420> arts<00:02:00.719> day<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.500> nest<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.189> and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and so fun arts day is by nest do and

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.060 
and so fun arts day is by nest do and
they've<00:02:02.820> done<00:02:03.060> an<00:02:03.270> actual<00:02:03.840> acrylic<00:02:04.409> painting

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
they've done an actual acrylic painting

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.760 
they've done an actual acrylic painting
of<00:02:05.280> Minecraft<00:02:06.000> which<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.750> really<00:02:07.049> nice<00:02:07.289> so<00:02:07.619> go

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
of Minecraft which is really nice so go

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
of Minecraft which is really nice so go
and<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> look<00:02:08.130> at<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:09.209> finally
