general<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.790> were<00:01:17.909> punished<00:01:18.299> way

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
general is that you were punished way

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
general is that you were punished way
more<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.990> missing<00:01:19.290> shots<00:01:19.470> compared<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> fully

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
more for missing shots compared to fully

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.590 
more for missing shots compared to fully
automatic<00:01:20.610> weapons<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
automatic weapons because of the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
automatic weapons because of the
downtime<00:01:22.080> between<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.710> burrs<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
downtime between the burrs so it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.649 
downtime between the burrs so it
definitely<00:01:23.610> gets<00:01:23.909> into<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.330> skill-based

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
definitely gets into it more skill-based

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
definitely gets into it more skill-based
in<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.229> sense<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:25.950> enough<00:01:26.189> practice

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
in that sense but with enough practice

alright guys let's talk about umano r3

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.800 
alright guys let's talk about umano r3
form<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.310> birth<00:01:32.520> sim<00:01:32.729> Prime<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> basically

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
form of birth sim Prime and basically

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
form of birth sim Prime and basically
what<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.079> looking<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> full<00:01:35.369> on

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
what you're looking at here is a full on

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
what you're looking at here is a full on
status<00:01:35.909> build<00:01:36.150> by<00:01:36.390> combining<00:01:36.720> high<00:01:36.840> voltage

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
status build by combining high voltage

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.380 
status build by combining high voltage
thermite<00:01:37.890> rounds<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.400> malignant<00:01:38.850> force<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
thermite rounds and malignant force and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.810 
thermite rounds and malignant force and
then<00:01:40.020> after<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.710> raw<00:01:41.009> damage<00:01:41.280> mods<00:01:41.640> it's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
then after that for raw damage mods it's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.370 
then after that for raw damage mods it's
gonna<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> max<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> serration<00:01:43.049> heavy

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
gonna be a max of serration heavy

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.280 
gonna be a max of serration heavy
caliber<00:01:43.680> split<00:01:44.189> chamber<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.790> shred<00:01:45.540> shred<00:01:46.079> is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
caliber split chamber and shred shred is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.530 
caliber split chamber and shred shred is
also<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.710> great<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.189> burst<00:01:47.460> fire<00:01:47.729> weapons

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
also really great on burst fire weapons

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.569 
also really great on burst fire weapons
especially<00:01:49.229> because<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:50.070> course<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
especially because of course you get a

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.420 
especially because of course you get a
30%<00:01:50.880> fire<00:01:51.299> rate<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> 1.2<00:01:52.470> meter<00:01:52.740> punched

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
30% fire rate but the 1.2 meter punched

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.160 
30% fire rate but the 1.2 meter punched
through<00:01:53.640> works<00:01:54.119> great<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.020> get

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
through works great because you can get

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.069 
through works great because you can get
multiple<00:01:55.409> kills<00:01:56.060> sometimes<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.780> burst

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
multiple kills sometimes with one burst

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.260 
multiple kills sometimes with one burst
so<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.500> helps<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.369> know<00:01:59.490> especially<00:02:00.030> for

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
so it helps you know especially for

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.670 
so it helps you know especially for
burst<00:02:00.689> fire<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.439> like

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
burst fire because you don't have like

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.749 
burst fire because you don't have like
the<00:02:01.710> fully<00:02:02.399> automatic<00:02:02.790> aspect<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
the fully automatic aspect of it and

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.679 
the fully automatic aspect of it and
after<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.909> all<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.210> got<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.420> worry<00:02:06.570> about

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
after that all you got to worry about

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.830 
after that all you got to worry about
really<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.369> elemental<00:02:09.239> placements

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
really is you know elemental placements

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.940 
really is you know elemental placements
for<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> faction<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:10.739> there's<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
for the faction and then there's a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.589 
for the faction and then there's a
couple<00:02:11.160> things<00:02:11.489> I'll<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.180> kind<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.390> walk

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
couple things I'll just kind of walk

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.920 
couple things I'll just kind of walk
through<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:12.989> before<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:13.379> that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
through it but before I do that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.690 
through it but before I do that
and<00:02:14.019> I'll<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.709> show<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:14.950> kind<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.370> what<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
and I'll just show you kind of what to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.860 
and I'll just show you kind of what to
do<00:02:15.819> if<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.120> don't<00:02:16.299> have<00:02:16.540> high<00:02:16.720> voltage

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
do if you don't have high voltage

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.839 
do if you don't have high voltage
because<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.500> know<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.069> mod<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.519> still<00:02:18.730> an

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
because I know that this mod is still an

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.520 
because I know that this mod is still an
exclusive<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.599> people<00:02:19.900> might<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.439> been

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
exclusive and people might not have been

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.800 
exclusive and people might not have been
around<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:21.189> event<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:21.730> if<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.599> don't

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
around for this event so if you don't

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.559 
around for this event so if you don't
have<00:02:23.049> that<00:02:23.379> mod<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:24.819> thing<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.239> do<00:02:25.360> is

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
have that mod one thing you can do is

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.050 
have that mod one thing you can do is
drop<00:02:25.870> your<00:02:26.110> shred<00:02:26.349> down<00:02:26.530> one<00:02:26.799> point<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.370> then

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
drop your shred down one point and then

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.920 
drop your shred down one point and then
you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.049> put<00:02:29.349> on<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.920> two<00:02:30.159> from<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.519> top

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you can put on a two from the top

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.789 
you can put on a two from the top
stormbringer<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.349> will<00:02:32.500> put<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.769> at

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
stormbringer and this will put you at

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.130 
stormbringer and this will put you at
the<00:02:32.980> exact<00:02:33.340> same<00:02:33.609> damage<00:02:34.329> level<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.840> stick<00:02:35.049> at

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
the exact same damage level you stick at

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.559 
the exact same damage level you stick at
the<00:02:35.170> 60%<00:02:35.560> electrical<00:02:36.340> damage<00:02:36.519> but<00:02:37.299> of<00:02:37.390> course

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
the 60% electrical damage but of course

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.449 
the 60% electrical damage but of course
you'll<00:02:37.750> lose<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.109> 60%<00:02:38.650> status<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.099> that's<00:02:39.280> one

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
you'll lose the 60% status so that's one

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.309 
you'll lose the 60% status so that's one
option<00:02:39.670> another<00:02:40.060> thing<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:40.359> can<00:02:40.510> do<00:02:40.659> is<00:02:40.870> just

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
option another thing you can do is just

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.280 
option another thing you can do is just
add<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:42.069> polarity<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.359> a<00:02:43.390> V<00:02:43.750> slot<00:02:44.049> on

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
add in a polarity so like a V slot on

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.949 
add in a polarity so like a V slot on
your<00:02:44.319> malignant<00:02:44.859> force<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.750> way<00:02:46.900> you

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
your malignant force and that way you

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.479 
your malignant force and that way you
can<00:02:47.170> actually<00:02:47.349> max<00:02:47.739> out<00:02:47.950> your<00:02:47.980> stormbringer

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
can actually max out your stormbringer

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.610 
can actually max out your stormbringer
and<00:02:48.760> they'll<00:02:48.849> give<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.030> 30%<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:50.049> know<00:02:50.170> extra

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
and they'll give you 30% you know extra

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.550 
and they'll give you 30% you know extra
damage<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.849> won't<00:02:52.090> punish<00:02:52.389> you<00:02:52.690> for<00:02:53.290> if

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
damage and it won't punish you for if

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.410 
damage and it won't punish you for if
you<00:02:53.709> do<00:02:53.859> get<00:02:54.010> your<00:02:54.069> hands<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.909> Tetra<00:02:55.239> mods

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
you do get your hands on the Tetra mods

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.059 
you do get your hands on the Tetra mods
you<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:55.629> just<00:02:55.780> switch<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.079> in<00:02:56.379> like<00:02:56.889> if<00:02:57.010> you

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
you can just switch it in like if you

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.920 
you can just switch it in like if you
added<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.430> dash<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.120> would<00:02:58.359> it<00:02:58.569> would<00:02:58.720> kind

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
added a dash in it would it would kind

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.539 
added a dash in it would it would kind
of<00:02:58.989> mess<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.349> up<00:02:59.379> a<00:02:59.620> bit<00:02:59.769> just<00:03:00.069> because<00:03:00.400> you

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
of mess you up a bit just because you

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.690 
of mess you up a bit just because you
have<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.819> have<00:03:01.109> these<00:03:02.109> three<00:03:02.349> V<00:03:02.680> slots<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.280> so

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
have to have these three V slots in so

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.399 
have to have these three V slots in so
that's<00:03:03.819> an<00:03:04.030> option<00:03:04.209> I'll<00:03:04.930> leave<00:03:05.079> that<00:03:05.109> one

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
that's an option I'll leave that one

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.160 
that's an option I'll leave that one
completely<00:03:05.769> up<00:03:06.129> to<00:03:06.159> you<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:07.420> because<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:08.109> do

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
completely up to you but because I do

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.009 
completely up to you but because I do
have<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.650> mod<00:03:08.859> I<00:03:09.099> run<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:10.299> know<00:03:10.420> high<00:03:10.599> voltage

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
have the mod I run you know high voltage

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.559 
have the mod I run you know high voltage
and<00:03:11.370> thermite<00:03:12.370> rounds<00:03:12.639> in<00:03:12.730> malignant<00:03:13.120> forests

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
and thermite rounds in malignant forests

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.679 
and thermite rounds in malignant forests
and<00:03:13.859> I'm<00:03:14.859> also<00:03:15.040> able<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.400> run<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> maxout<00:03:16.299> shred

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
and I'm also able to run a maxout shred

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.020 
and I'm also able to run a maxout shred
in<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:16.959> case<00:03:17.170> but<00:03:17.739> this<00:03:18.099> build<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.489> for<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
in this case but this build is for the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.140 
in this case but this build is for the
Grenier<00:03:19.359> so<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:20.319> elemental<00:03:20.739> combos<00:03:21.069> for<00:03:21.310> this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
Grenier so the elemental combos for this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.839 
Grenier so the elemental combos for this
faction<00:03:22.599> is<00:03:22.750> basically<00:03:23.230> first<00:03:23.579> radiation<00:03:24.579> so

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
faction is basically first radiation so

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.189 
faction is basically first radiation so
electric<00:03:25.269> plus<00:03:25.449> fire<00:03:25.660> will<00:03:25.810> give<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:25.989> that

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
electric plus fire will give you that

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.020 
electric plus fire will give you that
great<00:03:26.769> against<00:03:26.980> allied<00:03:27.340> target<00:03:27.669> units<00:03:27.910> when

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
great against allied target units when

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.430 
great against allied target units when
it<00:03:28.120> procs<00:03:28.359> you<00:03:28.510> get<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.720> confusion<00:03:29.139> effect

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
it procs you get the confusion effect

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.559 
it procs you get the confusion effect
and<00:03:29.650> then<00:03:30.340> viral<00:03:30.849> after<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:31.419> that's

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
and then viral after that so that's

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.379 
and then viral after that so that's
poison<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.199> ice<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:33.459> will<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:33.970> affects<00:03:34.269> of

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
poison and ice this will this affects of

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.030 
poison and ice this will this affects of
entire<00:03:34.629> faction<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.199> when<00:03:35.290> aprox<00:03:35.620> it'll<00:03:35.829> half

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
entire faction and when aprox it'll half

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.420 
entire faction and when aprox it'll half
enemies<00:03:36.489> HP<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.329> works<00:03:37.540> great

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
enemies HP so it works great

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.270 
enemies HP so it works great
moving<00:03:39.430> on<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:39.849> corpus<00:03:40.449> though<00:03:40.659> now<00:03:41.129> corpus<00:03:42.129> is

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
moving on to corpus though now corpus is

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.250 
moving on to corpus though now corpus is
slightly<00:03:43.030> different<00:03:43.419> because<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.079> first

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
slightly different because the first

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.439 
slightly different because the first
thing<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.530> want<00:03:44.919> to<00:03:44.949> do<00:03:45.099> is<00:03:45.280> build<00:03:45.549> magnetics

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
thing you want to do is build magnetics

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.869 
thing you want to do is build magnetics
less<00:03:46.659> electric<00:03:47.199> and<00:03:47.379> ice<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.979> I<00:03:48.609> actually

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
less electric and ice and I actually

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.580 
less electric and ice and I actually
don't<00:03:49.359> run<00:03:49.569> thermite<00:03:50.019> rounds<00:03:50.349> for<00:03:50.470> this

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
don't run thermite rounds for this

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.460 
don't run thermite rounds for this
loadout<00:03:50.859> because<00:03:51.370> gas<00:03:51.729> is<00:03:52.030> not<00:03:52.989> great<00:03:53.290> for

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
loadout because gas is not great for

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.920 
loadout because gas is not great for
corpus<00:03:53.919> you'll<00:03:54.310> actually<00:03:54.459> get<00:03:54.639> minus<00:03:55.030> 25%

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
corpus you'll actually get minus 25%

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.420 
corpus you'll actually get minus 25%
damage<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.919> flesh<00:03:57.190> units<00:03:57.959> overall<00:03:58.959> and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
damage to flesh units overall and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.920 
damage to flesh units overall and
because<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.669> weapon<00:04:00.970> isn't<00:04:01.120> like<00:04:01.510> if<00:04:01.659> it<00:04:01.810> has

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
because the weapon isn't like if it has

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.140 
because the weapon isn't like if it has
great<00:04:02.260> status<00:04:02.739> with<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.340> probability<00:04:03.819> but

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
great status with the probability but

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.849 
great status with the probability but
because<00:04:04.449> it's<00:04:04.629> not<00:04:04.810> like<00:04:05.019> super<00:04:05.530> high<00:04:05.650> like

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
because it's not like super high like

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.949 
because it's not like super high like
100<00:04:06.190> percent<00:04:06.459> or<00:04:06.579> something<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.150> found<00:04:07.780> that

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
100 percent or something I found that

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.899 
100 percent or something I found that
the<00:04:08.109> malignant<00:04:08.470> force<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:08.769> itself<00:04:09.069> will<00:04:09.729> do

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
the malignant force on itself will do

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.159 
the malignant force on itself will do
more<00:04:10.090> work<00:04:10.299> for<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.659> because<00:04:10.780> you'll<00:04:11.019> get

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
more work for you because you'll get

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.460 
more work for you because you'll get
plus<00:04:11.680> 25%<00:04:12.159> of<00:04:12.519> flesh<00:04:12.669> units<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.479> also<00:04:13.629> goes

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
plus 25% of flesh units and it also goes

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.069 
plus 25% of flesh units and it also goes
through<00:04:14.829> shields<00:04:15.729> so<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.510> works<00:04:16.720> way<00:04:16.870> better

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
through shields so it works way better

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.360 
through shields so it works way better
for<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.530> this<00:04:17.620> way<00:04:17.829> I<00:04:17.859> was<00:04:18.010> able<00:04:18.099> to<00:04:18.220> put

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
for you and this way I was able to put

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.890 
for you and this way I was able to put
on<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.549> bane<00:04:18.699> of<00:04:18.729> corpus<00:04:19.180> which<00:04:19.359> is<00:04:19.510> an<00:04:19.630> extra

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
on the bane of corpus which is an extra

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.560 
on the bane of corpus which is an extra
30%<00:04:20.169> damage<00:04:20.620> throughout<00:04:20.979> affection<00:04:21.789> but<00:04:22.419> of

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
30% damage throughout affection but of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.810 
30% damage throughout affection but of
course<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.050> lower<00:04:23.260> my<00:04:23.500> shred<00:04:23.830> by<00:04:24.610> one

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
course that to lower my shred by one

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.029 
course that to lower my shred by one
point<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.240> fit<00:04:25.419> everything<00:04:25.659> on<00:04:25.960> we<00:04:26.770> want<00:04:26.950> to

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
point to fit everything on we want to

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.400 
point to fit everything on we want to
infest<00:04:27.370> the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
infest the

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.970 
infest the
so<00:04:28.830> infested<00:04:30.020> basically<00:04:31.020> what<00:04:31.860> you're

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
so infested basically what you're

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.200 
so infested basically what you're
looking<00:04:32.010> at<00:04:32.280> here<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.580> actually<00:04:32.910> should<00:04:33.120> be

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
looking at here this actually should be

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.860 
looking at here this actually should be
in<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.450> position<00:04:33.690> because<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.650> run<00:04:35.630> toxic<00:04:36.630> and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
in this position because I run toxic and

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.050 
in this position because I run toxic and
fire<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.800> give<00:04:37.950> me<00:04:38.070> gas<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.910> will

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
fire to give me gas and that will

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.110 
fire to give me gas and that will
basically<00:04:39.240> make<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.840> AoE<00:04:40.440> explosion<00:04:41.310> when<00:04:42.030> it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
basically make the AoE explosion when it

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.180 
basically make the AoE explosion when it
procs<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:42.810> also<00:04:42.960> puts<00:04:43.290> a<00:04:43.380> dot<00:04:43.560> effect<00:04:43.980> on

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
procs and it also puts a dot effect on

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.850 
procs and it also puts a dot effect on
the<00:04:44.430> enemy<00:04:44.610> which<00:04:45.540> works<00:04:45.870> great<00:04:46.200> when<00:04:46.710> you're

the enemy which works great when you're
dealing<00:04:47.040> with<00:04:47.220> large<00:04:47.520> groups<00:04:47.730> of<00:04:47.940> infested

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
and then when the electric is put by

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.660 
and then when the electric is put by
itself

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670

it'll<00:04:51.240> when<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:51.540> procs<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.960> will<00:04:52.050> do<00:04:52.170> an

it'll when it procs it will do an

it'll when it procs it will do an

electric chain stun that is a form of CC

against<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.980> faction<00:04:56.400> -<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:56.940> these<00:04:57.780> 3<00:04:58.530> mods

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
against the faction - so these 3 mods

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.470 
against the faction - so these 3 mods
work<00:04:58.980> really<00:04:59.250> well<00:04:59.430> together<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.910> this<00:05:00.060> order

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
work really well together in this order

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.240 
work really well together in this order
and<00:05:00.510> then<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.870> course<00:05:00.900> bane<00:05:01.290> of<00:05:01.320> emphasis<00:05:01.830> on<00:05:01.980> 4

30%<00:05:02.910> damage<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.270> faction<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.560> this

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
30% damage to the faction and in this

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.830 
30% damage to the faction and in this
case<00:05:04.890> I<00:05:05.040> was<00:05:05.130> able<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.400> use<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.670> maxed<00:05:06.240> out<00:05:06.360> shred

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
case I was able to use a maxed out shred

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.170 
case I was able to use a maxed out shred
now<00:05:07.590> for<00:05:07.920> the<00:05:08.190> voids<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.730> first<00:05:09.000> thing<00:05:09.120> you

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
now for the voids the first thing you

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.850 
now for the voids the first thing you
want<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.360> do<00:05:09.450> is<00:05:09.600> make<00:05:09.780> this<00:05:09.960> switch<00:05:10.230> so<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.620> go

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
want to do is make this switch so you go

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.580 
want to do is make this switch so you go
corrosive<00:05:11.550> fire<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:12.300> then<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.200> have<00:05:13.380> to

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
corrosive fire and then you have to

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.750 
corrosive fire and then you have to
lower<00:05:14.340> your<00:05:14.430> shred<00:05:14.910> by<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> point<00:05:15.540> again<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:17.640> do

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
lower your shred by a point again to do

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.590 
lower your shred by a point again to do
this<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.270> then<00:05:18.750> what<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:18.960> actually<00:05:19.260> do<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.980> I

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
this and then what I actually do is I

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.260 
this and then what I actually do is I
put<00:05:21.600> on<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.750> maxed<00:05:22.350> out<00:05:22.440> hellfire<00:05:23.190> instead<00:05:24.090> of

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
put on a maxed out hellfire instead of

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.000 
put on a maxed out hellfire instead of
you<00:05:24.480> know<00:05:24.510> obviously<00:05:24.870> going<00:05:25.169> cold<00:05:25.500> because

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
you know obviously going cold because

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.290 
you know obviously going cold because
you'd<00:05:26.190> have<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.400> get<00:05:26.490> rid<00:05:26.640> of<00:05:26.669> thermite<00:05:27.030> rounds

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
you'd have to get rid of thermite rounds

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.659 
you'd have to get rid of thermite rounds
but<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:28.500> real<00:05:28.710> reason<00:05:28.980> why<00:05:29.070> I<00:05:29.100> do<00:05:29.220> this<00:05:29.340> is

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
but the real reason why I do this is

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:30.830 
but the real reason why I do this is
there's<00:05:30.150> actually<00:05:30.480> been<00:05:30.540> a<00:05:30.600> lot<00:05:30.660> of

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
there's actually been a lot of

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.590 
there's actually been a lot of
discussion<00:05:31.410> about<00:05:31.500> this<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.580> I<00:05:33.300> think<00:05:33.480> it's

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
discussion about this and I think it's

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.090 
discussion about this and I think it's
mostly<00:05:33.870> surrounding<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.350> thermite<00:05:34.770> rounds

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
mostly surrounding the thermite rounds

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.659 
mostly surrounding the thermite rounds
but<00:05:35.990> corrosive<00:05:36.990> fire<00:05:37.380> will<00:05:38.130> actually<00:05:38.550> give

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
but corrosive fire will actually give

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.280 
but corrosive fire will actually give
you<00:05:38.850> more<00:05:38.880> damage<00:05:39.600> against<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.080> heavy

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
you more damage against the heavy

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.890 
you more damage against the heavy
Gunners<00:05:40.830> in<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:42.150> voids<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.510> that's<00:05:42.660> really

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
Gunners in the voids and that's really

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.380 
Gunners in the voids and that's really
the<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.560> biggest<00:05:44.070> problem<00:05:44.580> in<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.970> voids<00:05:45.180> is

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
the the biggest problem in the voids is

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.700 
the the biggest problem in the voids is
the<00:05:45.510> heavy<00:05:45.660> gunners<00:05:45.900> they're<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:46.350> toughest

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
the heavy gunners they're the toughest

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.140 
the heavy gunners they're the toughest
enemy<00:05:47.010> and<00:05:47.190> most<00:05:47.640> of<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.820> time<00:05:48.000> you're

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
enemy and most of the time you're

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.850 
enemy and most of the time you're
modding<00:05:48.450> against<00:05:48.840> them<00:05:49.050> that's<00:05:49.530> why<00:05:49.800> you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
modding against them that's why you

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.380 
modding against them that's why you
build<00:05:50.100> corrosive<00:05:50.640> because<00:05:51.060> of<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.240> heavy

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
build corrosive because of the heavy

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.690 
build corrosive because of the heavy
gunners<00:05:51.600> now<00:05:52.320> corrosive<00:05:52.919> coal<00:05:53.130> which<00:05:53.400> you

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
gunners now corrosive coal which you

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.090 
gunners now corrosive coal which you
know<00:05:53.820> I<00:05:53.850> run<00:05:54.630> is<00:05:54.840> good<00:05:55.410> is<00:05:55.590> better<00:05:55.830> for<00:05:55.979> an

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
know I run is good is better for an

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.760 
know I run is good is better for an
all-around<00:05:56.520> build<00:05:56.850> because<00:05:57.240> cold<00:05:58.200> will<00:05:58.560> do

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
all-around build because cold will do

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.159 
all-around build because cold will do
good<00:05:59.010> damage<00:05:59.310> against<00:05:59.669> the<00:05:59.910> fusion<00:06:00.570> Mo's<00:06:00.720> and

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
good damage against the fusion Mo's and

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.320 
good damage against the fusion Mo's and
shielded<00:06:01.860> targets<00:06:02.220> like<00:06:02.370> from<00:06:02.640> the<00:06:02.790> Ospreys

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
shielded targets like from the Ospreys

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.790 
shielded targets like from the Ospreys
and<00:06:03.630> it<00:06:03.900> even<00:06:04.080> does<00:06:04.200> damage<00:06:04.470> against<00:06:04.650> the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
and it even does damage against the

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.950 
and it even does damage against the
Lancers<00:06:05.250> but<00:06:05.640> some<00:06:05.790> people<00:06:06.060> argue<00:06:06.390> but<00:06:06.540> that

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
Lancers but some people argue but that

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.050 
Lancers but some people argue but that
those<00:06:07.470> mobs<00:06:07.710> are<00:06:07.890> just<00:06:08.040> trash<00:06:08.280> mobs<00:06:08.550> anyway<00:06:09.000> so

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
those mobs are just trash mobs anyway so

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.350 
those mobs are just trash mobs anyway so
who<00:06:09.300> cares<00:06:09.540> why<00:06:10.229> not<00:06:10.410> just<00:06:10.650> build<00:06:11.360> corrosive

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
who cares why not just build corrosive

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.480 
who cares why not just build corrosive
heat<00:06:12.630> so<00:06:13.260> I<00:06:13.530> mean<00:06:13.740> for<00:06:13.860> this<00:06:13.979> bill<00:06:14.190> that<00:06:14.340> works

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
heat so I mean for this bill that works

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.950 
heat so I mean for this bill that works
because<00:06:14.820> you're<00:06:14.970> getting<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.360> more<00:06:15.570> status

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
because you're getting the more status

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.180 
because you're getting the more status
from<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.200> thermite<00:06:16.500> rounds<00:06:16.800> but<00:06:16.919> I've<00:06:17.040> been

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
from the thermite rounds but I've been

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.860 
from the thermite rounds but I've been
testing<00:06:17.640> it<00:06:17.760> and<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:18.060> actually<00:06:18.210> works<00:06:18.600> really

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
testing it and it actually works really

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.370 
testing it and it actually works really
well<00:06:19.140> like<00:06:19.710> you<00:06:19.890> drop<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.310> Gunners<00:06:21.260> you<00:06:22.260> know

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
well like you drop the Gunners you know

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.350 
well like you drop the Gunners you know
a<00:06:22.590> lot<00:06:23.220> better<00:06:23.430> than<00:06:23.580> you<00:06:23.669> do<00:06:23.820> with<00:06:24.000> the<00:06:24.120> cold

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
a lot better than you do with the cold
