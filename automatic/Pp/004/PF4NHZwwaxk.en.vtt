00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
toned palette and I didn't think I'd

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929 
toned palette and I didn't think I'd
like<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.780> because<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.129> cool<00:01:05.430> tone<00:01:05.700> and

so gray base and grey has always been

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.270 
so gray base and grey has always been
like<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.659> shade<00:01:10.170> family<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.830> I've<00:01:11.010> always

like a shade family that I've always

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640 
like a shade family that I've always
just<00:01:11.430> stayed<00:01:11.880> away<00:01:12.150> from<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.990> i'm<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.320> happy<00:01:13.500> i

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
just stayed away from but i'm so happy i

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.109 
just stayed away from but i'm so happy i
picked<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.220> palette<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> really

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
picked up this palette because it really

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.620 
picked up this palette because it really
kind<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.659> opened<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.740> mind<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.610> new<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.270> shades

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
kind of opened my mind to new or shades

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.990 
kind of opened my mind to new or shades
also<00:01:19.259> when<00:01:19.470> i<00:01:19.500> first<00:01:19.890> saw<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.310> palette<00:01:20.729> i<00:01:20.850> was

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
also when i first saw this palette i was

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
also when i first saw this palette i was
very<00:01:21.270> doubtful<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.979> grouping<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
very doubtful because the grouping of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300 
very doubtful because the grouping of
colors<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:25.049> awkward<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
colors is a little awkward because you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.300 
colors is a little awkward because you
have<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.060> green<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> reddish<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.920> navy

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
have like a green a reddish and navy

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.749 
have like a green a reddish and navy
blue<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.939> i<00:01:30.840> feel<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.590> half<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
blue and i feel like this half of the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.539 
blue and i feel like this half of the
palette<00:01:33.360> makes<00:01:33.750> sense<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.979> when<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> get<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
palette makes sense but when you get to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.359 
palette makes sense but when you get to
this<00:01:35.790> half<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.860> don't

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this half it's just a little I don't

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.830 
this half it's just a little I don't
know<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.640> looked<00:01:38.850> kind<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.329> an<00:01:39.600> awkward

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
know it looked kind of like an awkward

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
know it looked kind of like an awkward
pairing<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.740> me<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> actually<00:01:41.400> works<00:01:42.060> really

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
pairing to me it actually works really

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.469 
pairing to me it actually works really
well<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.930> very<00:01:43.259> versatile<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.360> even<00:01:45.360> though

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
well it's very versatile and even though

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.480 
well it's very versatile and even though
