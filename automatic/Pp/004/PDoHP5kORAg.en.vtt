DS<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> other<00:01:19.049> reason<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.470> went<00:01:19.680> for

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
DS so that's the other reason I went for

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
DS so that's the other reason I went for
Sanchez<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.210> said<00:01:21.390> he<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.780> quite

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
Sanchez but as I said he is quite

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.690 
Sanchez but as I said he is quite
expensive<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.799> he<00:01:22.950> will<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.189> picking<00:01:23.490> up<00:01:23.549> in

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
expensive and he will be picking up in

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
expensive and he will be picking up in
price<00:01:23.909> overall<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:24.869> his<00:01:25.170> eighty-five

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
price overall because his eighty-five

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
price overall because his eighty-five
ratings<00:01:26.220> first<00:01:26.640> informed<00:01:27.060> card<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.360> only<00:01:27.540> 1.5

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
ratings first informed card is only 1.5

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
ratings first informed card is only 1.5
mil<00:01:28.470> because<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:29.159> them<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.310> striker

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
mil because you can put them in striker

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
mil because you can put them in striker
if<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> want<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.180> basically<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> cam<00:01:30.780> but

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
if you want it's basically a cam but

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.140 
if you want it's basically a cam but
this<00:01:31.740> play<00:01:31.950> will<00:01:32.100> also<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> reckon<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.880> over<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
this play will also I reckon be over a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.520 
this play will also I reckon be over a
million<00:01:33.329> give<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> couple<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.229> weeks<00:01:34.320> give

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
million give it a couple of weeks give

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
million give it a couple of weeks give
it<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> week<00:01:34.829> even<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.430> it'll<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.850> there

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
it a week even I think it'll be up there

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.789 
it a week even I think it'll be up there
so<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.689> catch<00:01:36.869> him<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.530> buy<00:01:37.710> him

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
so you catch him if you can all buy him

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.560 
so you catch him if you can all buy him
now<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
now if you can but this is a I think a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.210 
now if you can but this is a I think a
nice<00:01:39.780> long<00:01:40.020> shot<00:01:40.259> yet<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> nice<00:01:40.829> long<00:01:41.040> shot

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
nice long shot yet is a nice long shot

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.889 
nice long shot yet is a nice long shot
they<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.610> into<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> batter<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
they go into the batter in there and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.050 
they go into the batter in there and
that's<00:01:43.200> something<00:01:43.320> about<00:01:44.310> Sanchez<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that's something about Sanchez and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
that's something about Sanchez and
Ronaldo<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.689> both<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.170> common<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
Ronaldo that both have in common is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
Ronaldo that both have in common is
their<00:01:46.890> shooting<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.329> point<00:01:48.659> it's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
their shooting is actually on point it's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.050 
their shooting is actually on point it's
brilliant<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.920> he's<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.700> 89

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
brilliant and he's actually got 89

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.389 
brilliant and he's actually got 89
shooting<00:01:51.600> that's<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:52.049> not<00:01:52.170> bad<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:53.250> some

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
shooting that's really not bad for some

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.859 
shooting that's really not bad for some
of<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.790> his<00:01:54.030> price<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.509> seems<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
of of his price and it seems like a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.999 
of of his price and it seems like a
weird<00:01:55.049> thing<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.290> say<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.829> probably

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
weird thing to say because you probably

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
weird thing to say because you probably
get<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> few<00:01:56.759> other<00:01:56.880> players<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.600> quite

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
get a few other players that have quite

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
get a few other players that have quite
high<00:01:58.170> shooting<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.890> they're<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.100> form<00:01:59.399> or

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
high shooting and they're in form or

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
high shooting and they're in form or
something<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:00.960> dude<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.799> as

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
something like that but dude have as

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.200 
something like that but dude have as
much<00:02:01.979> pace<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.399> him<00:02:02.490> did<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:02.969> much

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
much pace as him did have as much

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.450 
much pace as him did have as much
dribbling<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.140> him<00:02:04.320> not<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.369> don't

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
dribbling as him not really I don't

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.700 
dribbling as him not really I don't
think<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:05.969> do<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.600> Sanchez<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.619> of

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
think they do because Sanchez is one of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.169 
think they do because Sanchez is one of
the<00:02:07.770> coins<00:02:08.009> playing<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.789> left<00:02:08.940> side<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the coins playing on the left side of

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.520 
the coins playing on the left side of
the<00:02:09.239> pitch<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.509> well<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:09.989> Ronaldo's<00:02:10.379> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the pitch as well just like Ronaldo's of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.960 
the pitch as well just like Ronaldo's of
reason<00:02:10.770> why<00:02:10.860> picks<00:02:11.129> him<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.489> as<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.910> see

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
reason why picks him and as you can see

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.190 
reason why picks him and as you can see
from<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> gameplay<00:02:12.690> I've<00:02:12.810> already<00:02:12.989> showed

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
from the gameplay I've already showed

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.790 
from the gameplay I've already showed
you<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.349> think

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you I think

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.250 
you I think
to<00:02:13.950> free<00:02:14.670> kicks<00:02:14.940> which<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.480> pretty<00:02:15.870> decent

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
to free kicks which a pretty decent

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.450 
to free kicks which a pretty decent
they're<00:02:16.350> quite<00:02:16.530> accurate<00:02:16.890> free<00:02:17.070> kicks<00:02:17.280> for

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
they're quite accurate free kicks for

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.460 
they're quite accurate free kicks for
someone<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.820> think<00:02:18.120> he<00:02:18.360> has<00:02:18.450> 75<00:02:19.080> free-kick

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
someone I think he has 75 free-kick

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.320 
someone I think he has 75 free-kick
accuracy<00:02:19.920> he<00:02:20.490> does<00:02:20.700> take<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> very<00:02:21.270> good

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
accuracy he does take a very good

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330 
accuracy he does take a very good
free-kick<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.960> that's<00:02:22.080> also<00:02:22.260> another<00:02:22.500> thing

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
free-kick and that's also another thing

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.680 
free-kick and that's also another thing
that<00:02:23.400> relates<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.970> renown<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.420> he's<00:02:24.540> also

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
that relates to renown because he's also

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.530 
that relates to renown because he's also
known<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:24.990> his<00:02:25.200> free<00:02:25.350> kicks<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:26.510> apart<00:02:27.510> from

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
known for his free kicks and apart from

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.270 
known for his free kicks and apart from
that<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.900> game<00:02:28.080> wise<00:02:28.290> he's<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.710> some<00:02:28.980> awesome

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
that in game wise he's got some awesome

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.150 
that in game wise he's got some awesome
stats<00:02:29.700> 90<00:02:30.150> balance<00:02:30.450> 95<00:02:31.230> virginity<00:02:31.680> 92

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
stats 90 balance 95 virginity 92

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.130 
stats 90 balance 95 virginity 92
acceleration<00:02:32.760> there's<00:02:33.390> one<00:02:33.540> thing<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.080> I

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
acceleration there's one thing that I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.450 
acceleration there's one thing that I
would<00:02:34.200> say<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.770> know<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:35.190> bit<00:02:35.310> if

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
would say is you know a little bit if

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.680 
would say is you know a little bit if
well<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> little<00:02:35.910> bit<00:02:36.090> different<00:02:36.360> quite

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
well a little bit different quite

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.420 
well a little bit different quite
different<00:02:37.170> compared<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.830> Ronaldo<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.250> its
