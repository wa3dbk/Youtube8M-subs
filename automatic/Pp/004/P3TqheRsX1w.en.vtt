00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
this surface is very slippery so it

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.369 
this surface is very slippery so it
would<00:03:32.450> tip<00:03:32.599> like<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.410> would<00:03:33.560> turn<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:35.379> you

come to install this look at the tabs on

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.650 
come to install this look at the tabs on
it<00:03:52.040> you'll<00:03:53.040> notice<00:03:53.430> one<00:03:53.790> tap<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.300> bigger<00:03:54.480> than

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
it you'll notice one tap is bigger than

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.360 
it you'll notice one tap is bigger than
the<00:03:54.780> other

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
the other

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.110 
the other
same<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.550> here<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:58.530> top<00:03:58.710> tap<00:03:58.950> is<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.670> lot<00:03:59.880> bigger

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
same on here the top tap is a lot bigger

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
same on here the top tap is a lot bigger
in<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.690> bottom<00:04:00.960> top<00:04:02.390> obviously<00:04:03.390> basically<00:04:03.990> so

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
in the bottom top obviously basically so

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.630 
in the bottom top obviously basically so
you<00:04:04.200> can't<00:04:04.440> pull<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.620> hazard<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.010> upside<00:04:05.310> down

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
you can't pull the hazard in upside down

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.000 
you can't pull the hazard in upside down
and<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.210> doesn't<00:04:06.480> twist<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.410> loom<00:04:07.620> by<00:04:07.950> the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
and so it doesn't twist the loom by the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.890 
and so it doesn't twist the loom by the
plug<00:04:08.220> connector<00:04:08.610> attaches<00:04:08.880> onto<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
plug connector attaches onto just the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.380 
plug connector attaches onto just the
lemon<00:04:10.020> it's<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.350> lot<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.560> problems<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.940> will<00:04:12.300> you

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
lemon it's a lot of problems so will you

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.560 
lemon it's a lot of problems so will you
just<00:04:12.510> do<00:04:12.690> your<00:04:13.020> fruit<00:04:13.230> back<00:04:13.440> up<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.770> it<00:04:14.570> I'll

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
try and put it in upside down now a

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.680 
try and put it in upside down now a
little<00:04:19.950> time<00:04:20.100> at<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.220> top<00:04:20.459> that's<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.420> seven

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
little time at the top that's it seven
