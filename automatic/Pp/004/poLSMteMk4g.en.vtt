applied<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:47.250> small<00:02:47.460> difference<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.940> might

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
applied and a small difference you might

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.990 
applied and a small difference you might
notice<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.780> runs<00:02:48.990> super<00:02:49.320> SU<00:02:49.880> instead<00:02:50.880> of

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
notice is it runs super SU instead of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.600 
notice is it runs super SU instead of
super<00:02:51.510> user<00:02:51.770> again<00:02:52.770> that's<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.280> different

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
super user again that's just a different

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.790 
super user again that's just a different
app<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:54.060> managing<00:02:54.480> your<00:02:54.660> super<00:02:55.230> user<00:02:55.440> rights

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
app for managing your super user rights

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.220 
app for managing your super user rights
and<00:02:56.100> that's<00:02:56.880> roughly<00:02:57.240> it<00:02:57.330> for<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.840> release

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
and that's roughly it for this release

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.900 
and that's roughly it for this release
really<00:02:58.650> stable<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.160> haven't<00:02:59.520> noticed<00:02:59.640> any

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
really stable I haven't noticed any

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.470 
really stable I haven't noticed any
lagging<00:03:00.360> what's<00:03:00.900> good<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.350> no<00:03:02.120> random<00:03:03.120> reboots

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
lagging what's good is no random reboots

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.020 
lagging what's good is no random reboots
and<00:03:03.830> also<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.100> power<00:03:05.370> menu<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.700> believe

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
and also we have a power menu I believe

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.940 
and also we have a power menu I believe
right<00:03:06.060> there<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.570> can<00:03:06.750> power<00:03:07.230> off<00:03:07.410> reboot<00:03:07.800> go

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
right there you can power off reboot go

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.770 
right there you can power off reboot go
straight<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.280> recovery<00:03:08.640> which<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.910> great<00:03:09.210> has

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
straight to recovery which is great has

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.430 
straight to recovery which is great has
the<00:03:09.990> usual<00:03:10.380> issues<00:03:10.830> toggles<00:03:11.550> on<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> top<00:03:12.030> here
