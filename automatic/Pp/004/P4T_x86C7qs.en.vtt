00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
I was out here just admiring it because

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.460 
I was out here just admiring it because
it's<00:01:48.840> nice<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:48.990> clean<00:01:49.380> now

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
it's nice and clean now

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.500 
it's nice and clean now
so<00:01:52.190> it's<00:01:52.310> been<00:01:52.460> about<00:01:52.550> five<00:01:52.910> years<00:01:52.940> since<00:01:53.330> I've

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
so it's been about five years since I've

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.150 
so it's been about five years since I've
built<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:55.000> haven't<00:01:56.000> done<00:01:56.120> much<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:56.720> since

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
built this haven't done much to it since

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.260 
built this haven't done much to it since
kind<00:01:58.160> of<00:01:58.220> hard<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.430> grow<00:01:58.610> plants<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.120> it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
kind of hard to grow plants in it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.060 
kind of hard to grow plants in it
because<00:01:59.570> it's<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.080> much<00:02:00.140> shade<00:02:00.530> from<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.860> tree

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
because it's so much shade from the tree

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.970 
because it's so much shade from the tree
but<00:02:01.840> still<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.870> cool<00:02:03.110> pond<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:06.110> then<00:02:06.470> about

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
but still a cool pond and then about

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.160 
but still a cool pond and then about
four<00:02:07.970> years<00:02:08.149> ago<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.420> built<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:09.020> one<00:02:11.170> which

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
four years ago I built that one which

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.770 
four years ago I built that one which
there's<00:02:12.380> nothing<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.860> there<00:02:13.040> now<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.780> put

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
there's nothing in there now I put

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.600 
there's nothing in there now I put
actually<00:02:15.290> chlorine<00:02:15.680> tablet<00:02:16.070> in<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.430> keep

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
actually chlorine tablet in it to keep

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.550 
actually chlorine tablet in it to keep
it<00:02:16.730> clear<00:02:17.000> because<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.930> doesn't<00:02:18.200> have<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.320> good

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
it clear because it doesn't have a good

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.680 
it clear because it doesn't have a good
filter<00:02:19.010> system<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.500> just<00:02:21.680> did<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.920> for<00:02:21.980> now

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
filter system so I just did that for now

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.850 
filter system so I just did that for now
and<00:02:23.690> then<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.890> most<00:02:25.100> recent<00:02:25.520> one<00:02:25.640> out<00:02:25.820> here

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
and then the most recent one out here

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.690 
and then the most recent one out here
it's<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.220> mess<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:29.030> completely<00:02:29.810> overgrown

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
it's a mess it's completely overgrown

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.730 
it's a mess it's completely overgrown
but<00:02:31.700> that's<00:02:31.910> actually<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.420> pond<00:02:32.810> right<00:02:33.170> there<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
but that's actually a pond right there I

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.960 
but that's actually a pond right there I
don't<00:02:33.860> know<00:02:33.980> if<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.160> can<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.460> water<00:02:34.670> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
don't know if you can see the water and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.500 
don't know if you can see the water and
this<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.870> actually<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> pond<00:02:36.530> right<00:02:36.680> here<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.510> I

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
this is actually a pond right here and I

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.080 
this is actually a pond right here and I
believe<00:02:39.400> there's<00:02:40.400> actually<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.850> lot<00:02:41.060> of

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
believe there's actually a lot of

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.260 
believe there's actually a lot of
