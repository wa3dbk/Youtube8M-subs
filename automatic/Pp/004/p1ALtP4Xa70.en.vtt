in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> same<00:02:03.659> effect<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.759> had<00:02:06.000> which

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
in the same effect as I just had which

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.469 
in the same effect as I just had which
is<00:02:06.509> our<00:02:06.719> own<00:02:07.220> thousand<00:02:08.220> five<00:02:08.429> six

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
is our own thousand five six

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.440 
is our own thousand five six
okay<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.259> that's<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.769> first<00:02:11.069> bit<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:12.269> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
okay so that's the first bit of all the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.320 
okay so that's the first bit of all the
arrows<00:02:12.860> now<00:02:13.860> let<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.459> go<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.870> second<00:02:16.290> part

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
arrows now let me go to the second part

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.539 
arrows now let me go to the second part
so<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.629> is<00:02:18.659> bath<00:02:19.409> will<00:02:19.709> stand<00:02:19.980> alone<00:02:20.129> which
