have some cars next you can color along
with<00:00:07.020> me<00:00:07.200> I'll<00:00:07.710> start<00:00:08.040> off<00:00:08.130> by<00:00:08.340> using<00:00:08.370> yellow

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
with me I'll start off by using yellow

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.419 
with me I'll start off by using yellow
up<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> sky<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.380> adding<00:00:10.950> some<00:00:11.130> yellow

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
up in the sky and adding some yellow

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.810 
up in the sky and adding some yellow
clouds<00:00:11.849> up<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:13.070> I'm<00:00:14.070> gonna<00:00:14.250> color<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.490> nice

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
clouds up here I'm gonna color a nice

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.380 
clouds up here I'm gonna color a nice
tone<00:00:15.210> all<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> way<00:00:15.660> across<00:00:17.270> starting<00:00:18.270> with

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
tone all the way across starting with

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.500 
tone all the way across starting with
this<00:00:18.949> curving<00:00:19.949> around<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:24.090> didn't<00:00:24.330> color

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
this curving around and now didn't color

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.970 
this curving around and now didn't color
all<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> way<00:00:25.050> across<00:00:25.230> I'll<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.769> makes

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
all the way across I'll see how it makes

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.290 
all the way across I'll see how it makes
the<00:00:26.099> clouds<00:00:26.310> jump<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.029> from<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the clouds jump out and from the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.750 
the clouds jump out and from the
background<00:00:27.510> back<00:00:27.990> there<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:29.250> colors<00:00:29.580> really

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
background back there see colors really

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.490 
background back there see colors really
fun<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.090> experiment<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.929> only<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
fun to experiment with not only with the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.020 
fun to experiment with not only with the
little<00:00:31.769> beakers<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.309> gene<00:00:32.520> diamond<00:00:32.880> was

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
little beakers that gene diamond was

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.940 
little beakers that gene diamond was
using<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.750> she<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.050> mixing<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.800> those

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
using when she was mixing up those

using when she was mixing up those
primary<00:00:35.460> colors<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.180> he<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.390> experiment

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
primary colors but he can experiment

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.990 
primary colors but he can experiment
right<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> paper<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.710> colors<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> help

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
right on the paper with colors and help

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.490 
right on the paper with colors and help
you<00:00:39.090> experiment<00:00:39.660> might<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you experiment might want to get one of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
you experiment might want to get one of
these<00:00:40.590> color<00:00:41.340> wheels<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.850> has<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> primary

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
these color wheels that has the primary

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.569 
these color wheels that has the primary
colors<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.050> already<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
colors are already on it for you and it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.900 
colors are already on it for you and it
has<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> secondary<00:00:45.360> colors<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.350> explains

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
has the secondary colors and it explains

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.220 
has the secondary colors and it explains
analogous<00:00:47.910> colors<00:00:48.270> are<00:00:48.510> colors<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.020> are

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
analogous colors are colors that are

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.420 
analogous colors are colors that are
right<00:00:49.379> next<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.739> each<00:00:49.860> other<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> color

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
right next to each other in the color

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.279 
right next to each other in the color
will<00:00:50.670> they're<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.329> brothers<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.870> sisters

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
will they're like brothers and sisters

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.869 
will they're like brothers and sisters
because<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:52.800> along<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.370> well<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:53.610> look

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
because they get along so well they look

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.700 
because they get along so well they look
really<00:00:54.149> good<00:00:54.300> together<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> guess

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
really good together and now I guess

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.729 
really good together and now I guess
colors<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.190> fun<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> work<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:57.109> so<00:00:58.109> I'll<00:00:58.230> take

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
colors are fun to work with so I'll take

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.490 
colors are fun to work with so I'll take
my<00:00:58.800> yellow<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.489> along<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:01.109> some<00:01:01.140> tone

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
my yellow all along here put some tone

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.340 
my yellow all along here put some tone
on<00:01:01.680> each<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.980> these<00:01:02.070> cloud<00:01:02.399> Tufts<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> fun

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
on each of these cloud Tufts this is fun

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.990 
on each of these cloud Tufts this is fun
this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> final<00:01:08.010> touch<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.430> drawing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
this is the final touch in your drawing

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.370 
this is the final touch in your drawing
if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.330> go<00:01:09.450> through<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> sketch<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.080> in

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
if you go through and you sketch it in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.980 
if you go through and you sketch it in
you'd<00:01:11.040> put<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> color<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.729> last<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.600> then

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you'd put the color in last and then

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.630 
you'd put the color in last and then
maybe<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.290> outlining<00:01:13.830> after<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> just

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
maybe a little outlining after that just

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.219 
maybe a little outlining after that just
to<00:01:14.760> make<00:01:14.880> sure<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.270> everything<00:01:15.600> stands<00:01:15.930> out

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to make sure that everything stands out

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.480 
to make sure that everything stands out
from<00:01:16.380> each<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:16.770> oh<00:01:18.890> there's<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.950> nice<00:01:20.130> tone

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
from each other oh there's a nice tone

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
from each other oh there's a nice tone
on<00:01:20.670> each<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.939> these<00:01:21.030> clouds<00:01:21.830> now<00:01:22.830> how<00:01:22.979> about<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
on each of these clouds now how about a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.370 
on each of these clouds now how about a
little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.610> color<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.930> diving

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
little bit of color on the diving

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
little bit of color on the diving
platform<00:01:26.150> let<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.689> I've<00:01:28.229> used

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
platform let me see here I've used

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.469 
platform let me see here I've used
purple<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:28.979> orange<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.329> I'll

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
purple and orange here so I think I'll

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.300 
purple and orange here so I think I'll
use<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.630> different<00:01:30.990> color<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.560> side<00:01:31.829> I'll

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
use a different color on this side I'll

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.330 
use a different color on this side I'll
use<00:01:33.020> let<00:01:34.020> me<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.259> how<00:01:34.350> about<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> green<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
use let me see how about a green on the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.819 
use let me see how about a green on the
diving<00:01:35.579> platform<00:01:36.200> see<00:01:37.200> I've<00:01:37.290> already<00:01:37.409> treated

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
diving platform see I've already treated

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.920 
diving platform see I've already treated
it<00:01:37.920> dark<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> pen<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.479> tiny<00:01:39.630> round

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it dark with the pen a little tiny round

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.600 
it dark with the pen a little tiny round
circles<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:40.590> using<00:01:40.890> texture<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
circles now that's using texture all the
