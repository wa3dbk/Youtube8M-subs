put<00:00:07.890> out<00:00:08.130> we<00:00:08.730> took<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.480> look<00:00:09.599> at<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.960> rule<00:00:10.200> and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
put out we took a look at this rule and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.830 
put out we took a look at this rule and
that's<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:11.190> rule<00:00:11.400> states<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.000> runner<00:00:12.690> is

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
that's this rule states that a runner is

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.620 
that's this rule states that a runner is
out<00:00:12.990> when<00:00:13.650> he's<00:00:13.799> acquired<00:00:14.309> possession<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.540> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
out when he's acquired possession of a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.450 
out when he's acquired possession of a
base<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.139> he<00:00:16.590> runs<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.279> bases<00:00:18.470> backwards<00:00:19.470> for

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
base and he runs the bases backwards for

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.840 
base and he runs the bases backwards for
the<00:00:20.630> purpose<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:22.100> confusing<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> defense<00:00:23.580> or

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the purpose of confusing the defense or

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.429 
the purpose of confusing the defense or
making<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.810> travesty

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
making a travesty

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.099 
making a travesty
out<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> game<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.119> occurs<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
out of the game and if this occurs the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.500 
out of the game and if this occurs the
umpire<00:00:28.470> should<00:00:28.800> call<00:00:29.400> timeout<00:00:30.000> right<00:00:30.210> away

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
umpire should call timeout right away

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.049 
umpire should call timeout right away
and<00:00:30.779> call<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> run<00:00:32.009> around<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.880> might<00:00:33.030> be

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and call the run around so you might be

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.959 
and call the run around so you might be
wondering<00:00:33.469> even<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.250> wasn't<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
wondering even this if this wasn't a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.360 
wondering even this if this wasn't a
rule<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:37.370> what<00:00:38.370> why<00:00:38.670> would<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.690> team<00:00:40.649> ever

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
rule and in what why would a team ever

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.350 
rule and in what why would a team ever
want<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.870> even<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.110> about<00:00:43.230> doing<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.360> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
want to even think about doing this and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.840 
want to even think about doing this and
so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> remember<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.230> read<00:00:46.559> once<00:00:46.829> about<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so I remember that I read once about a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.540 
so I remember that I read once about a
play<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.050> can't<00:00:49.320> remember<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:51.620> exact<00:00:52.620> team

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
play and I can't remember the exact team

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.840 
play and I can't remember the exact team
or<00:00:54.020> player<00:00:55.020> who<00:00:55.350> who<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.219> maybe<00:00:56.520> somebody

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
or player who who it was maybe somebody

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
or player who who it was maybe somebody
can<00:00:56.969> find<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> post<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> comments

and they had runners on the corners 1st
and<00:01:10.500> 3rd<00:01:10.680> base<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.229> what<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.530> runner

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
and 3rd base and and what the the runner

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.060 
and 3rd base and and what the the runner
on<00:01:14.100> first<00:01:14.430> base<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:14.939> trying<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.689> was<00:01:16.409> draw

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
on first base was trying to do was draw

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.609 
on first base was trying to do was draw
the<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.060> throw<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> catcher<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the the throw and get the catcher to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.980 
the the throw and get the catcher to
throw<00:01:19.830> down<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.310> second<00:01:20.670> base<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
throw down to second base so that this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.710 
throw down to second base so that this
runner<00:01:22.290> could<00:01:22.979> score<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.479> while<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
runner could score you know while the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
runner could score you know while the
ball<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.590> maybe<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.220> second<00:01:26.549> base<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.610> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
ball was maybe out of second base and so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.330 
ball was maybe out of second base and so
what<00:01:30.299> happened<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.320> runner<00:01:31.590> ran

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
what happened was that the runner ran

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.719 
what happened was that the runner ran
during<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.450> pitch<00:01:34.020> he<00:01:34.229> ran<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.860> second<00:01:35.250> base<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
during a pitch he ran to second base and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.590 
during a pitch he ran to second base and
he<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:36.720> safe<00:01:37.020> he<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.009> he<00:01:38.189> stole<00:01:39.060> second<00:01:39.570> base

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
he was safe he so he stole second base

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.889 
he was safe he so he stole second base
the<00:01:40.610> defensive<00:01:41.610> team<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> catcher<00:01:42.390> they

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the defensive team and the catcher they

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
the defensive team and the catcher they
ignored<00:01:43.439> him<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.829> didn't<00:01:44.130> throw<00:01:44.340> down<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
ignored him they didn't throw down and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.539 
ignored him they didn't throw down and
so<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.840> runner<00:01:46.290> didn't<00:01:46.560> score<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.399> this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so then the runner didn't score so this

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.520 
so then the runner didn't score so this
upset<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:49.130> base<00:01:50.130> runner<00:01:51.229> maybe<00:01:52.229> really

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
upset the the base runner maybe really

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.950 
upset the the base runner maybe really
is<00:01:52.759> go<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.909> along<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:56.280> he<00:01:56.899> instead<00:01:57.899> of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
is go all along that he instead of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.830 
is go all along that he instead of
staying<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.560> second<00:01:58.979> base<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.790> actually<00:02:00.270> ran

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
staying on second base he actually ran

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.459 
staying on second base he actually ran
back<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.100> next<00:02:02.490> pitch<00:02:02.790> he<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.780> pretty<00:02:04.290> much

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
back on the next pitch he is pretty much

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
back on the next pitch he is pretty much
stole<00:02:05.070> first<00:02:05.790> base<00:02:06.060> again<00:02:07.729> which<00:02:08.729> again<00:02:09.000> under

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509

what<00:02:20.060> he<00:02:20.150> did<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.990> now<00:02:21.520> we're<00:02:22.520> back<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:23.170> runners

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
what he did so now we're back to runners

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.470 
what he did so now we're back to runners
on<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.320> corners<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.980> think<00:02:25.250> when<00:02:25.880> when<00:02:26.210> he<00:02:26.300> ran

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
on the corners I think when when he ran

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.090 
on the corners I think when when he ran
back<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.810> first<00:02:27.020> base<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.470> defense<00:02:27.800> again

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
back to first base the defense again

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.010 
back to first base the defense again
they<00:02:28.280> ignored<00:02:28.640> him<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.300> runner<00:02:29.540> was<00:02:29.720> forced

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
they ignored him this runner was forced

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.600 
they ignored him this runner was forced
to<00:02:30.080> stay<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.320> third<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.830> then<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.580> very

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
to stay on third and then on the very

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.770 
to stay on third and then on the very
next<00:02:32.240> pitch<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:33.800> runner<00:02:34.130> stole<00:02:35.120> second<00:02:35.720> base

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
next pitch this runner stole second base

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.740 
next pitch this runner stole second base
again<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.120> for<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.710> third<00:02:39.710> time<00:02:40.040> they<00:02:40.850> ignored

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
again and for a third time they ignored

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.790 
again and for a third time they ignored
him<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:43.070> runner<00:02:43.340> on<00:02:43.370> third<00:02:43.700> base<00:02:44.800> didn't

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
him and the runner on third base didn't

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.890 
him and the runner on third base didn't
score<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.760> I'm<00:02:46.880> not<00:02:47.030> completely<00:02:47.690> sure

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
score and so I'm not completely sure

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.300 
score and so I'm not completely sure
that<00:02:48.140> that's<00:02:48.530> that's<00:02:48.830> why<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:51.470> rule<00:02:51.740> was<00:02:51.890> was

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
that that's that's why this rule was was

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.040 
that that's that's why this rule was was
put<00:02:52.550> into<00:02:52.700> effect<00:02:52.820> but<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.630> have<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> strong

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
put into effect but I have a strong

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.480 
put into effect but I have a strong
suspicion<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.800> was<00:02:54.920> at<00:02:55.070> least<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.400> was

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
suspicion it was at least it was

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.790 
suspicion it was at least it was
something<00:02:55.820> like<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.870> if<00:03:00.320> you

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
something like that and so so so if you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.830 
something like that and so so so if you
were<00:03:00.980> wondering<00:03:01.190> know<00:03:01.520> why<00:03:01.760> would<00:03:02.240> any<00:03:02.420> any

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
were wondering know why would any any

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.500 
were wondering know why would any any
team<00:03:03.620> or<00:03:03.830> player<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> right<00:03:04.580> mind<00:03:04.820> think

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
team or player in the right mind think

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.690 
team or player in the right mind think
about<00:03:05.750> running<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.140> bases<00:03:06.320> backwards<00:03:07.010> even

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
about running the bases backwards even

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.830 
about running the bases backwards even
if<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:07.880> rule<00:03:08.120> didn't<00:03:08.360> exist

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
if this rule didn't exist

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.840 
if this rule didn't exist
a<00:03:08.959> situation<00:03:09.950> like<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.520> where<00:03:11.240> my<00:03:12.850> Runner

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
a situation like that is where my Runner

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.800 
a situation like that is where my Runner
might<00:03:14.510> attempt<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.440> do<00:03:15.620> it
