back of his uniform comes with a stock
standard<00:02:18.120> stormtrooper<00:02:18.480> gun<00:02:19.550> but<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.580> really

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
standard stormtrooper gun but I really

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.770 
standard stormtrooper gun but I really
pleased<00:02:21.030> with<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.180> one<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.450> gonna<00:02:21.569> be<00:02:21.660> tricky

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
pleased with that one is gonna be tricky

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.040 
pleased with that one is gonna be tricky
to<00:02:21.930> keep<00:02:22.140> clean<00:02:22.290> because<00:02:22.560> he's<00:02:22.740> all<00:02:22.860> white<00:02:23.160> and

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
to keep clean because he's all white and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.230 
to keep clean because he's all white and
we'll<00:02:25.050> try<00:02:25.230> our<00:02:25.380> best<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.610> last<00:02:26.850> we<00:02:27.030> have

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
we'll try our best and then last we have

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.080 
we'll try our best and then last we have
the<00:02:27.510> shock<00:02:28.020> trooper<00:02:28.410> which<00:02:29.340> again<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.610> really

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
the shock trooper which again is really

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.510 
the shock trooper which again is really
imposing<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.660> think<00:02:30.870> probably<00:02:31.110> one<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
imposing I think probably one of the the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.070 
imposing I think probably one of the the
most<00:02:32.550> sought-after<00:02:32.970> one<00:02:33.450> simply<00:02:33.810> because<00:02:34.050> of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
most sought-after one simply because of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.750 
most sought-after one simply because of
all<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.350> Battle<00:02:34.620> Damage<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.400> design<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
all the Battle Damage on the design and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.430 
all the Battle Damage on the design and
being<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.209> red<00:02:36.390> color<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.810> really<00:02:36.959> does<00:02:37.110> stand

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
being the red color it really does stand

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.360 
being the red color it really does stand
out<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.760> I'll<00:02:39.209> spin<00:02:39.480> him<00:02:39.630> around<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.989> bit<00:02:40.370> that's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
out so I'll spin him around a bit that's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.740 
out so I'll spin him around a bit that's
how<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.700> see<00:02:43.610> really<00:02:44.610> nice<00:02:44.910> with<00:02:45.720> that

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
