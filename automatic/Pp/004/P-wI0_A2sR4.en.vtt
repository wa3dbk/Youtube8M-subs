00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.240
 first of all let us start from the assumption 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.459
 that if we find ourselves wanting to win back 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.410
 a man means that at least once 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.380
 we have already conquered it and therefore 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.879
 he is sensitive to our charm and 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.919
 mind that this is not one 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.900
 consideration of little account since 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.210
 man by nature has the capacity to 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.100
 resist very limited to the advances of 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.570
 a woman able to provoke her 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.580
 interest 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.160
 the atmosphere can be poisoned i 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.769
 relationships can be very tense there 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.230
 communication can be poor however 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.090
 we can be sure we still have a 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.130
 certain ascendancy and a certain attraction 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.140
 in his regards 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.940
 what we need to understand only how 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.800
 leverage this ascendant for 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.710
 recover the ground lost with the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.900
 our former partner and many women here 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.020
 especially in adulthood usually 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.310
 they object that men are attracted 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.260
 exclusively from certain aesthetic forms 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.840
 and that having no freshness anymore 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.820
 body of twenty are not like that 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.090
 convinced that they can leverage on them 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.369
 seductive potential very serious error 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.720
 have you ever wondered how to do certain 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.060
 and wife get the upper hand 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.130
 on the lovers of their husbands despite having 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.920
 maybe 30 years older than them 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.750
 how is it possible for a girl in the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.300
 full of their own youth and 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.400
 own erotic potential can lose 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.220
 in comparison with a more mature woman e 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.870
 certainly the answer is less attractive 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.900
 than a woman's most seductive weapon 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.120
 it's not his body but his charm e 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.180
 the charm has very little to do with 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.370
 beauty forms or appearance the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.440
 charm is a magnetic force that 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.930
 springs from the whole personality of 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.260
 a woman from her identity from her 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.130
 sensitivity from his intelligence 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.950
 from the uniqueness of his luggage to 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.690
 experiences is extremely influential 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.600
 attractive that emanates from subjectivity 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.610
 of a woman and is able to charm of 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.620
 bewitch so much that in ancient times 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.340
 it was even considered one 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.070
 witchcraft 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.920
 but how to exploit your charm for 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.960
 to reconquer a man there is a whole 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.580
 series of well-established strategies that yes 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.799
 they can field in these 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.800
 situations and that is generally known 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.569
 lead to very positive results 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.910
 above all, we absolutely must 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.850
 stop behaving in a way 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.610
 counterproductive with our partner 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.690
 a grieving, sour, rancorous woman 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.520
 overwhelming 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.950
 it is the most castrating thing we can do 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.420
 to be in the eyes of a man 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.340
 we give a cut to everything 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.630
 may further exacerbate the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.300
 report and try to change 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.810
 suddenly attitude returning 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.910
 to be bright positive fresh 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 enterprising let us always remember that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.260
 while for women love is one 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.670
 ethical moral question for men yes 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.560
 it's an aspect of life 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.420
 related to the area of ​​pleasure and this 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.400
 implies how they tend to bind to 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.950
 people who are more inclined to 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.780
 satisfy their needs and desires 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.110
 in this light it is therefore clear how 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.730
 adopt a frustrating attitude 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.740
 oppressive and unnerving mortifying 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.630
 has the sole effect of 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.090
 weaken the emotional bond and of 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.820
 push your man away 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.620
 that's why the first step to take 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.810
 in the reconquest of our man it is 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.610
 that of recovering an attitude 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.270
 constructive and pleasant in his 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.880
 comparisons 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.190
 the second arrow we have to ours 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.930
 arch is the possibility of acting on them 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.520
 guilt feelings 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.680
 men in fact feel themselves 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.650
 responsible for the suffering that 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.810
 cause the person they leave safe 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.850
 exceptional cases or situations in the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.450
 which have already fallen in love with another 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.610
 woman 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.620
 men are torn by the idea of 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.600
 may have caused suffering 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.120
 hanging at a person who has 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.310
 demonstrated their affection and love 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.650
 in these cases a man triggers a 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.750
 psychological mechanism that sends it into 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.790
 crisis that no longer makes you feel good with 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.440
 himself because his nature 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.200
 requires care for those who have 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.760
 satisfied his needs and desires 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.500
 that is why it is all the more so 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.500
 important not to fall into that spiral 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.150
 negative represented by the animosity 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.190
 from the hatred of oppression but 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.650
 keep projecting to our man 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.290
 an image of good positive women 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.810
 generous able to satisfy even i 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.910
 his desires and to give him pleasure 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.920
 only in this way will we succeed in doing 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.890
 leverages its ethical dilemma and with a little 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.930
 of luck to let us grant you a second one 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.910
 possibility clearly the two strategies 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.550
 of which we have spoken are not the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.440
 unique that we can use not 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.570
 spend another day with 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.610
 the heart in pieces deviated itself and from the 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.740
 your man the decision to go right away 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.960
 to action and start the process of 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.180
 reconciliation once and for all
