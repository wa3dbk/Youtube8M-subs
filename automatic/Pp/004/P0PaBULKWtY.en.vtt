00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.510 
but here it is it's Michael BOPE i think
that<00:00:36.780> i'm<00:00:36.840> pronouncing<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.710> me<00:00:38.309> Kyle

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
that i'm pronouncing a right on me Kyle

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
differently but I'm guessing it's

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.000

once and it was like when I first saw

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130 
once and it was like when I first saw
the<00:00:56.579> comments<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.600> been<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> while<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.109> I

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the comments so it's been a while but I

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.799 
the comments so it's been a while but I
remember<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> sea<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.890> being<00:00:59.039> awesome<00:00:59.520> so

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809

as I'm not even going to go there yet

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.820 
as I'm not even going to go there yet
because<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> best<00:01:04.320> part<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> seed

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
because that's the best part of the seed

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the terrain is mostly like has some like

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.719 
the terrain is mostly like has some like
flat<00:02:04.500> lands<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.950> middle<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.310> there's<00:02:05.340> loads

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
flat lands and middle but there's loads

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.749

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
of you know floating floating blocks and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.669 
of you know floating floating blocks and
overhangs<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.539> high<00:02:09.929> mountains<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.560> stuff

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
overhangs and high mountains and stuff

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.210 
overhangs and high mountains and stuff
like<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:12.600> as<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.500> head<00:02:13.680> over<00:02:13.709> into<00:02:14.100> this

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
like that and as we head over into this

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.710 
like that and as we head over into this
direction<00:02:14.519> it's<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.420> little

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
direction it's like it's like little

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.870 
direction it's like it's like little
valleys<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.380> see<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:17.340> becomes<00:02:17.640> more

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
valleys you can see it becomes more

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.300 
valleys you can see it becomes more
flattish<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:19.739> remember<00:02:19.830> right<00:02:20.100> here

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
flattish and I don't remember right here

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.470 
flattish and I don't remember right here
but<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.459> think<00:02:20.700> there's<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.120> more<00:02:21.300> Mountains

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
but I think there's just more Mountains

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.809 
but I think there's just more Mountains
that's<00:02:21.900> really<00:02:22.140> awesome<00:02:22.260> seed<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.340> I'm<00:02:23.610> I

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
that's really awesome seed and I'm I

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.220 
that's really awesome seed and I'm I
think<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.330> actually<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.660> great<00:02:24.900> seat<00:02:25.080> for

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
think we actually be a great seat for

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.170 
think we actually be a great seat for
some<00:02:25.350> adventure<00:02:25.530> maps<00:02:25.890> if<00:02:26.160> anybody<00:02:26.940> wants<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
some adventure maps if anybody wants to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.780 
some adventure maps if anybody wants to
make<00:02:27.269> an<00:02:27.360> adventure<00:02:27.660> map<00:02:27.690> from<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.959> seed<00:02:28.230> but

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
make an adventure map from the seed but

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.920 
make an adventure map from the seed but
we're<00:02:29.790> finally<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.750> best

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930
