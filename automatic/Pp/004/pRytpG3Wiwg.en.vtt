[Music]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.380
Hey how's it going everybody, this is Geoff from AchievementHunter.com,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.300
And today we're going to be taking a look at getting the "Chain Reaction" achievement in Grand Theft Auto IV.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.500
The requirements for that achievement are to blow up ten cars in ten seconds.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.440
Now, there's a couple ways to do this.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.340
I'm gonna try a few ways and we're gonna figure out which one works best.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.220
First, I've decided to clog up Time Square with buses.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.840
There's buses located all around Time Square, so I thought, why not clog up all of the stop lights with them,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.920
and force traffic in the middle, and then try to do it.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.460
There's my first one there.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.860
As you can see, this isn't working out as I hoped.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.180
It hasn't caught any traffic and the buses have seemed to disappeared.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.140
And I also turned off the HUD so that it'd be more cinematic and it also made it impossible for me to see

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.020
where the cops were killing me.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.520
So...

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.540
Don't do that.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.760
Okay, attempt 2, I've decided to take some of the mini cars that are parked around Time Square

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.580
and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.820
drive them into the center, hopefully catch some other traffic because people are trying to get in, create some melee,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.020
end up with a big pile of cars,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700
and then blow that up.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.560
You can see I'm pulling another one in right here...

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.280
And much to my dismay, I discover that my cars are disappearing.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.900
So, I think I had about five or six cars there before they started to disappear on me.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.140
That's disappointing.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.300
So I guess what I'll try to do now is blow these guys up.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.040
Fucking cop.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.600
Ok, hold on, let me run away from this jerk.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.640
And... dadadadada...

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.180
Yeah you can see I'm down to three cars there, but we'll see if we can maybe get lucky.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.680
One...

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.060
Two...

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.500
Not a lot faith here that this is gonna work.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.720
Alright,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.080
there's one over there,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.600
and... Yeah I didn't get it.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.100
Okay.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.020
Well,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.680
Maybe I can take out my frustration on some cops.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.600
No!

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.920
I actually managed to shoot the rocket under the police car.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.140
I'm like the world's worst shot.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.000
Okay,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.340
So those two didn't work.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.580
Here's another tactic:

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.740
Drive up on a red light that just happens to have ten cars parked in one spot.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.360
I don't know how easy this is to do, this is my third attempt,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.200
and,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.040
there it is, so I'm imagining that it's pretty easy for you to, and hopefully you get lucky,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.640
just roll up in a place like Time Square and if you catch the light at the right time, you see ten cars.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.920
Lets see if we get luckier this time...

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.440
I got... It's hard to tell how many you've blown up.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.860
Oh, there's some more in the background.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.040
Ten... Did I get it?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.100
Did I... Yes! Ok. Achievement unlocked. Fantastic.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.100
So there you have it, pretty easy, not a lot to it.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.860
Just roll up on a stop light when you've got a couple of cars there,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.460
and unload with your rocket launcher.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.500
