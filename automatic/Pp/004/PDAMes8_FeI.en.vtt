00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
background is a little soft but if I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.330 
background is a little soft but if I
want<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.770> more<00:01:23.130> soft<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.710> use<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.950> nd

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
want it more soft you know use the nd

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.789 
want it more soft you know use the nd
throttle<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:27.170> want<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> open<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> aperture

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
throttle I want to open up the aperture

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.910 
throttle I want to open up the aperture
let's<00:01:29.250> say<00:01:29.369> 2f<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> want<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> f4

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.300 

now<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:37.670> use<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.970> nd<00:01:38.180> throttle<00:01:39.100> trees<00:01:40.100> and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
now I can use the nd throttle trees and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.420 
now I can use the nd throttle trees and

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
change the f-stop on the fly you don't

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.979 
change the f-stop on the fly you don't
want<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.729> use<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.509> don't<00:02:08.690> use<00:02:08.840> your

want to use that you don't use your

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.870 
want to use that you don't use your
aperture<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:10.070> do<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.340> because<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:10.670> get<00:02:10.789> that

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
aperture to do that because you get that

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.400 
aperture to do that because you get that
nasty<00:02:11.120> clicking<00:02:11.660> which<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.870> probably<00:02:12.050> saw<00:02:12.290> in

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
nasty clicking which you probably saw in

nasty clicking which you probably saw in
the<00:02:12.500> video<00:02:12.739> right<00:02:12.800> there<00:02:13.160> which<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.430> obvious

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
the video right there which is obvious

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.490 
the video right there which is obvious
what's<00:02:13.970> going<00:02:14.060> on<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.959> can<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.230> set<00:02:15.410> your

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
what's going on you can just set your

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.960 
what's going on you can just set your
aperture<00:02:15.650> at<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.040> maximum<00:02:16.459> level<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.820> want

aperture at the maximum level you want

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.820 
aperture at the maximum level you want
it<00:02:17.120> open<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:17.660> just<00:02:17.930> ride<00:02:18.200> levels<00:02:18.650> with

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
it open and then just ride levels with

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.500 
it open and then just ride levels with
your<00:02:18.980> variable<00:02:19.340> nd<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.060> changes

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
your variable nd so that it changes

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.220 
your variable nd so that it changes
smoothly<00:02:21.470> for<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.310> more<00:02:22.430> pleasing<00:02:22.640> look<00:02:23.230> so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
smoothly for a more pleasing look so

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.900 
smoothly for a more pleasing look so
let's<00:02:24.380> go<00:02:24.440> ahead<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.590> talk<00:02:24.709> about<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.640> nd

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
let's go ahead and talk about the the nd

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.640 
let's go ahead and talk about the the nd
throttle<00:02:25.940> right<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:26.630> first<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.050> all<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.470> is

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
throttle right here first of all this is

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.590 
throttle right here first of all this is
really<00:02:27.680> well<00:02:28.100> made<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.790> probably<00:02:29.390> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
really well made this is probably the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.509 
really well made this is probably the
nicest<00:02:29.780> best<00:02:30.380> adapter<00:02:30.890> I've<00:02:30.980> ever<00:02:31.130> used<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.459> my

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
nicest best adapter I've ever used on my

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.699 
nicest best adapter I've ever used on my
camera<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.510> kind<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.870> Cadillac<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.500> lens

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
camera it's kind of the Cadillac of lens

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.620 
camera it's kind of the Cadillac of lens
adapters<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:34.310> think<00:02:34.550> not<00:02:35.120> only<00:02:35.269> because<00:02:35.480> it

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
adapters I think not only because it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.060 
adapters I think not only because it
gives<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.019> extra<00:02:36.110> variable<00:02:36.650> nd<00:02:36.860> on<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
gives you the extra variable nd on the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.460 
gives you the extra variable nd on the
inside<00:02:37.400> but<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.880> adapter<00:02:38.300> itself<00:02:38.660> is

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
inside but just the adapter itself is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.509 
inside but just the adapter itself is
really<00:02:39.800> really<00:02:39.890> nice

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
really really nice

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.240 
really really nice
so<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.600> can<00:02:41.840> appreciate<00:02:42.380> now<00:02:42.650> as<00:02:43.040> far<00:02:43.190> as

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
so that I can appreciate now as far as

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.310 
so that I can appreciate now as far as
the<00:02:43.430> nd<00:02:43.790> function<00:02:44.269> itself<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.780> variable<00:02:45.079> nd

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
the nd function itself the variable nd

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.410 
the nd function itself the variable nd
function<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.829> works<00:02:46.040> well<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.940> does<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:47.299> it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
function it works well it does what it

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.780 
function it works well it does what it
says<00:02:47.450> it's<00:02:47.810> supposed<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.440> do<00:02:48.650> one<00:02:49.579> thing<00:02:49.700> I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
says it's supposed to do one thing I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.370 
says it's supposed to do one thing I
really<00:02:50.060> like<00:02:50.239> about<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.870> know<00:02:50.959> compare

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
really like about this you know compare

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.890 
really like about this you know compare
it<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.739> cheaper<00:02:52.190> version<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.720> has

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
it to the cheaper version is that it has

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.100 
it to the cheaper version is that it has
a<00:02:53.930> stop<00:02:54.620> when<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.980> go<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.130> minimum<00:02:55.549> or<00:02:55.730> maximum

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
a stop when you go to minimum or maximum

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.550 
a stop when you go to minimum or maximum
nd<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.410> will<00:02:57.650> stop<00:02:58.120> where<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.329> one<00:02:59.630> will<00:03:00.320> just

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
nd it will stop where this one will just

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.020 
nd it will stop where this one will just
keep<00:03:00.739> turning<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.310> could<00:03:01.459> turn<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:01.910> an

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
keep turning you could turn it on an

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.340 
keep turning you could turn it on an
endless<00:03:02.329> loop<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.720> keep<00:03:02.870> going<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.260> keep

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
endless loop and keep going and keep

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.660 
endless loop and keep going and keep
going<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.829> you're<00:03:03.980> never<00:03:04.130> really<00:03:04.310> sure

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
going and you're never really sure

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.160 
going and you're never really sure
exactly<00:03:04.790> what<00:03:05.299> you're<00:03:05.420> getting<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.900> does<00:03:06.019> have

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
exactly what you're getting it does have

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.199 
exactly what you're getting it does have
some<00:03:06.380> marks<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.040> with<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.790> little<00:03:07.970> arrow

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
some marks on this with a little arrow

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.580 
some marks on this with a little arrow
but<00:03:08.570> what<00:03:08.750> does<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.870> mean<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.200> mean<00:03:09.470> there's

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
but what does that mean I mean there's

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.170 
but what does that mean I mean there's
really<00:03:09.650> there's<00:03:10.160> no<00:03:10.340> indication<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:10.940> anything

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
really there's no indication of anything

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.090 
really there's no indication of anything
you're<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.420> kind<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.660> eyeballing<00:03:12.079> it<00:03:12.320> using

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
you're just kind of eyeballing it using

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.400 
you're just kind of eyeballing it using
the<00:03:13.280> light<00:03:14.269> meter<00:03:14.480> inside<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:14.959> your<00:03:15.049> camera

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
the light meter inside of your camera

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.930 
the light meter inside of your camera
and<00:03:15.530> then<00:03:15.650> stopping<00:03:15.920> where<00:03:16.430> it's<00:03:16.549> supposed<00:03:16.640> to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
and then stopping where it's supposed to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.240 
and then stopping where it's supposed to
expose<00:03:17.269> properly<00:03:17.840> we're<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:18.170> at<00:03:18.380> least<00:03:18.530> you

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
expose properly we're this at least you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.120 
expose properly we're this at least you
know<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.400> have<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:19.610> minimum<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.299> maximum

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
know you have a minimum and maximum

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.199 
know you have a minimum and maximum
label<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.430> outside<00:03:22.459> here<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.090> then

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
label on the outside here and then

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.330 
label on the outside here and then
twelve<00:03:23.570> marks<00:03:24.049> so<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.380> can<00:03:24.680> kind<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.160> know

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
twelve marks so you can kind of know

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.259 
twelve marks so you can kind of know
what<00:03:25.489> you're<00:03:25.640> getting<00:03:25.880> there's<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> little

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
what you're getting there's a little

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.990 
what you're getting there's a little
arrow<00:03:26.420> just<00:03:27.110> like<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.530> other<00:03:27.560> one<00:03:28.000> but

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
arrow just like on the other one but

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.250 
arrow just like on the other one but
there<00:03:29.120> are<00:03:29.239> no<00:03:29.360> numbers<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.900> kind<00:03:30.079> of<00:03:30.110> wish

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
there are no numbers I kind of wish

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.630 
there are no numbers I kind of wish
there<00:03:30.410> were<00:03:30.530> some<00:03:30.709> numbers<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.190> some<00:03:31.370> kind

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
there were some numbers of some kind

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.819 
there were some numbers of some kind
whether<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.480> directly<00:03:32.900> applies<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.590> what<00:03:33.709> the

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
whether it directly applies to what the

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.890 
whether it directly applies to what the
exactly<00:03:34.430> what<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.700> nd<00:03:34.970> you're<00:03:35.120> getting<00:03:35.420> or

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
exactly what the nd you're getting or

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.720 
exactly what the nd you're getting or
not<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.470> just<00:03:36.500> would<00:03:36.769> like<00:03:36.890> some<00:03:37.160> way<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.519> being

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
not I just would like some way of being

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.220 
not I just would like some way of being
able<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.940> record<00:03:38.180> keep<00:03:38.510> better<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:38.959> if<00:03:39.049> I<00:03:39.140> was

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
able to record keep better so if I was

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.349 
able to record keep better so if I was
the<00:03:39.290> DP<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.920> was<00:03:40.430> trying<00:03:40.609> to<00:03:40.640> recreate<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.090> shot

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
the DP I was trying to recreate the shot

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.210 
the DP I was trying to recreate the shot
or<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.630> thought<00:03:42.079> I<00:03:42.109> wouldn't<00:03:42.500> need<00:03:42.920> to

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
or and thought I wouldn't need to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.500 
or and thought I wouldn't need to
recreate<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.640> shot<00:03:43.790> later<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.150> would<00:03:44.329> like<00:03:44.450> to

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
recreate the shot later I would like to

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.900 
recreate the shot later I would like to
keep<00:03:44.690> records<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:46.459> doesn't<00:03:46.760> really

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
keep records and that doesn't really

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.610 
keep records and that doesn't really
give<00:03:47.120> me<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:47.360> could<00:03:47.720> just<00:03:47.900> go<00:03:48.019> from<00:03:48.170> one<00:03:48.230> to

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
give me I could just go from one to

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.930 
give me I could just go from one to
twelve<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:49.040> guess<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.400> just<00:03:49.430> wish<00:03:49.670> there<00:03:49.879> were

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
twelve I guess I just wish there were

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.500 
twelve I guess I just wish there were
some<00:03:50.090> numbers

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
some numbers

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.330 
some numbers
there<00:03:50.659> one<00:03:51.080> thing<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.290> wish<00:03:51.439> was<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.709> little

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
there one thing I wish was a little

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.009 
there one thing I wish was a little
better<00:03:52.519> implemented<00:03:53.060> on<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.569> this<00:03:53.720> blue

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
better implemented on this is this blue

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.350 
better implemented on this is this blue
ring<00:03:54.290> here<00:03:54.590> which<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:54.860> really<00:03:55.129> like<00:03:55.340> but<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
ring here which I really like but the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.210 
ring here which I really like but the
blue<00:03:56.599> ring<00:03:56.870> is<00:03:57.079> pretty<00:03:57.349> flush<00:03:57.769> against<00:03:58.159> the

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
blue ring is pretty flush against the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.830 
blue ring is pretty flush against the
body<00:03:58.459> here<00:03:58.790> so<00:03:59.030> trying<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.420> grip<00:03:59.659> this

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
body here so trying to grip this

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.059 
body here so trying to grip this
sometimes<00:04:00.319> can<00:04:00.500> be<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.680> little<00:04:00.890> difficult

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
sometimes can be a little difficult

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.280 
sometimes can be a little difficult
because<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.670> is<00:04:01.760> so<00:04:01.939> flush<00:04:02.269> there<00:04:03.049> are<00:04:03.140> some

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
because it is so flush there are some

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.259 
because it is so flush there are some
ridges<00:04:03.650> here<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:04.159> I<00:04:04.189> wish<00:04:04.430> they<00:04:04.700> were<00:04:04.760> raised

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
ridges here but I wish they were raised

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.330 
ridges here but I wish they were raised
a<00:04:05.629> little<00:04:05.720> more<00:04:06.019> or<00:04:06.860> maybe<00:04:07.010> they<00:04:07.190> were<00:04:07.250> a

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
a little more or maybe they were a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.160 
a little more or maybe they were a
little<00:04:07.459> more<00:04:08.090> of<00:04:08.180> them<00:04:08.329> or<00:04:08.540> they<00:04:08.690> bit<00:04:08.930> into<00:04:08.959> my

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
little more of them or they bit into my

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.899 
little more of them or they bit into my
finger<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.590> little<00:04:09.860> better<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.280> would<00:04:10.760> prefer

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
finger a little better I would prefer

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.780 
finger a little better I would prefer
that<00:04:11.560> part<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.739> reason<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.430> think<00:04:13.670> I

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
that part of the reason that I think I

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.649 
that part of the reason that I think I
wish<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.180> we're<00:04:14.329> a<00:04:14.360> little<00:04:14.480> better

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
wish that we're a little better

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.319 
wish that we're a little better
implemented<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.349> because<00:04:15.739> in<00:04:16.039> my<00:04:16.609> setup<00:04:16.970> this

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
implemented is because in my setup this

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.779 
implemented is because in my setup this
sits<00:04:17.600> at<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.780> back<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:17.959> my<00:04:18.169> lens<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:19.549> lot<00:04:19.699> of

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
sits at the back of my lens and a lot of

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.969 
sits at the back of my lens and a lot of
times<00:04:20.030> I'm<00:04:20.389> using<00:04:20.630> my<00:04:20.989> primes<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.709> want<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:21.889> use

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
times I'm using my primes I want to use

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.909 
times I'm using my primes I want to use
my<00:04:22.100> primes<00:04:22.690> also<00:04:23.690> probably<00:04:24.350> some<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.740> time

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
my primes also probably some of the time

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.860 
my primes also probably some of the time
use<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.220> follow<00:04:25.550> focus<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.270> big<00:04:26.419> follow<00:04:26.660> focus

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
use a follow focus and big follow focus

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.750 
use a follow focus and big follow focus
gear<00:04:27.289> sits<00:04:27.560> on<00:04:27.680> my<00:04:27.770> primes<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.280> if<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.490> want<00:04:28.669> to

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
gear sits on my primes and if I want to

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.060 
gear sits on my primes and if I want to
adjust<00:04:28.850> this<00:04:29.330> I'm<00:04:30.050> reaching<00:04:30.380> behind<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.830> gear

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
adjust this I'm reaching behind the gear

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.340 
adjust this I'm reaching behind the gear
so<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.370> easier<00:04:31.729> is<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:31.940> turn<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.389> better<00:04:32.570> and

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
so the easier is to turn the better and

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.870 
so the easier is to turn the better and
this<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.680> actually<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.039> better<00:04:34.160> idea<00:04:34.370> in<00:04:34.760> that

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
this is actually a better idea in that

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.879 
this is actually a better idea in that

the front of the lens and I don't care

the front of the lens and I don't care

if the follow focus gear is there or

I've also got lenses that are 55

I've also got lenses that are 55

want to use a variable nd on those
different<00:04:54.380> thread<00:04:54.560> sizes<00:04:54.800> either<00:04:55.250> have<00:04:55.430> to

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
different thread sizes either have to

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.279 
different thread sizes either have to
buy<00:04:55.669> more<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.180> these<00:04:56.449> in<00:04:56.720> different<00:04:57.050> thread

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
buy more of these in different thread

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.740 
buy more of these in different thread
sizes<00:04:57.530> or<00:04:57.919> get<00:04:58.220> one<00:04:58.400> big<00:04:58.639> one<00:04:58.820> and<00:04:59.120> then<00:04:59.630> you

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
sizes or get one big one and then you

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.210 
sizes or get one big one and then you
step<00:05:00.020> down<00:05:00.050> rings<00:05:00.530> that's<00:05:00.770> probably<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.070> most

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
step down rings that's probably the most

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.900 
step down rings that's probably the most
economical<00:05:01.789> approach<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:03.530> that's<00:05:04.280> doable

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
economical approach so that's doable

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.270 
economical approach so that's doable
obviously<00:05:05.750> this<00:05:05.960> is<00:05:06.110> way<00:05:06.349> more<00:05:06.590> convenient<00:05:06.979> it

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
obviously this is way more convenient it

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.140 
obviously this is way more convenient it
doesn't<00:05:07.610> matter<00:05:07.820> what<00:05:08.630> lens<00:05:08.930> you<00:05:09.139> put<00:05:09.440> on<00:05:09.620> this

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
doesn't matter what lens you put on this

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.640 
doesn't matter what lens you put on this
if<00:05:11.150> this<00:05:11.389> is<00:05:11.510> a<00:05:11.539> module<00:05:11.690> 2<00:05:11.930> lens<00:05:12.139> in<00:05:12.289> this<00:05:12.380> case

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
if this is a module 2 lens in this case

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.580 
if this is a module 2 lens in this case
there's<00:05:13.130> a<00:05:13.220> matter<00:05:13.370> how<00:05:13.520> big<00:05:13.789> or<00:05:13.940> small<00:05:14.000> the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
there's a matter how big or small the

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.409 
there's a matter how big or small the
the<00:05:15.590> thread<00:05:15.860> size<00:05:16.070> is<00:05:16.340> this<00:05:16.669> will<00:05:16.880> always<00:05:17.180> work

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
the thread size is this will always work

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.360 
the thread size is this will always work
so<00:05:17.449> you<00:05:17.630> don't<00:05:17.690> have<00:05:17.840> any<00:05:18.020> other<00:05:18.199> fuss<00:05:19.099> you

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
so you don't have any other fuss you

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.450 
so you don't have any other fuss you
have<00:05:19.490> to<00:05:19.610> do<00:05:19.699> with<00:05:19.849> this<00:05:20.030> now<00:05:20.300> one<00:05:20.720> thing<00:05:20.930> I

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
have to do with this now one thing I

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.980 
have to do with this now one thing I
wished<00:05:22.460> about<00:05:22.789> it<00:05:23.330> was<00:05:23.449> a<00:05:23.479> little<00:05:23.690> different

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
wished about it was a little different

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.450 
wished about it was a little different
about<00:05:24.139> these<00:05:24.349> and<00:05:24.650> there's<00:05:24.860> probably<00:05:24.949> no<00:05:25.280> way

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
about these and there's probably no way

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.920 
about these and there's probably no way
of<00:05:25.610> changing<00:05:25.970> this<00:05:26.060> because<00:05:26.360> it's<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.750> case

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
of changing this because it's the case

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.110 
of changing this because it's the case
with<00:05:27.110> any<00:05:27.289> variable<00:05:27.710> nd<00:05:28.010> is<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.760> you<00:05:28.849> can't

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
with any variable nd is that you can't

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.240 
with any variable nd is that you can't
really<00:05:29.360> ever<00:05:29.660> turn<00:05:29.990> this<00:05:30.169> off<00:05:30.440> you<00:05:30.710> can't<00:05:30.949> get

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
really ever turn this off you can't get

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.870 
really ever turn this off you can't get
rid<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.729> nd<00:05:32.030> there's<00:05:32.300> no<00:05:32.449> ND<00:05:33.380> 0<00:05:33.760> where<00:05:34.760> it's

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
rid of the nd there's no ND 0 where it's

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.029 
rid of the nd there's no ND 0 where it's
just<00:05:35.000> clear<00:05:35.510> I<00:05:35.659> know<00:05:36.139> that's<00:05:36.470> like<00:05:36.560> again

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
just clear I know that's like again

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.110 
just clear I know that's like again
that's<00:05:37.280> not<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.430> fault<00:05:37.699> of<00:05:37.789> the<00:05:37.909> nd<00:05:38.090> throttle

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
that's not the fault of the nd throttle

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.820 
that's not the fault of the nd throttle
it's<00:05:38.539> just<00:05:38.690> variable<00:05:39.020> in<00:05:39.139> these<00:05:39.289> in<00:05:39.440> general

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
it's just variable in these in general

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.830 
it's just variable in these in general
so<00:05:40.340> if<00:05:40.430> I<00:05:40.520> wanted<00:05:40.820> so<00:05:41.060> I'm<00:05:41.150> still<00:05:41.389> losing<00:05:41.720> like

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
so if I wanted so I'm still losing like

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.930 
so if I wanted so I'm still losing like
1/4<00:05:42.080> stop<00:05:42.409> or<00:05:42.590> 1/2<00:05:42.800> stop<00:05:43.130> with<00:05:43.370> this<00:05:43.520> attached

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
1/4 stop or 1/2 stop with this attached

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.930 
1/4 stop or 1/2 stop with this attached
even<00:05:44.210> if<00:05:44.389> it's<00:05:44.539> wide<00:05:44.750> open<00:05:45.139> or<00:05:45.380> minimum<00:05:45.820> so<00:05:46.820> I'd

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
even if it's wide open or minimum so I'd

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.670 
even if it's wide open or minimum so I'd
have<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:47.120> remove<00:05:47.510> that<00:05:47.780> and<00:05:48.080> go<00:05:48.289> back<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.590> my

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
have to remove that and go back to my

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.170 
have to remove that and go back to my
old<00:05:48.770> cheap<00:05:48.979> adapter<00:05:49.430> which<00:05:49.639> is<00:05:49.669> just<00:05:50.030> there's

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
old cheap adapter which is just there's

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.300 
old cheap adapter which is just there's
nothing<00:05:50.510> in<00:05:50.630> between<00:05:50.690> it's<00:05:51.169> just<00:05:51.409> you<00:05:52.130> know

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
nothing in between it's just you know

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.620 
nothing in between it's just you know
there's<00:05:52.520> no<00:05:52.699> and<00:05:52.820> there's<00:05:52.970> no<00:05:53.090> blast<00:05:53.330> in<00:05:53.510> there

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
there's no and there's no blast in there

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.080 
there's no and there's no blast in there
or<00:05:53.720> anything<00:05:54.010> so<00:05:55.010> that's<00:05:55.190> unfortunate<00:05:55.820> I<00:05:55.880> wish

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
or anything so that's unfortunate I wish

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.700 
or anything so that's unfortunate I wish
I<00:05:56.210> could<00:05:56.360> leave<00:05:56.510> this<00:05:56.690> on<00:05:56.870> my<00:05:56.990> camera<00:05:57.470> humming

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
I could leave this on my camera humming

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.760 
I could leave this on my camera humming
all<00:05:58.130> the<00:05:58.370> time<00:05:58.780> because<00:05:59.780> I<00:06:00.260> really<00:06:00.560> really

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
all the time because I really really

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.450 
all the time because I really really
like<00:06:00.950> this

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
like this

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.790 
like this
now<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:02.479> other<00:06:02.630> elephant<00:06:03.200> in<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.320> room

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
now the other elephant in the room

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.140 
now the other elephant in the room
obviously<00:06:04.159> we<00:06:04.250> have<00:06:04.340> to<00:06:04.430> talk<00:06:04.610> about<00:06:04.759> is<00:06:05.000> the

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
obviously we have to talk about is the

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.219 
obviously we have to talk about is the
price<00:06:05.470> now<00:06:06.470> this<00:06:06.979> is<00:06:07.310> about<00:06:08.210> $10<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:08.870> begin<00:06:09.139> an

realized this is the frugal filemaker so

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.969 
realized this is the frugal filemaker so
we<00:06:23.240> have<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.419> think<00:06:23.599> about<00:06:23.690> money

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
we have to think about money

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.619 
but that being said I think if you need
this<00:06:27.830> type<00:06:28.039> of<00:06:28.069> thing<00:06:28.430> meaning<00:06:28.909> if<00:06:29.090> you<00:06:29.270> are<00:06:29.300> in

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
this type of thing meaning if you are in

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.540 
this type of thing meaning if you are in

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
this but you have to determine if it's

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.100 
this but you have to determine if it's
worth<00:06:54.590> the<00:06:55.400> $99<00:06:56.150> because<00:06:56.419> that's<00:06:56.629> not<00:06:56.840> cheap

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
worth the $99 because that's not cheap

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.719

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
think I had a couple quibbles with this

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.930 
think I had a couple quibbles with this
but<00:07:00.349> they<00:07:00.440> are<00:07:00.469> really<00:07:00.740> really<00:07:00.919> minor<00:07:01.310> all<00:07:01.819> in

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
but they are really really minor all in

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.180 
but they are really really minor all in
all<00:07:02.090> this<00:07:02.270> is<00:07:02.419> a<00:07:02.449> really<00:07:02.659> good<00:07:03.020> a<00:07:03.289> really<00:07:03.949> good
