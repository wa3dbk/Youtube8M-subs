is about is really getting down to the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.990 
is about is really getting down to the
science<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> raw<00:01:01.649> food<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.460> also<00:01:02.610> what<00:01:02.910> does

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
science of raw food but also what does

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
spectrum of diet toward a plant-based
diet<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.650> chapter<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.400> vegan<00:01:14.640> two<00:01:14.970> point

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
diet so chapter one is vegan two point

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.149 
diet so chapter one is vegan two point
oh<00:01:15.390> I've<00:01:15.870> also<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> chapter<00:01:16.830> called

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
oh I've also put in the chapter called

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.310 
oh I've also put in the chapter called
calorie<00:01:17.700> prudence<00:01:18.300> really<00:01:18.900> looking<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
calorie prudence really looking at the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
calorie prudence really looking at the
science<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.040> calorie<00:01:20.460> restriction<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.570> raw

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
science of calorie restriction on a raw

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
science of calorie restriction on a raw
food<00:01:22.080> diet<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.710> we're<00:01:22.860> getting<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.190> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
food diet because we're getting all the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.670 
food diet because we're getting all the
nutrients<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.909> need<00:01:23.940> without<00:01:24.450> any<00:01:24.780> excess<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
nutrients we need without any excess you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.860 
nutrients we need without any excess you
can<00:01:25.799> eat<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.190> a<00:01:26.430> prudent<00:01:26.880> diet<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.510> not

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
can eat more of a prudent diet and not

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.450 
can eat more of a prudent diet and not
eat<00:01:28.110> access<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.770> helps<00:01:29.010> us<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> live

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
eat access and that helps us to live

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.160 
eat access and that helps us to live
longer<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> explain<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> calorie

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
longer so I explain that in the calorie

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
longer so I explain that in the calorie
prudence<00:01:31.560> chapter<00:01:32.040> I'm<00:01:32.460> also<00:01:32.610> talking<00:01:32.909> about

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
prudence chapter I'm also talking about

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.870 
prudence chapter I'm also talking about
deep<00:01:33.600> foods<00:01:33.990> than<00:01:34.590> another<00:01:34.890> chapter<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.700> just

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
deep foods than another chapter not just

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700 
deep foods than another chapter not just
nutrient<00:01:36.420> density<00:01:36.690> with<00:01:37.020> deep<00:01:37.200> foods<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
nutrient density with deep foods and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.710 
nutrient density with deep foods and
what<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.830> mean<00:01:38.040> by<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.670> course<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.510> want

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
what I mean by that is of course we want

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
what I mean by that is of course we want
a<00:01:39.810> lot<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> minerals<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.890> protein<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a lot of minerals and protein and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.120 
a lot of minerals and protein and
phytonutrients<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.290> things<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.740> in

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
phytonutrients and things like that in
