long-range rifle pretty good for sine be

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.560 
long-range rifle pretty good for sine be
enemies<00:02:17.910> now<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.180> said<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.210> an<00:02:22.360> earth

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570

let me tell you again this isn't nurse

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.170 
let me tell you again this isn't nurse

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
inactive it's an air blaster its ear

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.200 
inactive it's an air blaster its ear
blasters<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.930> think<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:30.360> Busby<00:02:31.360> toy<00:02:31.660> maybe

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
blasters I think like a Busby toy maybe

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.050 
blasters I think like a Busby toy maybe
i<00:02:34.620> would<00:02:35.620> actually<00:02:35.710> think<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.160> average<00:02:36.700> but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
i would actually think the average but

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.690 
i would actually think the average but
it<00:02:37.210> could<00:02:37.330> also<00:02:37.390> be<00:02:37.600> long<00:02:37.870> range<00:02:38.140> or<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.340> long

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it could also be long range or a long

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.650 
it could also be long range or a long
distance<00:02:40.240> or<00:02:40.540> whatever<00:02:42.240> mostly<00:02:43.240> because<00:02:43.270> i

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
distance or whatever mostly because i

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.990 
distance or whatever mostly because i
shot<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.200> before<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:45.190> shoots<00:02:45.520> bit<00:02:45.790> far

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
shot this before and it shoots bit far

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.160 
shot this before and it shoots bit far
and<00:02:47.940> people<00:02:48.940> out<00:02:49.060> there<00:02:49.300> who<00:02:49.420> say<00:02:49.600> oh<00:02:49.630> you're

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170
