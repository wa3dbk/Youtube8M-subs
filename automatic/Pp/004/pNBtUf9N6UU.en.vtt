boot what the micro-adjustable buckles
are<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.800> spin

are going to do for you is you can spin
them<00:00:59.219> 100<00:00:59.879> 360<00:01:00.719> degrees<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:02.430> allows<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
them 100 360 degrees that allows the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
them 100 360 degrees that allows the
buckle<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> move<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.920> you're

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
buckle to move in and out so if you're

in between catches here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.270 
in between catches here
once<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.380> type<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:07.950> too<00:01:08.040> loose<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
once you type when it's too loose you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.710 
once you type when it's too loose you
can<00:01:08.490> dial<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> fit<00:01:09.180> with<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
can dial in that fit with the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
can dial in that fit with the
micro-adjustable<00:01:10.290> buckles<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.860> yeah<00:01:11.100> perfect

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
micro-adjustable buckles so yeah perfect

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
micro-adjustable buckles so yeah perfect
fit<00:01:11.729> kind<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> coincide<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.560> we've<00:01:13.740> got

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
fit kind of coincide with that we've got

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
fit kind of coincide with that we've got
in<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:15.259> hinge<00:01:16.259> instep<00:01:17.040> catch<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
in a hinge instep catch right here so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.899 
in a hinge instep catch right here so
what<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.810> does<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.080> us<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:20.700> going

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
what that does for us is that it's going

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.480 
what that does for us is that it's going
to<00:01:21.000> allow<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.240> lower<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.409> overlap<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to allow that lower that overlap so to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.399 
to allow that lower that overlap so to
wrap<00:01:23.610> perfectly<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> contour<00:01:24.750> perfectly<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
wrap perfectly and contour perfectly to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.289 
wrap perfectly and contour perfectly to
the<00:01:25.500> top<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.830> our<00:01:25.890> instep<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.180> an

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the top of our instep so we don't get an

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.990 
the top of our instep so we don't get an
undue<00:01:27.630> pressure<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.610> our<00:01:29.759> feet

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
undue pressure there so that our feet

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
undue pressure there so that our feet
stay<00:01:30.210> nice<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.479> warm<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.110> toasty<00:01:31.259> throughout
