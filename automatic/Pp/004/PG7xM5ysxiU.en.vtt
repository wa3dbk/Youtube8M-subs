another pixel gun 3d glitch tutorial
today<00:00:05.040> I'll<00:00:05.190> be<00:00:05.220> showing<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.580> how<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.790> get<00:00:06.089> out

today I'll be showing you how to get out

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.410 
today I'll be showing you how to get out
of<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.540> map<00:00:06.750> cemetery<00:00:07.680> which<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.910> campaign

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
of the map cemetery which is in campaign

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.499 
of the map cemetery which is in campaign
mode<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.950> not<00:00:10.950> really<00:00:11.190> useful<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:12.030> think

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
mode it's not really useful but I think

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.950 
mode it's not really useful but I think
it's<00:00:12.690> really<00:00:13.049> cool<00:00:13.400> because<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.519> can<00:00:14.730> walk<00:00:14.880> on

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
it's really cool because you can walk on

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.950 
it's really cool because you can walk on
very<00:00:15.960> far<00:00:16.230> distance<00:00:16.680> outside<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.340> map<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
very far distance outside of the map and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.320 
very far distance outside of the map and
yeah<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:18.990> mean<00:00:19.260> come<00:00:19.699> on<00:00:20.699> you're<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.270> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
car on the other side of the map which

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.609 
car on the other side of the map which
maybe<00:01:13.640> means<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:14.939> wanted<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:16.080> intended

maybe means they wanted they intended

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.749 
maybe means they wanted they intended
you<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> map<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.400> don't<00:01:17.610> really

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you to get out of the map I don't really

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
you to get out of the map I don't really
know<00:01:17.880> maybe<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.600> meant<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> larger

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
know maybe it was meant to be a larger

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100 
know maybe it was meant to be a larger
map<00:01:20.040> or<00:01:20.310> something<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.509> yeah<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
map or something but yeah if you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.270 
map or something but yeah if you
continue<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:24.780> gets<00:01:25.290> really<00:01:25.890> glitchy

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
continue on here it gets really glitchy

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.310 
continue on here it gets really glitchy
as<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.750> color<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
as you can see the the color of the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.429 
as you can see the the color of the
ground<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:32.100> changes<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.909> lot<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.810> don't<00:01:34.350> know

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
ground really changes a lot I don't know

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.010 
ground really changes a lot I don't know
why<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.890> does<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> can

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
why it does that it really kind of can

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.649 
why it does that it really kind of can
screw<00:01:37.380> somebody<00:01:37.650> since<00:01:38.579> cut<00:01:38.820> somebody<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
screw somebody since cut somebody up I

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.410 
screw somebody since cut somebody up I
don't<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.590> double<00:01:40.920> jump<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
don't know and then if I double jump I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.520 
don't know and then if I double jump I
jumped<00:01:42.420> through<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.689> an<00:01:42.810> invisible<00:01:43.020> floor

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
jumped through like an invisible floor

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.219 
jumped through like an invisible floor
right<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:44.880> that's<00:01:45.149> weird<00:01:45.479> but

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
right there so that's that's weird but

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.340 
right there so that's that's weird but
these<00:01:46.470> um<00:01:47.420> odd<00:01:48.420> images<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> background

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
these um odd images in the background

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.850 
these um odd images in the background
are<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:51.530> they<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.680> um

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
are actually they are actually um

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
are actually they are actually um
textured<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.180> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
textured as you can see here which is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.850 
textured as you can see here which is
really<00:01:57.570> cool<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.469> know<00:01:59.750> yeah<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.049> was

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
really cool because you know yeah I was

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
really cool because you know yeah I was
able<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> get<00:02:02.250> up<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.460> top<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:02.880> at<00:02:03.630> one

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
able to get up on top of one at one

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200 
able to get up on top of one at one
point<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.320> don't<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.159> which<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
point I don't know which one it was and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.389 
point I don't know which one it was and
for<00:02:06.600> some<00:02:06.780> reason<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.170> looks<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.530> they<00:02:08.190> might

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
for some reason it looks like they might

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.020 
for some reason it looks like they might
have<00:02:08.459> updated<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.270> where<00:02:09.509> they

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
have updated this where they

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.090 
have updated this where they
made<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.570> overall<00:02:11.380> surrounding<00:02:11.830> area

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
made the overall surrounding area

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.250 
made the overall surrounding area
smaller<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:12.880> cannot<00:02:13.270> get<00:02:13.510> out<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.930> farther

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
smaller so I cannot get out to farther

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.190 
smaller so I cannot get out to farther
areas<00:02:14.710> like<00:02:14.920> way<00:02:15.130> way<00:02:15.550> way<00:02:15.820> over<00:02:16.060> there<00:02:16.270> but

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
areas like way way way over there but

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.510 
areas like way way way over there but
you<00:02:17.620> know<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:19.090> doesn't<00:02:19.390> doesn't<00:02:19.840> matter<00:02:20.520> just

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
you know it doesn't doesn't matter just

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
on the elite crafter cape get the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.680 
on the elite crafter cape get the
maximum<00:02:31.959> jumping<00:02:32.640> stats<00:02:33.640> which<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.510> right

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
maximum jumping stats which is right

well I'm here I'll just tell you guys
what's<00:03:23.410> going<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.560> happen<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.690> future<00:03:25.840> I

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
what's going to happen in the future I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.020 
what's going to happen in the future I
will<00:03:26.530> not<00:03:27.250> be<00:03:27.730> uploading<00:03:28.540> any<00:03:28.810> videos<00:03:33.030> until

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
will not be uploading any videos until

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.259 
will not be uploading any videos until
let's<00:03:34.570> I<00:03:34.840> think<00:03:35.140> it's<00:03:35.290> July<00:03:35.860> 14th<00:03:36.459> or<00:03:36.640> 15th<00:03:36.670> I

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
let's I think it's July 14th or 15th I

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.060 
let's I think it's July 14th or 15th I
believe<00:03:38.850> they're<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.870> reason<00:03:41.170> not<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.590> will<00:03:42.040> be

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
believe they're the reason not I will be

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.430 
believe they're the reason not I will be
over<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:43.360> China<00:03:43.690> on<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.500> vacation<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.870> that's

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
over in China on a vacation so that's

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.650 
over in China on a vacation so that's
that's<00:03:47.829> why<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.100> just<00:03:48.670> won't<00:03:48.940> have<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.510> that

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
that's why I just won't have really that

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.819 
that's why I just won't have really that
much<00:03:50.160> opportunity<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.549> be<00:03:51.760> using<00:03:52.150> Wi-Fi

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
much opportunity to be using Wi-Fi

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.520 
much opportunity to be using Wi-Fi
therefore<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:53.860> won't<00:03:54.160> be<00:03:54.340> able<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.700> UM<00:03:55.530> upload

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
therefore I won't be able to UM upload

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.569 
therefore I won't be able to UM upload
much<00:03:57.010> videos<00:03:57.430> for<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.730> guys<00:03:57.940> without<00:03:59.579> paying

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
much videos for you guys without paying

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.710 
much videos for you guys without paying
like<00:04:01.110> hundreds<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.260> hundreds<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.650> dollars<00:04:02.799> to

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
like hundreds and hundreds of dollars to

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.050 
like hundreds and hundreds of dollars to
Chinese<00:04:06.900> cellular<00:04:07.900> networks<00:04:08.440> but<00:04:09.010> yeah<00:04:09.190> I'm

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
Chinese cellular networks but yeah I'm

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.000 
Chinese cellular networks but yeah I'm
kind<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.690> hitting<00:04:10.870> odd<00:04:11.140> invisible<00:04:11.829> walls

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
kind of hitting odd invisible walls

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.039 
kind of hitting odd invisible walls
right<00:04:12.489> now<00:04:12.519> but<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.269> just<00:04:13.660> think<00:04:13.810> this<00:04:13.900> is

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
right now but I just think this is

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.400 
right now but I just think this is
really<00:04:14.200> cool<00:04:14.440> right<00:04:14.650> here<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:16.299> weird<00:04:16.810> weird

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
really cool right here this weird weird

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.890 
really cool right here this weird weird
wall<00:04:17.859> thing<00:04:18.340> maybe<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.209> can<00:04:19.359> get<00:04:19.450> up<00:04:19.570> on<00:04:19.690> top<00:04:19.870> of

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
wall thing maybe I can get up on top of
