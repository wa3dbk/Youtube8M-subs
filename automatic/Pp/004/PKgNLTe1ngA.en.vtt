00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.100 
big that's probably when a maybe a
multiplayer<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:24.239> teaser<00:02:25.239> trailer<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:26.080> be

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
multiplayer or a teaser trailer will be

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.979 
multiplayer or a teaser trailer will be
announced<00:02:26.739> for<00:02:26.769> black<00:02:27.099> up<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.580> but<00:02:28.569> what<00:02:28.840> I'm

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
announced for black up to but what I'm

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.490 
announced for black up to but what I'm
thinking<00:02:29.379> right<00:02:29.410> now<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:30.580> mean<00:02:31.090> they<00:02:32.049> did<00:02:32.319> it

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
thinking right now is I mean they did it

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.339 
thinking right now is I mean they did it
I<00:02:32.950> think<00:02:33.549> it<00:02:33.640> was<00:02:33.700> nw3<00:02:34.420> who<00:02:34.720> did<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:36.959> playoffs<00:02:37.959> it

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
I think it was nw3 who did a playoffs it

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.530 
I think it was nw3 who did a playoffs it
was<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> NBA<00:02:38.860> Playoffs<00:02:39.370> or<00:02:39.640> NBA<00:02:39.940> Finals<00:02:40.360> one

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
was the NBA Playoffs or NBA Finals one

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.860 
was the NBA Playoffs or NBA Finals one
other<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:41.319> during<00:02:41.799> one<00:02:41.829> of<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.190> games<00:02:42.459> they

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
other it during one of the games they

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.270 
other it during one of the games they
they<00:02:43.870> put<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.260> TV<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.829> commercial<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
they put it on TV the commercial the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.580 
they put it on TV the commercial the
first<00:02:45.579> commercial<00:02:46.060> that's<00:02:46.690> where<00:02:47.019> that's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
first commercial that's where that's

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.839 
first commercial that's where that's
what<00:02:47.860> I'm<00:02:48.010> thinking<00:02:48.040> they're<00:02:48.549> going<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.730> do

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
what I'm thinking they're going to do

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.849 
what I'm thinking they're going to do
this<00:02:49.030> year<00:02:49.299> with<00:02:49.930> black<00:02:50.140> ops<00:02:50.379> 2<00:02:50.590> they're

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
this year with black ops 2 they're

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.039 
this year with black ops 2 they're
probably<00:02:51.010> put<00:02:51.340> out<00:02:51.430> an<00:02:51.579> NBA<00:02:51.849> Finals<00:02:52.180> or<00:02:52.660> NBA

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
probably put out an NBA Finals or NBA

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.789 
probably put out an NBA Finals or NBA
playoff<00:02:53.890> game<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.720> second<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:56.349> whatever
