 how to install bluestack player beta 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:16.830
 lesson 0.9.0 40 49 this version is 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.140
 quite innovative as it uses 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.360
 android kitkat 4.4.2 first 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.770
 we see 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:33.880
 my pc its features 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:37.950
 very simple other 64 x2 minimum 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.950
 requested by blue stuff a jig of ram 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.500
 we have stacks 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:51.090
 talked about this version of bluestack a 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:55.830
 fool ruth robe app installed you will find 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.520
 the description of the video here is that 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.520
 let's start with the farewell guspini 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.220
 I will make you a roundup of mine 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.880
 customizations and I will let you see 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880
 withdrawal 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.430
 this version is still a lot 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.280
 unstable and slow compared to the election 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:30.390
 4.0 that this darling release some 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.940
 freezes in the next releases 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.890
 we hope we can have 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.890
 a certain speed that was obvious 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:46.420
 however usable simo 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.420
 vertical line can be installed 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.050
 it doesn't work so well 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.810
 in voice search more 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.320
 slow field but everything else we say 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.210
 more usable 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.210
 like spears a spear uses it 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.380
 we are going immediately 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.380
 route rights 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.320
 access 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.750
 found 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.750
 the bild 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.859
 we also hope for a moment 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.859
 what tells us there stylized 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:02.489
 ram slightly modified through 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.489
 at most it uses the 350 megs 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.320
 resolution also 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.980
 you see android pour done all done 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.980
 with health 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.870
 fully functional roberts 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.260

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.270

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.640
 functional and functional 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.840
 weighs over time you rock 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.840
 the part to masha there 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.480

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.849
 startup icons of ang help them 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.849

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.380
