00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
 Stir-fry dish with chicken, shiitake and egg noodles. 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.400
 The easy dish that you put on the table in a few minutes. 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.069
 For this you need the following ingredients: 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:13.349
 400 grams of Chinese egg noodles, cooked according to the instructions on the package ... 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.329
 ... 400 grams diced chicken fillet, 1 pressed garlic ... 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.119
 ... 1 spring onion, sliced ​​... 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.359
 ... 1 sliced ​​bok choy, Blue Band Liquid ... 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.820
 ... 200 grams sliced ​​shiitakes, Conimex Soy Sauce Asin ... 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.700
 The wok is hot, which means that we can put the liquid margarine in it. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.050
 About... 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.020
 ...2 tablespoons. 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 It is ready ... 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.440
 Big bubbles are gone ... 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.440
 ... time to add the chicken. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.980
 We will briefly review this. 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.420
 Until all chicken cubes are equally brown. 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.370
 The chicken is nice and brown. 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.550
 Is it time to ... 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.250
 ...garlic... 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.750
 ... and add the spring onions. 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.770
 And this.... 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.110
 ... stir-fry for about one or two minutes. 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.190
 The great thing about stir-frying is ... 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 ... that the smells of the ingredients come up. 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.980
 Then the bok choy and the shii-takes ... 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.130
 First I add the white part, they are a bit harder ... 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.110
 ... and therefore have to be waked a little longer. 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.660
 After about two minutes ... 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.050
 ... you can just do the shii-take and the ... 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.660
 ... add leaves of the pak choi. 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.470
 The nice thing about bok choy is that it is a type of cabbage that is fairly firm. 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.870
 I now use it in a wok dish ... 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.850
 ... but is also great in a salad. 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.750
 Shii-takes there ... 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.460
 Shii-take is a whole ... 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980
 ... delicate ... 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.030
 ... mushroom type. 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.699
 Then carefully pour it through. 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.030
 And you also have to bake the shiitakes very shortly ... 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.979
 ... and then they are just done. 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.799
 The green of the bok choy has shrunk. 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.949
 So I can add the noodles. 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:30.299
 Carefully stir. 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.299
 I think I'm just going to grab a pair of tongs here, I find that a bit easier myself. 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.319
 To carefully turn it over. 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.959
 Time to season the dish ... 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.149
 ... with some pepper ... 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:52.829
 ... and Ketjap Asin. 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.219
 The dish is delicious in taste and smells fantastic. 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.159
 I am really looking forward to it. 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.629
 A few pieces of chicken ... 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.179
 ... always tasty. 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:08.759
 We can sit at the table. Enjoy your meal.
