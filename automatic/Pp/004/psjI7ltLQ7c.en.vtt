00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
started so for this first DIY it's just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
started so for this first DIY it's just
a<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.830> cute<00:01:14.100> monogram<00:01:14.580> ornament<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.150> you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
a really cute monogram ornament and you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
a really cute monogram ornament and you
can<00:01:15.390> obviously<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:15.869> these<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.320> customizable

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
can obviously make these is customizable

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 
can obviously make these is customizable
or<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.880> non<00:01:18.119> customizable<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.380> want<00:01:19.680> i

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
or is non customizable as you want i

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.649 
or is non customizable as you want i
guess<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.580> these<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.479> things

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
guess so these are all of the things

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.969 
guess so these are all of the things
that<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.930> will<00:01:22.020> need<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:22.950> are

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that you will need to make them they are

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.429 
that you will need to make them they are
super<00:01:23.369> easy<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:24.150> i<00:01:24.180> found<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.840> easiest<00:01:25.170> was

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
super easy but i found to be easiest was

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.710 
super easy but i found to be easiest was
marking<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.490> initials<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.450> white

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
marking out the initials with a white

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.270 
marking out the initials with a white
eyeliner<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> only<00:01:28.890> thing<00:01:29.159> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
eyeliner this was the only thing that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.890 
eyeliner this was the only thing that
would<00:01:29.369> actually<00:01:29.820> show<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.329> stick<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
would actually show up and stick and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530 
would actually show up and stick and
this<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.280> helped<00:01:32.579> me<00:01:32.670> find<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> base

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
this just really helped me find the base

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.090 
this just really helped me find the base
for<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.170> painting<00:01:34.500> otherwise<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.040> was

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
for it for painting otherwise it was

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.410 
for it for painting otherwise it was
just<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.549> shot<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.850> dark<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
just kind of a shot in the dark if you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.660 
just kind of a shot in the dark if you
know<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.689> mean<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.740> after<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> did

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
know what I mean and then after I did

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
know what I mean and then after I did
that<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.880> filled<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.659> fake<00:01:39.960> snow<00:01:40.259> I'd

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that I filled it with this fake snow I'd

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
that I filled it with this fake snow I'd
actually<00:01:40.710> recommend<00:01:41.280> doing<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.549> first<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
actually recommend doing this first I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
actually recommend doing this first I
have<00:01:42.299> no<00:01:42.540> idea<00:01:42.689> why<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.110> did<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100 
have no idea why I did it in the
opposite<00:01:44.670> order<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> mean<00:01:45.509> regardless<00:01:45.840> as

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
opposite order but I mean regardless as

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.660 
opposite order but I mean regardless as
long<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.409> get<00:01:46.500> some<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.189> guess

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
long as you get some in there I guess

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.100 
long as you get some in there I guess
it's<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:48.000> good<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.840> put<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it's all good and then you just put the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.830 
it's all good and then you just put the
top<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> use<00:01:50.939> some<00:01:51.420> puffy<00:01:51.810> paint

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
top on and then I use some puffy paint

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.889 
top on and then I use some puffy paint
like<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> use<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.799> t-shirts<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.570> school

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
like you use on t-shirts for like school

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
like you use on t-shirts for like school
events<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.500> stuff<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.950> paint<00:01:56.399> mine

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
events and stuff like that to paint mine

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.520 
events and stuff like that to paint mine
and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.210> tried<00:01:57.540> using<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> bottle

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and I tried using it out of the bottle

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.530 
and I tried using it out of the bottle
and<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.890> was<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.100> too<00:01:59.310> hard<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> ended<00:02:00.420> up

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and it was just too hard so I ended up

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.910 
and it was just too hard so I ended up
using<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.899> paintbrush<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.530> found<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.799> that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
using a paintbrush and I found that that

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
using a paintbrush and I found that that
worked<00:02:02.130> 10<00:02:02.490> times<00:02:02.700> easier<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.299> me<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
worked 10 times easier for me and then I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.440 
worked 10 times easier for me and then I
could<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.200> multiple<00:02:04.710> layers<00:02:04.950> as<00:02:05.310> well<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
could do multiple layers as well so I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150 
could do multiple layers as well so I
did<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> few<00:02:06.899> layers<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.409> then<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:08.009> take<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
did a few layers and then you can take a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.100 
did a few layers and then you can take a
q-tip<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.849> take<00:02:09.060> off<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
q-tip and take off all of the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.020 
q-tip and take off all of the
excess<00:02:11.740> eyeliner<00:02:12.130> if<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.460> makes<00:02:12.610> sense<00:02:12.730> once

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
excess eyeliner if that makes sense once

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.900 
excess eyeliner if that makes sense once
it's<00:02:13.210> all<00:02:13.330> dried<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.960> won't<00:02:14.200> show<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.730> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
it's all dried and you won't show so it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.190 
it's all dried and you won't show so it
does<00:02:16.060> turn<00:02:16.210> out<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.390> little<00:02:16.630> bit<00:02:16.750> neater<00:02:16.930> than<00:02:17.050> I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
does turn out a little bit neater than I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.140 
does turn out a little bit neater than I
show<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.620> here<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.970> you're<00:02:22.120> wondering

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
super practical so for me I just was

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.280 
super practical so for me I just was
kind<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.090> experimenting<00:02:55.690> with<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:56.050> kind<00:02:56.260> of

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
kind of experimenting with it I kind of

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.449 
kind of experimenting with it I kind of
wanted<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.560> keep<00:02:56.650> mine<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.830> little<00:02:57.010> bit<00:02:57.250> more

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
wanted to keep mine a little bit more

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.610 
wanted to keep mine a little bit more
simple<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.450> for<00:02:58.660> this<00:02:58.750> first<00:02:58.810> one<00:02:59.200> I'm<00:02:59.410> just

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
simple so for this first one I'm just

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.560 
simple so for this first one I'm just
tracing<00:03:00.040> out<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.220> snowman<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> piece<00:03:01.270> of<00:03:01.300> paper

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
tracing out a snowman a piece of paper

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.990 
tracing out a snowman a piece of paper
and<00:03:01.780> putting<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.290> out<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.770> then<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.640> am<00:03:03.760> putting

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
and putting it out and then I am putting

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.630 
and putting it out and then I am putting
that<00:03:04.239> on<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.020> lid<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.620> use<00:03:05.800> hot<00:03:06.010> glue<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
that on to the lid and I use hot glue to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.030 
that on to the lid and I use hot glue to
secure<00:03:06.850> everything<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:08.290> depending<00:03:08.800> on<00:03:08.890> how

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
secure everything but depending on how

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.130 
secure everything but depending on how
durable<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.730> want<00:03:09.940> them<00:03:10.180> or<00:03:10.420> if<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.110> just

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
durable you want them or if you just

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.600 
durable you want them or if you just
want<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> change<00:03:11.800> them<00:03:11.920> with<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.100> seasons<00:03:12.459> you

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
want to change them with the seasons you

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.770 
want to change them with the seasons you
definitely<00:03:12.940> don't<00:03:13.030> have<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.420> use<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.540> hot<00:03:13.750> glue

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
definitely don't have to use a hot glue

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.289 
definitely don't have to use a hot glue
that's<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:14.860> what<00:03:15.010> worked<00:03:15.220> best<00:03:15.340> for<00:03:15.610> me<00:03:16.000> and

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
that's just what worked best for me and

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.289 
that's just what worked best for me and
then<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.019> decided<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.830> do<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> layer<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.549> this<00:03:18.940> red

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
then I decided to do a layer of this red

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.330 
then I decided to do a layer of this red
chevron<00:03:19.810> ribbon<00:03:20.320> around<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.709> bottom<00:03:21.190> and

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
chevron ribbon around the bottom and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.150 
chevron ribbon around the bottom and
then<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:23.140> overlapped<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:23.890> tried<00:03:24.040> to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
then I just overlapped it and tried to

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.770 
then I just overlapped it and tried to
cut<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.790> where<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.150> would<00:03:25.269> match<00:03:25.450> up<00:03:25.480> with

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
cut it to where it would match up with

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.140 
cut it to where it would match up with
the<00:03:25.840> Chevron<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.530> then<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.190> did<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.549> bow<00:03:27.760> in<00:03:27.790> this

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
the Chevron and then I did a bow in this

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.570 
the Chevron and then I did a bow in this
twine<00:03:28.540> at<00:03:28.750> type<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.230> ribbon<00:03:29.739> if<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.130> will<00:03:30.310> at

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the top and that is all I did for this

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.580
