00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.730
 Oh 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.130
 link appeared for the first time in 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.529
 1988 on nintendo a very good system 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.410
 more commonly called the nes the game 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.099
 was called legend of zelda this game created 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.199
 by the grand master 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.149
 shigeru miyamoto to whom we owe Mario 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.019
 donkey kong for example she break the 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.190
 hut at the time indeed this is the 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.600
 first game where it was possible to 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.100
 start a real quest and 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.430
 save to continue later 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.809
 and yes because we have to think that in 1988 he 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.790
 had a lot of arcade games and 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.900
 platforms that had to finish entering 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.809
 because there was no pile of 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.369
 save this legend of zelda was doing 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.949
 also enter a new parameter in 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:58.449
 video games the duration 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.589
 in this rpg the goal of link was to 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.970
 find the nine fragments of the 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.119
 triforce and save the princess zelda 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.229
 claws of their wives win the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.380
 success is immense in Japan and 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.610
 will enthuse the Westerners as much 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 link and save the princess does 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.750
 could not stay unemployed 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.070
 so on the legend of zelda 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.170
 adventure of link 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.670
 just in the title we see that line 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.100
 pass to posterity 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.929
 I do not look too much like the first 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.749
 part of the series but much more a 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.429
 real role play for example you 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.719
 move on a map and the game goes on 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.759
 in horizontal scrolling 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.299
 because meeting a village or a 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.069
 enemy over the match points and 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.359
 of experiences are counted which does not 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.350
 will not be the case for the suites 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.850
 regarding the points 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.100
 experience because those of magic will be 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.710
 recounted in zelda iii ocarina of time 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.450
 and majora's mask 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.259
 again the game is selling well but less 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.710
 well in the west 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.060
 so go and find out why after 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.549
 save the princess zelda twice 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.009
 the anthem is going to see miyamoto and fate and 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.990
 li dong shigeru never two without three 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.579
 this is after five years of 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.889
 development that fate the legend of 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.429
 zelda a link to the past on super 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.560
 nintendo 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.729
 the success is huge plus the game is 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.990
 translated into all languages 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.780
 which makes us fit in all 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.910
 morals by the way I remember the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:22.700
 too mortal ad have your writings 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:24.260
 one day and we saw a skeleton with 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.130
 cap in reverse filled with canvases 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.780
 of spiders in front of the super nes 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.220
 mailing feels very quickly cramped 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.200
 in the super nes at the same time 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.230
 miyamoto beginners developing the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.850
 super nes with the super fx 2 chip is 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.880
 also an opus on game boy 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.830
 finally the game planned on super fx 2 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.290
 will be transcribed to go on nintendo 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.570
 64 but let's go back to our sheep an inc 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.000
 the charmer is not tired of saving 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.380
 always the same princess so he goes 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.330
 to go to a desert island to do 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.510
 knowledge of marine in legend of 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.940
 zelda link's awakening the link awakening 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.530

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.320
 full of musical instruments for 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.410
 wake up the fish dream and saved lille 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.390

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.280
 line finally comes out in a game 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.860

 legend of zelda majora's mask 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.130
