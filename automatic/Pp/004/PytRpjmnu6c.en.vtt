the boxes there's a couple things to
mention<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> front<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.649> does<00:01:01.890> have

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
mention here on the front this does have

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
mention here on the front this does have
the<00:01:02.100> digit<00:01:02.550> 6<00:01:02.940> sensor<00:01:03.750> image<00:01:04.019> image

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the digit 6 sensor image image

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
the digit 6 sensor image image
processing<00:01:04.830> sensor<00:01:05.220> built<00:01:05.820> into<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
processing sensor built into it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
processing sensor built into it
it's<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.720> 12.1<00:01:07.260> megapixel<00:01:07.830> camera<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> CMOS

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's a 12.1 megapixel camera with a CMOS

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's a 12.1 megapixel camera with a CMOS
sensor<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.750> does<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.049> five<00:01:10.320> times<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
sensor and it does have five times the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.539 
sensor and it does have five times the
optical<00:01:11.340> zoom

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
optical zoom

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
optical zoom
so<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> 128<00:01:12.720> millimeters<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.229> 140

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
so this 128 millimeters to 140

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.880 
so this 128 millimeters to 140
millimeters<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.689> does<00:01:15.840> feature<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.259> 3-inch

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
millimeters and it does feature a 3-inch

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.520 
millimeters and it does feature a 3-inch
LCD<00:01:17.780> LCD<00:01:18.780> display<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> back<00:01:19.259> I'll<00:01:19.500> show

it
as<00:03:24.560> far<00:03:24.739> as<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.860> physical<00:03:25.070> body<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.370> feels

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
as far as the physical body it feels

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.729 
as far as the physical body it feels
really<00:03:25.850> solid<00:03:26.090> it's<00:03:26.500> definitely<00:03:27.500> feels<00:03:27.620> like

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
really solid it's definitely feels like

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.210 
really solid it's definitely feels like
metal<00:03:27.920> actually<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.720> know<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.989> top<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.980> top

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
metal actually I know the top this top

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.640 
metal actually I know the top this top
section<00:03:31.430> right<00:03:31.700> here<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.850> definitely<00:03:31.970> metal

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
section right here is definitely metal

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.110 
section right here is definitely metal
but<00:03:33.650> body<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.250> maybe<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.609> that<00:03:34.880> kind<00:03:35.090> of

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
but body and maybe that that kind of

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.819 
but body and maybe that that kind of
that<00:03:35.269> plastic<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.750> they<00:03:35.840> use<00:03:35.989> in<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.170> DSLRs

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
that plastic that they use in the DSLRs

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.349 
that plastic that they use in the DSLRs
has<00:03:37.070> that<00:03:37.220> real<00:03:37.400> rough<00:03:37.609> texture<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.090> those<00:03:38.269> so

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
has that real rough texture to those so

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.360 
has that real rough texture to those so
it's<00:03:38.480> not<00:03:38.570> slippery<00:03:38.930> but<00:03:39.799> it<00:03:39.890> really<00:03:40.070> it<00:03:40.190> feels

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
it's not slippery but it really it feels

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.270 
it's not slippery but it really it feels
very<00:03:40.430> solid<00:03:41.000> surprisingly<00:03:41.769> very<00:03:42.769> very<00:03:43.040> solid

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
very solid surprisingly very very solid

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.340 
very solid surprisingly very very solid
it<00:03:43.640> doesn't<00:03:43.880> feel<00:03:44.030> cheap<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.900> actually<00:03:45.230> has<00:03:45.320> a

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
it doesn't feel cheap it actually has a

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.590 
it doesn't feel cheap it actually has a
little<00:03:45.440> bit<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.680> weight<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.640> pretty

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
little bit of weight to it so a pretty

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.630 
little bit of weight to it so a pretty
nice<00:03:48.160> point-and-shoot<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.280> can<00:03:49.430> definitely

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
nice point-and-shoot I can definitely

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.490 
nice point-and-shoot I can definitely
see<00:03:49.970> if<00:03:50.420> this<00:03:50.600> takes<00:03:50.810> really<00:03:50.989> good<00:03:51.170> pictures

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
see if this takes really good pictures

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.259 
see if this takes really good pictures
really<00:03:51.709> being<00:03:52.100> another<00:03:52.370> option<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:52.940> take<00:03:53.120> out

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
two or three weeks if it has a really

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.979 
two or three weeks if it has a really
good<00:04:07.850> opportunity<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.299> play<00:04:08.540> around<00:04:08.690> with<00:04:08.840> it

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
good opportunity to play around with it

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.199 
good opportunity to play around with it
I<00:04:09.170> may<00:04:09.560> even<00:04:09.650> do<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.859> demo<00:04:10.459> video<00:04:10.609> of<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:11.000> the

I may even do a demo video of the the

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.430 
I may even do a demo video of the the
Wi-Fi<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.660> see<00:04:11.840> how<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.049> works<00:04:12.260> another

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
Wi-Fi to see how that works another

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.320
