00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.840
 Hello everyone, today I am truly alone 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.630
 from the first who managed to post a review 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.690
 on a new yet warm game under 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.540
 name lego marvel super heroes 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.950
 already from the title it is clear that the game is dedicated 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.140
 comic book super hero 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.150
 american maru studios a of this 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.120
 it follows that all fan of spiderman 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.510
 or hulk already overstrain behind the box with 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.489
 9 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.309
 but not only for the fans tried 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.620
 developers because there is no game from the universe 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.780
 lego always been successful well how 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.180
 least successful in sales and in 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.580
 licenses of journalists despite the fact that 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.949
 they themselves are comic and from the first 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.440
 sight meant for the youngest 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.600
 gamers will start with gameplay 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.540
 originality which rolls over and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.909
 this is not sarcasm we for the full 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.940
 passing the game will manage two a 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.379
 then three characters at the same time 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.450
 prepare your fingers they will come in handy 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.250
 you all and one hundred percent 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.130
 assigned to action characters 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.350
 Left very much in the first minutes of the eye 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.420
 torn in half you need for halk 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.340
 make sure that he doesn't break too much 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.680
 tony stark on the way to correctly put 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.719
 honestly 30 minutes of familiarization were 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.670
 for me hell the game is testing you on 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.770
 strength because you see such a gameplay 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.170
 for the first time and how to navigate the world 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.990
 have time to kill enemies and control 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.969
 a bunch of characters just wondering about 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.700
 after two missions you already get used to 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.170
 you are acting briskly with lightning almost 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.509
 forgot to mention that in two 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.939
 character is not the maximum number but let 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.380
 better information will remain a surprise 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.539
 in some places the game resembles sensors 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.939
 no there is no purple sex toys but 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.100
 a drop of madness in the barrel added oh yeah 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.990
 even in lego marvel there is a place for a madman 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.380
 year deadpool which by the way 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.780
 shone 2013 a second time and if you're still 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.030
 didn't hear or play deadpool then 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.659
 click and video annotation where the link 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.399
 in my review 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.799
 when the number of missions completed 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.780
 It is over the door, and the map will open on 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.940
 which one can travel to choose 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.459
 previous assignment and rerun it 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.230
 to earn more points but what about 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.849
 without them to describe the ability 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.340
 individual characters i won't be in 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.489
 the game is not one do we meet 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.920
 Deadpool Spidey Tony Stark Halk Tor and 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.709
 lots of other comic book heroes in 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.900
 particular x-men and avengers list 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.819
 villains no less magnet doctor doom 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.660
 green goblin sand man and this 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.209
 Not everyone 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.430
 a few words about the plot begins with 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.200
 what a silver surfer board which 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.959
 appeared in the second part of the fantastic 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.030
 Fours breaks into details and the one who 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.129
 will be able to take possession of the parts will be 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.790
 powerful and invincible rulers 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.860
 galaxies screenwriters choice for the role 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.629
 the main villain is full of doctor thought 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.790
 the choice is right in my opinion 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.530
 justified usually iron cheated 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.480
 attention we threw to the mercy 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.680
 fantastic four and sometimes 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.200
 gangsters with bums 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.030
 Well, call the plot amazing worthy 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.630
 greatest rewards and accolades 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.670
 it will not work in it is small but 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.709
 inconsistencies when ficks no fault 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.230
 meaning before us lego nonetheless 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.359
 the picture looks juicy bright and in general 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.519
 youth will like textures and patterns 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.319
 made great why weighty plus 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.660
 can be called not high system 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.980
 average requirements for performance 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.989
 computer with two gigabytes 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.900
 operational and one gigabyte 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.579
 the video card is enough to talk about who is easy 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.310
 supports lego marvel heroes on 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.040
 high parameters music is not without 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.660
 epica here marvel have not changed themselves she 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.919
 unlike most elements of the game 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.780
 not funny 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.209
 but truly heroic even in 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.660
 pathetic she gives greatness home 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.519
 the process and the situation it is time to stop 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.349
 horses to sum up on the one hand 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.780
 nice pleasant game which is a hundred 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.419
 percent will please the baby thin and not 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.489
 there is a lot of space here for humor 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.950
 but every coin has a downside 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.349
 as the two-faced in our case 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.629
 complexity and monotony because warner 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.160
 The brothers did not come up with anything new and those 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.349
 who is familiar with previous games 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.550
 Lego Understand What I 'm Talking About 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.760
 in addition to the gameplay 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.810
 she is gone and if you are not afraid for half an hour 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.810
 embarrassing passages in exchange for 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.120
 10 missions of the original plot and 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.430
 managing the best marvel characters then 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.920
 forward lego marvel super heroes 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.220
 the game score is already available on your 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.220
