00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
important thing to remember is that it

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.420 
important thing to remember is that it
is<00:02:55.370> possible<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.470> manufacturer<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:58.040> label

is possible for a manufacturer to label

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.690 
is possible for a manufacturer to label
their<00:02:58.580> product<00:02:59.030> non-gmo<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.680> they<00:03:00.920> can<00:03:01.190> put<00:03:01.520> on

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
their product non-gmo so they can put on

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.500 
their product non-gmo so they can put on
a<00:03:01.730> package<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.300> this<00:03:02.690> does<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:03.140> contain<00:03:03.620> GMO

a package that this does not contain GMO

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.140 
a package that this does not contain GMO
products<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.110> that's<00:03:06.350> that's<00:03:06.860> allowable<00:03:07.459> and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
products so that's that's allowable and

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.840 
products so that's that's allowable and
that<00:03:08.720> any<00:03:09.290> company<00:03:09.860> can<00:03:10.040> decide<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.520> do<00:03:10.670> that

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
that any company can decide to do that

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.800 
that any company can decide to do that
okay

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
okay

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.840 
okay
the<00:03:11.959> confusion<00:03:12.410> would<00:03:12.709> come<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.280> because

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
the confusion would come in and because

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.949 
the confusion would come in and because
people<00:03:14.630> would<00:03:15.410> maybe<00:03:15.860> construe<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:17.030> GMO<00:03:17.570> label

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
people would maybe construe a GMO label

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.080 
people would maybe construe a GMO label
as<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.110> warning<00:03:18.590> label<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:19.850> there's

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
as a warning label that there's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.030 
as a warning label that there's
something<00:03:20.510> about<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:21.020> that<00:03:21.350> they<00:03:21.680> should<00:03:21.709> be

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
something about this that they should be

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.920 
something about this that they should be
concerned<00:03:22.459> about<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:23.090> might<00:03:23.450> make<00:03:23.690> them

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
concerned about that might make them

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.780 
concerned about that might make them
sick<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.950> they<00:03:25.190> wouldn't<00:03:25.459> want<00:03:25.640> their

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
sick that they wouldn't want their

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.970 
sick that they wouldn't want their
children<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.269> consume<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.989> that's<00:03:27.769> not

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
children to consume and that's not

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.430 
children to consume and that's not
truthful<00:03:28.910> there's<00:03:29.570> no<00:03:29.720> evidence<00:03:30.200> that<00:03:30.290> that

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
truthful there's no evidence that that

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.620 
truthful there's no evidence that that
that<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.010> would<00:03:31.160> be<00:03:31.280> harmful<00:03:31.640> what<00:03:32.420> would

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
that it would be harmful what would

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.170 
that it would be harmful what would
happen<00:03:33.019> if<00:03:33.290> we<00:03:33.860> were<00:03:34.610> required<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.000> have

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
happen if we were required to have

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.780 
happen if we were required to have
labels<00:03:35.420> on<00:03:35.780> on<00:03:36.080> GMO<00:03:36.800> products<00:03:37.220> how<00:03:37.430> does<00:03:37.580> that

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
labels on on GMO products how does that

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.350 
labels on on GMO products how does that
change<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.600> industry<00:03:38.989> or<00:03:39.530> no<00:03:40.519> does<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:40.970> change

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
change the industry or no does it change

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.420 
change the industry or no does it change
I<00:03:41.750> think<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.170> would<00:03:42.290> have<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.470> huge<00:03:42.739> impact<00:03:43.190> on

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
I think it would have a huge impact on

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.880 
I think it would have a huge impact on
on<00:03:43.760> what<00:03:44.239> we<00:03:44.390> see<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.840> grocery<00:03:45.260> store<00:03:45.560> with

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
on what we see in the grocery store with

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.330 
on what we see in the grocery store with
any<00:03:46.489> kind<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.350> regulation<00:03:48.350> there<00:03:48.860> has<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.070> be

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
any kind of a regulation there has to be

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.610 
any kind of a regulation there has to be
a<00:03:49.370> law<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:50.360> would<00:03:50.510> go<00:03:50.780> into<00:03:50.959> place<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.530> then

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
a law that would go into place and then

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.830 
a law that would go into place and then
there<00:03:51.769> has<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:51.980> be<00:03:52.160> criteria<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:53.510> the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
there has to be criteria and so the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.960 
there has to be criteria and so the
price<00:03:54.110> of<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.470> food<00:03:54.709> will<00:03:55.250> likely<00:03:55.579> be

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
price of the food will likely be

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.030 
price of the food will likely be
increased<00:03:56.510> there's<00:03:57.049> no<00:03:57.260> difference

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
increased there's no difference

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.940 
increased there's no difference
nutritionally<00:03:58.880> there's<00:03:59.209> no<00:03:59.950> risks

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
nutritionally there's no risks

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.330 
nutritionally there's no risks
associated<00:04:01.549> with<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.420> product<00:04:02.860> why<00:04:03.860> would

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
associated with that product why would

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.900 
associated with that product why would
that<00:04:04.610> cost<00:04:05.000> be<00:04:05.650> justifiable<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.920> think<00:04:07.790> you

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
that cost be justifiable I think you

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.449 
that cost be justifiable I think you
have<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.209> look<00:04:08.390> at<00:04:08.600> all<00:04:08.810> aspects<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.739> the

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
have to look at all aspects of the

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.000 
have to look at all aspects of the
implications<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.390> then<00:04:11.510> weigh<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.440> risk<00:04:12.680> and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
implications and then weigh the risk and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.190 
implications and then weigh the risk and
the<00:04:13.100> benefit<00:04:13.519> this<00:04:14.030> has<00:04:14.269> been<00:04:14.420> such<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.810> great

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the benefit this has been such a great

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.969 
the benefit this has been such a great
experience<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:16.400> learn<00:04:16.430> on<00:04:17.390> a<00:04:17.450> high<00:04:17.690> level

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
experience to learn on a high level
