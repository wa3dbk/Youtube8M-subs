00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
 th 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.960
 The 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.100
 Hmm 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.700
 It's time to go around the 4 corners of the racetrack 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.090
 Because it is said how to set the focus there 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.610
 I was wondering if I should go to the rules but 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.610
 I heard a lot about today's lecture 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:35.220
 I'm convinced yes thank you very much 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:39.270
 I did not know the timing to press the shutter, so it was helpful today 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.320
 First of all, it's a thumb f run 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.140
 Shutter speed setting 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:51.110
 Then I thought that I would like to shoot with a flash a little more 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:56.690
 Very meaningful valuable because became a study in you I Do many ways there are to take how to say Well this 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:01.670
 The experience can be of Tteyuu I take only the elderly An think Naa was good to true 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.110
 Since glance there is little done because it is likely to be the first time saw a little easier because 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.159
 I thought it was like 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.799
 Get close to my 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.400
 Is horseback archery as a shrine quite of think I'd have entered into and every year there is a horseback archery in 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.550
 For now 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.480
 I tried to make it so 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:25.080
 I would like to practice about mother's thumb af 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:29.130
 Always Tteyuu Nikki and Neba' so had to give up because there is that movement 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.899
 I thought that would emulate the attitude line to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.009
 I had such a person in the pros because it is not good at Which ones but does not move things, such confidence is 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.850
 You say 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:44.060
 It is also a trouble in taking something with a moving husband 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.300
 I checked it out, but this is already a surprise and still the first place is 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.570
 Pictures that can be expressed with movement 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.930
 Headlights that can be taken out 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:00.270
 When the tail lamp moves and looks and does it 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:04.790
 Say Well become really a cracker to the video, such as kana did with Pan 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:11.080
 It is the most recommended to say from the camera conclusion 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.080
 The Tteyuu performance of the af are or appear to really crow by that 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.280
 It will not stop 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.280
 2 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:28.400
 This is different only by using the function to tell from now on 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.360
 If it was old, a truly divine disease 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.980
 There are photos that you can not take unless you are a craftsman with arms 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:42.830
 It's getting much easier to get 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:47.930
 When the Tteyuu normal autofocus say what is useless 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.770
 So could not keep up with auto-focus becomes to feel say by all means wiped out towards the rest 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.310
 That's right 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:57.080
 I don't recommend it when it's moving . 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.840
 Because I can no longer get on the train already, I'm going to speed up 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.850
 Increase as of course it yields I go up if 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.880
 Go in the tend to be felt not boring 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.190
 The mean to conduit table as I thought in the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.730
 In this 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.120
 The car I stopped was that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:21.890
 Such a clip on stroke 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.990
 Ferment and ferment four times and practice unreasonably in the direction of practice 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.840
 sex 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:30.850
 There is only this neighborhood or this neighborhood, and it tends to be said that the mainland system and the pink system which are important 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.780
 Since become 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:41.370
 It 's meaningless to have a series of continuous shootings , though . 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:47.370
 So to purchase When you come down to three or is When was until now on the assumption that Tteyuu and Rena 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:52.160
 It's also powerful that you can take out places that you could not shoot because it was too dark or too blurry 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:58.370
 Be a craftsman before being an expressive person 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:01.080
 It's the first time I got it as I was able to get it done 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.440
 Aim for chance in motion 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:10.780
 Caught by I will be able to say that was the moment 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:14.780
 Come say sense and Zoku' also looking photo 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.090
 To everyone on that based on the lecture of today 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.090
 I wish I could get it 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:34.470
 Hiding the points that are really important for the committee to work well 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.800
 How did you find a chance and how to catch it 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.770
 is not it 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.249
 Specifically, it's ok if you hit one of them in the middle of it. 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.669
 Not to say 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:49.580
 How is the difference in how it looks with high and cheap equipment 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.100
 Most pin v system When this speed 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.529
 It is a reality that will become 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.610
 In the diffusion period 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:59.480
 Put on a high-end lens 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:07.030
 I have taken one more time 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.030
 If you say in the background, I have something like that mother but I'm running away exquisitely 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.110
 This first thing 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:25.620
 It is a photograph 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:29.910
 Very Good Moment Both of us capture good moments though 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.680
 To wearing the little finger fuser in the ceiling bounce 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.470
 Chau Kagegade want leisure 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.840
 The shadows of the jaws are coming over 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.289
 This is what I say 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.639
 But it is actually because of this 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.590
 It's because of this 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.860
 This angle 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.280
 Doing anyway 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.409
 Is fine 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.580
 in vip 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:58.770
 It becomes easy to catch light such a woman 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.689
 So here I made a big vic 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.709
 I wanted to tell you the most but it is here 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.709
 t 4
