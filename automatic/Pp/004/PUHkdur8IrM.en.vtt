00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
animatedanatomy.com now i will talk

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.610 
animatedanatomy.com now i will talk
about<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:06.029> deep<00:00:06.240> layers<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.200> planter

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
about the deep layers of the planter

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.089 
about the deep layers of the planter
side<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.849> foot<00:00:09.090> first<00:00:09.900> muscle<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:11.040> I

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
side of the foot first muscle that I

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.070 
side of the foot first muscle that I
will<00:00:11.490> explain<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.599> flexor<00:00:13.049> digitorum

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
will explain is the flexor digitorum

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.279 
will explain is the flexor digitorum
longus<00:00:13.880> that's<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.150> muscle<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.630> goes<00:00:15.929> here

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
longus that's the muscle that goes here

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.950 
longus that's the muscle that goes here
and<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.770> its<00:00:17.010> stand<00:00:17.340> oh<00:00:17.490> okay<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.750> that's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and this is its stand oh okay now that's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840 
and this is its stand oh okay now that's
not<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.470> muscle<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.070> will<00:00:20.430> talk<00:00:20.670> about

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
not the muscle that I will talk about

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.029 
not the muscle that I will talk about
now<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.810> talked<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.619> muscle

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
now because I talked about this muscle

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.460 
now because I talked about this muscle
in<00:00:23.160> previous<00:00:23.550> lessons<00:00:23.930> what<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> want<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> talk

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
in previous lessons what I want to talk

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800 
in previous lessons what I want to talk
about<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:26.039> here<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.789> its<00:00:26.939> stand<00:00:27.210> own<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.779> have

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
about is here from its stand own we have

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.099 
about is here from its stand own we have
the<00:00:28.320> Olympic<00:00:28.650> cold<00:00:28.859> muscles<00:00:29.900> arising<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the Olympic cold muscles arising and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.709 
the Olympic cold muscles arising and
that's<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.980> origin<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.850> these<00:00:33.030> lyrical

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
that's the origin of these lyrical

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.319 
that's the origin of these lyrical
muscles<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.860> insertion<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> lumbrical

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
muscles the insertion of lumbrical

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.369 
muscles the insertion of lumbrical
muscles<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:38.149> plantar<00:00:39.149> aponeurosis<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
muscles is the plantar aponeurosis and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.529 
muscles is the plantar aponeurosis and
here<00:00:40.950> actually<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.540> lateral<00:00:43.530> four<00:00:43.920> digits

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
here actually on the lateral four digits

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.500 
here actually on the lateral four digits
plantar<00:00:45.539> side<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.590> function<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.510> lemarchal

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
plantar side the function of lemarchal

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.709 
plantar side the function of lemarchal
muscle<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:50.250> flex<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.180> proximal

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
muscle is to actually flex the proximal

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.889 
muscle is to actually flex the proximal
valleys<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.430> extend<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.210> distal

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
valleys and to extend the distal

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.799 
valleys and to extend the distal
phalanges<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.460> innovated<00:00:57.120> also<00:00:57.570> by<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
phalanges it is innovated also by the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.139 
phalanges it is innovated also by the
blancher<00:00:58.260> nerve<00:00:58.670> just<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> previous

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
blancher nerve just like the previous

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.840 
blancher nerve just like the previous
three<00:01:00.690> muscles<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> explained<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.820> I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
three muscles that I explained now I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.230 
three muscles that I explained now I
will<00:01:03.239> remove<00:01:03.629> these<00:01:04.229> two<00:01:04.559> muscles<00:01:04.970> because<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
will remove these two muscles because I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.289 
will remove these two muscles because I
want<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> explain<00:01:06.990> some<00:01:07.200> other<00:01:07.290> muscles<00:01:08.299> here

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
want to explain some other muscles here

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.280 
want to explain some other muscles here

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
now there are only two more groups of

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.740 
now there are only two more groups of
muscles<00:01:54.869> left<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.829> will<00:01:56.130> explain<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
muscles left that will explain and that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.539 
muscles left that will explain and that
is<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.909> in<00:01:59.909> terrassa<00:02:00.329> t<00:02:00.630> muscles<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.259> have

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
is the in terrassa t muscles we have

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.670 
is the in terrassa t muscles we have
dorsal<00:02:02.549> interossei<00:02:02.640> muscles<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:04.439> have

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
dorsal interossei muscles and we have

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.850 
dorsal interossei muscles and we have
the<00:02:05.420> planter<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.540> Taurasi<00:02:06.990> muscles<00:02:07.380> let's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the planter in Taurasi muscles let's

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.320 
the planter in Taurasi muscles let's
start<00:02:08.099> by<00:02:08.340> explaining<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.940> dorsal

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
start by explaining the dorsal

goes here it originates on the fourth
metatarsal<00:02:27.600> bone<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.530> inserts<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
metatarsal bone but it inserts on the

metatarsal bone but it inserts on the
third<00:02:29.700> challenge<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:30.990> okay<00:02:31.970> what<00:02:32.970> does<00:02:33.120> this

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
third challenge here okay what does this

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.540 
third challenge here okay what does this
produce<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.900> actually<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> challenge<00:02:35.340> these

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
produce is actually the challenge these

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.440 
produce is actually the challenge these
are<00:02:35.820> pulled<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:36.990> laterally<00:02:37.790> okay<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.030> here

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
are pulled here laterally okay and here

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.100 
are pulled here laterally okay and here
from<00:02:40.020> both<00:02:40.200> sides<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.800> stays<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.250> place

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
from both sides it stays in place

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.130 
from both sides it stays in place
that's<00:02:43.110> why<00:02:43.380> muscles<00:02:43.950> are<00:02:44.280> pulled<00:02:45.209> apart<00:02:45.480> from

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that's why muscles are pulled apart from

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.750 
that's why muscles are pulled apart from
each<00:02:46.410> other<00:02:46.709> okay<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:48.020> that's<00:02:49.020> called<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
each other okay and that's called the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.130 
each other okay and that's called the
