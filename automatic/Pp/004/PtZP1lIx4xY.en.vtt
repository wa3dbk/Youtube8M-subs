00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:02.410
 welcome Zoua 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.660
 at the feet of interest 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.070
 this word 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.290
 and we are here in releases you are sweet of Easy Solutions Inc 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:11.730
 Rank three is 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.279
 against South Africa 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.650
 that is the top meeting of this group anyway 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.409
 at the constellation 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:20.320
 if you 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.800
 Table currently with the customs are that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.220
 the first two teams freedom rights have become six points 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.349
 and the host South Africa so far can also convince with this 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.570
 Gulbis now 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.790
 there 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.680
 to fulfill a big dream Minins 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.570
 to reach the next round at the home world championship we are not 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 very excited to succeed will be against 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.440
 Frenchmen are incredibly strong in the match against Mexico 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.630
 this is what it is 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.610
 certainly with sparkling more self-confidence will occur 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.100
 besides the whistle France and right over Rieble 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.070
 So you are today 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.730
 Kuntz in this but show it up 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.070
 better to be able to play we now have a few slight picture dropouts but that is 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.630
 apparently no problem 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
 and for the first time, if and when you come to the ball 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.910
 Jaffe has been relatively harmless so far, two hits that was 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.950
 happens against Mexico but no statement 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.140
 the tournament winner 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.670
 and Saigon and now for the first time 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.200
 was perfect 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.910
 on the way to the gate 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.490
 but that's what they were doing themselves 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 little playful 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.170
 Of course, the two successes they have achieved so far are clear 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.030
 have achieved this led 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.170
 they are not yet 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.509
 Of course, leave a single TV tower they are not allowed to 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.650
 Feeling safe today is a daunting task to do 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.260
 you 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.040
 give everything again today 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.670
 own power to park 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.880
 and now 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.680
 We will definitely be here if a man told them that my case is 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 for France 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.120
 This one must be a destination like Audi 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.880
 hit here and that was no problem now we show no what 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.189
 other we with seven seals 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.839
 because the Mexicans 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.839
 we also have a chance of progressing lines 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.579
 We are caught here in Rustenburg 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.969
 empty for about ten days 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.409
 precarious card of the game Ricardo Osorio from VfB Stuttgart 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.209
 That's going to be next goal against South Africa 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.459
 being in front of him 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.499
 So who in the negative sense as this and warns if historical but also 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.730
 she could turn her back on the Mexicans 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 and if they can do it then 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.869
 Who wants to change that for something soon 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:51.519
 Seitz for the Mexicans best out of the house are with this one point they 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.179
 here 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.599
 where Anton then in the first game against South Africa 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.599
 who run template first position 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.689
 and Dr so here in the first minutes 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.039
 the OLG saw she was better 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.339
 today 60 years here with achievements also why but the Kurds demand and it 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.249
 will not be served 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:14.569
 he would probably only off 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.509
 the Rieder delamar show what he can do about other things AG 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.459
 to look forward to there like her summer 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.199
 Of course, offers for certain clubs 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.919
 and now, of course, it is very 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.909
 here talks talks with dropouts I think it's a good one 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.909
 Opportunity providers abound Altona 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.799
 Fini 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.799
 Paprika for the first time 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.869
 after work 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.599
 that's one percent 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.599
 he's been playing in seven years has been there 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:53.889
 and then SIDs are there 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.189
 there they are there 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.679
 in front of the gate is on us 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.569
 unfortunately, unfortunately 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.689
 for the host 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.599
 right past the gate 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.599
 first good options of the game 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.559
 the two teams part 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:19.139
 if and when at the alstria that can explain itself 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.059
 and that was it 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.599
 Take a penalty kick in the clean 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.599
 that promotes a hacker 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:31.029
 my thoughts circled over the city 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.120
 older ones would be there 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 performance-analysis 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.259
 had seen some open that is proven either 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.430
 the congress july 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.430
 and how a goal scored 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.249
 this chance is true 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.639
 definitely not as big as the foals we'll see 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.639
 Merchants Parallel play is a little more exciting 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.830
 is 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.210
 or at least checked less 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.319
 Unconsciously one says there is only one facet of the b-max 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.110
 a feature called off-line runs but it's the same as the wireless network 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 has gone 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.189
 m 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.449
 from Mexico SN APA 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.449
 for decades in Hannover and we have to 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:32.910
 here only a 0 0 or a 1 1 1 2 2 4 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.910
 It was like a bomb 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.559
 enough under the title 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.009
 The city is clearly fifth since yesterday 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.069
 it's about time to pick up the car 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.099
 it's not safe 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.819
 that's for sure 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.889
 in the games before that 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.419
 you also know that you performed well, you can not blame that 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.710
 Dubai belongs to pieces 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.710
 this trend sets 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.599
 what I say gets rolling 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.650
 translated the mood 2011 should be improved and extended 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.059
 in this place by Andres Guardado 

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:21.339
 currently prepare 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.339
 it will be blocked again soon 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.770
 completely free the ball 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.770
 and he mends counter-options because of 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.719
 Rolla on top 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.050
 best after five out of ten digits
