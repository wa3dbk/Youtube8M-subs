number one please be aware that there
are<00:00:27.840> two<00:00:28.019> types<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.500> pedals<00:00:28.830> left<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.849> right

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
are two types of pedals left and right

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.510 
are two types of pedals left and right
they're<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.990> same<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.949> left<00:00:32.279> hand

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
they're not the same the left hand

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160 
they're not the same the left hand
pedals<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.059> left<00:00:33.270> hand<00:00:33.510> thread<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.989> right

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
pedals the left hand thread the right

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.740 
pedals the left hand thread the right
hand<00:00:34.469> pedals<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.219> hand<00:00:35.489> thread<00:00:35.790> number

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
hand pedals a right hand thread number

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.860 
hand pedals a right hand thread number
two<00:00:37.200> before<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.160> install<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.850> pedals<00:00:39.180> grease

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
two before you install the pedals grease

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.840 
two before you install the pedals grease
the<00:00:40.200> threads<00:00:40.230> before<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.219> screw<00:00:41.489> them<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the threads before you screw them in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.600 
the threads before you screw them in
this<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.719> allow<00:00:43.020> them<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> screw<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.129> more

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
this will allow them to screw in more

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.810 
this will allow them to screw in more
tightly<00:00:44.940> more<00:00:45.329> easily<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:47.160> it'll<00:00:47.610> keep

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
tightly more easily and to it'll keep

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.209 
tightly more easily and to it'll keep
them<00:00:48.000> from<00:00:48.239> corroding<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.020> time<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.160> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
them from corroding in time so when you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.979 
them from corroding in time so when you
have<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> take<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.539> year's<00:00:51.899> time

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
have to take them off in a year's time

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.139 
have to take them off in a year's time
they'll<00:00:52.440> come<00:00:52.469> right<00:00:52.860> off

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
they'll come right off

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.060 
they'll come right off

for tightening them will be generally

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.300 
for tightening them will be generally
shorter<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.290> you'll<00:02:23.440> need<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.800> apply<00:02:23.890> more

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
shorter so you'll need to apply more

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.570
