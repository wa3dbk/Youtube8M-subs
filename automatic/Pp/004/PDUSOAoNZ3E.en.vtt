00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello here are the elements 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.970
 indispensable to achieve a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.610
 excellent mozzarella tomato salad 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.030
 you need two balls of mozzarella to 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.960
 about 125 grams each then one 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:29.640
 half onion and 3 tomatoes oil 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:31.910
 olive salt pepper and parsley I 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 will start by slicing the onion 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:40.230
 I chose a red onion because they are 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.290
 a little sweeter it goes very well 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:01:00.719
 with mozzarella tomatoes can 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:01:06.060
 also brings a few colors I 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.430
 reserve then I cut my tomatoes in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.000
 thin washers 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.000
 like this 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.710
 I will also cut my balls 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:42.910
 mozzarella in small slivers him too 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:45.330
 thin or too thick like this if the 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.330
 ideal size 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.970
 here 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.710
 then in a dish I alternate tomatoes and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.710
 Mozzarella 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.590
 so I'm going to layer tomatoes as 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.590
 this 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.650
 and a layer of mozzarella and I see 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:34.930
 but a row of tomatoes then one of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.930
 mozzarella and so on 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:28.380
 here we are now going to season 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:39.000
 I add meti red onions so frozen 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:42.170
 like these on my salad and then 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.170
 parsley 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.080
 salt and pepper 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.069
 and I end with a trickle of oil 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.069
 olive 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.639
 and here is your little salad and priests 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.819
 simple red onion mozzarella tomato 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.819
