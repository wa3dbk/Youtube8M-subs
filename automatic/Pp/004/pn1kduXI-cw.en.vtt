maybe not a team that can take on
Germans<00:03:59.040> but<00:04:00.040> it's<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.250> team<00:04:00.460> that<00:04:00.610> can<00:04:01.050> can

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
play football right well as it turns out

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.950 
play football right well as it turns out
they<00:04:06.370> look<00:04:06.610> good<00:04:06.760> on<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.030> paper<00:04:07.240> but<00:04:07.810> when<00:04:07.900> you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
they look good on the paper but when you

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.820 
they look good on the paper but when you
put<00:04:08.230> them<00:04:08.380> together<00:04:09.420> on<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.480> field<00:04:10.840> they

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
put them together on the field they

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.240 
put them together on the field they
usually<00:04:12.100> can't<00:04:12.640> deliver<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.900> that's<00:04:14.770> our<00:04:14.980> fear

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
usually can't deliver so that's our fear
