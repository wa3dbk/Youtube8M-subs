00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:21.510
 first time here and the impression almost 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.039
 magnificent had time passed on high 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.010
 professional level 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.140
 organism motivation of participants to me 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.330
 I liked how everyone fought but the most 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.700
 the main atmosphere of friendship which 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.450
 attending your events at 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.950
 this cross 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.160
 so I absolutely did not regret that I 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.960
 take advantage of your invitation arrived 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 participated to the best of my ability i also wish 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 you so that you always have everything in life 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.270
 as well as holding such 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.610
 events 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.750
 I think that this all just rallies 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.910
 improves the relationship including between 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.699
 decision teams well and for life generally 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.920
 for friendship, nothing is more important than 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.759
 holding together with such events 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 so good luck success to pass well 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.950
 as one race today what's the point 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.729
 view participants both in terms of 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.580
 medic 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.820
 you know the track is quite difficult such 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.909
 she had a profile, in general, did not expect 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.580
 catch an easy run but not here 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.340
 it was even that time that I showed 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.759
 I was not happy I understood it because 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.799
 there were quite lengthy ups 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.869
 short descents and turns turns into 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.810
 general route from the very competently I 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.810
 I think that some can learn 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.240
 rescued I plan sometimes even coloring yes I 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.350
 would like if only be free 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.619
 time with pleasure 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.899
 participated them until less do not need myself 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.700
 tower question from me as an operator 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.280
 but saw everything you read with such 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.350
 the lord but the briefcase gave the doctor again 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.420
 thresh will seem much content like 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.530
 comment on the easier footballer 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.320
 learn from each event we 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.720
 we form a separate tab further you do not 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.609
 I formed and based on the fact that you have 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.829
 almost all-around here is not 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:22.650
 just a mole here there are full 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:25.019
 strength training so no i'm 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.730
 I will show the head of the medical staff 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.980
 our team reveals the secret of ourselves 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.769
 magic suitcase let's start 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.540
 michael to secret in big no just 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.130
 simply is as it were a certain 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.980
 minimum set which every 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.640
 self-respecting doctor always carries with him 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.109
 on training games but other than that 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.510
 would eat directly the suitcase 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.880
 who is present on the bench 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.239
 spare yes there is still a whole set 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.540
 it consists of probably two big rounds 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.760
 baules where everything else is already present 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.799
 necessary Qing equipment but all 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.530
 what do you need for first aid she somehow 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.019
 magically you put into this 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.379
 small suitcase though every year he 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.330
 getting fatter and fatter 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.480
 swells from the contents but nonetheless 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.580
 it we manage to put everything here but 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.950
 if I just talk shortly then this 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.090
 drugs 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.730
 preformed series that are needed for 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.769
 provide some first aid this 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.430
 dressing means and they should 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.530
 be very easily accessible and because 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.420
 when a soccer player gets injured the score 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.530
 goes for seconds he's very nervous he 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.230
 wants to return to the game 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.750
 therefore all means of dressing they 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.260
 must be self-adhesive necessarily 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.409
 quickly discover them and effective 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.110
 try to use this kind 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:50.489
 dressing devices of different formats 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.860
 different sizes for different purposes but 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.019
 they must all be specific 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.590
 sports 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.480
 hemostatic agent with 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.940
 nosebleeds there 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.040
 Yes, and there are a number of drugs 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.860
 devices if we say devices without 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.549
 which also can not do this tonometer 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.989
 know the meter 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.129
 blood pressure 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.560
 I always have with me a kit for 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.269
 embroidery wound suture disposable 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.079
 material 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:25.590
 such here and there are disposable sticks 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:28.080
 silk have special tools 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.419
 with which you can quickly impose 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.820
 the seams in the locker room funds to hold 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.970
 emergency care for intensive 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.729
 therapy and a variety of infusion means 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.139
 if God forbid you need a dropper 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:49.789
 Intravenous fluids are also present. 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:53.479
 here are various ointments and creams and syringes 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.770
 the catheter is all that is needed for 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.190
 first aid 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:06.900
 our main dream is to never 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:09.150
 needed all who still have a lot of things 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.700
 but I repeat, but it's all in 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.930
 directly stripped enters already in 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.610
 such general equipment wished you 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.450
 as little as possible accounted for the straits 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.260
 magic bag thank you all the best 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.260
 Thanks you
