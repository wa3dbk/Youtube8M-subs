00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.580
 [Music] 

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.770
 gordon and I was alone I'm sure that 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.610
 I'll find a better place to sleep 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.179
 that the stinky diesel workshops but 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.440
 as much as he thought he could not think 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.440
 where could I sleep 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.949
 then an idea flowed down the chimney 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.130
 of fat and the locomotives are all 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.189
 sleeping in other stores but the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.000
 rotating platform should already be 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.910
 working 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.250
 [Music] 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.170
 but a rotating platform does not 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.160
 works 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:47.510
 I was still stuck in the same place and just 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:51.890
 a locomotive could enter the shed 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.339
 that all locomotives I know where to sleep 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.339
 tonight 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:03.200
 [Music] 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.470
 It was very late when he stopped and came back 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.590
 after carrying the mail cars 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.479
 He was married and ready to sleep but 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.479
 the shed was not empty 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.210
 gordon that space I also need a 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.820
 place to sleep nonsense persie this 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.970
 shed is too small for two 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.030
 of us if you need a place to 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.720
 sleep there is an empty shed in the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.479
 wii dump but was not very 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.759
 happy but I was too tired 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.680
 to discuss with a hat so it 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.300
 He went to sleep in the garbage dump 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.520
 Wifi 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.670
 and the bourbon liked the idea of having 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.120
 the thermal station for him alone 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.800
 I should ask you to work for me 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.130
 give a private shed is very 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.050
 silent without the other locomotives 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.050
 chatting and making noise 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.360
 but then the workers started 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.790
 to work on the platform they did a lot 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.910
 noise 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.390
 [Music] 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.940
 the cord could not fall asleep 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.510
 [Music] 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.460
 in a short time dawned and his driver 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.450
 he prepared his boiler so he could 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.450
 pull the express 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.080
 the workers prepared the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.080
 rotating platform 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.250
 it stopped the cold really did not make him 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.090
 all right 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.090
 here 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.270
 he was very surprised he was ready to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.270
 leaving it was time to pull the express 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.830
 but the rotating platform did not return 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.080
 that was stuck again 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.080
 it meant that Gordon could not get out
