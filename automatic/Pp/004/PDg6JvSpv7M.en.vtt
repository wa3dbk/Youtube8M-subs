in<00:01:29.930> from<00:01:30.080> high<00:01:30.200> schools<00:01:30.530> is<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.190> big<00:01:31.430> step<00:01:31.670> and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
in from high schools is a big step and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000 
in from high schools is a big step and
if<00:01:32.660> I'm<00:01:32.810> like<00:01:33.020> probably<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.440> thousand<00:01:33.920> people

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
if I'm like probably a thousand people

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.370 
if I'm like probably a thousand people
like<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.310> most<00:01:34.520> my<00:01:34.940> school<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.990> one<00:01:36.140> or<00:01:36.260> two

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
like the most my school so one or two

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.410 
like the most my school so one or two
for<00:01:36.530> 55<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.310> it's<00:01:37.909> something<00:01:38.060> bigger<00:01:38.240> than

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
for 55 so it's something bigger than

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.960 
for 55 so it's something bigger than
ours<00:01:38.690> but<00:01:38.990> just<00:01:39.950> like<00:01:40.040> I<00:01:40.160> say<00:01:40.340> we<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:40.760> gotta

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
ours but just like I say we just gotta

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.510 
ours but just like I say we just gotta
prepare<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.420> same<00:01:41.600> way<00:01:41.780> each<00:01:42.770> practicing<00:01:43.369> and

prepare the same way each practicing and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.280 
prepare the same way each practicing and
hopefully<00:01:43.820> diameter<00:01:46.780> there's<00:01:47.780> not<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:47.990> little

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
hopefully diameter there's not a little

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.500 
hopefully diameter there's not a little
bit<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.920> think

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
bit of that you think

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
teaching this technique you're

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.730 
teaching this technique you're
repeatedly<00:02:01.390> talks<00:02:01.719> about<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.350> this

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
repeatedly talks about it and this

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.440 
repeatedly talks about it and this
that's<00:02:03.340> what<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.670> main<00:02:03.850> focus<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.420> a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
that's what that main focus is a

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.539 
that's what that main focus is a
breaking<00:02:05.289> point<00:02:05.560> such<00:02:05.829> as<00:02:05.950> game<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.399> and

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549

disposition oh um yeah you just plant
receivers<00:02:15.819> it's<00:02:16.810> more<00:02:16.989> than<00:02:17.049> just<00:02:17.140> because<00:02:17.470> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
receivers it's more than just because it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.289 
receivers it's more than just because it
was<00:02:17.620> also<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.980> mental<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.430> got<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:18.849> your

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
was also a mental you got to know your

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.949 
was also a mental you got to know your
convergence<00:02:19.900> usually<00:02:20.799> defense<00:02:21.190> oh<00:02:21.459> yes<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.720> lot

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959
