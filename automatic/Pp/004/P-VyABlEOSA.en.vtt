00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.460
 very often when standing up honey 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:16.109
 here's this white mass, many 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:25.430
 call it honey cream here i am 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:25.430
 I will try to remove it separately and do 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:39.270
 some thickness manipulations 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.719
 in some different from someone fat 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.090
 I probably have a layer 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:52.550
 or three meters maybe even here 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.550
 and millimeter everything is thick in the center 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.250
 in almost every bucket 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.680
 it forms with me anyway 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:19.310
 Here I will try to gain a liter capacity and 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:24.370
 weigh and without taking into account the weight of the container 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:29.240
 It turns out almost 1300 grams that is 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:33.350
 lighter than honey is 100 grams 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.560
 fraction I think that this honey is saturated 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.180
 air to check it is necessary 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.100
 put in a thermo cabinet here is complete 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.250
 bucket 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.560
 rests on the cover I put the thermo cabinet with 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.560
 temperature of 36 degrees 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:07.960
 after 24 hours the other has become more honey 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:17.570
 by weight 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:24.320
 still remained the same if 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:31.430
 this foam move back there it turns out well 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:38.860
 honey therefore I think that except honey 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.860
 there is no saturated rest upper core layer
