00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
body and it seems like her grunt gets

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.710 
body and it seems like her grunt gets
louder<00:01:57.520> when<00:01:57.760> she<00:01:57.910> hits<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.240> backhand

twice what's changed around here for
Steffi<00:03:15.440> Graf<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:17.140> think<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.260> she's<00:03:18.410> just

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
Steffi Graf I think that she's just

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.770 
Steffi Graf I think that she's just
making<00:03:19.160> contact<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.760> lot<00:03:19.910> better<00:03:20.150> not<00:03:20.480> she's

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
making contact a lot better not she's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.620 
making contact a lot better not she's
cut<00:03:20.989> down<00:03:21.170> or<00:03:21.410> unforced<00:03:21.890> errors<00:03:22.190> she's<00:03:23.090> won<00:03:23.300> 12

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
cut down or unforced errors she's won 12

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:35.470

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
beginning that that Steffi was really

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.650

that Monica was just basically getting

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.400 
that Monica was just basically getting
