00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.180
 driving beautiful even without makeup and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.670
 every week I share video clips of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.990
 beauty and lifestyle on my channel 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 youtube and today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.510
 you can create the sand look of the king 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.579
 that's what elegant is sophisticated 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.809
 anna so today I want to talk to you about 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.489
 driving beautiful even without makeup and I 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 I'm saying that makeup makes 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.379
 that you look beautiful but definitely 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.500
 gives you a touch of additional confidence 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.660
 that helps a lot so the goal in 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.090
 this video is to make our face 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.699
 it looks like we do not need that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.300
 touch of makeup to feel and 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.199
 see us super well and you want to start 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.640
 removing any trace of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.530
 makeup that you can access from the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.690
 last night for this we are going to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.159
 use a make-up remover with oil 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.120
 because it makes the makeup come out 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.150
 much easier 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.920
 and I do not have to apply as much force and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.290
 they know that when you do make-up and do 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 a lot of pressure this can damage your skin 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.160
 why a make-up remover with some 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.920
 oil is going to be much smoother with its 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.630
 skin and that is especially important 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.070
 constant making up his eyes the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.290
 most probably know that the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.510
 eyeliner or mask especially to 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.880
 Water proof can be difficult to 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.490
 remove so a product like this one goes 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.960
 to be much easier your homework and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 talking about the door line wants 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 make sure you remove it absolutely 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.410
 everything if you're using at least 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.200
 black eyeliner on the inside of the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.060
 eyelid may be a little bit more 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.190
 difficult to remove simply because it 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.800
 love to stay there stuck but what 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.260
 you can do is use a cotton swab 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.390
 or something cotton to make sure you do not 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.520
 there are traces because this in the long run 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.280
 It can turn into dark circles that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.540
 we know that that is super bad and that you are 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.130
 are sometimes the reason why 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.290
 we use more makeup than 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.630
 necessary for the rest of the skin I 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.520
 I use cleansing wipes and it's 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.149
 super important that you look for some that of 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.549
 you will see 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.560
 remove in your makeup I sometimes is 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.390
 used wipes that do nothing 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.310
 basically I spend them if they leave everything and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.799
 makeup so used together to 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.329
 be of good quality and then remove the 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.640
 excess makeup with a cleanser 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.019
 of course, it's having your 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.760
 facial care routine and also 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.799
 you can use an exfoliant and a 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.959
 tonic if it seems necessary for you 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.810
 skin type once you have skin 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.480
 clean it is necessary to moisturize the skin 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.980
 hydrated they were processed super beautiful and it is 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.829
 important that hydrate is your skin 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.329
 Even if you have oily skin you do not think 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.250
 that this does not apply to you only because 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.319
 have oily skin here I am using 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.599
 my favorite moisturizer and apply it in 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.599
 all my face and also in my neck 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.920
 now for the eye contour is super 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.350
 important to have a product that is 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.390
 specialized for this area the skin 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.580
 under the eyes is very sensitive so 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.540
 what is important to have as a care 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.540
 special with them 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.069
 Of course we can not forget about 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.440
 the lips in my special case I suffer 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.670
 with super dry lips so what 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.980
 What I do is that it has a moisturizer 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.840
 labial wherever I go because the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.879
 Split lips make the rest of the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.160
 face look as sloppy and super 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.840
 wrong so I need to touch up long 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.030
 of the day but if your case is given so 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.760
 Less idea for your lips in the morning 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.769
 before leaving the house a step that 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.510
 no one gives to jump is to use protector 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.280
 solar it has been proven that the protector 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.290
 solar is the most efficient way to 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.599
 prevent signs of age like so 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.019
 less wrinkles and spots so 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.910
 if you can avoid them it's even better to apply 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.410
 sunscreen on your whole face and I 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.500
 I know that sometimes sunscreen can 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.880
 your skin has a different finish 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.640
 that you want as it can be more 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.190
 bright or fatter and that's why sometimes 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.200
 We try to apply less quantity but 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.819
 It is important that you apply a quantity 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.299
 enough for the sunscreen 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.130
 can really do his job and 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.930
 It is also extremely crucial that you apply 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.060
 sunscreen even on the days that 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.859
 you think that those can be cloudy 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.690
 days there are also solar rays so 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.150
 protects 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.770
 and this guy to look good is 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.560
 probably one that will seem super 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.630
 bothersome pÃ©rez important 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.120
 eating eat well take 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.890
 a lot of water when you take care of your body 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.800
 from the inside out it's going to 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.900
 reflect so try to eliminate all 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.910
 those processed foods are basically 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.440
 bad in every way because no 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.520
 you'll just string around a bit but 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.220
 that also your skin is going to see 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.350
 emaciated and the sores are crucial if 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.050
 you want to look good without makeup because 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.940
 they must have a pretty shape and for 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.800
 course they should have some hair is 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.870
 you can not be without eyebrows either because the 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.250
 idea is that you do not have to make up the 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.170
 so what you can do is 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.330
 just comb the and then remove 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.870
 any hair that is going to make the 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.900
 form looks dirty or loses the 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.990
 way she gave herself a nice and clean eyebrow 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.490
 when you clean your eyebrows, have a lot 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.010
 Care you want one eyebrow that looks another 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.810
 natural time is not necessary that you have 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.610
 everything impeccable and that there is not a 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.590
 little hair outside the place but to see 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.120
 quite well and we like in that 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.970
 many of us happen to have other beautiful 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.020
 unwanted in other parts of the face and 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.849
 also removes 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.770
 You can do it with a princess or with 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.169
 hot wax or whatever your method 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.099
 preferred the only one I do not recommend is 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.050
 shave and finally this may seem 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:44.379
 super annoying but it works 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.060
 wonder and it is to have nice hair yo 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.970
 I honestly think that when you have your 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.639
 beautiful hair like the rest of you 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.210
 join that does not matter if you're wrong 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.580
 Makeup without badly dressed makeup 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.800
 undressed 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.960
 but if you put a nice hair mind 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.819
 clean hydrated is going to be wonders like that 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.430
 that you try to take care of your hair 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.840
 condition it deeply as a 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.090
 once a week will really help 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.800
 that looks super healthy and I like it 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.229
 dry it with the dryer but do it 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.189
 from far away so that the heat of 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.259
 dryer does not hurt my hair and 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.819
 also try to make this look clean 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.979
 of course it will vary because of hair 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:25.889
 more fatty than others that need to be 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.900
 washed more often but all if 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.340
 you are seeing how it looks better and also 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.409
 How do you have better hair style? 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.060
 There are many many how it looks clever but 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:35.190
 there are people who like more rulo ay 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.620
 that will depend a lot but 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.599
 basically a hair that is fabulous 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.530
 to help a lot so that you see yourself 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:45.870
 super good yet without makeup there and almost 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.779
 of forgetting the smile of course the 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.940
 smile is part of the face so a 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:53.969
 cute smile is going to make all the 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.349
 face looks super good so try 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:57.629
 take care of your teeth 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:59.580
 obviously brushing those and having 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:02.219
 good breath that's important no one 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.270
 he wants to be with bad breath out there and 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:05.520
 if you have the possibility 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.440
 I was looking for whitening your teeth this is going to 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.020
 improve your smile from heaven to earth 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.630

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.810
 super white and makes the whole face 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.850
 it looks much better 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.800
 and following some of these tips I hope 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.900
 that they manage to venture out without 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.240
 makeup and they will look super super 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.980
 well do not worry because the 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.260
 natural things are those that are over 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.660
 fashion so less definitely is 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.820
