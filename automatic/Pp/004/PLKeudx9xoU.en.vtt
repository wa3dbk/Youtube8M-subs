00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.430
 if you are setting up your home studio the 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.440
 your studio is starting now and still 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.420
 do not know what to buy which microphones 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.850
 buy I recommend that your first 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.090
 microphones are diaphragm condensers 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.530
 because it is more versatile you 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.930
 can record voice and guitar 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.980
 you can record in an essay you can 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.570
 record a show with the microphone you 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.449
 you can record the entire battery only with the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.940
 microphone and with dynamics and you do not have 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.400
 so much versatility will you use the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.820
 more dynamic to capture parts of 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.910
 battery to pick up a percussion you 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.510
 will use the dynamic for capital a 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.250
 guitar and then the first microphone 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.100
 should be a diaphragm condenser 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.290
 Lake the second microphone can be 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.880
 if you plan to buy two 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.790
 microphones if you can afford it 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.010
 and the third microphone does not go 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.050
 to the diaphragm and that it will not 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.719
 small diaphragm condenser because 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.209
 if you buy another capacitor 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:08.829
 Can you make some microphones? 

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.600
 then you have several 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.549
 possibilities and then if you have a 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.560
 microphone just like you do not need 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.649
 necessarily buy a microphone 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.549
 same to married that people call more 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.490
 It's cool 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.719
 if you already have a good microphone 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.149
 capacitor that can buy another 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.920
 Just as you have a married couple that you 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.560
 get to play mystery trainings 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.560
 but on the other hand you are left alone with this 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.450
 microphone microphone texture is a 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.189
 thing that is for the rest of life 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.979
 It's the thing you should invest in 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.499
 his studio you will exchange software 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.229
 You'll change the sound card, will you? 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.759
 to change equipment but your 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.840
 microphone will continue with you through 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.759
 rest of life 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.529
 so that's why they're good 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.229
 investments, mainly 

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:54.700
 capacitors but it's worth the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.249
 investment 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.779
 so summarizing if you have a budget 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.899
 limited 

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:07.179
 I would advise buying a condenser 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.340
 first fragma a dynamic and more 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.040
 a wide diaphragm condenser 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.790
 if you can depending on what you went 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.600
 record 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.580
 you will gradually invest 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.530
 other microphones if the battery is 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.090
 you really need a lot 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.130
 microphone 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.470
 now with two condenser microphones 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.930
 you record a lot of things you do 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.380
 stereo microphones you grass guitar 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.040
 I held piano drums you record coral 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.400
 so I think it's a legal setup for 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.520
 you get versatile and cost effective 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.520
 benefit
