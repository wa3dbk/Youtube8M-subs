00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.330
 How I bought it 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.890
 Hmm 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.970
 But what is 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.420
 3 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.100
 Some way is good 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.160
 The thread error if there is a Sealy 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.980
 All a 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.920
 Enter when you can do it 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.450
 Be able to do various things 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.619
 I'd like to see other guys as they come 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.619
 How is this time 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.770
 First of all 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.970
 For roundness 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.970
 Down below 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.920
 Then 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.120
 As it is 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.120
 Down below 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.650
 I can go around here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.030
 Straight 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.670
 Than the state 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.579
 finger 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.270
 One bottle 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.229
 It is about half from 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.229
 I see a little 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.030
 Den 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.340
 Yes 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.110
 2 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.790
 It is better to wet a little 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:26.670
 A little mix Toka treatment spent I'd 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.730
 Warm 3 o'clock day 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.540
 I think it is okay if you ask me 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.540
 How is this time 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.370
 Just repeat this once 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.720
 I would like to mix and explain 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.469
 Go or to match the roundness of the head 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.720
 Shape it 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.620
 Also because why wet 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.500
 There is also a saying that how much lower is it 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.600
 If it is ok 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.600
 Please try a little thought 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.379
 is 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.269
 But usually now blocking 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.269
 Yopido Oishi East 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.940
 Now 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.940
 unnecessary 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.370
 Follow 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.460
 I want to cut 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.640
 style 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.830
 Hair quality 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.800
 So this is wet 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.000
 Can we be in wet condition 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.010
 Or anti 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.350
 I can be dry 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.080
 About half 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.930
 It's about now and I feel like it's half above 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.349
 I only get half wet 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.349
 It can change whether you can state 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.389
 Commentary a little in 1 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:34.500
 I feel broken 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.340
 State in which the whole was Mahoro was 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.680
 Roundly 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.680
 In rounded take grated state what was 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.240
 Fear 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.040
 Better two 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.500
 Create a grated state 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:57.000
 About this ab size for a long time 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.870
 It's about half the finger, but I 'm lowering the angle a little 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.870
 Thereby 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.870
 Nakagawa 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.870
 Outside the floor 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.180
 A little 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.860
 There is a difference 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:23.919
 Because the house is shorter 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.919
 It becomes easy to enter the inner winding after blowing 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.949
 This time of the rectum of the cut side is 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.110
 This time from the root 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.969
 Acupuncture and roots of this tooth 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.410
 From 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:44.780
 All this middle part 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.770
 Be aware of what you can do 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.100
 I'm cutting it but this is 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.030
 In the expectation form of that right hand last time 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.180
 That 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.560
 Because I am doing a training method of it 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.560
 If you like, have it look 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.190
 Among so wrote here 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.930
 In the explanation column 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.930
 As we get on when everything is done 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.569
 From the coffin 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.560
 Up to about that half 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.810
 Hey school 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.569
 Mark 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.020
 Because it is bad 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.020
 inside 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:30.400
 It is a flower like a crescent moon 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:33.479
 All over the easy to enter the house 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.479
 Because sincerity is made 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.480
 The last is ana 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.120
 There is no need to reduce 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.849
 Damage 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.529
 If you do not want to give as much as possible 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.529
 The way to go 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:57.979
 This is also almost a prunkin 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.979
 Save time because you need it 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.449
 Oh dear 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.020
 Palm and the inner winding It is reproducibility 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:10.789
 I like one thing 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.789
 I will be able to 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.459
 The way this time is that 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:18.459
 How to do this 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:29.389
 As I bought new hair to be completed by combining all kinds 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.389
 Also please try to also look at the difference between
