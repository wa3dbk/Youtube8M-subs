rapture itself also means ecstasy and I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.639 
rapture itself also means ecstasy and I
can't<00:01:51.659> help<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.409> was<00:01:52.500> something

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
can't help but think there was something

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.679 
can't help but think there was something
really<00:01:53.009> ecstatic<00:01:53.820> about<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.659> which

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
really ecstatic about the way in which

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.840 
really ecstatic about the way in which
we<00:01:54.869> went<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> couple

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
we went about this as there for a couple

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.399 
we went about this as there for a couple
of<00:01:57.000> hours<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.509> allowed<00:01:57.810> ourselves<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
of hours we allowed ourselves to

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
of hours we allowed ourselves to
entertain<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> illusion<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.820> were<00:02:00.030> in

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
entertain the illusion that we were in

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.139 
entertain the illusion that we were in
control<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.049> end<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.500> things<00:02:02.060> whereas<00:02:03.060> in

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
control of the end of things whereas in

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.149 
control of the end of things whereas in
reality<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.810> were<00:02:03.899> kind<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.350> facing<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
reality we were kind of facing the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.590 
reality we were kind of facing the
complete<00:02:05.520> opposite<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.420> lack<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
complete opposite and that's a lack of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
complete opposite and that's a lack of
control<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> end<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.619> things<00:02:07.770> whether<00:02:08.099> or

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
control in the end of things whether or

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.559 
control in the end of things whether or
not<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.520> were<00:02:08.610> looking<00:02:08.879> forward<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> next

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
not we were looking forward to the next

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.229 
not we were looking forward to the next
stage<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.560> think<00:02:10.739> everyone<00:02:11.099> was<00:02:11.340> in

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
stage which I think everyone was in

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.640 
stage which I think everyone was in
attempting<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.989> make<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.319> so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
attempting to make it so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.809 
attempting to make it so
we<00:02:13.769> have<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> power<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> make<00:02:14.610> something

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
we have the power to make something

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.550 
we have the power to make something
cease<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.299> exist<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.780> weren't<00:02:16.140> factually

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
cease to exist we weren't factually

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.800 
cease to exist we weren't factually

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
enacting an age-old ritual that night in

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.270 
enacting an age-old ritual that night in
that<00:02:18.900> fire<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.439> tree<00:02:19.620> bound<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> quiet

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
that fire the tree bound is a quiet

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.759 
that fire the tree bound is a quiet
reminder<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.909> our<00:02:21.030> ability<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:22.079> play<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.560> role

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
reminder of our ability we play the role

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.069 
reminder of our ability we play the role
of<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.099> destroyer<00:02:23.489> only<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.120> mask<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.569> physical
