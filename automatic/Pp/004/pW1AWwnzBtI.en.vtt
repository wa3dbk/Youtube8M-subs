00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.960
 virtual gaming industry 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.300
 reality is picking up month after month 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.309
 popularity in the last summer of 2015 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.080
 years of the e3 conference many companies from 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.090
 which did not even expect such a move 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.800
 provided their achievements in mastering 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.390
 virtual world gathered there as 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.010
 introduce developers to various 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.720
 virtual reality helmets so and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.369
 all sorts of controllers for we are in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.439
 including gloves which is completely 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.330
 simulates your real hand movements in 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.130
 the game was also presented pretty 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.020
 famous track fruits with which 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.820
 you can navigate the game world by 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 moving your real legs but in 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.200
 2016 we will finally see can 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.040
 siberian versions they are running stages 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 alpha and beta 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.579
 however in this video we would like you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 tell about the best games that are already 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.780
 support virtual reality helmet 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.050
 and hemisphere let's see what it is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.050
 games 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.030
 and our first compilation is very strong 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.920
 space simulators 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.809
 by itself a game or dangers already 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.640
 quite interesting as cosmo sim 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.199
 however given the fact that you are graham 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.850
 all the time we spend behind the pilot's seat 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.950
 virtual reality helmet was asking for 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.720
 her like him but another game feeling 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.340
 realism in the game achieves incredible 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.960
 level you feel every detail in 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.640
 cockpit feel range 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.560
 object well and of course i think you 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.240
 Can you imagine what I am wearing a helmet 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.310
 virtual reality be in 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.350
 outer space is large and 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.420
 grandly call this smoke scene play 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.700
 of course it is very hard well yes you can 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.990
 walk jump spin your head but let's say 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.149
 so this is really one of the best 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.220
 virtual scenes for the oculus because in it 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.200
 used all the chips last bite and 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.970
 she will show you the future of animated 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.100
 cartoon is no wonder we have become 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.960
 get used and movie games and calling many 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.880
 cinematic games with console kintso 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.350
 maybe this is really the future 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.940
 animated picture in this game 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.130
 we will ride in the cabin too 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.630
 but this time the bogie cab is honest 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.640
 saying the game itself is certainly an amateur 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.709
 but that is, I do not know of any such 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.300
 acquaintance who wanted to be a truck driver 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.130
 or play for truckers but we 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.229
 here we discuss quality games with you 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.300
 for bite and eurotrack suitable this 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.500
 category just like you lady jass you 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.759
 will feel the distance and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.200
 feel all the details of the cabin 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.150
 only as in the first case 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.069
 stock up with good headphones for 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.880
 full immersion and of course driving 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.880
 where do without him 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.490
 in this game we can again 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.410
 feel like a pilot 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.000
 spacecraft is not surprising after all 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.800
 This topic is really suitable for 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.480
 virtual reality however here we are 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.070
 we can improve our solar system 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.260
 you can land on the moon 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.670
 fly by the meteorite cloud of Saturn and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.070
 all this is at a very high level 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.170
 even though the performance is just interesting 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.490
 dna case as with spirit two of course 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.470
 no virtual reality 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.300
 will help if the game will level graphics 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.250
 zero years so it's nice to see that 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.020
 the grill engine 4 engine added 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.760
 some very important tools for 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.530
 creating games subjected well and of course 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.510
 Immediately so that all 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.400
 worked fine made a little haze 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.790
 Yes, like this is the most common roller 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.680
 coaster 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.510
 however, in the opinion of many, this is a better 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.960
 poster of all existing at this 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.960
 moment 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.560
 This game is rather like another Technodrome 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.480
 seemingly not carrying something 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.160
 Unusual besides the graphics in it give 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.380
 Goodness, but it has 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.300
 certain chip you sit your office 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.550
 on the chair should not keep both hands on 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.560
 keyboard buttons a different game project 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.810
 and then the show begins next to you 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.910
 fly from the stages of offices a dinosaur 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.769
 who roars you straight in the face yes dagger 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.360
 get away from you on all sides in general nonsense 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.190
 mad but conveys a feeling 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.610
 reality and looks very cool with 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.610
 all sides 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.420
 Well, of course we could not get around 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.520
 side this game before oculus rift 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.780
 works with skyrim and what's interesting 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.820
 this moment without any 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.050
 hangs and glitches of course anyway 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.060
 how else but the game was not 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.920
 originally intended for helmet and this 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.510
 interferes a little but this is nobody 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.310
 cares to look at the snow 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.050
 tops skyrim 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.150
 meet dragons face to face this 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.250
 expensive by the way development 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.960
 This project deals with studio works and 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.310
 their plans also build opportunity 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.780
 use angle in games like 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.760
 designer of fallout 3 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.610
 mirror's edge and bioshock 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.260
 wait though by 2017 many games will 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.260
 support the oculus but by default 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.300
 she is all write in the comments 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.400
 what other videos or clips would you have 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.080
 wanted to see like on the channel 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.640
 if you like subscribe to the channel 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.410
 to not miss new videos and to 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.340
 new meetings on new videos total 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.340
 good bye bye
