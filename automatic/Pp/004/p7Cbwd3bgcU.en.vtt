00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.640
 hello guys and welcome back I'm alive 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.960
 that this is the new video on clash of 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.610
 france 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.260
 I always thought of doing a series 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.510
 on the construction of various provisions 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.040
 of villages for different levels of 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.160
 more municipalities 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.270
 you have also been asked by many 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.149
 unfortunately I never had the time for 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.570
 do something similar but do it 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.059
 you must first start right 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.300
 well without commitment today I want to bring you 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.309
 in the provision for municipalities at 9 la 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.590
 arrangement will be more war 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.619
 precisely the format used by the 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.619
 head of the gazelle or bank 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.440
 I would say that first of all I show you it 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.720
 speed build then we'll go and see 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.530
 a defense of our base against 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.950
 of heroes 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.950
 at 40 ok let's start with the speed build 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.870
 New York 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.879
 here we are, this is the complete village and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.459
 last constructions especially those 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.069
 external I put a little randomly because 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.410
 it is not so important indeed you can 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.849
 and put them as well as you want 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.390
 those that are important instead 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.099
 I leave you inside especially the defenses 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.379
 15 seconds 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.260
 this view seems to me the best 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.799
 if you want to make us a screen to reuse 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.799
 the village 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.870
 ok I would say to go to the defense that 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.870
 I was saying at the beginning of the video 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.250
 here we are, as I had announced to you 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.540
 defense was made against heroes 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.440
 at 40 ok let's start replay 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:09.290
 then meanwhile the attack is a buy wine 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.380
 or goals and witch magicians and sins in 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.770
 more for I don't know what reason he has brought 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.660
 5 fury or that is okay not to take them 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.660
 freezing because precisely in the town hall 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.360
 ix therefore not to hell or however it has 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.090
 brought out the castle with a giant 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.220
 and in the meantime it began to position 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.290
 his troops or the golems followed by 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.450
 a row of magicians plus witches at 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.140
 center with the reggina while the 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.400
 rhubarb the anchor is me 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.060
 that I didn't say no put it right 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.820
 now ok mean a flaw already gone 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.260
 for its leaders will light its 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.560
 walk around the village 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.240
 the other hand entered well is now a 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.360
 position the troops part what is 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.890
 outside it is a bit more randomly put than 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.650
 other because the heroes did not go 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.720
 where he wanted while this fury is 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.970
 helping the various golems the heroes have 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.980
 in fact, having started the tour this is it 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.960
 one of the peculiarities of the village 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.310
 in fact even if completely open 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.470
 you can see that it smashes the wall 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.880
 they opened it from all sides 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.400
 heroes prefer to go around and 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.290
 breaking the wall at random even the back is 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.330
 went for a ride a bit like the other one 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.460
 who is already dead 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.750
 no it arrived right at the bottom of the 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.970
 village in the meantime there is the real 40 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.140
 which is going to die indeed is not true 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.980
 because still its power 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.210
 I think that will activate it now here is precisely 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.640
 let's think 61 percent 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.290
 nothing has remained standing now 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.290
 there are only those two pretty flaws 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:45.080
 immortalize the golems they became of 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:47.390
 mild and unreal throats is enough 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.370
 we are at 78 percent, let's see how 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:54.380
 the attack continues and I would say that it is not there 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.940
 nothing to do because he has now used i 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.760
 powers of the reals that they were 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.500
 dying 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.060
 so it's really that hard 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.830
 manage to take the other town hall 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.470
 because precisely cisl and tesla a bow 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.030
 hicks the tower the sorcerer by now 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.580
 reggina reggina focuses on 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.040
 City Hall but now can not make facts 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.910
 he stops looking like a barbarian but by now 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.530
 the attack is over then what to say ve 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.360
 I really recommend this one 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.850
 village because as you have also seen 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.800
 if the walls are open to all 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.230
 possible parts also just for 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.890
 enter town hall troops did 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:31.260
 around and I hope nothing the video there 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.610
 both liked and maybe you mentioned 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.800
 also the provision 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.450
 I hope it can help you remember 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.730
 leave a layman a comment is of 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.250
 share the video and if you are not already 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.300
 to join the channel we will see you 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.300
 in the next video
