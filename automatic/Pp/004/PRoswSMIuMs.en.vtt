00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.700
 how many planes 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.930
 7 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.850
 it's the feet especially it hurts 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.870
 if not near people see that must be 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.870
 good for recovery 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.910
 it's back 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.349
 it's the process after each 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.669
 training and every game that's 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.680
 generally it feels good on the spot 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.989
 it's not very nice we'll say but 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.099
 after it feels lighter it's my 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.440
 promise of world cup me 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.720
 personally so it feels good 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.769
 finally we played because it starts to 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.199
 to be time to look at all 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.160
 options and and we not played so this 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.360
 so that have that 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.600
 we're really going into this 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.489
 competition 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.000
 here we are good my recovery for 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000
 be 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.690
 not much played it took it took 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.870
 run a little bit to spend themselves today the 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.090
 world cup it's just a dream 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.450
 necessarily very happy even if I am 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.489
 returned only for 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.420
 minutes but hey it stays and that and I 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.420
 am very happy today 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 and aim a little bit out and move from 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.620
 the hotel is waiting we wait its turn and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.780
 we're on the ground what's needed 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.420
 give everything because that tonight the bench 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.130
 where his land we all have the same desire 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.870
 she just won the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:46.920
 matches so we're not going to present for 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:49.650
 any time we are on the edge of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.160
 sea in the Atlantic in this cup 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.930
 of the world 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.909
 the ocean an ocean at least we will have seen a 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.950
 the 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.569
 challenge is to go see each other 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.799
 ocean on the other side of the Pacific to 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.409
 vancouver on July 5th 53 to say so that 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.090
 customers just about every degree 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.450
 landman match that lets us out 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.629
 a bit of the hotel it's true that 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.510
 we will spend nine days in moncton in 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.010
 a competition atmosphere so released 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.540
 taxes if spirits see something else 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.610
 was wandering on the beach 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.840
 it's always nice little wink 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.910
 so at the cold baths and then escaped 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.269
 also a bit of a head in a context 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.269
 different 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:44.970
 misses it win it had been 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.970
 thanked this tournament 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.800
 warm up a regeneration for the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.140
 girls who have who hears playing and then 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.080
 work much tougher power 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.720
 for those who have not played or very 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.290
 little played on on these encounters for 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.750
 bring everyone tomorrow to the same 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.480
 but it's still very interesting to 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.760
 start will remain by one by one 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.760
 victory almost too 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.660
 very correct is that we took cardboard 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.160
 yellow has no hurt so for 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.160
 the moment we started well 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.520
 parra 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200
 at 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.430
 know did not have too much trauma 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.500
 too many sores so we are not sure 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.720
 asked but here we put a big point 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.580
 of honor on the recovery one is 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.230
 with 23 girls at the beginning of the match 23 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.670
 girls on arrival we do not have too much 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.019
 but it must absolutely 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.019
 or 100% for the second game 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.209
 yes it's still going well in 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.209
 any case 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.150
 thirteen have potatoes 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.760
