few<00:01:23.370> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> points<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> her<00:01:24.480> eyeshadow<00:01:26.840> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
few of the points of her eyeshadow to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:49.100 
few of the points of her eyeshadow to
accentuate<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.620> detail<00:01:47.810> with<00:01:48.810> smaller

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
accentuate the detail with smaller

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.140 
accentuate the detail with smaller
jewels<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.740> easier<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.370> use<00:01:50.520> tweezers<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
apply them because they're hard to hold
