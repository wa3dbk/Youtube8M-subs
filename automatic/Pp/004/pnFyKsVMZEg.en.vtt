00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
yourself but I did a great deal of

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.760 
yourself but I did a great deal of
contoured<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:34.780> before<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.320> used<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.620> have<00:01:35.710> to

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
contoured so before you used to have to

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.020 
contoured so before you used to have to
follow<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.190> computer

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
follow the computer

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.670 
follow the computer
you<00:01:37.120> can<00:01:37.270> do<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.510> yourself<00:01:38.080> they've<00:01:38.530> also

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
you can do it yourself they've also

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.500 
you can do it yourself they've also
added<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.130> torch<00:01:39.400> because<00:01:39.700> when<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.120> form<00:01:40.390> an

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
added the torch because when you form an

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.820 
added the torch because when you form an
upper<00:01:40.690> where<00:01:40.870> if<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.230> push<00:01:41.440> one<00:01:41.620> of<00:01:41.650> the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
upper where if you push one of the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.470 
upper where if you push one of the
equipments<00:01:42.520> it's<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.760> wire<00:01:42.940> on<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.180> classic

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
equipments it's the wire on the classic

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.960 
equipments it's the wire on the classic
controller<00:01:43.780> then<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.560> taunt<00:01:44.860> like<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.250> so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
controller then you taunt like that so

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.100 
controller then you taunt like that so
that's<00:01:46.090> pretty<00:01:46.270> much<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.630> only<00:01:46.780> things

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
parlance works is a bit of a shame but

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.160 
parlance works is a bit of a shame but
it<00:02:03.460> seems<00:02:03.700> like<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.060> period<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.720> original

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170

over<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.940> other<00:02:07.119> characters<00:02:07.600> because<00:02:08.289> they

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
over the other characters because they

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.109 
over the other characters because they
seem<00:02:08.679> more<00:02:08.890> powerful<00:02:09.130> they've<00:02:09.610> got<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.910> best

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
seem more powerful they've got the best

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.180 
seem more powerful they've got the best
set<00:02:10.570> of<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.750> moves<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.200> all<00:02:11.320> of<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.650> speedier

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
set of the moves and all of the speedier

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.940 
set of the moves and all of the speedier
the<00:02:12.370> more<00:02:12.580> agile<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.600> stuff<00:02:13.989> like<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:14.739> it

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the more agile and stuff like that so it

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.170 
the more agile and stuff like that so it
just<00:02:15.130> seems<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> bit<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.760> shame<00:02:15.940> really

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
just seems like a bit of a shame really

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.870 
just seems like a bit of a shame really
that<00:02:16.480> they've<00:02:16.780> concentrated<00:02:17.170> really<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.160> Joe

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880

personally<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.380> think<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.709> emulation<00:02:42.100> on

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
personally I think the emulation on

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.640 
personally I think the emulation on
that's<00:02:42.489> pretty<00:02:42.549> damn<00:02:42.880> perfect<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:44.049> it's<00:02:44.410> one

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that's pretty damn perfect but it's one

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.199 
that's pretty damn perfect but it's one
of<00:02:44.680> them<00:02:44.830> things<00:02:44.890> where<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.670> only<00:02:45.880> after

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
one or two beat'em ups then I probably

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.920 
one or two beat'em ups then I probably

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
skill back on this game because it's

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.050 
skill back on this game because it's
very<00:03:08.350> hard<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.829> play<00:03:09.040> again<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.519> this<00:03:09.730> whilst

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
very hard to play again like this whilst

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:59.670 
very hard to play again like this whilst
he<00:03:10.239> talkin

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.170 

slow<00:04:00.680> evolving<00:04:01.100> clapping<00:04:01.490> you<00:04:01.550> bit<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.730> music

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
slow evolving clapping you bit the music

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.620 
slow evolving clapping you bit the music
and<00:04:03.010> that's<00:04:04.010> pretty<00:04:04.400> much<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:04.760> then<00:04:04.910> it's<00:04:05.090> just

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
and that's pretty much it then it's just

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.570 
and that's pretty much it then it's just
graphically<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.440> likes<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.860> as<00:04:07.160> you<00:04:07.490> can

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
graphically and the likes you as you can

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.010 
graphically and the likes you as you can
see<00:04:07.790> it's<00:04:07.910> pretty<00:04:08.090> damn<00:04:08.330> good<00:04:08.510> graphically

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
see it's pretty damn good graphically

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.900 
see it's pretty damn good graphically
and<00:04:09.200> prefer<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.980> only<00:04:10.250> one<00:04:10.459> thing<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:10.760> haven't

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
and prefer the only one thing I haven't

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.480 
and prefer the only one thing I haven't
shown<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.650> can<00:04:12.800> jump<00:04:13.010> backwards

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
shown you is that you can jump backwards

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.340 
shown you is that you can jump backwards
so<00:04:13.670> very<00:04:13.910> quickly<00:04:14.150> style<00:04:14.510> fight<00:04:14.750> just<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.110> ship

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
so very quickly style fight just to ship

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.530 
so very quickly style fight just to ship
simply<00:04:15.770> show<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.340> what<00:04:16.940> I<00:04:16.970> mean<00:04:17.209> by<00:04:17.359> that

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
simply show you what I mean by that

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.000 
simply show you what I mean by that
because<00:04:17.750> it's<00:04:17.959> not<00:04:18.049> as<00:04:18.200> simple<00:04:18.470> as<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.769> jump

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
because it's not as simple as you jump

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.280 
because it's not as simple as you jump
and<00:04:19.250> called<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.669> diagonal<00:04:19.880> it's<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.480> special

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
and called the diagonal it's a special

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.600 
and called the diagonal it's a special
thing<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.500> can<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:21.769> you<00:04:21.950> just<00:04:22.160> double<00:04:22.460> track

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
thing you can do you just double track

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.190 
thing you can do you just double track
backwards<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.330> you'll<00:04:23.450> do<00:04:23.540> a<00:04:23.570> little<00:04:23.840> da<00:04:23.990> jog

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
backwards and you'll do a little da jog

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.260 
backwards and you'll do a little da jog
aware<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:25.460> can<00:04:25.640> be<00:04:25.669> quite<00:04:25.970> useful

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
aware so that can be quite useful

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.480 
aware so that can be quite useful
sometimes<00:04:26.690> but<00:04:27.200> overall<00:04:27.800> again<00:04:28.220> it's<00:04:28.430> the

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
sometimes but overall again it's the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.520 
sometimes but overall again it's the
type<00:04:28.640> of<00:04:28.669> thing<00:04:28.820> where<00:04:29.120> if<00:04:29.780> you're<00:04:29.990> not<00:04:30.169> fast

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
type of thing where if you're not fast

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.050 
type of thing where if you're not fast
enough<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:31.190> won't<00:04:31.400> be<00:04:31.520> useful<00:04:31.850> at<00:04:31.970> all

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
enough it won't be useful at all

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.050 
enough it won't be useful at all
although<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.840> did<00:04:32.990> come<00:04:33.140> in<00:04:33.230> handy<00:04:33.290> there<00:04:34.060> so

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060
