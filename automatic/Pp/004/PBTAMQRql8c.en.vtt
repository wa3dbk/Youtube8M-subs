in the skin but you definitely feel like
working<00:02:15.959> deep<00:02:16.290> cleaning<00:02:17.480> then<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.599> other<00:02:18.780> one

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
working deep cleaning then the other one

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.290 
working deep cleaning then the other one
you<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.409> is<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.739> massage<00:02:20.300> applicator

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.800 
you have is like a massage applicator
and<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:22.940> for<00:02:23.940> your<00:02:24.060> shoulders<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.659> your

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069

neck but I don't think I'll ever use
that<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.610> then<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.030> last<00:02:27.569> one<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:28.079> sponge

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349

that and then the last one is a sponge
applicator<00:02:28.879> which<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.060> good<00:02:30.299> for

things like my skin seems brighter
lighter<00:03:10.390> cleaner<00:03:11.390> more<00:03:11.930> refreshed<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.370> I

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
lighter cleaner more refreshed and I

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.970 
lighter cleaner more refreshed and I
think<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.480> down<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:15.020> using<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.500> this

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
think that is down to using this this

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.370 
think that is down to using this this
tool<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.760> hair<00:03:19.940> just<00:03:20.120> clips<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:21.260> off

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
tool so the hair just clips on and off

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.729 
tool so the hair just clips on and off
like<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:23.690> was<00:03:23.750> really<00:03:24.230> simple<00:03:24.440> and

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
like that so it was really simple and

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.650 
like that so it was really simple and
easy<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.130> use<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.640> has<00:03:25.700> an<00:03:25.910> on/off<00:03:26.360> button<00:03:26.900> I

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
easy to use it has an on/off button I

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.410 
easy to use it has an on/off button I
don't<00:03:29.660> know<00:03:29.720> what<00:03:29.840> can<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.020> hear<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:31.270> so<00:03:32.270> it

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
don't know what can you hear that so it

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.940 
don't know what can you hear that so it
just<00:03:32.450> makes<00:03:32.870> like<00:03:33.080> this<00:03:33.230> tail<00:03:33.530> it'll<00:03:33.830> vibrate

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
just makes like this tail it'll vibrate

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.430 
just makes like this tail it'll vibrate
inside<00:03:34.550> it's<00:03:34.880> battery-powered<00:03:35.420> as<00:03:35.900> well<00:03:36.110> and
