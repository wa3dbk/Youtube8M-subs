00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 The fall of the economy is a very 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.540
 used for aesthetic purposes in dogs 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.540
 but know that cutting the tail of a 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.300
 dog without health justification may 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.370
 cause serious damage to the animal. 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.400
 practice has been banned by the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.189
 of veterinary medicine and should 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.590
 prohibition is aimed at more 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.140
 aesthetic ends of the tail economy 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.570
 the advice he thinks and that the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.519
 Veterinarians are also well in favor of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.890
 issue of animal welfare is thus a 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.230
 already very clear evolution of this first 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.940
 resolution to ban the collector mia 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.489
 aiming at animal welfare is a 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 surgery to a mutilating surgery the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.300
 cases indicated for connectomy cases 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.640
 clinical cases of self-mutilation tumors 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.250
 fractures in situations where the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.500
 Tail permanence brings the curse 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.989
 clinic for animals around the conectÃ´mica it 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.199
 is indicated as a correction of a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.620
 Pathology Tail amputation is common in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.760
 some breeds like pinscher poodle 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.670
 pitbull among others 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.740
 According to the veterinarian, the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.510
 animal remain with the tail 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.220
 depending on the animal's age and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 economy it works like any other 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.130
 other surgery she has bleeding 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.890
 it has a bony part involved at all 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.259
 the risk of a surgical infection 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.770
 the same risks as any other 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.939
 type of surgery at cotec sunday include 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.680
 there is an innervation that 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.960
 up to a certain tail length 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.600
 that if she is injured it can lead to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.180
 locomotor effects per animal and even 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.240
 muscle function because inside the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.520
 tail to a certain point passes an end 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.259
 of the spinal cord, let's say a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.750
 Spinal cord injury can lead to 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.180
 without much more severe sequelae 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.369
 veterinary remember that it is important to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.710
 awareness of people 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.590
 in fact so for aesthetic purposes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.540
 We do not even recommend people to 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.460
 do more vets they are 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.549
 really prohibited and runs if the risk 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.710
 of professional ethical process 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.950
 in contrast we also guide 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.850
 the following today is not lost 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.120
 commercial value of puppy 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.020
 for not having the tail to the tail cut is not 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.270
 there is a risk that the person will be rejected 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.310
 or even having the animal devalued 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.990
 against a racial competition 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.150
 so people do not need to 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.870
 to worry about it all the associations 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.910
 of race also thinking about the well-being 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.800
 They accept puppies without having 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.360
 which of the economy then this is not anymore 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.850
 a concern for us 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.490
 the people who have puppies is what 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.010
 intend to adopt this measure 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.700
 aesthetic there is no need to make 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.230
 that 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.600
 another consideration to be made 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.630
 also in relation to the economy 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.240
 the surgical process with respect to 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.370
 infection and even the technical knowledge 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.350
 people always guide people because it is 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.290
 the veterinarian is prohibited but many 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.790
 people are looking for practitioners who 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.090
 procedure then we will always 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.150
 do not do this do not look for this 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.810
 type of person because really the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.490
 health to the animal 's life is at risk if 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.980
 with the entire procedure the protocol 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.870
 correct a surgical procedure is already 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.790
 risky with a person without 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.960
 technical knowledge that this risk 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.850
 increases a lot 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.040
 then even more for aesthetic purposes a 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.040
 risk that pays off not run
