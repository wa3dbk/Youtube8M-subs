00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 of drinks 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 three weeks have passed and I come by 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:52.640
 the window and then I'm on the phone 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.910
 quiet and are not those cravings to 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.770

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:16.869
 I sank those who saw you and greeted me 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:22.780
 another absence the looks of the people I 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:25.780
 they did before total indifference these 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.470
 want to hug you without having you 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.330
 well in my body tempting 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.740
 it is not eternal that time of not seeing you 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:44.600
 and keep asking me I do not know where 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:47.750
 you went looking for you I do not know anything 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.380
 at the beginning there was that I did not like if 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:59.259
 The Somali did not disconsolate me 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:02.830
 you disappeared as I do in my hands 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:07.759
 it's only been three weeks and I feel 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:14.450
 that have passed many years I do not know where 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:17.959
 you left you do not know anything 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.670
 at the beginning he did not look for me if that 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:25.390
 They keep my disconsolate 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.390
 disappear 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:34.370
 as I do in my hands they have only been 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.780
 three weeks and I feel that they have passed 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.780
 many years 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.069
 this urge to hug go without having 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:16.610
 they have my body in landa then they 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.209
 thermas this time of not seeing you and 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.209
 follow me 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:27.290

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.890
 I do not know anything 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:38.140
 At first I did not look for myself if that was wrong 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.140
 that it comforted me to have that peace 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:46.890
 as water between my hands have only been 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:51.930
 three weeks and I do not feel like they've passed 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:58.580
 many years have only been three weeks and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.580
 I'm sorry it's been many years
