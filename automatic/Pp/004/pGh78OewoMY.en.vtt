is the elixir how many of my giants are
still<00:02:57.300> up<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:57.750> still<00:02:57.960> have<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.110> couple

and<00:03:48.720> five<00:03:49.610> wall<00:03:50.610> breakers<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.390> and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
and five wall breakers like that and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.020 
and five wall breakers like that and
then<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.840> go<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.680> wizards<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.670> then<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.790> just

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
then I go for wizards and then I just

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.170 
then I go for wizards and then I just
fill<00:03:54.240> this<00:03:54.480> up<00:03:54.630> with<00:03:54.690> archers<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.350> then<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.580> do

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
fill this up with archers and then I do

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.970 
fill this up with archers and then I do
my<00:03:57.210> heal<00:03:57.540> spells<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.500> get<00:03:58.740> 20<00:03:59.570> goblins

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
my heal spells and then I get 20 goblins

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.000 
my heal spells and then I get 20 goblins
and<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:04.350> rest<00:04:04.620> are<00:04:05.040> going<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.850> be<00:04:07.010> barbarians

up to that point so that's what we have

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.690 
up to that point so that's what we have
right<00:04:10.350> now<00:04:11.150> there<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:13.010> yeah<00:04:14.010> there's<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.459> army

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.670 
comp whatever but let's see what kind of
upgrades<00:04:16.830> we<00:04:16.950> can<00:04:17.070> do<00:04:17.190> okay<00:04:17.459> so<00:04:18.290> obviously<00:04:19.290> the

upgrades we can do okay so obviously the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.719 
upgrades we can do okay so obviously the
gold<00:04:19.950> is<00:04:20.430> going<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.150> go<00:04:21.479> towards<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> walls

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
gold is going to go towards the walls

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
gonna be annoying but that's what we're

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.529 
gonna be annoying but that's what we're
gonna<00:04:43.139> do<00:04:43.349> because<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.770> needs<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:44.039> be<00:04:44.129> done

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
first let's get all like the corners and

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.089 
first let's get all like the corners and
the<00:04:47.759> junction<00:04:48.210> points<00:04:48.659> so<00:04:49.620> upgrade<00:04:50.069> right

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
the junction points so upgrade right

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.689 
the junction points so upgrade right
there<00:04:50.780> upgrade<00:04:51.780> right<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:52.550> upgrade<00:04:53.550> right

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
there upgrade right here upgrade right

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.070 
there upgrade right here upgrade right
here<00:04:53.939> and<00:04:54.210> what<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.419> actually<00:04:54.599> have<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.900> do<00:04:55.050> a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
here and what you actually have to do a

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.540 
here and what you actually have to do a
lot<00:04:55.439> of<00:04:55.469> people<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.919> don't<00:04:56.099> know<00:04:56.189> why<00:04:56.340> they

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
lot of people I don't know why they

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.480 
lot of people I don't know why they
still<00:04:56.729> do<00:04:56.969> this<00:04:57.150> but<00:04:57.330> they<00:04:57.419> do<00:04:57.479> double<00:04:57.990> walls

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
still do this but they do double walls

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.119 
still do this but they do double walls
because<00:04:59.490> they<00:04:59.639> don't<00:04:59.909> think<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:01.229> or<00:05:02.009> they

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
because they don't think that or they

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.570 
because they don't think that or they
don't<00:05:02.340> know<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.610> wall<00:05:03.180> breakers<00:05:03.659> do<00:05:04.580> Splash

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
don't know that wall breakers do Splash

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.330 
don't know that wall breakers do Splash
Damage<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:06.300> they<00:05:06.449> affect<00:05:06.870> three<00:05:07.710> walls<00:05:07.949> around

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
Damage so they affect three walls around

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.570 
Damage so they affect three walls around
them<00:05:08.580> or<00:05:08.819> I<00:05:08.879> guess<00:05:09.240> it's<00:05:09.449> it's<00:05:09.690> too<00:05:10.080> deep<00:05:10.580> so

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
them or I guess it's it's too deep so

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.830 
them or I guess it's it's too deep so
you<00:05:11.610> have<00:05:11.969> to<00:05:12.560> protect<00:05:13.819> corners<00:05:14.819> a<00:05:15.090> lot<00:05:15.509> better

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
you have to protect corners a lot better

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.980 
you have to protect corners a lot better
with<00:05:16.259> multiple<00:05:16.889> walls<00:05:17.099> otherwise<00:05:17.990> wall

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
with multiple walls otherwise wall

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.709 
with multiple walls otherwise wall
breakers<00:05:19.319> are<00:05:19.440> just<00:05:19.650> gonna<00:05:20.210> ignore<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.479> pink

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
breakers are just gonna ignore the pink

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.899 
breakers are just gonna ignore the pink
one<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:21.930> they<00:05:22.139> hit<00:05:22.319> or<00:05:23.069> the<00:05:23.190> level<00:05:23.460> six<00:05:23.699> wall

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
one that they hit or the level six wall

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.300 
one that they hit or the level six wall
and<00:05:24.270> just<00:05:24.719> take<00:05:25.379> out<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.620> level<00:05:25.860> five<00:05:26.039> walls

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
and just take out the level five walls

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.820 
and just take out the level five walls
around<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.960> let's<00:05:27.960> see<00:05:28.110> what<00:05:28.139> else<00:05:28.349> we<00:05:28.500> can<00:05:28.650> do

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
around it let's see what else we can do

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.519 
around it let's see what else we can do
I<00:05:29.219> guess<00:05:30.120> we<00:05:30.330> need<00:05:30.539> to<00:05:30.599> do<00:05:30.750> these<00:05:30.930> as<00:05:31.110> well<00:05:31.259> so

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
I guess we need to do these as well so

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.680 
I guess we need to do these as well so
this<00:05:32.190> is<00:05:32.310> gonna<00:05:32.460> be<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.610> long<00:05:32.849> process<00:05:33.180> but<00:05:33.569> I'm

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
this is gonna be a long process but I'm

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
this is gonna be a long process but I'm
not<00:05:33.900> going<00:05:34.349> to<00:05:35.060> I'm<00:05:36.060> not<00:05:36.120> gonna<00:05:36.449> upgrade<00:05:37.259> or

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
not going to I'm not gonna upgrade or

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.480 
not going to I'm not gonna upgrade or
level<00:05:38.039> up<00:05:38.190> until<00:05:38.789> all<00:05:39.539> my<00:05:39.870> walls<00:05:40.080> are<00:05:40.319> done<00:05:40.500> so

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
level up until all my walls are done so

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.629 
level up until all my walls are done so
that<00:05:41.639> might<00:05:41.879> be<00:05:42.180> in<00:05:42.629> a<00:05:43.110> week<00:05:43.289> or<00:05:43.469> so<00:05:43.680> but<00:05:44.430> we'll

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
that might be in a week or so but we'll

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.230 
that might be in a week or so but we'll
see<00:05:44.789> what<00:05:44.879> happens<00:05:44.940> with<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:47.240> otherwise

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
see what happens with that otherwise

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.689 
see what happens with that otherwise
guys<00:05:48.569> it<00:05:48.930> looks<00:05:49.169> like<00:05:49.349> that<00:05:49.529> is<00:05:49.770> going<00:05:50.129> to<00:05:50.400> be
