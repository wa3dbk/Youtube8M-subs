00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
back the back of course is the side that

it's going to have your string on it and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.389 
it's going to have your string on it and
you<00:01:51.450> want<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.899> groove<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> slight

angle backward so that it supports the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.120 
angle backward so that it supports the

severely next we're going to take some
of<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.680> electrical<00:02:32.519> tape<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.120> we're<00:02:33.269> going

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
of this electrical tape and we're going

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.390 
of this electrical tape and we're going
to<00:02:33.450> wrap<00:02:33.629> around<00:02:33.659> here<00:02:34.379> to<00:02:34.769> give<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.220> nice

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
to wrap around here to give it a nice

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.220 
to wrap around here to give it a nice
look<00:02:35.700> but<00:02:35.939> also<00:02:36.060> give<00:02:36.329> it<00:02:36.420> added<00:02:36.629> strength<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
look but also give it added strength and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.410 
look but also give it added strength and
that<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.250> what<00:02:38.549> it<00:02:38.640> looks<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.879> with<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.239> tape

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
that is what it looks like with the tape

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.339 
that is what it looks like with the tape
on<00:02:39.659> it<00:02:39.980> again<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.639> can<00:02:41.790> see<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.659> groove<00:02:43.019> right

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
on it again you can see the groove right

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.069 
on it again you can see the groove right
here<00:02:43.409> very<00:02:43.889> vaguely<00:02:44.219> but<00:02:44.629> it's<00:02:45.629> toward<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
here very vaguely but it's toward the

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.009 
here very vaguely but it's toward the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
on the left-hand side now this will be

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.559 
on the left-hand side now this will be
where<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.739> arrow<00:03:25.979> actually<00:03:26.250> sits<00:03:26.819> as<00:03:27.030> you're

the arrow back this top 90 degree piece

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.270 
the arrow back this top 90 degree piece
will<00:03:33.209> prevent<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.989> little<00:03:34.169> rest<00:03:34.440> here<00:03:34.769> from

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
will prevent the little rest here from

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.479 
will prevent the little rest here from
going<00:03:35.579> backwards<00:03:36.199> but<00:03:37.199> as<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:38.040> shoot<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
going backwards but as you shoot the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.369 
going backwards but as you shoot the
arrow<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:38.940> goes<00:03:39.120> forward<00:03:39.599> this<00:03:40.079> will

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
arrow and it goes forward this will

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.890 
arrow and it goes forward this will
allow<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:41.190> rest<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.940> swivel<00:03:42.209> out<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.750> way

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
allow the rest to swivel out of the way

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.689 
allow the rest to swivel out of the way
and<00:03:43.290> have<00:03:43.680> plenty<00:03:43.919> of<00:03:44.010> room<00:03:44.129> for<00:03:44.159> the<00:03:44.370> arrow<00:03:44.519> to

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
and have plenty of room for the arrow to

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.569 
and have plenty of room for the arrow to
fly<00:03:45.139> now<00:03:46.139> this<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.470> time<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.859> figure<00:03:47.310> out<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
fly now this is time to figure out the

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.939 
fly now this is time to figure out the
length<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.909> your<00:03:48.030> cord<00:03:48.329> i'd<00:03:48.840> suggest<00:03:49.109> having

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
length of your cord i'd suggest having

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.460 
length of your cord i'd suggest having
your<00:03:50.400> cord<00:03:50.699> just<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:51.120> little<00:03:51.479> over<00:03:51.810> 4<00:03:52.079> foot<00:03:52.290> just

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
your cord just a little over 4 foot just

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.740 
your cord just a little over 4 foot just
a<00:03:52.590> little<00:03:52.620> bit<00:03:52.919> longer<00:03:53.220> than<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.909> actual<00:03:54.150> bow

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
a little bit longer than the actual bow

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.539 
a little bit longer than the actual bow
length<00:03:55.109> so<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.919> in<00:03:56.069> case<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.519> a

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
length so that in case you have a

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.729 
length so that in case you have a
mistake<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.599> always<00:03:57.870> trim<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.349> off<00:03:58.560> if

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
mistake you can always trim it off if

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.009 
mistake you can always trim it off if
need<00:03:58.919> be<00:03:58.949> but<00:03:59.510> determine<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.629> length<00:04:00.840> you

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
need be but determine the length you

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.270 
need be but determine the length you
want<00:04:01.199> and<00:04:02.000> start<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> types<00:04:03.299> of<00:04:03.389> nuts<00:04:04.280> all

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
want and start the types of nuts all

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.240 
want and start the types of nuts all
right<00:04:05.430> once<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:05.970> tie<00:04:06.150> your<00:04:06.329> nuts<00:04:06.599> in<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.989> end

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
right once you tie your nuts in the end

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.610 
right once you tie your nuts in the end
I<00:04:08.250> had<00:04:08.639> an<00:04:08.760> additional<00:04:09.299> suggestion<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.349> you

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
I had an additional suggestion that you

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.409 
I had an additional suggestion that you
might<00:04:10.769> want<00:04:10.949> to<00:04:10.979> put<00:04:11.189> a<00:04:11.220> couple<00:04:11.400> zip<00:04:11.759> ties<00:04:12.000> on

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
might want to put a couple zip ties on

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.780 
might want to put a couple zip ties on
it<00:04:12.629> to<00:04:12.780> hold<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.229> cord<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:13.979> nuts<00:04:14.189> for

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
it to hold the cord and the nuts for

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.580 
it to hold the cord and the nuts for
maybe<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.090> little<00:04:15.329> bit<00:04:15.509> stronger<00:04:16.049> but<00:04:16.199> that's

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
maybe a little bit stronger but that's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.129 
maybe a little bit stronger but that's
up<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.889> I<00:04:17.180> do<00:04:18.180> want<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.599> give<00:04:18.750> everybody<00:04:18.959> a

is my mistake

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.690 
is my mistake
just<00:04:28.260> bear<00:04:28.410> in<00:04:28.500> mind<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:28.980> is<00:04:29.220> not<00:04:29.520> as

just bear in mind that this is not as

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.910 
just bear in mind that this is not as
strong<00:04:30.000> as<00:04:30.060> 3/4<00:04:30.930> inch<00:04:31.080> pipe<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.590> we<00:04:31.680> had<00:04:31.770> done

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
strong as 3/4 inch pipe that we had done

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.970 
strong as 3/4 inch pipe that we had done
previously<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:33.150> as<00:04:33.480> long<00:04:33.870> as<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.230> are<00:04:34.440> gentle

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980

when you pull the cord back there is a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.570 
when you pull the cord back there is a
good<00:04:37.260> chance<00:04:37.470> of<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:37.830> will<00:04:38.040> last<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.520> a

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
good chance of this will last you a

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.970 
good chance of this will last you a
while<00:04:38.900> but<00:04:39.900> if<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.110> pull<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.320> too<00:04:40.380> far<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:40.920> will

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
while but if you pull it too far it will

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.930 
while but if you pull it too far it will
