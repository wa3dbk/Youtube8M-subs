 for me it's my wife we're not married 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.860
 but for me it is my husband 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.060
 We have been living together for 4 years and we 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.750
 we met for 5 years 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.260
 ok today I bring you the video that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.180
 you asked me on facebook in the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.150
 page that I managed here I'm going to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.970
 let down I asked them what opinion was it 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.880
 the video that I wanted with which I 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.730
 begin to 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.400
 then this is going to be the video and the 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.750
 video is going to try and how to help 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.890
 I grow up I can grow my hair 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.800
 little more and I was researching 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.390
 I was a bit fanatic with that 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.910
 with about three months and this and I was 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.000
 I searched and searched and searched and searched and 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.850
 I looked for many things to be able to 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 to be able to make me grow up 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.620
 I found one that was I think the most 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.370
 Quick 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.170
 in doing it and the cheapest that I've 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.020
 found because the truth also the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.750
 economy like that at those moments 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.270
 It was very good but I think that 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.940
 then he will try several things on 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.560
 method that I'm going to use I'm going to 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.820
 use today which I am going to 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.400
 teach me is the onion shampoo is not 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.350
 one is a shampoo that you buy the 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.260
 shampoo you will do at home 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.960
 then you have to pay attention very well 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.920
 what are we going to do for this one we are going to 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.200
 need a finely chopped onion 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.490
 chopped like that when you make the sauces 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.570
 so for the tacos like that they will chop it and 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.750
 a our shampoo the shampoo that I 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.550
 I use is repairing for my tips 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.560
 because they had my tips too 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.890
 battered now my hair is already 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.890
 best 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.170
 let's cut the onion and we're going to 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.950
 put our shampoo the shampoo that I 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.250
 I use that I have is 650 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.530
 milliliters and take an onion anything 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.660
 more than obviously if you buy 9 you will 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.660
 you throw the onion you will not be able to because 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.990
 will not be able to enter then I will 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.560
 use as a 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.350
 23 weeks and get it down a bit like that 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.630
 so, more or less, it gives me 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.200
 that the onion can fit because if not 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.980
 afterwards they will not be able to put it in 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.510
 the onion 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:19.970
 and they have to let their shampoo sit 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:23.000
 for 15 days not less than 15 exact days 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.950
 because because if not we will not receive 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.410
 the same results as if we left it 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.379
 15 days then you have to put a lot 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.930
 attention on that please me when 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.720
 spend the 15 days you're going to do this 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.000
 you are going to wash your hair perfectly and 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.640
 you're going to start seeing the results of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.700
 done yes I have seen them and a lot now 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.780
 I'm going to have my hair caught but 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.780
 I want you to check it 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.780
 for this one is going to see 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.800
 and if you see it 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.060
 so up there is my hair ok 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.940
 done I had it until here 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.599
 and I have grown a little bit and with my 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.090
 shampoo took about a month 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.100
 took a month with my shampoo then this 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.980
 is what I more or less am in that has 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.770
 grown up 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.520
 I'm not exaggerating seriously that works 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.300
 I really recommend it very much 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.849
 I'm going to make my other shampoo, I think 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.889
 not a week is enough because the one 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.190
 I have the first first time that 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.259
 I did already it's going to end then I'm going to 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.050
 do the other shampoo and I'll go with 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:46.490
 you just have to remember 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.490
 more or less to where it was 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.500
 up to this point 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.750
 and so here is my hair I'm going to 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.889
 be recording these hair videos 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.200
 nothing more for the shampoo every month I'm going to 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.570
 upload then I will upload 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.400
 I'm going to in that video I'm going to add the 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.590
 photos of each week because I also 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 I'm going to take pictures so that you 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.560
 go see how it is growing 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.410
 obviously this is not going to have 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.820
 results to the eye after you wash it 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.700
 and that all of that 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.030
 obviously not but if they are constant 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.830
 they will achieve another of the things from 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.650
 that I had my ends very battered 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.770
 right now I do not know if it is noticed but not anymore 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.540
 A lot of what I did was enjoy myself 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.000
 alone in another video I will teach you 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.240
 how can you give it to you 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.860
 alone without needing to go to the aesthetic 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:56.770
 or X thing, then I'm going to teach you 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.110
 I hope you have served this video and 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.290
 make this shampoo and if they do not 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.140
 forget to send me a photo 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.860
 facebook I'm going to leave my facebook my 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.350
 instagram and my twitter too so that 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.690
 send me the photo of your shampoo 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.300
 remember that they have to leave 15 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.000
 days resting for the onion 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.040
 release all your nutrients if you 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.940
 after those 15 days they want him 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.400
 remove 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.440
 the pieces of onion your shampoo there's 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.270
 no problem because in fact the 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.150
 onion and the loose what I had to 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.180
 drop one of the recommendations that 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:38.230
 I give them is to use a 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.840
 conditioner because because its its 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.600
 wet hair will smell onion not 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.400
 a lot but if it's going to smell then for 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.770
 that hide a little the smell already 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.140
 after he's not going to smell anything about that 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.360
 do not worry but I recommend them 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.660
 they use their rinse or their 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.630
 conditioner to hide a 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.880
 little smell while it is wet 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.140
 then there will not be any hair 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.270
 problem 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:08.040
 then I say goodbye see you in another 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.040
 video and I love them very much
