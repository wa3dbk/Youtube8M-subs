into the vignette tutorial okay so this
technique<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.229> believe<00:01:10.530> has<00:01:10.710> been<00:01:10.740> around

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
technique I believe has been around

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.179 
technique I believe has been around
since<00:01:11.869> cs5<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> pull<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> off<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
since cs5 and to pull it off you

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.590 
since cs5 and to pull it off you
basically<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> filter<00:01:15.420> menu

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
basically just go up to the filter menu

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.920 
basically just go up to the filter menu
and<00:01:16.080> down<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.130> lens<00:01:17.430> correction<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> then

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and down to lens correction and then

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
and down to lens correction and then
within<00:01:19.110> lens<00:01:19.530> correction<00:01:20.100> you'll<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.430> that

right<00:01:33.810> you'll<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> white<00:01:34.740> vignette<00:01:35.159> so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
right you'll get the white vignette so

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.580 
right you'll get the white vignette so
you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.030> left<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:37.170> does<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
you can see as I go left it does the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.830 
you can see as I go left it does the
darkened<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.630> get

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
darkened and then as I go right I get

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.289 
darkened and then as I go right I get
the<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.530> white<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.939> I'm<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> go<00:01:42.240> ahead

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the the white so I'm going to go ahead

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.819 
the the white so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> way<00:01:42.810> left<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.560> right

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
and go all the way left and then right

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.319 
and go all the way left and then right
below<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> slider<00:01:45.000> called<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
below that is a slider called the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.999 
below that is a slider called the
midpoint<00:01:45.509> slider<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.500> shows<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
midpoint slider and that just shows you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.429 
midpoint slider and that just shows you
or<00:01:47.310> gives<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.850> additional<00:01:48.600> vini<00:01:48.990> adding<00:01:49.290> down

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
or gives you additional vini adding down

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
or gives you additional vini adding down
to<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.710> center<00:01:50.040> point<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.790> photograph

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
to your center point in the photograph

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.560 
to your center point in the photograph
so<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> go<00:01:52.259> all<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.530> way<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.250> left<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.850> get

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
so as I go all the way to the left I get

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
so as I go all the way to the left I get
the<00:01:54.780> extreme<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> way<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the extreme and if I go all the way to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.280 
the extreme and if I go all the way to
the<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.060> pushes<00:01:57.570> everything<00:01:57.600> out<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the right it pushes everything out to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.580 
the right it pushes everything out to
the<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> corners<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> edges<00:02:00.590> that's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the to the corners and the edges that's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.350 
the to the corners and the edges that's
essentially<00:02:02.189> all<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.329> my

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
essentially all you do what I do on my

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.030 
essentially all you do what I do on my
work<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.020> create<00:02:04.320> an<00:02:04.380> ActionScript

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
work is I just create an ActionScript

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.240 
work is I just create an ActionScript
that<00:02:05.490> sets<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:06.500> dark<00:02:07.500> vignette<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> way

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that sets my dark vignette all the way

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.669 
that sets my dark vignette all the way
over<00:02:08.550> at<00:02:08.910> negative<00:02:09.420> 100<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:09.869> then

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
over at negative 100 and then

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.449 
over at negative 100 and then
right<00:02:11.039> around<00:02:11.189> the<00:02:11.579> 35<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.810> 40<00:02:13.319> mark<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.340> my

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
right around the 35 to 40 mark for my

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.470 
right around the 35 to 40 mark for my
midpoint<00:02:15.650> click<00:02:16.650> okay<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:17.670> go<00:02:17.849> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
midpoint click okay and there you go the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.599 
midpoint click okay and there you go the
perfect<00:02:19.220> quick<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.489> easy<00:02:20.790> vignette
