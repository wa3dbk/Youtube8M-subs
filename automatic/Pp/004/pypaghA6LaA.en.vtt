00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.359
 Sunday and today we're going 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.830
 talk about work the job it's a 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.510
 serious subject especially in this period 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 of crisis and doubt 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.599
 and good to evoke this serious subject 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.880
 especially in this time of crisis and I 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.220
 doubted well I invited a guest louis 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.020
 emile of reaction wimille hello hello 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.850
 sir is 6.15 then louis Ã©mile 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.430
 you are an expert at work and you 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.320
 just publish the gamer these 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.090
 feignasses had said to himself and to the presses 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 University of Toulouse is accurate 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.050
 opera then go into this in this big 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.910
 volume you defend the thesis according 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.829
 which game would be an activity our 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.760
 six for the whole society is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.739
 that and tells you that gamers 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.340
 are feigners yes yes yes 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.010
 absolutely 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 let's take an example the sleep time 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.230
 on which the player ron and without 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.730
 shame 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.559
 even to be late for his 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.670
 next day post france 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.629
 does not belong to those who lie down 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.829
 late pro-choice skyrim 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.750
 it's about time we say 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 okay so do you have a 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 solution to get out of the crisis on them 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 couple all the helpers 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 then we cut them off and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.070
 Finally, we forbid their children 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.809
 to go to the canteen 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.580
 ah yes bounce because you have to 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.479
 boost productivity to revive 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.010
 productivity we need to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.460
 growth what is needed for the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.590
 growth 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.909
 it takes workers gold players 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.470
 are unemployed it has been proven we have 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.509
 statistics we will be rolled 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.070
 above by the Chinese it's obvious we 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.210
 will become a under developed country we will 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.780
 to find himself eating rice and that the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.780
 Somali Ugandans 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.390
 indeed there are two kinds of games 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.680
 video those in which we work and 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.810
 those in which we do not work 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.280
 because yes a video game hero does not have 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.180
 necessarily need a job for 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.560
 survive for others by against 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.210
 things are not so easy 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.979
 a player to dispose of the funds 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.840
 necessary for the development of his home 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:57.070
 will for example send his sim to 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:58.750
 coal though in some games like in 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.340
 rpg where you can fashion objects 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.080
 work is only discussed under his 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.250
 creative aspect of wealth in 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.170
 others on the contrary it is the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.790
 repeatability and investment as 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.880
 jobseekers who are put in 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.880
 before 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.020
 aw 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.150
 in shenmu in fable ii work and 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.070
 takes time and it's crazy boring 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.930
 sega taxi to an arcade-themed game 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.340
 is betting on making the activity of 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.440
 taxi driver who is not yet 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.610
 especially exciting a lot more 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.370
 extravagant thanks to its graphics 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.470
 shimmering his boosted rhythm and his 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.250
 dynamic physical engine and of which ten 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.390
 years indeed when it's well done 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.070
 can make just about any 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.240
 exciting job - this fare I 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.180
 will be ready to play the day of a 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.730
 bus driver in the yonne it's 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.960
 time attack 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.730
 if as we have seen the video game has the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.080
 extraordinary power to transform the 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.670
 work in play activity 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.920
 there are times when the game sometimes 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.940
 despite himself is getting work 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.560
 what to think of long 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.330
 farming sequences imposed by the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.870
 rpg players or worse the players of 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.820
 mmo 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.200
 from when these booths talk about 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.840
 game to describe its activities 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.360
 repetitive laborious boring and 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.330
 sometimes even decerebrating where you are 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.380
 the border between play and work 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.790
 did you know that in China some farm 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.470
 objects on your hours during 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.940
 for a derisory salary so that their 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.680
 employer resell these same objects to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.570
 westerners indolent but good payer 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.540
 do you think we can still say 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.140
 of those people who the day I can go 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.370
 in the toilet 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.230
 you pass your way cupcakes 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.660
 to win no tonight you take me to 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.360
 level 75 and if it's not done you pass 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.959
 the night I can see down 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.760
 this time around the work itself 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.370
 develops a world that of the company 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.940
 and he rarely gives desire in the games 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.800
 video the player put face to examples 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.410
 archetypal like umbrella corp 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.230
 the shinra breaking farms or aperture 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.270
 science is forging a little skewed image 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.770
 brilliant of the big companies then 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.330
 that in the background you like me we know 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.459
 that any serious business deserving 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.070
 his place in the cac 40 is aimed at the 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.250
 common good and that without it the world 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.510
 ran towards generalized unemployment 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.770
 so to clear the mind some 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.250
 just play that on their place of 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.930
 job 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:19.519
 leave to take the risk of being 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:21.139
 pinch patrick not tired we get there 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.190
 I can see that you know what you are 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.260
 cheeks besides I see your bar of 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.990

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.100
 textile file and ovid sorry yes you 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.210
 can say forgiveness and failings as much 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.930
 not hold what gorgue you are where 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.070

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.180
 bad in the east i do not want to surprise you 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.180
 it's in life with a pnj 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.000
 so some of you will have 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.800
 maybe misunderstood and will figure 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.550
 I do not like work on the world 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.490
 of the company 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.360
 so that's totally wrong work 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.220
 is a treasure 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.940
 the work of others it goes without saying 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:01.030

 I do not know if you noticed but 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.289
 Mario is a little supposed to be a 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.070
 plumber but we do not believe much 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.070

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.360

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.370
