00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
all right next up we're gonna shoot

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.009 
all right next up we're gonna shoot
through<00:00:11.740> a<00:00:11.769> car<00:00:12.009> tire<00:00:12.250> into<00:00:13.089> a<00:00:13.150> 16<00:00:13.570> inch<00:00:13.779> block

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
through a car tire into a 16 inch block

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.159 
through a car tire into a 16 inch block
of<00:00:14.259> clear<00:00:14.650> ballistic<00:00:15.009> gelatin<00:00:15.599> whoops<00:00:16.599> 380

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:17.169 
of clear ballistic gelatin whoops 380

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:31.069 
of clear ballistic gelatin whoops 380
rip<00:00:17.410> round<00:00:17.650> see<00:00:18.189> what<00:00:18.310> that<00:00:18.430> does<00:00:28.169> okay<00:00:29.169> so<00:00:29.320> 380

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
rip round see what that does okay so 380

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.529 
rip round see what that does okay so 380
through<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.200> tire<00:00:32.469> end<00:00:32.800> of<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.129> gelatin<00:00:33.700> Wow

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
through the tire end of the gelatin Wow

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.060 
through the tire end of the gelatin Wow
good<00:00:34.780> penetration<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:35.440> don't<00:00:35.680> know<00:00:35.770> if<00:00:35.829> you<00:00:36.010> uh

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
good penetration I don't know if you uh

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.250 
good penetration I don't know if you uh
how<00:00:37.059> many<00:00:37.210> of<00:00:37.300> you<00:00:37.360> out<00:00:37.390> there<00:00:37.449> shot<00:00:37.960> tires

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
how many of you out there shot tires

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.860 
how many of you out there shot tires
with<00:00:38.559> pistol<00:00:39.070> ammunition<00:00:39.309> but<00:00:39.870> certainly

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
with pistol ammunition but certainly

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.350 
with pistol ammunition but certainly
wouldn't<00:00:41.079> expect<00:00:41.290> 380<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.890> go<00:00:42.550> through<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.850> fire

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
wouldn't expect 380 to go through a fire

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.200 
wouldn't expect 380 to go through a fire
like<00:00:43.630> this<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:44.110> this<00:00:44.260> one<00:00:44.440> certainly<00:00:44.680> does

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
like this and this one certainly does

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.090 
like this and this one certainly does
we've<00:00:46.210> got<00:00:48.390> right<00:00:49.390> at<00:00:49.540> 9<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.260> just<00:00:50.680> over<00:00:50.920> nine

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
we've got right at 9 and just over nine

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.880 
we've got right at 9 and just over nine
and<00:00:51.130> a<00:00:51.340> half<00:00:51.370> inches<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.930> penetration<00:00:53.110> into

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
and a half inches of penetration into

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.590 
and a half inches of penetration into
the<00:00:54.670> clear<00:00:54.940> ballistic<00:00:55.300> gelatin<00:00:55.950> and<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:01.329> looks

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
the clear ballistic gelatin and it looks

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.200 
the clear ballistic gelatin and it looks
like

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.969 

probably<00:01:04.930> three<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.409> a<00:01:05.440> half<00:01:05.650> inch

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
probably three and a half inch

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.070 
probably three and a half inch
dispersion<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.030> width<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.600> trocars

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
dispersion of the width of the trocars

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.460 
dispersion of the width of the trocars
the<00:01:08.500> pattern<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:09.250> dispersion<00:01:09.670> on<00:01:09.909> this<00:01:10.060> one

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the pattern of dispersion on this one

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.350 
the pattern of dispersion on this one
with<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.710> trocars<00:01:12.190> penetrating<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.970> three

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
with the trocars penetrating at three

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.780 
with the trocars penetrating at three
inches<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:17.440> three<00:01:17.710> inches<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.130> depth<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:18.610> the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
inches so three inches of depth of the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.350 
inches so three inches of depth of the
trocar<00:01:19.470> dispersion<00:01:20.470> pattern<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:22.119> looks

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
trocar dispersion pattern and it looks

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.410 
trocar dispersion pattern and it looks
like<00:01:22.450> those<00:01:22.750> tow<00:01:23.020> cars<00:01:23.259> started<00:01:24.420> expanding

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
like those tow cars started expanding

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.050 
like those tow cars started expanding
immediately<00:01:25.990> upon<00:01:26.500> impact<00:01:26.920> with<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.310> gelatin

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
immediately upon impact with the gelatin

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.060 
immediately upon impact with the gelatin
in<00:01:28.270> this<00:01:28.509> case<00:01:28.750> after<00:01:29.080> having<00:01:29.590> hit<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.890> rubber

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
in this case after having hit the rubber

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.249 
in this case after having hit the rubber
barricade<00:01:30.610> material<00:01:31.000> first<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.509> I'll<00:01:32.050> pull

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
barricade material first so I'll pull

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.690 
barricade material first so I'll pull
this<00:01:32.350> gelatin<00:01:32.800> out<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.220> have<00:01:33.399> a<00:01:33.430> closer

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
this gelatin out so you have a closer

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.669 
this gelatin out so you have a closer
look<00:01:33.850> at<00:01:34.180> it

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.800 

okay<00:01:38.679> so<00:01:38.740> never<00:01:39.070> mind<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.520> older<00:01:39.850> shot<00:01:40.119> from<00:01:40.720> a

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
okay so never mind the older shot from a

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.810 
okay so never mind the older shot from a
previous<00:01:41.259> test<00:01:41.590> from<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.190> direction<00:01:42.670> what

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
previous test from this direction what

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.400 
previous test from this direction what
we're<00:01:42.940> looking<00:01:43.149> at<00:01:43.270> is<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.810> one<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.170> came<00:01:44.380> in

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
we're looking at is the one that came in

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.550 
we're looking at is the one that came in
through<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.369> tire<00:01:46.050> immediately<00:01:47.050> began<00:01:47.380> to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
through the tire immediately began to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
through the tire immediately began to
disperse<00:01:48.100> into<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.880> three<00:01:49.179> inch<00:01:49.360> wide<00:01:49.600> pattern

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
disperse into a three inch wide pattern

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.870 
disperse into a three inch wide pattern
with<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:53.229> base<00:01:53.440> of<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.679> projectile<00:01:54.250> coming

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
with the base of the projectile coming

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.380 
with the base of the projectile coming
in<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.060> full<00:01:55.270> 10<00:01:55.509> inches<00:01:55.840> into<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.800> gelatin

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
in a full 10 inches into the gelatin

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.950 
in a full 10 inches into the gelatin
after<00:01:58.390> having<00:01:58.690> passed<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.200> tire<00:02:00.179> so<00:02:01.179> 380<00:02:01.659> if

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
after having passed to a tire so 380 if

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.559 
after having passed to a tire so 380 if
you<00:02:02.950> didn't<00:02:03.220> expect<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.270> would<00:02:04.390> happen

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
you didn't expect that that would happen

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.500 
you didn't expect that that would happen
well<00:02:04.929> here<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.170> have<00:02:05.350> it
