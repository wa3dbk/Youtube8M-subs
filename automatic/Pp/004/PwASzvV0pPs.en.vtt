00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
camera onto itself I don't think it's a

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.659 
camera onto itself I don't think it's a
downgrade<00:00:28.840> or<00:00:29.290> an<00:00:29.380> upgrade<00:00:29.529> it's<00:00:29.950> just<00:00:30.190> it's

about a half a million pixels as opposed

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.870 
about a half a million pixels as opposed

to three inches and about a million

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.280 
to three inches and about a million
pixels<00:01:04.089> but<00:01:04.420> it's<00:01:04.540> still<00:01:04.720> quite<00:01:04.989> readable

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
pixels but it's still quite readable

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.190 
pixels but it's still quite readable
like<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.130> camera<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:06.909> type<00:01:07.150> it's<00:01:07.420> mostly

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
like a camera of this type it's mostly

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.080 
like a camera of this type it's mostly
plastic<00:01:08.500> including<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.369> lens<00:01:09.610> mount<00:01:09.820> which

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
plastic including the lens mount which

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.020 
plastic including the lens mount which
is<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.240> first<00:01:10.509> for<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.840> DSLR<00:01:11.530> type<00:01:11.920> camera<00:01:12.400> again

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
is a first for a DSLR type camera again

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.929 
is a first for a DSLR type camera again
this<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.330> not<00:01:13.479> really<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.840> DSLR<00:01:14.530> it's<00:01:14.799> really<00:01:15.580> it

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
this is not really a DSLR it's really it

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.480 
this is not really a DSLR it's really it
uses<00:01:16.390> translucent<00:01:17.049> or<00:01:17.409> uses<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.799> translucent

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
uses translucent or uses a translucent

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.359 
uses translucent or uses a translucent
mirror<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.299> it's<00:01:19.539> a<00:01:19.719> variation<00:01:20.350> on<00:01:20.439> a<00:01:20.499> DSLR<00:01:21.159> but

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
mirror so it's a variation on a DSLR but

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.249 
mirror so it's a variation on a DSLR but
not<00:01:21.520> quite<00:01:21.789> one<00:01:22.060> but<00:01:22.359> it<00:01:22.450> functions<00:01:22.780> just<00:01:23.140> like

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
not quite one but it functions just like

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.120 
not quite one but it functions just like
one<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:24.399> usable<00:01:24.729> ISO<00:01:25.270> range<00:01:25.539> is<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:26.439> would<00:01:26.890> say

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
one the usable ISO range is I would say

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.480 
one the usable ISO range is I would say
between<00:01:27.549> 3,200<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.770> 6400<00:01:29.770> certainly<00:01:30.369> I've

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
between 3,200 and 6400 certainly I've

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.550 
between 3,200 and 6400 certainly I've
taken<00:01:30.670> many<00:01:30.880> shots<00:01:31.240> at<00:01:31.420> 3200<00:01:32.200> which<00:01:32.319> I<00:01:32.380> think

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
taken many shots at 3200 which I think

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.440 
taken many shots at 3200 which I think
are<00:01:32.649> perfectly<00:01:33.159> fine<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.729> I've<00:01:34.060> taken<00:01:34.270> a

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
are perfectly fine and I've taken a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.529 
are perfectly fine and I've taken a
number<00:01:34.689> of<00:01:34.749> shots<00:01:35.049> at<00:01:35.729> 6400<00:01:36.729> that<00:01:37.210> looked

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
number of shots at 6400 that looked

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.120 
number of shots at 6400 that looked
pretty<00:01:37.780> good<00:01:37.899> too<00:01:38.229> I'll<00:01:38.409> show<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.649> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
pretty good too I'll show you the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.950 
pretty good too I'll show you the
samples<00:01:39.549> of<00:01:39.670> book<00:01:39.819> those<00:01:40.090> at<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.359> end<00:01:40.539> of<00:01:40.869> this

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
samples of book those at the end of this

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.529 
samples of book those at the end of this
presentation<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:42.460> video<00:01:42.759> there's<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.179> variety

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
presentation the video there's a variety

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.080 
presentation the video there's a variety
of<00:01:43.600> different<00:01:43.780> video<00:01:44.259> options<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.859> you<00:01:44.979> have

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
of different video options that you have

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.889 
of different video options that you have
highest<00:01:46.090> resolution<00:01:46.359> that<00:01:46.630> you're<00:01:46.719> going<00:01:46.869> to

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
highest resolution that you're going to

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.429 
highest resolution that you're going to
get<00:01:47.049> out<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.289> this<00:01:47.380> camera<00:01:47.679> is<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.639> 1080i<00:01:49.600> matte

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
get out of this camera is a 1080i matte

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.230 
get out of this camera is a 1080i matte
P<00:01:50.799> so<00:01:51.399> that's<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.609> little<00:01:51.759> bit<00:01:51.880> of<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.030> downgrade

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
P so that's a little bit of a downgrade

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.709 
P so that's a little bit of a downgrade
from<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.020> 57<00:01:53.740> as<00:01:53.889> is<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:54.909> burst<00:01:55.179> mode<00:01:55.359> which

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
from the 57 as is the burst mode which

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.749 
from the 57 as is the burst mode which
is<00:01:55.869> also<00:01:56.049> a<00:01:56.229> bit<00:01:56.530> slower<00:01:56.950> but<00:01:57.219> don't<00:01:57.399> forget<00:01:57.639> we

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
is also a bit slower but don't forget we

a superior auto mode where we usually

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.190 
a superior auto mode where we usually

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
I still have to look them up because I

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.000 
I still have to look them up because I
forget<00:03:39.610> it's<00:03:39.850> such<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> convoluted<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.019> messy

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
forget it's such a convoluted and messy

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.699 
forget it's such a convoluted and messy
menu<00:03:42.519> this<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.209> in<00:03:43.450> between<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:44.380> type<00:03:44.680> of

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
menu this is in between that type of

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.610 
menu this is in between that type of
menu<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.370> Pentax<00:03:45.850> which<00:03:46.030> has<00:03:46.209> really<00:03:46.620> just

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620

with this kind of flash now this flash
actually<00:04:19.359> works<00:04:19.720> quite<00:04:19.810> well<00:04:20.140> it's<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.410> low

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
actually works quite well it's a low

actually works quite well it's a low
powered<00:04:21.010> flash<00:04:21.310> really<00:04:21.970> mostly<00:04:22.270> therefore

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
powered flash really mostly therefore

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
it's incredibly cheaply made and it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.279 
it's incredibly cheaply made and it
really<00:04:28.120> is<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> disappointment<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:28.990> see<00:04:29.169> the

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
really is a disappointment to see the

really is a disappointment to see the
sony<00:04:29.560> brand<00:04:30.039> on<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.550> how<00:04:30.789> cheaply<00:04:31.030> made<00:04:31.979> see

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
sony brand on it how cheaply made see

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.820 
sony brand on it how cheaply made see
that<00:04:33.160> can<00:04:33.640> you<00:04:33.669> see<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.870> fallen<00:04:35.620> off

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
that can you see this it's fallen off

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.279 
that can you see this it's fallen off
this<00:04:36.430> flash<00:04:36.700> was<00:04:36.970> used<00:04:37.210> less<00:04:37.570> than<00:04:37.810> two<00:04:38.080> days

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
this flash was used less than two days

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.459 
this flash was used less than two days
and

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:40.469 
and

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.369 
and
it's<00:04:40.649> completely<00:04:41.309> broken<00:04:41.819> and<00:04:42.209> it<00:04:43.110> was<00:04:43.229> not

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
it's completely broken and it was not

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.079 
it's completely broken and it was not
abused<00:04:43.769> in<00:04:43.860> any<00:04:43.949> way<00:04:44.099> and<00:04:44.429> the<00:04:44.519> reason<00:04:44.639> that

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:45.089 
abused in any way and the reason that

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:46.879 
abused in any way and the reason that
it's<00:04:45.419> broken<00:04:45.719> is<00:04:46.050> because<00:04:46.199> way<00:04:46.529> that<00:04:46.679> you<00:04:46.739> turn

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
it's broken is because way that you turn

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.659 
it's broken is because way that you turn
the<00:04:46.979> flash<00:04:47.189> on<00:04:47.459> is<00:04:47.759> you<00:04:48.330> rotate<00:04:48.809> it<00:04:48.989> up<00:04:49.669> right

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
the flash on is you rotate it up right

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.600 
the flash on is you rotate it up right
so<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.599> piece<00:04:51.869> here<00:04:52.169> was<00:04:52.559> just<00:04:52.889> pushed<00:04:53.279> into

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
so this piece here was just pushed into

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.790 
so this piece here was just pushed into
the<00:04:53.879> other<00:04:54.029> piece<00:04:54.239> a<00:04:54.269> few<00:04:54.599> millimeters<00:04:55.229> so

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
the other piece a few millimeters so

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.339 
the other piece a few millimeters so
that's<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.189> stress<00:04:56.550> point<00:04:56.909> of<00:04:57.119> the<00:04:57.719> flash<00:04:57.989> and

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
that's the stress point of the flash and

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.109 
that's the stress point of the flash and
you're<00:04:58.919> constantly<00:04:59.279> doing<00:04:59.580> this<00:04:59.699> back<00:04:59.939> and

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:00.119 
you're constantly doing this back and

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:01.790 
you're constantly doing this back and
forth<00:05:00.179> so<00:05:00.569> is<00:05:00.719> it<00:05:00.839> any<00:05:00.959> surprise<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.679> this

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
forth so is it any surprise that this

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.129 
forth so is it any surprise that this
would<00:05:02.039> break<00:05:02.279> it's<00:05:03.269> just<00:05:03.479> kind<00:05:03.689> of<00:05:03.749> a<00:05:03.899> very

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
would break it's just kind of a very

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.749 
would break it's just kind of a very
poorly<00:05:04.619> designed<00:05:04.800> product<00:05:05.369> and<00:05:05.489> I<00:05:05.519> really

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
poorly designed product and I really

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.249 
poorly designed product and I really
would<00:05:05.909> expected<00:05:06.389> more<00:05:06.569> for<00:05:06.749> Sony<00:05:06.929> well<00:05:07.139> they

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
would expected more for Sony well they

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.659 
would expected more for Sony well they
probably<00:05:07.469> took<00:05:07.739> was<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.949> little<00:05:08.039> bit<00:05:08.309> of<00:05:08.399> glue

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
probably took was a little bit of glue

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.059 
probably took was a little bit of glue
or<00:05:08.849> maybe<00:05:09.059> a<00:05:09.179> little<00:05:09.539> washer<00:05:10.469> or<00:05:10.619> something<00:05:10.949> in

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
or maybe a little washer or something in

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.359 
or maybe a little washer or something in
there<00:05:11.189> to<00:05:11.369> reinforce<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:12.089> and<00:05:12.239> now<00:05:13.199> this<00:05:13.439> 140

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:14.369 
there to reinforce it and now this 140

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:17.479 
there to reinforce it and now this 140
dollar<00:05:14.519> flash<00:05:14.819> is<00:05:15.149> basically<00:05:15.869> garbage<00:05:16.489> so

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:17.489 
dollar flash is basically garbage so

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:19.029 
dollar flash is basically garbage so
let's<00:05:17.639> take<00:05:17.759> a<00:05:17.789> look<00:05:17.999> at<00:05:18.089> some<00:05:18.239> pictures<00:05:18.389> and

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
let's take a look at some pictures and

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.739 
let's take a look at some pictures and
we're<00:05:20.039> going<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.219> look<00:05:20.279> at<00:05:20.519> mostly<00:05:21.149> just<00:05:21.599> the

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:21.749 
we're going to look at mostly just the

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
we're going to look at mostly just the
standard<00:05:22.289> lens<00:05:23.279> and<00:05:23.699> also<00:05:24.479> some<00:05:25.139> from<00:05:25.499> the

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
telephoto lens these pictures have been
