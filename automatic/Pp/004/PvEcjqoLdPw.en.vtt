hey guys this is tech is everywhere um
this<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:05.180> the<00:00:06.180> rocket<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:07.020> might<00:00:07.230> have<00:00:07.350> seen

and just stick it in it works just like

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.359 
and just stick it in it works just like
that<00:01:52.410> if<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.190> take<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.460> off<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.360> still

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
that if you take it off you can still

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.930 
that if you take it off you can still
hear<00:01:56.840> try<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> notch<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.500> well<00:01:58.800> as<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.160> can<00:01:59.430> in

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you if you want to get creative you can

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
you if you want to get creative you can
do<00:02:07.530> what<00:02:07.710> i<00:02:07.740> did<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:09.090> box<00:02:10.070> with<00:02:11.270> sharpie<00:02:12.270> on

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
do what i did get a box with sharpie on

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:41.850 
do what i did get a box with sharpie on
it<00:02:15.380> put<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.440> rocket<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.100> there

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.660 

if<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:43.040> pee<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.910> works<00:02:44.240> in<00:02:44.570> on<00:02:44.780> all<00:02:45.290> sorts<00:02:45.830> of

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
if you pee it works in on all sorts of

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.850 
if you pee it works in on all sorts of
stuff<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:48.050> just<00:02:49.090> take<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.270> out<00:02:50.420> for<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.900> second<00:02:51.380> it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
stuff I just take it out for a second it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:03.100 
stuff I just take it out for a second it
even<00:02:52.160> works<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.700> rocket<00:02:53.030> itself<00:03:01.900> as<00:03:02.900> you

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
even works on the rocket itself as you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.520 
even works on the rocket itself as you
want<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.410> completely<00:03:04.630> defeat<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.840> purpose<00:03:06.080> of

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
want to completely defeat the purpose of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:15.910 
want to completely defeat the purpose of
a<00:03:06.980> rocket<00:03:08.680> find<00:03:10.209> speaker<00:03:13.480> stick<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:15.530> rocket

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
a rocket find speaker stick the rocket

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.020 
a rocket find speaker stick the rocket
to<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:20.020> that's<00:03:21.020> probably<00:03:21.580> this<00:03:22.580> probably

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
to it that's probably this probably

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.840 
to it that's probably this probably
sounds<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.930> best<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.770> that's<00:03:25.160> just<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.640> my

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
sounds the best but that's just in my

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:37.330 
sounds the best but that's just in my
opinion<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:32.630> works<00:03:32.930> pretty<00:03:33.410> well<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:36.340> just

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
opinion it works pretty well and just

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.470 
opinion it works pretty well and just
try<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.580> that's<00:03:37.850> probably<00:03:38.239> not<00:03:38.330> very<00:03:38.390> good<00:03:40.480> but

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
try to that's probably not very good but

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.250 
try to that's probably not very good but
yeah<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.940> sound<00:03:43.940> quality<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.420> pretty<00:03:44.630> good<00:03:44.930> it

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
yeah the sound quality is pretty good it

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.330 
yeah the sound quality is pretty good it
works<00:03:45.440> on<00:03:45.590> just<00:03:45.860> about<00:03:45.950> anything<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:50.180> by<00:03:50.630> a

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
works on just about anything it's by a

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.870 
works on just about anything it's by a
ridge<00:03:52.340> audio<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:55.420> yeah<00:03:56.500> here<00:03:57.500> is<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:58.220> on<00:03:58.430> my

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
ridge audio and yeah here is it on my

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:27.010 
ridge audio and yeah here is it on my
printer

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.920 

probably<00:04:28.020> not<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.500> best<00:04:28.700> audio<00:04:29.700> because<00:04:30.210> it's

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
probably not the best audio because it's

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.960 
probably not the best audio because it's
hammer<00:04:31.620> but<00:04:32.580> in<00:04:32.790> real<00:04:33.060> life<00:04:34.160> life<00:04:35.160> here<00:04:36.090> Korea

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
hammer but in real life life here Korea

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:54.740 
hammer but in real life life here Korea
here's<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.240> little<00:04:40.370> bear<00:04:53.510> yeah<00:04:54.510> that's

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
here's the little bear yeah that's

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:12.260 
here's the little bear yeah that's
pretty<00:04:54.960> much<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.200> rocket<00:05:10.940> overall<00:05:11.940> this<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.120> a

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
pretty much the rocket overall this is a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.390 
pretty much the rocket overall this is a
pretty<00:05:12.480> good<00:05:12.720> product<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:14.550> comes<00:05:14.820> with<00:05:16.400> USB

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
pretty good product it comes with USB

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.700 
pretty good product it comes with USB
cable<00:05:18.710> extender<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.960> extra<00:05:21.960> sticky<00:05:22.260> pads<00:05:22.500> but

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
cable extender and extra sticky pads but

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.020 
cable extender and extra sticky pads but
you<00:05:22.860> can<00:05:23.070> actually<00:05:23.840> reuse<00:05:25.220> your<00:05:26.220> sticky<00:05:26.820> pad

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
you can actually reuse your sticky pad
