00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.160
 singles on the way to the upper one is 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.559
 and it's so easy to drive on 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.190
 you need a driver of that 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.190
 one with it 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.250
 there you can see how the trees are hanging heavily 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.920
 place of these frostbitten it now 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.160
 Here you are very good like this 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.600
 tree had to carry snow here 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.600
 either over the entire lane 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:20.690
 from the snow right up to 1400 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.220
 meter about 2,300 70 meters lies this 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.179
 First of all I'm on it now 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.009
 currently located 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.970
 and here, of course, that's a tick 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.310
 stronger more wind more snowfall though 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.770
 It is very fine snowfall and 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.899
 Still, it's within two hours 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.789
 lie here 10 cm 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.170
 The snowfall has increased too 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.789
 the wind has increased and it is relative 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.100
 Siberian partly but one has seen 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.360
 four tours hikers or some tours 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.099
 were 20 still not take 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.170
 let's come up here 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:53.060
 one has also seen dangerous ones 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.610
 Overhangs of the trees already through this 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.920
 heavy snow really like stress 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.660
 at first sticks look like yourself 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.619
 the development continues and I look 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:07.450
 look in there and look like it 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.450
 here to address the hosts from the first 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.340
 Winter has started well from that 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.440
 her states in business now in the end 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.360
 january february is currently on 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.940
 but have become less 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.100
 otherwise he has less snow his 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.010
 meanwhile party has to cost the rooms 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.930
 now in anyway represent you 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.680
 Climate change where there is less and less snow 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.150
 are in the low mountain ranges paroli yes 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.380
 if there is less and less snow and we 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.080
 then at the end have no more then 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.920
 It's bad, but like this year 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.740
 maybe three four weeks longer 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.430
 can be behind snow but otherwise 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.620
 always satisfied 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.810
 So snow hammer actually in the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.100
 usually always until the end of march that we now 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.400
 Of course, four weeks in between 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.260
 spring or summer was not 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.480
 the rule 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.450
 the sudden cold snaps between 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.690
 We have always had such a warm time 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.120
 but it is such a long time 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.200
 in the spring and then again snow 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.200
 it comes is set 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.739
 Did you know that the weather 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.269
 turns of course, aware that's it 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.939
 that's right the motivation leaves 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:36.760
 forward the greeks go on 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:39.620
 sunday on it and in march 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.810
 we have this heat as well in the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:47.170
 can enjoy it badly 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.170
 that is bad 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.900
 Here you can also see a tree of the 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.900
 pretty down inclines 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.280
 there are many people on the way 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.870
