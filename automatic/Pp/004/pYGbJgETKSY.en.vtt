00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.010
 welcome all seekers 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:12.110
 calling on my channel thanks for 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.379
 public attention people write 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.330
 Here are particular A.N. 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:23.970
 comrade m wrote 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.050
 interesting wishes well and basically for 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:35.550
 and thanks, is it possible to increase the scheme 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:40.290
 this is one of the problems and I and all this time and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:45.050
 I deal with the problem let's say the main thing in 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.539
 theories understand how it all works well 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.449
 so for the interest of opportunity 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.120
 transformer allows you to make 127 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.710
 volt 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 what else is our shooting myself i'm here 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 made small calculations and principle 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.409
 I will try to explain what is happening 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.409
 the processes that we have going on 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:24.560
 I will say this conditional calculations relatively 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.439
 and it may well be someone will correct me 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:33.360
 what will be very happy about the case 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:39.170
 well and still run what's interesting 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:44.640
 here we have a light bulb to attend 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.630
 12 volt me ​​including and so on 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.630
 I will explain why 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.980
 here is the first 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.980
 according to the scheme 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.549
 ammeter is the second here 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.920
 I show before and I have included 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.330
 were 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.330
 let's say such calculations relatively speaking 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.610
 what's a 12 volt light bulb i 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.610
 0 0 26 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.819
 So 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.819
 well, well, well 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.470
 Yes 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.599
 counted it turned out 300 0303 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.599
 12th then 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:50.720
 but Kazan and others were a little yes 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:53.510
 Okay, no matter how the problem is 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.530
 self-connection of the secondary winding 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.110
 transformer we have a diode bridge 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.850
 there are no capacitors here 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.560
 filtering and 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.820
 rug fall stupidly from the generator here with 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.990
 such parameters 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.990
 Straight directly to the base of the field worker 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:25.630
 the outflow is growing and growing too strange 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.630
 ok well 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.579
 what happens is the following 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.519
 the secondary circuit itself 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:41.489
 catches these impulses here and here 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:44.499
 it turns out that as a result 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.090
 their pulse pulses are exceeded 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:52.209
 reverse vds light bulb starts to burn 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.879
 the truth is weak the more we stick 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.389
 voltage in the primary winding create 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:01.780
 idle motion and with that 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:07.199
 idling we have a reverse impulse from 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.510
 which ukhty we are with success 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:12.519
 power this device 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.489
 here but as we need to increase 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:22.829
 power try to wind 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.829
 duty cycle and i will add here 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.650
 to make 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.660
 21 percent by the way is very good 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.740
 I recommend the generator to everyone 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.099
 and frequency 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.819
 and hard modulation white white background and 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.910
 lots and lots of interesting things and what 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.100
 we have as a result 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.810
 here 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.810
 we have 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:56.360
 primary winding 0 0 6 5 6 0 6 multiply 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.870
 at 127 we get to everyone 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.870
 here 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.380
 to all of you 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:10.190
 762 now 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.529
 remove this current that we have 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.909
 on the secondary side 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:19.979
 besides jumping that moment when i 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.830
 measured me there were such indications 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:31.090
 I have 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:35.800
 1356 cotton and that and power gain 594 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.450
 well, this is all conditional again if 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.640
 anyone 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.830
 get this experience 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.750
 refute or make other measurements 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.750
 I will be very happy but none the less 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.120
 as well as 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.120
 and all the rest 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:06:01.610
 of our company trying to explain 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:03.150
 what is happening to all of us success 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.150
 Well 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150
 further 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.850
 who has any thoughts write 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:19.400
 I personally think that this works inverse 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.760
 DS because since childhood I remember 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.760
 when 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.699
 use we once measured 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.649
 transformer primary winding and 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.379
 fucked and so mom don't worry 

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:35.249
 your hands from vitaly here they are please 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.249
 these impulses 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:42.699
 apparently there is a limit to what point they 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:46.989
 can shoot does matter of course 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:50.709
 it is important to connect the diode that's all 

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:55.869
 Thank you for your attention to new meetings 

00:06:50.709 --> 00:07:00.999
 so twist again twist 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:12.239
 11 percent place right here there 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:12.239
 growth here until all
