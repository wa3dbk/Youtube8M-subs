hope to demonstrate to you just how much
can<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:23.880> gained<00:00:24.210> from<00:00:24.359> such<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> simple<00:00:25.019> pattern

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
can be gained from such a simple pattern

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.599 
can be gained from such a simple pattern
right<00:00:26.580> let's<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.300> started<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.980> basic<00:00:29.400> free

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
right let's get started the basic free

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.310 
right let's get started the basic free
no<00:00:29.760> grouping<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.359> made<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.689> from<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.080> right

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
accented while the left hand double is

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.450 
accented while the left hand double is
played<00:00:36.329> quietly<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.200> order<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> play<00:00:38.309> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
played quietly in order to play this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490 
played quietly in order to play this
faster<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> left<00:00:39.420> hand<00:00:39.660> has<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.020> relaxed

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
faster the left hand has to be relaxed

00:00:40.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
faster the left hand has to be relaxed
and<00:00:40.620> loose

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.910 

there<00:01:07.420> are<00:01:07.540> three<00:01:07.840> ways<00:01:08.050> that<00:01:08.500> i<00:01:08.530> like<00:01:08.800> to

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
there are three ways that i like to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.130 
there are three ways that i like to
orchestrate<00:01:09.400> this<00:01:09.550> pattern<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.900> first

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
orchestrate this pattern the first

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.690 
orchestrate this pattern the first
involves<00:01:11.590> moving<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.010> right<00:01:12.220> hand<00:01:12.460> around

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
involves moving the right hand around

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.490 
involves moving the right hand around
the<00:01:12.820> drums<00:01:13.120> while<00:01:13.510> keeping<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.870> left<00:01:14.110> hand<00:01:14.380> on

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
the drums while keeping the left hand on

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:25.320 
the drums while keeping the left hand on
the<00:01:14.530> snare<00:01:14.680> drum<00:01:15.130> like<00:01:15.729> this<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:25.150> next

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
the snare drum like this the next

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.390 
the snare drum like this the next
orchestration<00:01:26.140> idea<00:01:26.500> involves<00:01:27.040> moving<00:01:27.280> the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
orchestration idea involves moving the

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.370 
orchestration idea involves moving the
right<00:01:27.610> hand<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.119> symbols<00:01:28.570> while<00:01:29.170> hitting

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
right hand to the symbols while hitting

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:39.810 
right hand to the symbols while hitting
the<00:01:29.560> bass<00:01:29.740> drum<00:01:29.950> at<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.250> same<00:01:30.460> time<00:01:38.820> thirdly

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
the bass drum at the same time thirdly

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.700 
the bass drum at the same time thirdly
you<00:01:40.240> could<00:01:40.509> try<00:01:40.690> moving<00:01:40.930> both<00:01:41.200> hands<00:01:41.440> around

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
you could try moving both hands around

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:55.859 
you could try moving both hands around
the<00:01:41.830> drums<00:01:42.070> together<00:01:42.460> like<00:01:42.910> this

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.450 

once<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.080> have<00:01:57.110> two<00:01:57.320> previous<00:01:57.770> three<00:01:58.070> ideas

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
once you have two previous three ideas

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.670 
once you have two previous three ideas
down<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:59.240> can<00:01:59.420> then<00:01:59.570> start<00:01:59.750> to<00:02:00.049> mix<00:02:00.259> things<00:02:00.470> up

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
down you can then start to mix things up

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:16.290 
down you can then start to mix things up
a<00:02:00.830> little<00:02:00.979> like<00:02:01.580> this

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:53.390 

you

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.830 

this<00:02:54.400> idea<00:02:54.819> works<00:02:55.060> really<00:02:55.360> well<00:02:55.510> as<00:02:55.810> a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
this idea works really well as a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.350 
this idea works really well as a
sixteenth<00:02:56.319> note<00:02:56.530> triplet<00:02:56.920> drum<00:02:57.129> fill<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
sixteenth note triplet drum fill the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.940 
sixteenth note triplet drum fill the
next<00:02:58.599> clip<00:02:58.840> shows<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.260> pattern<00:02:59.560> used<00:02:59.800> in

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
next clip shows the pattern used in

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.729 
next clip shows the pattern used in
context<00:03:00.489> with<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.670> drum<00:03:00.910> beat<00:03:01.560> remember<00:03:02.560> that

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
context with a drum beat remember that

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.589 
context with a drum beat remember that
I'm<00:03:02.860> only<00:03:03.040> using<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.550> orchestration<00:03:04.209> ideas

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
I'm only using the orchestration ideas

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.300 
I'm only using the orchestration ideas
previously<00:03:05.200> demonstrated<00:03:05.349> while

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
previously demonstrated while

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.920 
previously demonstrated while
maintaining<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.940> right<00:03:07.120> left<00:03:07.390> left<00:03:07.510> sticking

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
maintaining the right left left sticking

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:57.560 
maintaining the right left left sticking
at<00:03:08.230> all<00:03:08.380> times

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.580 

playing<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.720> free<00:03:58.900> no<00:03:59.050> grouping<00:03:59.440> through

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
playing the free no grouping through

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.530 
playing the free no grouping through
sixteenth<00:04:00.100> notes<00:04:00.340> can<00:04:00.580> sound<00:04:00.790> awesome<00:04:01.030> but

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
sixteenth notes can sound awesome but

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.180 
sixteenth notes can sound awesome but
can<00:04:01.660> also<00:04:01.720> be<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:02.050> little<00:04:02.260> trickier<00:04:02.740> to<00:04:02.890> hear

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
can also be a little trickier to hear

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.820 
can also be a little trickier to hear
this<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.330> because<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.780> free<00:04:04.990> note<00:04:05.200> pulse<00:04:05.500> goes

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
this is because the free note pulse goes

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.470 
this is because the free note pulse goes
against<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.220> natural<00:04:06.400> for<00:04:06.790> note<00:04:07.000> pulse<00:04:07.300> of

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
against the natural for note pulse of

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.050 
against the natural for note pulse of
the<00:04:07.510> sixteenth<00:04:08.020> notes<00:04:08.640> for<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.730> following

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
the sixteenth notes for the following

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.880 
the sixteenth notes for the following
examples<00:04:10.690> I've<00:04:10.960> played<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.530> free<00:04:11.710> note

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
examples I've played the free note

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.920 
examples I've played the free note
grouping<00:04:12.310> four<00:04:12.580> times<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.240> then<00:04:13.420> ended<00:04:13.810> the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
grouping four times and then ended the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.010 
grouping four times and then ended the
bar<00:04:14.110> with<00:04:14.350> some<00:04:14.500> improvised<00:04:14.950> sixteenth<00:04:15.520> notes

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
bar with some improvised sixteenth notes

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.449 
bar with some improvised sixteenth notes
this<00:04:17.020> helps<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.440> resolve<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.890> drum<00:04:18.130> foe<00:04:18.310> in

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
this helps to resolve the drum foe in

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:40.340 
this helps to resolve the drum foe in
time<00:04:18.730> for<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:18.970> next<00:04:19.000> bar

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:05:09.710
