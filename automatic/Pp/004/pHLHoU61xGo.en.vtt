00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.790
 4 people 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:21.639
 It is important to repeat the self-answer question firmly at the timing when it comes to the front 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:25.260
 Should I give up and give up? 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:28.409
 I wonder if the one who gives up is pretty 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.930
 Repeat it over and over 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.480
 If too my child Tooshi 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.820

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:44.670
 Are you going or are you going to dig in? 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.849
 Question I ask of you Oh Well-through was loaded air Well Then 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:51.729
 Yes 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:55.619
 For example, a salty cake that my wife made me wrong with salt and sugar 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.619
 Can you eat if you have love 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.639
 Try 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.539
 If you eat with a strong feeling 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.539
 It is sweet 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.070
 Have a strong feeling 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.210
 With eating a cake that uses a salt 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:17.770
 That's even in me 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.930
 Almost the same as a cake with sugar 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.710
 I think so and eat 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.730
 It went too salty 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.730
 I see tears 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.090
 I do not like the condition of the lawn a little today 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.819
 Thank you for you to add
