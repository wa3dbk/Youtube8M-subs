 I sing there's an insensitivity that goes 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 against all this know that it was nailed 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.120
 in the letters of renato in our work 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.890
 of us surrendered and degrading desire 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.890
 from my father to me it 's the law

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.759
 this week juliana has launched a new website 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 the pictures and stories about the 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.640
 band and came out a streak 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.820
 the heir does not represent the legion 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.170
 urban wrote in a social network eu 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.530
 I can not see my life to our 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:25.590
 lives being handled and managed in the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.200
 environment on the internet and believe that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.040
 that 's really the story of the band is 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.310
 a site that aims to get back 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.970
 all the information that revolves around the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.890
 history of the urban legion and to 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.439
 accessible to the public 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.380
 the site is only one chapter of a dispute 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.280
 higher that involves the use of the legion brand 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.680
 urban 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.290
 the mark is registered by a company 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.710
 belonging to juliana 90 years the 80 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.110
 guy is registered the brand to us 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.560
 got together with a judge 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.170
 the gain of the cause and this mark had to 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.239
 looking for a company was assumed by the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.190
 renato company that is the legion 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.360
 belonged to him 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.360
 along the Sunday of the brand urban legion 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.130
 ten years have passed and this has never been 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.130
 challenged and with him alive 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.709
 he was a type our big brother 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.740
 yea 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.430
 Renata then let's lawyer that the only 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.430
 everything is resolved 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.810
 My father when he died 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.760
 He left everything to me because he's a 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.170
 his desire and ended up becoming a 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.580
 my right 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.670
 therefore it is legally up to the Giuliano 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.410
 whether or not to authorize the use of the band name 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.540
 in all the projects that we have been 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.350
 invited to solve has always had some 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.810
 thing like that 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.410
 in the afternoon so we'll see it then stop 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.830
 there 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.230
 in 2012 w bonfa were forced to 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.660
 cancel their participation in the tribute 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.170
 to the legion that would be held in curitiba 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.500
 it is impossible to decouple a mark from 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.140
 brand of the artist and the artist are us 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.630
 They are the owners of the book cover. 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.790
 It's inside for you the globe was can 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.530
 use the name is urban legion can 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.880
 I think I should see the faces. 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.440
 Working, I want to see the cars on the street and 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.750
 When I want to see the cars win, but 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.120
 the six members want to guarantee this 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.489
 right in writing and so are 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.019
 suing Julian's company 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.780
 We are talking about the law that is in the 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.610
 same level is in the same status 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.320
 conditional the user will have to create 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.690
 that there is no ready solution in a 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.109
 system for this problem which harmonises 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.049
 these two song rights from the 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.540
 legion are not discussing the die and 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.790
 Bonfa can play them since they are 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.190
 most of them co-authors 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.930
 but there is an unprecedented collection of the group that 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.060
 will not be released as long as the issue 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.100
 of the brand was not resolved 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.940
 we want to for example throw a table 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.940
 metropolitan 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.820
 if it is experience any project 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.720
 reissue leftovers from studio while 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.430
 this situation is in this 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.180
 year the least possibility of this 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.100
 to happen 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.259
 the girl will only miss an audience 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.940
 conciliation procedure was scheduled for 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.360
 next wednesday 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.570
 I want everyone's participation . 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.860
 dialogue and I'm always willing to 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.130
 always talk with open doors in the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.250
 economic and cultural survival 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.350
 this collection an agreement to a solution 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.050
 is that it is built 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.139
 are our lives our history that 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:05.030
 was written for nearly two decades 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:07.970
 without thinking too much about the question of 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.360
 brand and then today we have a situation 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.360
 weird
