00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.809
 what are you doing to them today if this experience I try to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.750
 manage cancerla some people who are concerned have animated the say 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.529
 for ten years this show 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.519
 it constitutes for 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.460
 how can I be Syrian 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.439
 I am I am pretty proud to write it I listen a little neglected his 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.250
 secrets 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.340
 ccc with the sources were those of its local competitors general mills have 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.630
 exceeded the limits of exchanges that I have student friends to laugh 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.750
 it is a fact 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.750
 the swiss team 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.060
 so I wrote I name I see six to have in the stone show area 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.980
 after these people who decide on the ramparts 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.250
 a mother with four children was shattered 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.540
 first stage 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.930
 in the general classification this legal meaning would not yet have to be there 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.080
 to write 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.200
 the church those who make me laugh optional finish the lists conducted on stage 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.690
 this service that appears as the tell tv outlet I liked the fight with 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.130
 the public really does not have anything sharp 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.270
 to sell them a special evening on this link 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.970
 really the impression is that people come to see a show that undermines 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.490
 nothing 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.980
 Tuesday night by a vote 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.950
 except that the post in question 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.980
 q the country with the best chance of working requires that the 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.460
 pressure did not work 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.470
 cccb all his strength of play I could play the 500 points 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.190
 the moment is a certain challenge because it is really a 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.600
 it's really the story for a project judged really feels like 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 to master my subject in fact 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.750
 so it's really interesting because I thought maybe it was 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.250
 real face when adding center sava drunk but I did not hurt 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.200
 evolved 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.320
 and that the better I go out of the show to fall on the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.250
 feet 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.660
 and the euro fell on the roof went away with the price but it's really a 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.549
 example, the more you play the younger and old 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.419
 5 its forms of violent 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.559
 It's certain 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.769
 I feel good actually I think my knees 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.589
 his head with that 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.529
 some new orders 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.169
 viva chile income 6% 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.169
 I make love with my girlfriend forced me to keep in shorts 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.429
 for many it's too much too expensive maybe those who do not 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.429
 do not accept it and are not aware of everything 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.899
 as a humourist 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.089
 would not you be spokespersons 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.199
 the party was a spokesman citing the two men in space in 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.199
 which has passed a message for the spokesperson 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.769
 it is an important parameter in my eyes depends on the sense of humor that you 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:53.519
 in fact 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.769
 it's very good then it's a front in France in texts 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.729
 but again, why accept the obvious 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.109
 other areas of the North Atlantic 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.849
 it's on stage that will never stop immediately attention to 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.849
 what they say consanguinity he is not preparing to leave 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.849
 didier you do not talk about our national history 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.249
 opposite 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.469
 it's the race we have to agree 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.649
 a structure 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.649
 4 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.619
 I'm starting to have some notoriety the big notoriety that 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.469
 scary 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.169
 orange offers all summer 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.549
 still what is disturbing who listened to the temple I am very 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.000
 weird is a way of avoiding that she succeeded the score from the 6th stage 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.550
 a little more period in them now appeared the economist 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.480
 they are everywhere to note that these blows there the promo 6 6 degrees of 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.200
 ajoie ju approved the creation and that of christophe and sends the season 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.099
 you will face Amiens 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.319
 but it will not be the first league nor the Alsatian staff knows not so bad for 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.159
 a second pilot indeed is not necessarily what we are looking for 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.139
 several researchers and of course that the clients we need is from 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.360
 humor like the game I think it's a necessity to introduce 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.110
 a minute of meditation for me it's the same 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.879
 great burden of notoriety 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.239
 the change from page to page not enough to have 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.970
 on the side of the negative numbers in your personal car support I pass 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.009
 a lot of things that things can take a long time on the phone 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.590
 enormously last in date the group 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.790
 this 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.940
 the law is clear thank you very much for accepting this interview for planet 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.940
 Liberian comedian charles taylor 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.409
 The final word 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.439
 20 minutes is a group of young people in the bathroom 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.689
 these words of famine and in these roles kaplan the partners 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.809
 the cafe-theaters particle that burst the artists 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:51.009
