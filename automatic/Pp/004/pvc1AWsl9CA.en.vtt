and then go in the corner there you see

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.190 
and then go in the corner there you see
the<00:01:53.639> ladder<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.630> we're<00:01:54.749> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.929> grab<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the ladder so we're going to grab the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.510 
the ladder so we're going to grab the
ladder<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.439> we're<00:01:55.679> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.859> run<00:01:55.979> around<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
ladder and we're going to run around and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.510 
ladder and we're going to run around and
put<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.749> side<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> bus<00:01:58.319> so<00:01:58.799> ribbon

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
put it on the side of the bus so ribbon

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.730 
put it on the side of the bus so ribbon
these<00:01:59.789> pieces<00:02:00.119> won't<00:02:00.420> always<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.810> exactly<00:02:01.560> in

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
these pieces won't always be exactly in

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.580 
these pieces won't always be exactly in
the<00:02:01.829> spot<00:02:02.189> spots<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.880> basically<00:02:03.810> every<00:02:03.929> area

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the spot spots on basically every area

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.289 
the spot spots on basically every area
will<00:02:04.709> have<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.920> couple<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.369> lock<00:02:05.549> door<00:02:05.789> or<00:02:06.029> I'll

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
will have a couple of lock door or I'll

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.270 
will have a couple of lock door or I'll
up<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.509> war<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.229> has<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.859> be

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
up the war that has to be

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.300 
up the war that has to be
by<00:02:08.369> power<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.830> once<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.890> put<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.100> power<00:02:11.280> on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
by power and once you put the power on

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.430 
by power and once you put the power on
there<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:12.150> most<00:02:12.390> probably<00:02:12.569> find<00:02:13.080> one<00:02:13.170> we

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
there you are most probably find one we

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.870 
there you are most probably find one we
happen<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.800> be<00:02:13.890> lucky<00:02:14.130> enough<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.490> find<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
happen to be lucky enough to find it the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.410 
happen to be lucky enough to find it the
first<00:02:15.090> few<00:02:15.270> areas<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:15.930> um<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.500> will<00:02:17.370> now<00:02:17.640> go<00:02:18.209> and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
first few areas but um I will now go and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.920 
first few areas but um I will now go and
find<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.170> one<00:02:19.380> for<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.740> top<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.520> bus<00:02:20.930> it's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
find the one for the top of the bus it's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.199 
find the one for the top of the bus it's
um<00:02:22.350> yeah<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:23.010> basically<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.910> little

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
um yeah it's basically just a little

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.050 
um yeah it's basically just a little
hatch<00:02:24.420> thing<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.890> again<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.940> to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
hatch thing and again you just have to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.400 
hatch thing and again you just have to
place<00:02:27.239> your<00:02:27.360> turbine<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.959> front<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.350> door

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
place your turbine in front of this door

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.340 
place your turbine in front of this door
to<00:02:28.770> open<00:02:28.890> him<00:02:29.100> up<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.989> there<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
to open him up and there it is on the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.699 
to open him up and there it is on the
ground<00:02:31.560> that's<00:02:31.739> huge<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.900> that's<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.410> this

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
ground that's huge so that's it and this

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.410 
ground that's huge so that's it and this
one<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.130> said<00:02:35.310> goes<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.610> top<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.880> bus<00:02:36.060> but

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
one as I said goes on top of the bus but

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.360 
one as I said goes on top of the bus but
once<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.380> put<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.650> some<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> bus<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.220> will

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
once you put on some of the bus you will

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.010 
once you put on some of the bus you will
get<00:02:38.430> an<00:02:38.520> achievement<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.690> hot<00:02:39.840> all
