detail<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.539> brush<00:00:57.780> strokes<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.379> you've<00:00:58.530> got

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
detail and brush strokes but you've got

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
detail and brush strokes but you've got
to<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.699> careful<00:00:59.910> how<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.480> your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
to kind of be careful how you do your

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.689 
to kind of be careful how you do your
brush<00:01:00.870> strokes<00:01:01.230> because<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:02.430> kind

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
brush strokes because it's actually kind

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.450 
brush strokes because it's actually kind
of<00:01:02.820> acting<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.510> you're<00:01:04.320> painting<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.280> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
of acting like you're painting so it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
of acting like you're painting so it's
moving<00:01:05.939> pixels<00:01:06.210> around<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.470> form<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
moving pixels around in the form of a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.010 
moving pixels around in the form of a
brushstroke<00:01:08.189> which<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.240> kind<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.780> nuts

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
brushstroke which is really kind of nuts

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.800 
brushstroke which is really kind of nuts
and<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> froze<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.180> let's<00:01:12.360> open<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.659> back

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and then it froze so let's open it back

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.249 
and then it froze so let's open it back
up<00:01:12.869> again<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:18.420> launches<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.049> same

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
up again and it launches the same

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.990 
up again and it launches the same
picture<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> had<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.520> basically

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I see let's get a different tool lets

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.130 
I see let's get a different tool lets
just<00:01:32.610> play<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> eraser<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.960> bit

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and we're racing away the brushstrokes

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.719 
and we're racing away the brushstrokes
so<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.799> don't<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> came<00:01:41.670> up

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
with it's like almost non-destructive

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.179 
with it's like almost non-destructive
you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.149> play<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.710> erase<00:01:46.950> away

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you can play you can just erase away

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.539

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
typically you know moves around the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.870 
typically you know moves around the
image<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.840> course<00:01:55.250> you've<00:01:56.250> got<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.549> airbrush

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
tool here and now we can airbrush over

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.170 
tool here and now we can airbrush over
and<00:02:00.390> bring<00:02:00.689> back<00:02:00.869> some<00:02:01.579> detail<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.939> image

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and bring back some detail in that image

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.389 
and bring back some detail in that image
so<00:02:03.930> what's<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.380> neat<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.130> it's

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
so what's really neat is that it's

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.010 
so what's really neat is that it's
there's<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> lot<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.270> other<00:02:06.479> apps<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.960> there

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
there's a lot of other apps out there

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.240 
there's a lot of other apps out there
which<00:02:07.469> actually<00:02:07.740> lets<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:09.649> manipulate<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
which actually lets you manipulate the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.130 
which actually lets you manipulate the
picture<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.849> know<00:02:11.970> dragging<00:02:12.480> pixels<00:02:12.959> around

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
picture you know dragging pixels around

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.670 
picture you know dragging pixels around
and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.979 
and
like<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.129> but<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.819> actually<00:02:15.060> lets<00:02:15.719> you

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
like that but this actually lets you

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.979 
like that but this actually lets you
take<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.560> brush<00:02:17.159> tool<00:02:17.489> or<00:02:17.879> an<00:02:18.209> airbrush<00:02:18.719> or

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
take a brush tool or an airbrush or

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.830 
take a brush tool or an airbrush or
something<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.439> that<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.510> paint<00:02:21.510> your

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
something like that and paint your

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.089 
something like that and paint your
pixels<00:02:22.319> back<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.129> kind<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.579> opposite

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
pixels back so it's kind of the opposite

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.289 
pixels back so it's kind of the opposite
so<00:02:26.099> down<00:02:26.280> here<00:02:26.459> you've<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:27.180> know<00:02:27.209> you've

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
so down here you've got you know you've

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.789 
so down here you've got you know you've
got<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.750> different<00:02:28.079> tools<00:02:28.290> we've<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.709> an

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
got your different tools we've got an

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.360 
got your different tools we've got an
airbrush<00:02:29.189> pencil<00:02:30.469> brush<00:02:33.889> you<00:02:34.889> can<00:02:34.920> kind<00:02:35.250> of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
airbrush pencil brush you can kind of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.699 
airbrush pencil brush you can kind of
add<00:02:35.579> some<00:02:35.879> cut<00:02:36.120> marks<00:02:36.799> see<00:02:37.799> I'm<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:38.159> I<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:39.709> while

something<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.879> I'm<00:02:44.969> never<00:02:45.150> going<00:02:45.359> to<00:02:45.389> be

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
something that I'm never going to be

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.280 
something that I'm never going to be
able<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.780> be<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.260> look<00:02:46.799> at<00:02:46.919> froze<00:02:47.129> again<00:02:47.659> so<00:02:48.659> I<00:02:48.689> I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290

something cool so got some different
textures<00:03:21.329> all<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.379> we<00:03:22.799> can<00:03:22.919> go<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.190> apply

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
textures all so that we can go and apply

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.750 
textures all so that we can go and apply
to<00:03:23.519> images<00:03:24.120> which<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.799> really<00:03:26.159> cool<00:03:26.370> some

to images which is just really cool some

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.659 
to images which is just really cool some
of<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:26.909> power<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.540> application<00:03:28.379> has

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
of the power that this application has

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.729 
of the power that this application has
for<00:03:29.669> manipulating<00:03:30.150> images<00:03:30.419> right<00:03:31.319> inside

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
for manipulating images right inside

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.580 
for manipulating images right inside
your<00:03:31.949> iPhone<00:03:32.430> which<00:03:32.699> is<00:03:32.849> is<00:03:33.329> really<00:03:33.629> cool<00:03:33.959> so

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
your iPhone which is is really cool so

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.129 
your iPhone which is is really cool so
it<00:03:35.519> looks<00:03:35.699> like<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.970> froze<00:03:36.180> again<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:37.019> we're

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
it looks like it froze again so we're

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.509 
it looks like it froze again so we're
having<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.409> little<00:03:37.620> bit<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.739> issues<00:03:38.129> with<00:03:38.159> some

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
having a little bit of issues with some

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.270 
having a little bit of issues with some
freezing<00:03:38.819> on<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.299> app<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.919> it's<00:03:40.919> it's

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
freezing on this app but it's it's

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.099 
freezing on this app but it's it's
trying<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.729> do<00:03:41.849> a<00:03:41.879> lot<00:03:42.120> at<00:03:42.299> once<00:03:42.509> I<00:03:42.780> mean<00:03:42.930> I've

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
trying to do a lot at once I mean I've

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.289 
trying to do a lot at once I mean I've
been<00:03:43.500> running<00:03:43.859> my<00:03:44.099> iphone<00:03:44.519> all<00:03:44.790> day<00:03:45.030> haven't

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
been running my iphone all day haven't

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.390 
been running my iphone all day haven't
reset<00:03:45.840> my<00:03:46.049> iphone<00:03:46.379> in<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.620> couple<00:03:46.889> of<00:03:46.949> days<00:03:47.009> so

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
reset my iphone in a couple of days so

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.830 
reset my iphone in a couple of days so
it's<00:03:47.549> probably<00:03:47.879> just<00:03:48.150> running<00:03:48.359> out<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:48.629> memory

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
it's probably just running out of memory

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.580 
it's probably just running out of memory
because<00:03:49.799> I'm<00:03:49.949> doing<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.400> many<00:03:50.579> things<00:03:50.639> at<00:03:51.030> once

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
because I'm doing so many things at once

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.860 
because I'm doing so many things at once
and<00:03:52.590> haven't<00:03:53.189> saved<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.579> image<00:03:53.819> of<00:03:53.939> course<00:03:54.209> so

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
and haven't saved the image of course so

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.929 
and haven't saved the image of course so
when<00:03:55.680> you're<00:03:55.799> done<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.069> start<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.639> build<00:03:56.759> up

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
when you're done you start to build up

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.490 
when you're done you start to build up
your<00:03:57.000> gallery<00:03:57.540> which<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.959> gives<00:03:58.109> you<00:03:58.229> a<00:03:58.259> really

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
your gallery which it gives you a really

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.170 
your gallery which it gives you a really
cool<00:03:58.799> background<00:03:59.310> so<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.970> have

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
cool background so that you can have

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.219

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
application freezing which is pretty

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.440 
application freezing which is pretty
