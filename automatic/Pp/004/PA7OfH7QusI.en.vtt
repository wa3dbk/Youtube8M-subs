00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
I've never raced on and they apparently

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.149 
I've never raced on and they apparently
got<00:01:20.960> better<00:01:21.259> reading<00:01:21.619> it's<00:01:21.710> not<00:01:21.830> sure<00:01:22.009> how

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
got better reading it's not sure how

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.520 
got better reading it's not sure how
that<00:01:22.190> works<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:22.789> it<00:01:22.940> did<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.929> they<00:01:24.259> made<00:01:24.500> a

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
that works but it did so they made a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.770 
that works but it did so they made a
rule<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.130> morning<00:01:25.580> race<00:01:26.149> morning<00:01:26.569> that

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
first on there you actually see it hold

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.999 
first on there you actually see it hold
on<00:01:44.030> your<00:01:44.239> own<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.690> even<00:01:45.410> though<00:01:45.649> we're<00:01:45.890> now

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
on your own and even though we're now

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.859 
on your own and even though we're now
doing<00:01:46.069> a<00:01:46.459> little<00:01:46.640> bit<00:01:46.789> quicker<00:01:47.179> he<00:01:47.599> actually

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
doing a little bit quicker he actually

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.990 
doing a little bit quicker he actually
did<00:01:47.989> the<00:01:48.140> job<00:01:48.349> your<00:01:49.160> first<00:01:49.310> on<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:49.940> was

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
did the job your first on this that was

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.589 
did the job your first on this that was
pretty<00:01:50.179> cool

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599 
pretty cool

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.180 
pretty cool
yeah<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.959> putting<00:01:51.289> this<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.709> first<00:01:51.979> time

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
yeah of putting this the first time

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.190 
yeah of putting this the first time
computer<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.910> other<00:01:53.030> two<00:01:53.509> rounds<00:01:53.869> we've<00:01:53.989> done

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
computer the other two rounds we've done

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.320 
computer the other two rounds we've done
it<00:01:54.319> was<00:01:54.440> good<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.770> actually<00:01:54.830> get<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:56.000> bit<00:01:56.179> more

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
it was good to actually get a bit more

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.440 
it was good to actually get a bit more
in<00:01:56.509> touch<00:01:56.660> with<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.989> car<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.550> think<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:58.879> this

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
in touch with the car I think it this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.930 
in touch with the car I think it this
trick<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.019> fast-flowing<00:02:00.860> track<00:02:01.369> seems<00:02:01.759> to

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
trick the fast-flowing track seems to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.410 
trick the fast-flowing track seems to
suit<00:02:02.119> me<00:02:02.360> better

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
suit me better

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.240 
suit me better
and<00:02:04.960> generally<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.410> mean<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.650> cat<00:02:05.800> was<00:02:05.920> good<00:02:06.220> I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and generally I mean the cat was good I

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.850 
and generally I mean the cat was good I
mean<00:02:06.490> burns<00:02:07.270> out<00:02:07.480> rear<00:02:07.690> tires<00:02:07.900> as<00:02:08.140> we<00:02:08.289> know<00:02:08.440> but

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
mean burns out rear tires as we know but

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.760 
mean burns out rear tires as we know but
I<00:02:09.160> thought<00:02:09.850> overall<00:02:10.360> was<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> pretty<00:02:11.500> complete

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
I thought overall was a pretty complete

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:45.470 
I thought overall was a pretty complete
package

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360 

and<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.470> were<00:02:46.560> obviously<00:02:46.800> racing<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
and so we were obviously racing the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.780 
and so we were obviously racing the
DeWitt<00:02:47.959> Smith<00:02:48.959> prototype<00:02:49.620> before<00:02:49.950> for<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
DeWitt Smith prototype before for the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.420 
DeWitt Smith prototype before for the
window<00:02:51.090> super<00:02:51.330> affront<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:53.129> was<00:02:53.310> only

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
seven points in it so we had to beat

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.860 
seven points in it so we had to beat
them<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.580> early<00:02:56.849> running<00:02:57.360> they<00:02:57.540> were<00:02:57.690> they

were just ahead of us but you you did a
big<00:03:00.599> mammoth<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:01.440> hour<00:03:01.620> forty<00:03:01.980> stunt<00:03:02.220> caucus

big mammoth one hour forty stunt caucus
for<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:02.910> bit<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.180> well<00:03:04.019> I've<00:03:04.110> got

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
for a little bit of that well I've got

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.320 
for a little bit of that well I've got
no<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.620> had<00:03:04.830> no<00:03:04.980> bracelet<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.550> can<00:03:05.730> now<00:03:06.000> but

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
no I had no bracelet so I can now but

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.449 
no I had no bracelet so I can now but
the<00:03:06.989> plan<00:03:07.230> was<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.590> we<00:03:07.890> would<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.220> course

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
the plan was that we would have course

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.790 
the plan was that we would have course
pretty<00:03:09.269> much<00:03:09.510> out<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.200> previous<00:03:10.590> race

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
pretty much out of the previous race

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.890 
pretty much out of the previous race
that<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.190> I'd<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.880> an<00:03:11.970> hour<00:03:12.090> ten<00:03:12.390> or<00:03:12.599> something

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
that we I'd do an hour ten or something

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.520 
that we I'd do an hour ten or something
like<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:14.819> because<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:15.510> had<00:03:15.690> safety<00:03:16.140> cars

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
like that but because we had safety cars

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.350 
like that but because we had safety cars
and<00:03:16.830> because<00:03:17.099> I'm<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.280> very<00:03:17.489> economical<00:03:18.090> driver

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
and because I'm a very economical driver

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.570 
and because I'm a very economical driver
we<00:03:19.140> actually<00:03:19.560> managed<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.920> get<00:03:20.160> over<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
we actually managed to get over the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.400 
we actually managed to get over the
magical<00:03:21.030> hour<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.330> half<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.780> they<00:03:22.019> read<00:03:22.200> in

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
magical hour and a half and they read in

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.069 
magical hour and a half and they read in
the<00:03:22.440> car<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:22.920> an<00:03:22.980> hour<00:03:23.040> fourteen<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.959> was

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
the car for an hour fourteen so that was

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.680 
the car for an hour fourteen so that was
a<00:03:25.140> long<00:03:25.319> way<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.560> me<00:03:25.860> but<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.579> run<00:03:26.970> funnily
