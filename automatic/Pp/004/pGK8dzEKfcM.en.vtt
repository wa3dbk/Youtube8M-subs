00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.179
 according to some researchers 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.579
 anomalies of the Medveditsky ridge to the wave 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.519
 teletype strictly on the two located 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:35.550
 underground at shallow depth caves 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.320
 according to the stories of old-timers these caves 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.510
 are located 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.899
 parallel underground tunnels 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.570
 diameter according to various sources from 6 to 20 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.290
 meters besides having smooth even 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.440
 walls 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.500
 The strange tunnels of the Medveditsa Ridge were 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.969
 open in many ways by accident 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.879
 eighties professionals 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.390
 Moscow Aviation Institute was 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.920
 entrusted with the task of national importance 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.580
 explore all known at that time 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.200
 facts of appearances in the country 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.290
 unidentified flying objects with a view 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.930
 unravel the principle of their flight and create 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.810
 working theory to develop the future 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.110
 own aircraft one 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.880
 of the students it was vadim chernobrov 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.170
 future most active researchers 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 Medveditsky ridge 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.940
 creator and leader of cosmo search 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.820
 suggested starting exploring routes 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.240
 move mysterious flying objects 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.010
 work began as a result of this work 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.350
 It turned out most of the flight routes 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.710
 intersected in the Volgograd region in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.630
 the area of ​​the so -called Medveditsky ridge 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.540
 scientists began to study the history of this 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.000
 terrain which led researchers 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.299
 to the tunnels when these places appeared 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.270
 The first settlement is unknown to anyone Scythian 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.790
 hosted here 3,000 years ago about 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.710
 What do the numerous mounds but 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.200
 besides them there lived some more 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.810
 unknown tribes covered huge 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.920
 the field is small mounds in height to 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.500
 half a meter the Scythians usually did not do this 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.319
 from residents of the surrounding villages and now 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.730
 you can hear the legend that the people 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.800
 inhabited these edges 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.560
 was cruel cut by thread 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.910
 mighty power what power no one 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.290
 does not know but does not go on the field afraid 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.870
 locals are sure that 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.110
 mounds compound underground into a complex 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.120
 the maze system is also interesting what 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.900
 quite by accident next to one of 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.450
 villages 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.180
 building dug up an ancient burial ground 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.850
 where were the skeletons of the giants of people 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.790
 you are half a meter tall 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.190
 here perhaps long before the new era in 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.250
 a village not far from the excavations 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.200
 still remembers how in former times 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.200
 often during the plowing was found on 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.900
 field of human skull size times 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.810
 two more usual and on the other hand 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.810
 Ursa river upstream in the area 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.150
 other diggers of the same name village 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.420
 hid the ancient burial of the people 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.580
 Liliput people whose height did not exceed 50 60 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.570
 centimeters question who lived on 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.510
 this territory 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.120
 remains open in some old 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.700
 guides of the Russian Empire in that 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.489
 his tommy where is narrated about the Volga 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.400
 talking about two strange caves supposedly 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.109
 keeping untold treasures in history 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.329
 Golden Horde managed to find 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.489
 evidence that the Mongols 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.070
 used captured Rusich for 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.870
 excavation either cave or tunnel and 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.830
 even indicated where it is 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.560
 the shores of the bear 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.280
 early 20th century dan or served 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.610
 shelter 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.980
 I liked the Cossack gang beard 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.530
 dashing chieftain terrified at all 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.900
 For a long time, the Red Army district did not 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.750
 could eliminate gang and beard and 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.750
 therefore was elusive that his people 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.310
 finally went to the tunnel and went to 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.310
 another place for dozens of versions
