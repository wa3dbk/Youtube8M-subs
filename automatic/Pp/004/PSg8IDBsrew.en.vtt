00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello with you again Alina Rin and this 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.780
 I want to show you the video that I 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.460
 took off completely spontaneously when we 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.289
 friends went for a walk botanical 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 garden found that in the Japanese garden 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.640
 Sakura ino blooms of course immediately to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.600
 I ran back only when 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
 went there and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 seems urgent need to shoot a vlog for 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.029
 guys and therefore a little bit so sharply he 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.399
 my video started and what can 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.820
 say Japanese garden exposure in 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.100
 botanical garden was built in 1983 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.989
 these 1980s on the project of the most famous 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.510
 Japanese landscape architect by 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.539
 named ken at cadima and with support 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.789
 Japanese Embassy in Moscow itself 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.030
 this park went there was just 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.710
 very beautiful in general, see for yourself if 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.379
 would never be in japan forever 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.930
 wanted to see sakura 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.260
 a little problem basically 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.420
 find her and in Moscow truth here she is 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.600
 starts from those later than japan a 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.370
 specifically skin than in tokyo because 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.640
 sakura flows down gradually in different 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.770
 corners of japan it even be and which 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:28.190
 travel from south to north by observer 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:32.540
 So Moscow can also see Sakura 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.750
 lesson 1 is dissolved right near the center 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.899

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.210

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.830
 Japanese garden 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.210
