now I'm just using PVC glue that I'm
watering<00:03:44.600> down<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:45.710> cross<00:03:45.980> glue<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.640> could

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
watering down like cross glue you could

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.300 
watering down like cross glue you could
use<00:03:47.000> Mod<00:03:47.270> Podge<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:48.410> might<00:03:48.710> work<00:03:49.040> better

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
use Mod Podge that might work better

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.010 
use Mod Podge that might work better
than<00:03:49.520> what<00:03:49.640> I'm<00:03:49.790> doing<00:03:49.820> but<00:03:50.330> this<00:03:50.480> seem<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
work fine and all the pieces of the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.300 
work fine and all the pieces of the
paper<00:03:52.760> are<00:03:53.060> still<00:03:53.330> stuck<00:03:54.110> on<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.500> ukulele<00:03:54.800> so

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
that's really good now you just start

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.860 
that's really good now you just start
sticking<00:03:58.130> pieces<00:03:58.850> of<00:03:59.000> paper<00:03:59.210> onto<00:03:59.540> your

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
sticking pieces of paper onto your

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.580 
sticking pieces of paper onto your
ukulele<00:04:00.550> random<00:04:01.550> spots<00:04:02.020> ripping<00:04:03.020> them<00:04:03.200> up<00:04:03.320> and

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
ukulele random spots ripping them up and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.340 
ukulele random spots ripping them up and
to<00:04:03.920> make<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.220> hole<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.700> used<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.270> pen<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.959> push

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
to make the hole I used a pen and push

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.310 
to make the hole I used a pen and push
it<00:04:06.380> down<00:04:06.590> through<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.209> created<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.959> sort

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
it down through so it created the sort

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.440 
it down through so it created the sort
of<00:04:09.440> shape<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.550> hole<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.000> then<00:04:11.120> I'm<00:04:11.300> just

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
of shape of the hole and then I'm just

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.110 
of shape of the hole and then I'm just
pushing<00:04:12.170> bits<00:04:12.590> down<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:13.160> try<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.550> give<00:04:13.820> it<00:04:13.850> an

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
pushing bits down to try and give it an

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.590 
pushing bits down to try and give it an
even<00:04:14.920> effect<00:04:15.920> but<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.459> go<00:04:16.669> back<00:04:17.000> after<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:19.600> go

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
even effect but I go back after and I go

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.980 
even effect but I go back after and I go
round<00:04:20.870> up<00:04:21.109> with<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.290> really<00:04:21.680> thin<00:04:22.010> piece<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.990> the

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
round up with a really thin piece of the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.320 
round up with a really thin piece of the
paper<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.740> gives<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.700> a<00:04:25.760> really<00:04:25.790> neat

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
