smarter fighter to think a better way to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.080 
smarter fighter to think a better way to
win<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:14.839> because<00:00:16.130> even<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.340> success<00:00:17.789> of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
win now because even with success of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.500 
win now because even with success of
being<00:00:18.390> young<00:00:19.670> there's<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.760> lot<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.939> things<00:00:21.270> that

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
being young there's a lot of things that

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.960 
being young there's a lot of things that
now<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> look<00:00:22.590> at<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> was<00:00:23.220> young<00:00:23.460> even

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
now that I look at what I was young even

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.290 
now that I look at what I was young even
out<00:00:24.119> even<00:00:24.330> though<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.840> successful<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:26.300> waste

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
out even though I was successful I waste

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.320 
out even though I was successful I waste
a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.599> time<00:00:28.189> but<00:00:29.189> those<00:00:29.490> things<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.090> have

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
a lot of time but those things you have

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.770 
a lot of time but those things you have
to<00:00:30.510> go<00:00:30.660> through<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.740> why<00:00:32.630> we<00:00:33.630> are

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
to go through and that's why we are

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.889 
to go through and that's why we are
young<00:00:33.960> before<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.680> owe<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:36.300> that's<00:00:36.630> why<00:00:36.870> we

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
young before we owe and that's why we

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:45.770 
young before we owe and that's why we
are<00:00:41.329> immature<00:00:42.350> before<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.500> come<00:00:43.710> mature<00:00:44.780> these

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
are immature before we come mature these

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.740 
are immature before we come mature these
stages<00:00:46.200> offset<00:00:46.980> by<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.399> times<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.149> lights<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
stages offset by the times of lights and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.850 
stages offset by the times of lights and
so<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.600> get<00:00:51.600> there<00:00:51.840> before<00:00:52.020> he<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:52.590> she

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
so you can get there before he or she

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
so you can get there before he or she
but<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> end<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> day<00:00:54.000> y'all<00:00:54.420> gonna

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
but at the end of the day y'all gonna

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
but at the end of the day y'all gonna
get<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.410> time<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:56.100> there

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
get there when it's time to get there

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
get there when it's time to get there
best<00:00:56.610> thing<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.059> realized<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.719> life<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.559> just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
sport is that when I look back at my

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.549 
sport is that when I look back at my
last<00:01:02.640> that's<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.539> great<00:01:03.719> question<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> last

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
last that's a great question to the last

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.190 
last that's a great question to the last
five<00:01:04.860> years<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.339> career<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> feel

and you got all this energy and you're
just<00:01:23.040> running<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.610> realize<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.390> training

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
just running you realize I'm training

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
hours you will believe that's an

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.420 
hours you will believe that's an
overkill<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.799> older<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
overkill but as you get older and you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.179 
overkill but as you get older and you
understand<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.450> somehow<00:01:36.920> some<00:01:37.920> don't

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
understand and somehow some don't

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.810 
understand and somehow some don't
survive<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:39.200> long<00:01:40.200> torture<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.520> some

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
survive that long torture and some

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.300 
survive that long torture and some
survived<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> knowledge

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
survived it and if you get the knowledge

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.940 
survived it and if you get the knowledge
to<00:01:44.670> understanding<00:01:45.290> don't<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.649> got

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to understanding don't you know you got

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
to understanding don't you know you got
to<00:01:46.979> reverse<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.000> wouldn't<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.479> here

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
to reverse that out I wouldn't be here

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.770 
to reverse that out I wouldn't be here
now<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.310> thinking<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.820> same<00:01:51.119> concept

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
now if I was thinking that same concept

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
now if I was thinking that same concept
without<00:01:51.840> growth<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.470> development<00:01:52.710> now<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:54.030> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
without growth and development now if I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.179 
without growth and development now if I
was<00:01:54.450> training<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.079> way<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.439> training<00:01:55.740> even
