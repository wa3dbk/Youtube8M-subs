have<00:02:24.760> happened<00:02:24.970> uh<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.989> know<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.680> was

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
have happened uh I you know this was

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.890 
have happened uh I you know this was
amazing<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.520> when<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> was<00:02:28.360> watching<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.810> I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900

also thought of the other butterfly

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.729 
also thought of the other butterfly
effect<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.330> theory<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:32.200> if<00:02:32.350> Jordan<00:02:32.650> had

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
effect in theory that what if Jordan had

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.500 
effect in theory that what if Jordan had
gone<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.400> portland<00:02:33.820> trail<00:02:33.940> blazers<00:02:34.000> and

been a sensation for the trail blazed

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.039 
been a sensation for the trail blazed
the<00:02:36.370> trail<00:02:36.610> blazers<00:02:37.090> won<00:02:37.239> six<00:02:37.540> titles<00:02:37.750> with
