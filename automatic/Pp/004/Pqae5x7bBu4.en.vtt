00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
what I can see here after initially

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.440 
what I can see here after initially
opening<00:04:54.720> it<00:04:54.840> it's<00:04:55.710> pretty<00:04:56.100> bright<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.580> pretty

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
opening it it's pretty bright and pretty

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.180 
opening it it's pretty bright and pretty
clear<00:04:57.780> even<00:04:58.140> though<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.380> resolution<00:04:58.890> is<00:04:58.950> only

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
800 pixels by 480 pixels and as you can

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.040 
800 pixels by 480 pixels and as you can
see<00:05:04.200> it's<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.820> it's<00:05:05.820> certainly<00:05:06.750> not<00:05:06.900> the

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
see it's a it's certainly not the

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
camera which I believe is right there so

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.170 
camera which I believe is right there so
since<00:05:52.140> I<00:05:52.260> can't<00:05:52.530> quite<00:05:53.490> connect<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:53.940> it<00:05:54.060> here

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
since I can't quite connect to it here

else<00:06:02.220> interesting<00:06:02.790> to<00:06:02.880> play<00:06:03.000> here<00:06:03.440> maybe<00:06:04.440> it's

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
else interesting to play here maybe it's

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:15.940 
else interesting to play here maybe it's
got<00:06:07.040> some<00:06:08.040> built-in<00:06:08.490> videos<00:06:08.850> we<00:06:09.030> can<00:06:09.180> try

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.840 

I'll<00:06:16.950> be<00:06:17.070> in<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.220> gallery<00:06:17.550> if<00:06:17.730> they're

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
I'll be in the gallery if they're

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:26.910 
I'll be in the gallery if they're
anywhere<00:06:18.260> one<00:06:19.260> video<00:06:19.590> all<00:06:19.860> right

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.140 

speaker<00:06:27.920> sound<00:06:28.160> alright<00:06:28.370> I<00:06:28.730> imagine<00:06:29.060> the

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
speaker sound alright I imagine the

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.460 
speaker sound alright I imagine the
volume<00:06:29.450> isn't<00:06:29.600> quite<00:06:29.870> as<00:06:29.990> high<00:06:30.110> as<00:06:30.230> it<00:06:30.320> could

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
volume isn't quite as high as it could

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.690 
volume isn't quite as high as it could
be<00:06:34.210> so<00:06:35.210> there<00:06:35.360> it<00:06:35.420> goes<00:06:35.540> to<00:06:35.720> full<00:06:35.900> volume

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
be so there it goes to full volume

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.210 
be so there it goes to full volume
that's<00:06:37.700> surprisingly<00:06:38.240> loud<00:06:38.920> for<00:06:39.920> a<00:06:39.980> device

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
that's surprisingly loud for a device

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.900 
that's surprisingly loud for a device
the<00:06:40.370> size<00:06:40.720> not<00:06:41.720> especially<00:06:42.070> clear<00:06:43.070> but

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
the size not especially clear but

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.730 
the size not especially clear but
certainly<00:06:44.180> loud<00:06:44.360> enough<00:06:44.600> to<00:06:44.630> severe<00:06:45.170> across

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
certainly loud enough to severe across

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.410 
certainly loud enough to severe across
couple<00:06:46.040> of<00:06:46.100> rooms<00:06:46.340> I'd<00:06:46.580> say<00:06:49.060> as<00:06:50.060> you<00:06:50.150> can<00:06:50.270> see

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
couple of rooms I'd say as you can see

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.980 
couple of rooms I'd say as you can see
that<00:06:50.720> screen<00:06:51.020> is<00:06:51.320> pretty<00:06:51.920> darn<00:06:52.130> nice

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
that screen is pretty darn nice

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.210 
that screen is pretty darn nice
considering<00:06:53.990> a<00:06:54.050> resolution<00:06:54.410> in<00:06:54.590> the<00:06:54.710> size<00:06:54.890> I'd

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
considering a resolution in the size I'd

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.540 
considering a resolution in the size I'd
say<00:06:55.400> it's<00:06:55.430> a<00:06:55.550> very<00:06:55.850> nice<00:06:56.090> little<00:06:56.240> screen<00:07:00.550> well

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
say it's a very nice little screen well

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.460 
say it's a very nice little screen well
