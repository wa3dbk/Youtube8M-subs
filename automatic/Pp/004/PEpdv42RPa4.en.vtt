00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.939
 unravel today then something that we were left 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.380
 a little pending in the last time 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 that we work the technique that were 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.689
 about partial avoidance and return 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.600
 with upper we talk about an orthodoxy and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.520
 a heterodoxy within boxing we are going to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.280
 explain it a little I want to say with 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.989
 it 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.579

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.390
 Rodriguez the Polish on his 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.129
 movements 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.489
 some elusive orthodox calls that 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.140
 we got out of his line of slamming 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.660
 on his left live I'm leaving 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.969
 towards my right side and avoided its possible 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.760
 straight from right over your live from 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.620
 right I stepped that hand and avoided his 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.870
 possible crochet or direct left 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.059

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.710
 risk today on your rectum of 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.960

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.360
 to the left side and on his rectum 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.550
 right to the american very alo floy 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.039
 mayweather on his right straight me 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.100
 I arrange on my right side to pass your 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.440
 hand here in the boxing night of 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.659
 marcatv we see how they throw us the live 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.460
 on the left and on that same blow 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.119
 we dodge to our side 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.819
 left from there we went up with the upper 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.789
 on the same side we see how he throws it like 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.860
 we passed the hand and from there we went up with the 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.720
 upper or partridge left straight 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.479
 right crochet left 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.020
 we surrender to pain and move that 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.390
 it is step subo of oper cross straight cross 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.420
 croché we have all the watering of the world 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.870
 it's a gesture that has to be quick not 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.180
 yes yes scintillating because we are 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.640
 getting right into the crosshairs of the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.650
 straight from the opponent's right now 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.020
 we dodge the right rectum here 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.550
 it comes quite complicated this yes that 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.440
 is out of all orthodoxy 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.680
 pugilistic throw us the rest of 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.860
 right and we load the weight back 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.770
 there's almost your right challenge skimming 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.220
 our little ear 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.660
 from there we went up with the upper right and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.060
 we see how the rest of us have 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.220
 we left his line we have a watering 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.380
 awful because we are there in let's say 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.660
 that in your distance from your rectum 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.400
 left courses on super left 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.430
 even about his outbreak and that the truth and 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.920
 Quickly we left against with 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.260
 our to lose right crossing with the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.110
 left crochet are gestures 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.360
 defensives with enough risk but that 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.070
 to the sea ​​risk greater benefit us 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.830
 we can control in a more 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.280
 fast and more explosive there in the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.250
 Boxing equation at higher risk 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.190
 benefit depends on each one and up 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.200
 here the technical section in the school of 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.570
 boxing I hope we have been a 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.060
 little bit of the partial dodges 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.680
 or laterals working with apple also 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.690

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.570
 set work with crochet but that 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.340
