my<00:04:39.720> palm<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.290> my<00:04:40.410> hand<00:04:42.139> my<00:04:43.139> finger<00:04:43.590> right<00:04:43.830> here

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
my palm of my hand my finger right here

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.790 
my palm of my hand my finger right here
this<00:04:44.310> is<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.550> buddy<00:04:44.790> image<00:04:45.240> style<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:46.139> blocking

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
this is a buddy image style of blocking

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.950 
this is a buddy image style of blocking
what<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.160> does<00:04:47.400> allows<00:04:47.880> gives<00:04:48.690> me<00:04:48.870> an

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
what that does allows gives me an

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.100 
what that does allows gives me an
additional<00:04:49.620> block<00:04:49.889> from<00:04:50.370> my<00:04:50.550> palm<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:51.570> here<00:04:51.900> on

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
additional block from my palm to here on

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.520 
additional block from my palm to here on
maybe<00:04:52.470> two<00:04:52.950> or<00:04:53.130> three<00:04:53.160> strings<00:04:54.320> let's<00:04:55.320> get

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
maybe two or three strings let's get

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.790 
maybe two or three strings let's get
into<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.669> blocking<00:04:57.180> itself<00:04:57.660> there's<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.470> palm

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
into the blocking itself there's a palm

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.680 
into the blocking itself there's a palm
blocking<00:04:59.370> where<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.700> block<00:05:00.000> with<00:05:00.270> your<00:05:00.419> palm

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
blocking where you block with your palm

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.990 
blocking where you block with your palm
just<00:05:00.990> like<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.889> you're<00:05:02.550> picking<00:05:02.760> the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
just like this and you're picking the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.730 
just like this and you're picking the
strings<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.570> land<00:05:03.810> your<00:05:03.990> palm<00:05:04.200> right<00:05:04.440> back

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
strings and land your palm right back

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.700 
strings and land your palm right back
down<00:05:04.950> okay<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.900> then<00:05:06.900> there's<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.229> picking

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
down okay and then there's a picking

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.930 
down okay and then there's a picking
there's<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.130> pick<00:05:09.090> blocking<00:05:10.460> style<00:05:11.460> which<00:05:11.729> is

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
there's a pick blocking style which is

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.750 
there's a pick blocking style which is
you<00:05:12.120> pick<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.539> string<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.220> lay<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.400> finger

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
you pick the string and lay the finger

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.820 
you pick the string and lay the finger
right<00:05:14.940> straight<00:05:15.270> back<00:05:15.300> down<00:05:15.750> on<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.560> string

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
right straight back down on the string

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.900 
right straight back down on the string
again<00:05:16.979> before<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:17.610> pick<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.000> next<00:05:18.150> one<00:05:18.650> okay

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
again before you pick the next one okay

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.670 
again before you pick the next one okay
then<00:05:20.910> there's<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.600> ones<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:22.050> I<00:05:22.080> showed<00:05:22.200> you

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
then there's the ones that I showed you

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.890 
then there's the ones that I showed you
with<00:05:22.890> here<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.400> did<00:05:23.850> I<00:05:23.970> use<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:24.780> I

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
with here that I did I use it to that I

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.050 
with here that I did I use it to that I
called<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.289> buddy<00:05:25.470> Yemen<00:05:25.830> style<00:05:26.130> okay<00:05:26.580> and

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
called a buddy Yemen style okay and

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.090 
called a buddy Yemen style okay and
that's<00:05:27.720> what<00:05:27.810> we're<00:05:28.050> going<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.350> be<00:05:28.470> using<00:05:28.890> the

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
that's what we're going to be using the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.950 
that's what we're going to be using the
primary<00:05:29.640> today<00:05:29.850> because<00:05:30.270> that's<00:05:30.479> that's<00:05:30.750> how

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
primary today because that's that's how

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.710 
primary today because that's that's how
I<00:05:30.990> that's<00:05:31.770> how<00:05:31.950> I<00:05:31.979> play<00:05:32.340> there's<00:05:33.180> no<00:05:33.450> such

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
I that's how I play there's no such

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.680 
I that's how I play there's no such
thing<00:05:33.990> as<00:05:34.020> which<00:05:34.470> is<00:05:34.650> better<00:05:34.919> than<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.310> other

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
thing as which is better than the other

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.840 
thing as which is better than the other
generally<00:05:36.690> speaking<00:05:37.050> if<00:05:37.440> you<00:05:37.830> want<00:05:38.100> to<00:05:38.250> if<00:05:38.669> you

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
generally speaking if you want to if you

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.730 
generally speaking if you want to if you
want<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.180> do<00:05:39.360> real<00:05:39.750> real<00:05:40.050> fast<00:05:40.350> picking

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
want to do real real fast picking

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.430 
want to do real real fast picking
generally<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.940> pick<00:05:42.180> blocking<00:05:42.720> seems<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.320> be

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
generally the pick blocking seems to be

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.180 
generally the pick blocking seems to be
better<00:05:43.910> but<00:05:44.910> I<00:05:45.539> primarily<00:05:46.229> have<00:05:46.770> learned<00:05:47.010> this

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
better but I primarily have learned this

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.310 
better but I primarily have learned this
way<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.669> I<00:05:47.789> have<00:05:48.000> stuck<00:05:48.300> with<00:05:48.510> it<00:05:48.690> I<00:05:48.840> do<00:05:48.900> once

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
way and I have stuck with it I do once

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.560 
way and I have stuck with it I do once
in<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.530> while<00:05:49.710> dude<00:05:49.979> do<00:05:50.340> some<00:05:50.639> pick<00:05:50.880> blocking<00:05:51.360> on

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
in a while dude do some pick blocking on

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.420 
in a while dude do some pick blocking on
a<00:05:51.600> backward<00:05:52.229> roll<00:05:52.350> and<00:05:52.770> I'll<00:05:52.889> show<00:05:53.130> you<00:05:53.190> that

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
a backward roll and I'll show you that

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.120 
a backward roll and I'll show you that
in<00:05:53.610> another<00:05:53.760> lesson<00:05:54.470> but<00:05:55.470> anyway<00:05:55.889> that's

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
in another lesson but anyway that's

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.409 
in another lesson but anyway that's
where<00:05:56.460> we're<00:05:56.639> at<00:05:56.820> here<00:05:57.120> today<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:59.419> whether

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
where we're at here today and whether

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.930 
where we're at here today and whether
you<00:06:00.690> block<00:06:00.990> either<00:06:01.800> we'll<00:06:02.130> eat<00:06:02.280> one<00:06:02.729> of<00:06:02.760> them

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
you block either we'll eat one of them

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.520 
you block either we'll eat one of them
either<00:06:03.090> one<00:06:03.360> of<00:06:03.419> those<00:06:03.630> styles<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.229> really

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
either one of those styles it really

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.779 
either one of those styles it really
doesn't<00:06:04.860> make<00:06:04.979> any<00:06:05.039> difference<00:06:05.370> what<00:06:05.760> you
