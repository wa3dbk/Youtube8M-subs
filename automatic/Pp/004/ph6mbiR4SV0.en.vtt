 I want to show how in general 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 a lawyer working for the garbage that too general 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.039
 We look first to the player there 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.449
 on the thirteenth server you need aleppo 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.220
 forum after that or 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.539

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.990
 game hours you must work after 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.880
 What you have raised to 2 that is, 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.579
 the doctors 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.920
 when you have been promoted your work 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.040
 is just to climb on 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.620
 prisons and freeing up various kinds 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.120
 forbidden to change clothes on the second even 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.500
