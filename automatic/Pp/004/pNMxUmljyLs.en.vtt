came with some instructions some

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.430 
came with some instructions some
hardware

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.860 

so<00:02:55.440> let's<00:02:55.860> see<00:02:58.160> install<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.450> took<00:03:00.450> these<00:03:00.660> old

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
so let's see install this took these old

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.479 
so let's see install this took these old
washers<00:03:01.320> out<00:03:01.530> from<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.930> old<00:03:03.930> strut<00:03:04.489> because

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
washers out from the old strut because

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.600 
washers out from the old strut because
it's<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.970> usual<00:03:06.090> old<00:03:06.570> washes<00:03:07.610> we're

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
it's just the usual old washes we're

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.920 
it's just the usual old washes we're
going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.820> take<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.650> put<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.770> on<00:03:10.860> there

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
going to take that put it on there

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.820 
going to take that put it on there
use<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.959> slot<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.739> clip

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:27.870 

locked<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:17.670> up

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.090 

so<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:29.360> one<00:03:29.570> is<00:03:29.690> ready<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.020> go<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.800> start

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
so this one is ready to go and start

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.970 
so this one is ready to go and start
putting<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.430> in<00:03:32.320> start<00:03:33.320> with<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> one<00:03:33.800> that's

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
putting it in start with the one that's

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.640 
putting it in start with the one that's
attached<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.520> body<00:03:34.730> before<00:03:35.300> we<00:03:35.900> start<00:03:36.410> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
attached to the body before we start the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.640 
attached to the body before we start the
one<00:03:37.040> from<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.730> lift<00:03:37.880> gate<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:41.990> screw<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.530> and

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
one from the lift gate and screw it and

00:03:42.650 --> 00:04:16.750 
one from the lift gate and screw it and
it's<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.160> little<00:03:43.550> bit

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.730 

what<00:04:17.760> I'm<00:04:18.630> gonna<00:04:19.110> attach<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:20.570> one<00:04:21.590> where<00:04:22.590> is

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
what I'm gonna attach this one where is

00:04:22.740 --> 00:05:10.120 
what I'm gonna attach this one where is
it<00:04:23.450> right<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.560> patch<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:25.980> one<00:04:27.140> ready<00:04:28.140> to<00:04:28.230> go

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.140 

all<00:05:10.880> right<00:05:11.450> this<00:05:11.930> one<00:05:12.170> is<00:05:12.350> in<00:05:14.260> that<00:05:15.260> one<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.620> in

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
all right this one is in that one is in

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.720 
all right this one is in that one is in
so<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.240> just<00:05:17.420> basically<00:05:17.600> use<00:05:18.140> like<00:05:18.410> a

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
so you just basically use like a

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.180 
so you just basically use like a
flathead<00:05:19.730> screwdriver<00:05:23.230> and<00:05:24.230> you<00:05:24.680> lift<00:05:24.920> this<00:05:25.130> a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
flathead screwdriver and you lift this a

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.810 
flathead screwdriver and you lift this a
little<00:05:25.550> bit<00:05:25.670> to<00:05:26.860> open<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:27.980> and<00:05:28.160> you<00:05:28.310> push<00:05:28.520> it<00:05:28.550> in

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
little bit to open it and you push it in

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.350 
little bit to open it and you push it in
I<00:05:29.210> couldn't<00:05:29.990> do<00:05:30.080> that<00:05:30.260> with<00:05:30.970> holding<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.120> camera

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
I couldn't do that with holding a camera

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.770 
I couldn't do that with holding a camera
in<00:05:32.570> one<00:05:32.660> hand<00:05:32.720> and<00:05:34.180> trying<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.300> do<00:05:35.390> this<00:05:35.510> on<00:05:35.660> the

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
in one hand and trying to do this on the

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.270 
in one hand and trying to do this on the
other<00:05:35.900> but<00:05:36.170> basically<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.650> same<00:05:36.860> thing<00:05:37.100> for

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
other but basically the same thing for

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.540 
other but basically the same thing for
the<00:05:37.430> back<00:05:37.610> as<00:05:37.820> well<00:05:38.950> I'm<00:05:39.950> going<00:05:40.160> to<00:05:40.190> do<00:05:40.370> that

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
the back as well I'm going to do that

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.130

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349
