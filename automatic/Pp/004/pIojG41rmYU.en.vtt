hi I'm Thomas chase Jones and today I'm
going<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.069> talk<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.600> dominant<00:00:06.600> ninth

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
going to talk about dominant ninth

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.200 
going to talk about dominant ninth
chords<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:08.210> dominant<00:00:09.210> ninth<00:00:09.360> chords<00:00:09.870> are

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
chords and dominant ninth chords are

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.060 
chords and dominant ninth chords are
what<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.480> call<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.960> second<00:00:13.320> octave<00:00:13.650> structure

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
what we call a second octave structure

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.010 
what we call a second octave structure
I'm<00:00:14.490> not<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> make<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.240> complicated<00:00:15.599> but

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
I'm not going to make it complicated but

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.980 
I'm not going to make it complicated but
there's<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> complete<00:00:18.119> dominant<00:00:18.840> 9th

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
there's to have a complete dominant 9th

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.429 
there's to have a complete dominant 9th
chord<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.070> four<00:00:20.609> notes<00:00:20.900> not<00:00:21.900> including

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
chord you have four notes not including

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.980 
chord you have four notes not including
the<00:00:22.560> root<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:23.490> I'm<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.119> that's<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.810> root

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the root so if I'm in a that's the root

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.710 
the root so if I'm in a that's the root
I<00:00:25.460> have<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.519> three<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.949> five<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.460> minus<00:00:30.000> seven<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
I have a three a five a minus seven and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.010 
I have a three a five a minus seven and
a<00:00:30.929> nine<00:00:31.189> so<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> guitar<00:00:33.930> it's

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
a nine so and on the guitar it's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.560 
a nine so and on the guitar it's
complicated<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.910> voicings<00:00:36.360> get

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
complicated because it the voicings get

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.040 
complicated because it the voicings get
broken<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.260> here's<00:00:38.120> I'm<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.450> here's<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
broken up so here's I'm in a here's the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
broken up so here's I'm in a here's the
three<00:00:40.410> that's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.309> c-sharp<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> G<00:00:43.730> okay

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
three that's a c-sharp then a G okay

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.080 
three that's a c-sharp then a G okay
that's<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.300> minus<00:00:45.690> seven<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> nine<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that's the minus seven then the nine is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.479 
that's the minus seven then the nine is
a<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> B<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:50.460> an<00:00:50.670> E<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> five

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
a is a B and then an E is the five

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.450 
a is a B and then an E is the five
that's<00:00:53.489> called<00:00:53.760> an<00:00:53.910> open<00:00:54.149> voicing<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.559> we

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that's called an open voicing because we

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.630 
that's called an open voicing because we
go<00:00:56.610> from<00:00:56.789> three<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.440> minus<00:00:59.129> seven<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
go from three to the minus seven it

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.900 
go from three to the minus seven it
doesn't<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.059> three<00:01:00.390> five<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:02.280> goes<00:01:02.520> three

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
doesn't go three five it goes three

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.840 
doesn't go three five it goes three
minus<00:01:03.359> seven<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.920> natural<00:01:05.250> order<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
minus seven and so the natural order of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.300 
minus seven and so the natural order of
a<00:01:05.939> 9th<00:01:06.119> chord<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> three<00:01:06.780> five<00:01:07.380> minus<00:01:08.159> seven

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
a 9th chord is three five minus seven

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
a 9th chord is three five minus seven
nine<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> order<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.840> would

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
nine it's the order that they would

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
nine it's the order that they would
appear<00:01:10.310> guitar<00:01:11.310> takes<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.970> those<00:01:12.090> notes

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
appear guitar takes one of those notes

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
appear guitar takes one of those notes
and<00:01:12.479> throws<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.260> octave<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:13.979> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
and throws it up an octave and so you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.350 
and throws it up an octave and so you
end<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.560> nice<00:01:16.759> open<00:01:17.759> sound<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.299> is

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
end up with a a nice open sound this is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
end up with a a nice open sound this is
the<00:01:18.509> same<00:01:18.840> sound<00:01:19.170> by<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.040> way<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> same

for<00:02:39.730> notes<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.269> hard<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.599> grab<00:02:40.840> going<00:02:41.590> back

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
for notes it's hard to grab going back

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.920 
for notes it's hard to grab going back
and<00:02:41.980> forth<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.160> trick<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.510> take<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
and forth so the trick is you take the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.380 
and forth so the trick is you take the
chord<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:48.430> drop<00:02:48.670> one<00:02:48.879> of<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.060> notes<00:02:49.239> out
