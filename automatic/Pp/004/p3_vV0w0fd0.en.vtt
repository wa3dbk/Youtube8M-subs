00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 welcome once again to the videos of 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.690
 river this time we have the five best 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.280
 skyrim mods in my opinion this time 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.110
 we are going to focus on motorcycles that are 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 100% friendly with the skyrim environment 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.889
 that do not change the appearance of the game 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.980
 that does not change the appearance of weapons 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.720
 armor are simply mods that all 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.939
 world should have to enjoy a lot 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.590
 more the game we do not lose more time and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.590
 let's go with the number five 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.619
 road for life sports art moore what 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.540
 that fabulous is karim is the great 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.400
 number of missions they have but if 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.020
 the npc die they can not give you 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.630
 missions but that would not be a problem 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.100
 if it were not because they love to be 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.860
 the heroes when a dragon attacks his 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.470
 body but for that is breaking life 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.449
 npc that do not have weapons will run 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.879
 as ladybugs to their homes or outside the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.020
 town until the attack ends like this 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.420
 they will prevent you from losing the opportunity 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.420
 to start or finish a mission 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.290
 joe louis alternative menu by 263 from 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.180
 the hangar the new expansion of skyrim 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.040
 it is already possible to change the appearance of 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.480
 your character in the robbers' guild 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.220
 but this still has many 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.470
 limitations does not work with vampires 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.240
 werewolves and only that he killed 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.130
 appearance does not change your race if you are 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.500
 like me and you want to try each element 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.110
 of skyrim or do you like to download races 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.090
 Customized you probably do not want 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.520
 Start the game again or change your 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.740
 race with commands if you do this what 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.930
 will happen is that your skills and your 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.940
 attributes are going to be redistributed and 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.710
 nobody wants that this mode is added a 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.810
 power that allows you to change your race 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.550
 auto appearance at any time and 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.750
 that any race and any 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.790
 appearance that you want can be 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.130
 from small adjustments to a change 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.509
 complete that does have a defect that is 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.520
 that can cause some crash is 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.530
 because it's a bit heavy so I 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.479
 I recommend using it in places that are 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.140
 little young to be that way 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.140
 less load 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.020
 skyrim performance in crash prevention 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.090
 of drag with 1.122 of this world there are 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.070
 so much to show them not everyone knows 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.200
 that skyrim is a very heavy game for 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.120
 almost any machine with this mode of 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.920
 Video memory empties every 10 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.980
 minutes the data is removed 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.660
 unnecessary so performance is increased 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.670
 and frames per second 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.340
 this way you can play a game a 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.990
 little more agile a little less worked 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.000
 suddenly you're going to need some other 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.980
 mods to also improve the end by 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.270
 second but this maybe is the best of 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.340
 all because it also prevents your 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.510
 game will fall its only flaw maybe 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.480
 is to have to be careful that 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.110
 always remain at the end of the load but 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.110
 that's all 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.510
 skyrim monster mode doc town 1 this one 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.879
 It's one of my favorite bikes because 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.650
 if any fault has skyrim is that its 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.750
 variety of enemies and the amount of 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.819
 encounters could be better is that 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.920
 no mod being adds several hundred 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.870
 new monsters scattered all over the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.180
 map you can face from taps 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.890
 dinosaurs following versions of 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.599
 other monsters and more of some surprise 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.790
 out there but if for example the 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.530
 dinosaurs look too much the way 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.790
 it's completely customizable you can 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.470
 put that monsters you want that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.690
 monsters not or where more or less 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.760
 they can be if we try a bit of 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.380
 time to the configuration also adds 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.790
 some new weapons that you're going to have to 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.340
 tear him out of the hands of these 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.840
 monsters and certain very difficult drops 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.459
 of obtaining will be available in 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.230
 the new meetings for example the 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.209
 hearts of the hedra are already a little 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.670
 easier to get not much but 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.170
 if they are easier really this is one 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.709
 of the mods that improve the most 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.780
 experience since we say has never been 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.269
 easy for skyrim players 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.370
 fight against the same drivers one and 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.370
 again highly recommended 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.540
 skyrim freedom fighters this mod is without 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.280
 place to doubts without fear of being mistaken 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.349
 greater work in improving 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.730
 game experiences in skyrim the 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.040
 improvements are many are very 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.560
 interesting first of all the level 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.500
 maximum increases to 160 and the 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.269
 skills exceed 120 the pace of 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.579
 growth is to say how fast that 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.169
 if your character is also faster 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.489
 but do not for that reason think that the 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.199
 game is going to be easy 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.570
 the enemies are going to grow with you equal 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.030
 of fast and the damage is recalculated to 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.919
 make the game much more challenging 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.280
 also the fight mode will change 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.770
 the constellations is to say the mode of 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.830
 the perks is also now wider and 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.570
 is much better organized for example 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.030
 opening locks and stealing pockets 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.310
 now in the same constellation that 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.470
 is simply stealing the skill of 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.229
 shout now is integrated to that of 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.789
 eloquence and in this way every time 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.740
 you scream you get experience from 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.570
 eloquence and there are new pÃ©rez that 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.370
 let your screams be more 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.350
 powerful ones that take less between 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.110
 scream and scream and many other things that 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.450
 I mean do not ruin them are enough 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.150
 good also adds a new 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.220
 constellation who adds effects to the 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.570
 food you are not going to simply sell 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.030
 all the tomatoes that you are in 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.530
 the barrels now yes you use the 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.690
 pellets of the new constellation that is 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.110
 the constellation of explorer is 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.700
 food is going to have fabulous effects 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.020
 the more you upload better effects 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.670
 they will have and you will also be able to 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.260
 put effects on meat and others 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.990
 many ingredients as well 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.460
 Resistance to cold poison and other 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.040
 things very necessary to be in 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.730
 skyrim the truth is that improving the 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.100
 experience with this mod is very superior 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.740
 to which there may be other modes 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.720
 makes the game much more fun 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.960
 increases its value to continue 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.490
 playing more than replayability and if the 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.220
 game seems too fast 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.840
 difficult is an experience 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.390
 customizable is made up of 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.590
 several mods integrated into one that 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.600
 you can install or uninstall 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.480
 as you go wanting without 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.250
 too much trouble that's the only 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.080
 The defect that it has is that it conflicts with 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.670
 a lot of mods but 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.770
 fortunately that without any of those 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.680
 modes does not have a patch that does 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.479
 to support it really worth it and 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.540
 even sometimes it is better to remove a mode 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.550
 or two to keep this one 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.380
 and well this was all if there is a video 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.690
 more skyrim the version to see I will give you my 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.490
 favorite bikes that greatly alter the 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.890
 game those that have to do with the 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.720
 appearance with the textures and with 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.250
 Some other tidbits we see us 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.520
 once and many thanks to all those who 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.520
 they see us
