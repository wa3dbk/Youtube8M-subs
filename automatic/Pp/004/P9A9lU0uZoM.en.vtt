speed is feeling pretty good actually

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.130 
speed is feeling pretty good actually
the<00:00:35.610> weights<00:00:35.850> felt<00:00:36.120> incredibly<00:00:36.690> fast<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.020> can

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
of moving up a little bit higher than

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.830 
of moving up a little bit higher than
lockout<00:00:40.800> position<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.540> decide<00:00:42.810> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
lockout position on these so I decide to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.389 
lockout position on these so I decide to
play<00:00:43.079> around<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.470> this<00:00:43.649> afterwards<00:00:44.190> you'll

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
see and basically see how high I could

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.959 
see and basically see how high I could
pull<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.859> overall<00:00:49.859> that<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.640> just

the<00:01:28.049> intensity<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> volume<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:30.030> at

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the intensity and the volume are at

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.480 
the intensity and the volume are at
least<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.869> intensity<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.190> wasn't

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
least the intensity so there wasn't

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.770 
least the intensity so there wasn't
really<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:32.789> of<00:01:33.060> heavy<00:01:33.180> lifting<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
weights light I was more of a cardio

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
weights light I was more of a cardio
session<00:01:39.780> than<00:01:39.930> anything<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:43.049> I'm

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
showing you basically using a landmine

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.809 
showing you basically using a landmine
press<00:01:45.929> with<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.289> addition<00:01:46.679> of<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.860> band<00:01:47.130> makes

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
press with the addition of a band makes

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.590 
press with the addition of a band makes
it<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.360> hard<00:01:48.600> towards<00:01:48.929> lockout<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
it really hard towards lockout and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.940 
it really hard towards lockout and
continues<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> work<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.899> stabilizers<00:01:52.649> even

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
continues to work the stabilizers even

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.230 
continues to work the stabilizers even
more<00:01:53.300> than<00:01:54.380> traditional<00:01:55.380> landline<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.240> really

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
more than traditional landline so really

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.309 
more than traditional landline so really
enjoy<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.569> I'm<00:01:57.690> gonna<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.899> working<00:01:58.050> this
