00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.249 
I don't see why not you know even though
two<00:01:42.759> opponents<00:01:43.240> have<00:01:43.569> called<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.079> there's

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
two opponents have called and there's

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.199 
two opponents have called and there's
multiple<00:01:44.979> draws<00:01:45.189> that<00:01:45.340> they<00:01:45.490> could<00:01:45.789> have<00:01:46.029> on

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.989 
multiple draws that they could have on
this<00:01:46.389> board<00:01:46.719> I<00:01:47.340> might<00:01:48.340> bite<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.549> little<00:01:48.639> less

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
this board I might bite a little less

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.169 
this board I might bite a little less
than<00:01:49.209> this<00:01:49.359> however<00:01:50.169> I<00:01:50.439> think<00:01:50.709> you<00:01:50.799> can

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
than this however I think you can

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.879 
than this however I think you can
achieve<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.630> same<00:01:52.899> thing<00:01:53.229> with<00:01:53.380> us<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.740> yet

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
achieve the same thing with us and yet

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
weak point if I if I'm Roger because I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.380 
weak point if I if I'm Roger because I
usually<00:02:37.830> know<00:02:37.950> I'm<00:02:38.100> beat<00:02:38.280> here<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:39.180> I'm

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
usually know I'm beat here and I'm

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.510 
usually know I'm beat here and I'm
usually<00:02:39.720> still<00:02:40.140> just<00:02:40.320> calling<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:41.280> I'm<00:02:41.400> an

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
usually still just calling if I'm an

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.729 
usually still just calling if I'm an
idiot<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:42.989> hard<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.410> think<00:02:43.590> for<00:02:43.709> a

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
idiot and it's hard for I think for a

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.040 
idiot and it's hard for I think for a
lot<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.950> players<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.730> know<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.660> tends<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> be

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
lot of players you know it tends to be

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.110 
lot of players you know it tends to be
good<00:02:46.350> i<00:02:46.380> got<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.770> over<00:02:47.010> pair<00:02:47.280> are<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.850> too

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
good i got the over pair are you too

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.960 
good i got the over pair are you too
lazy<00:02:48.360> even<00:02:49.010> though<00:02:50.010> there's<00:02:50.190> two<00:02:50.310> players<00:02:50.610> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
lazy even though there's two players it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.970 
lazy even though there's two players it
seemed<00:02:51.209> pretty<00:02:51.360> happy<00:02:51.570> right<00:02:51.750> now<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.860> know

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
seemed pretty happy right now you know

that's<00:02:53.160> my<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:53.430> weak<00:02:53.640> point<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.450> know<00:02:54.480> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
that's my one weak point I you know I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.210 
that's my one weak point I you know I

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
think about it I know I'm beat and then
