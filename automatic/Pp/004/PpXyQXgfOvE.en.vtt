00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello people with chekov energy and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.210
 today i'll show you how to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:17.400
 riffle shuffle the shuffle is a whole 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:20.520
 good way to make the tarts so generous and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.670
 it's fast and shuffle the cards 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 many many times better than this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.039
 what you do is just dachshund time 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.179
 back and forth just do the riffle 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.179
 shuffle is just really good 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.010
 to start with, you have one with a card 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.050
 need as logical to start what i am 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.629
 usually do messi if they do the race or me 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.360
 tried to do so grab some beer 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.940
 make two piles try them on like this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.309
 to hold on to each other and then they grab 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.359
 supposedly it doesn't go that simple 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:06.900
 and then when they put it together and then 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:09.659
 twice the kind of stuff that's real 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.210
 completely wrong 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.130
 it can be many many times faster and well 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.500
 yes slightly harder but if you like it 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.150
 once chance really really is in anyway 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.130
 ahoy hand on your deck in your left hand 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.159
 so you should prefer the way you are on the right 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.650
 like nothing with a sits at the perfect me 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.579
 got stuck with two fingers under the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.100
 thumb above your index finger here so because 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.369
 then press on through your index finger 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 push new and forward 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.350
 about half of it 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.340
 river along with your thumb then grab 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.920
 grab you like that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.500
 that half that you broke down you need 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.860
 if you do exactly the same to 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.869
 all sides vérité fingers now we will 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.380
 here to other fingers not to be with 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.630
 lady was your the packages also fixed then 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.189
 you grab it with your hands land in you 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.250
 finger does exactly it itself also puts 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.289
 she does 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.819
 the fit on the table 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.240
 so in this position you have it underneath 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.180
 stuck with your fingers like that sir 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.030
 this position are you go 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.890
 pushing text zone inside but you have to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.489
 hold your thumb up well and give good pressure 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.300
 that they do not lose weight go cards 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.680
 you slowly 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.709
 when you are done that you are alright 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.660
 sit and your first to center 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.400
 you go slowly you go you let go 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.989
 can slowly go out of your hands and whatever 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.269
 is actually the riffle shuffle 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:45.790
 so you do so nicely no hand turns so 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.540
 the deck under other side of jelle 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:55.120
 other hand so stuck already when positions 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 and live in a by or have your lid 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:03.040
 grasp it with your fingers 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.550
 do the riffle shuffle so that's it 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.380
 actually 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:11.019
 Well a few tips you yourself would 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.049
 keep a thumb on it so then they are 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.730
 suddenly apart does not look nice 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.280
 also a bit bad for the cards 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.579
 if you do that but just fine 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.579
 clearly 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.800
 that's it the riffle shuffle you can 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.650
 imagination just use game 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.660
 are playing or if you are used to 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.770
 also i want to check a lot of project dear 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.760
 clover coats 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.280
 it's handy but ask teacher yes 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.680
 some needles quickly that some people 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.750
 it gets a little suspicious 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.130
 because this thinks you have red cards 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.130
 so phrases can already remember 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.100
 I said people can do this I can do it myself 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.660
 not but yes it is clean 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.400
 you will see the map so if you are real 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.550
 very officially the games then I would like this 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.870
 they do not I would do it otherwise 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:15.010
 just shake it like that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.230
 yes this was how venice people i hope 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.209
 you found this tutorial useful if you are still 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.010
 a few ambiguities the walls 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.010
