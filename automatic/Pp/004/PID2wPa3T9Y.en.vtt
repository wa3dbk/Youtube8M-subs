00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
entire car jacked up cuz they do not

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.950 
entire car jacked up cuz they do not
have<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> car<00:00:40.800> stand<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:42.570> you've<00:00:42.690> seen<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
have a car stand and if you've seen the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.279 
have a car stand and if you've seen the
prices<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.620> them<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.309> why

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
prices for them you know why

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.190 
prices for them you know why
well<00:00:46.289> yeah<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.980> super<00:00:47.489> loud<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.360> sounds<00:00:48.899> good

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
well yeah it's super loud it sounds good

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.990 
well yeah it's super loud it sounds good
but<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:50.399> problem<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:52.789> there's<00:00:53.789> no

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
but one problem is because there's no

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.709 
but one problem is because there's no
catalytic<00:00:54.570> converter<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:56.039> rasp

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
catalytic converter it has a not rasp

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.119 
catalytic converter it has a not rasp
but<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> sounds<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.859> air

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
but it sounds like there's like air

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.090 
but it sounds like there's like air
escaping<00:00:59.609> but<00:01:00.410> through<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> mean<00:01:01.800> sorry

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
escaping but through that I mean sorry

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.860 
escaping but through that I mean sorry
it<00:01:02.640> sounds<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.120> there's<00:01:03.300> air<00:01:03.480> escaping

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it sounds like there's air escaping

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.460 
it sounds like there's air escaping
through<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> rear<00:01:04.890> section<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> exhaust

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
through the rear section of the exhaust

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.679 
through the rear section of the exhaust
which<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> normal<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.450> really

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
which is normal because if you it really

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
which is normal because if you it really
any<00:01:09.960> mid<00:01:10.170> pipe<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> pseudo

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
any mid pipe it's not just the pseudo

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.719 
any mid pipe it's not just the pseudo
cuz<00:01:11.640> I've<00:01:11.790> heard<00:01:12.710> Megan<00:01:13.710> mid<00:01:13.890> pipes<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.580> stuff

additions Oh
stubby<00:03:07.500> antenna<00:03:10.370> mmm<00:03:11.510> looks<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.600> lot<00:03:12.750> cleaner

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
stubby antenna mmm looks a lot cleaner

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.870 
stubby antenna mmm looks a lot cleaner
than<00:03:13.140> it's<00:03:13.410> talking<00:03:13.770> tonight<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.580> my

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
than it's talking tonight just in my

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.050 
than it's talking tonight just in my
opinion<00:03:15.300> but<00:03:15.600> yeah<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.980> about<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:20.060> will

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
opinion but yeah it's about it I will

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.700 
opinion but yeah it's about it I will

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
probably take it to an exhaust shop

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.430 
probably take it to an exhaust shop
eventually<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:24.050> either<00:03:25.050> put<00:03:25.230> another

eventually and either put another

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.860 
eventually and either put another
resonator<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.570> or<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:29.270> don't<00:03:30.270> know<00:03:30.390> I'm<00:03:30.750> gonna

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
resonator in or I don't know I'm gonna

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.050 
resonator in or I don't know I'm gonna
I'll<00:03:31.380> talk<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.650> him<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.100> if<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.760> all<00:03:32.850> know
