Hello and welcome to Archana's Rasoi. Today, I'll show you how to make crispy onion pakoras!

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:18.112
If you are wondering how to make the pakoras crisp and spicy, like they serve in dhabas, restaurants or tea stalls, stay tuned to Archana's Rasoi!  

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:35.920
Let's look at the ingredients to make one plate onion pakoras- the quantity you'll get if you order these at a restaurant! 

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:45.369
2 onions sliced lengthwise, Chickpea flour as per requirement. Coriander according to taste, 1 tbsp mix masala...

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:49.409
Salt to taste, a pinch of hing (asafoetida) and oil to fry

00:00:51.709 --> 00:01:01.025
Let's start making onion pakoras. First, we mix the ingredients with the flour. Up first, and importantly, heat the oil to make the crisps quickly.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:32.554
In a bowl, start with the onions, 1 tsp red chilli powder, 3/4 tsp hing (asafoetida). Next, add salt according to taste &amp;amp; chickpea flour as per requirement.

00:01:36.517 --> 00:01:37.938
Start with just a little flour and add more, if there is a need.

00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:41.960
Add coriander to taste. 

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:54.430
We're not adding any water to this mix, the juices from the onion will be enough to mix the dough. No water will make the pakoras crisp. This is my first tip today.

00:01:56.136 --> 00:02:02.190
Mash the onions properly to get the mix 

00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:21.980
The oil is how enough now to fry the pakoras. Remember, we're using only the juices from 
 the onion for the mix, no water. This will make the pakoras crisp!  

00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:32.480
Usually, we'd use water to mix the chickpeas, onions, etc. Then, the pakoras will be like smaller fries, like the moong-dal wada!

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.040
Now, we'll have the crispy pakoras. While making pakoras, always keep the oil on a high flame and reduce heat as they fry.

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:55.680
Our pakoras are now ready! They are a beautiful red... Let's take them off the wok. 
Look, they look like professionally made pakoras! You can see the onions, it looks crisp!

00:03:07.013 --> 00:03:15.710
Onion pakoras are ready! Crisp, a beautiful red and you can see the onions too! Perfect for winters that are almost here! 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:29.430
