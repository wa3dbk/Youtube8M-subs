through<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.220> hole<00:02:54.450> hold<00:02:55.450> on<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> end<00:02:55.989> loop

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
through the hole hold on to the end loop

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.390 
through the hole hold on to the end loop
it<00:02:57.130> through<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:02.799> how<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.130> final

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
it through and this is how the final

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.240 
it through and this is how the final
product<00:03:03.790> should<00:03:04.060> look<00:03:04.410> next<00:03:05.410> find<00:03:05.769> some<00:03:06.010> beads

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
product should look next find some beads

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.220 
product should look next find some beads
that<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.730> want<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.120> use<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.780> your<00:03:07.810> bracelet

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
that you want to use for your bracelet

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.680 
that you want to use for your bracelet
so<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.650> chose<00:03:08.950> these<00:03:09.250> ones<00:03:09.609> get<00:03:10.209> big<00:03:10.510> tail

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
so I chose these ones get big tail

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.650 
so I chose these ones get big tail

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
actually had these since elementary

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.580 
actually had these since elementary
school<00:03:15.639> so<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.269> didn't<00:03:16.690> buy<00:03:16.840> them<00:03:17.079> but<00:03:17.440> I'm

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.629 
school so I didn't buy them but I'm
pretty<00:03:17.799> sure<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:17.980> got<00:03:18.160> them<00:03:18.280> at<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.459> dollar

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
pretty sure I got them at the dollar

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.849 
pretty sure I got them at the dollar
store<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.750> grabbed<00:03:20.049> my<00:03:20.200> needle<00:03:20.590> with<00:03:20.709> my

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
store so I grabbed my needle with my

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.979 
store so I grabbed my needle with my
thread<00:03:21.310> attached<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:21.910> already<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.540> I'm

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
thread attached to it already and I'm

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.949 
thread attached to it already and I'm
going<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.380> hook<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.190> through<00:03:24.609> the<00:03:25.120> end<00:03:25.359> of<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
going to hook it through the end of the

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.240 
going to hook it through the end of the
back<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.590> bracelet<00:03:26.950> so

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
back of the bracelet so

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.339 
back of the bracelet so
until<00:03:30.250> its<00:03:30.400> end<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.180> we're<00:03:31.720> going<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:32.080> do<00:03:32.200> it

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
until its end and we're going to do it

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.699 
until its end and we're going to do it
on<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.739> same<00:03:33.040> spot<00:03:33.489> or<00:03:34.000> about<00:03:34.390> one<00:03:34.810> millimeter

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
on the same spot or about one millimeter

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:45.589 
on the same spot or about one millimeter
or<00:03:36.640> from<00:03:36.760> each<00:03:36.819> other<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.470> make<00:03:38.470> into<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:38.830> knot

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.280 

I<00:03:45.629> learned<00:03:46.439> in<00:03:46.799> high<00:03:47.310> school<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:48.209> by<00:03:48.599> putting

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
I learned in high school that by putting

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.739 
I learned in high school that by putting
the<00:03:50.099> needle<00:03:50.370> through<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.609> same<00:03:50.909> spot<00:03:51.299> three

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:51.749 
the needle through the same spot three

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.030 
the needle through the same spot three
times<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.379> actually<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.799> one<00:03:52.889> of<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
times is actually the one of the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.610 
times is actually the one of the
toughest<00:03:53.340> types<00:03:53.969> of<00:03:54.090> knots<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:54.569> that<00:03:54.780> your

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
toughest types of knots so that your

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.580 
toughest types of knots so that your
thread<00:03:55.799> isn't<00:03:55.950> converge<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:57.439> thought<00:03:58.439> I<00:03:58.469> was

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
thread isn't converge I thought I was

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.869 
thread isn't converge I thought I was
pretty<00:03:58.799> cool

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.319 

all<00:04:02.879> right<00:04:03.030> nuts<00:04:03.450> nice<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.079> sturdy<00:04:04.909> now<00:04:05.909> grab

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
all right nuts nice and sturdy now grab

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:16.360 
all right nuts nice and sturdy now grab
a<00:04:06.599> bead<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:10.200> put<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.590> through<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.859> hole

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.170 

and<00:04:16.910> then<00:04:17.180> you're<00:04:17.359> going<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.980> put<00:04:18.980> this<00:04:19.549> needle

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
and then you're going to put this needle

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.650 
and then you're going to put this needle
through<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:21.079> of<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.709> chains<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:22.340> right<00:04:22.550> there

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
through one of the chains so right there

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.540 
through one of the chains so right there
you<00:04:23.810> can't<00:04:24.080> really<00:04:24.230> tell<00:04:24.470> but<00:04:24.710> as<00:04:24.889> long<00:04:25.520> as

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
you can't really tell but as long as

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.909 
you can't really tell but as long as
Ahmet<00:04:26.210> Racal<00:04:26.570> throughout<00:04:27.229> your<00:04:27.350> bracelet<00:04:27.830> it

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
Ahmet Racal throughout your bracelet it

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.930 
Ahmet Racal throughout your bracelet it
doesn't<00:04:28.160> really<00:04:28.250> matter<00:04:28.460> where<00:04:28.729> you<00:04:28.820> put<00:04:28.970> it

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
doesn't really matter where you put it

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.000 
doesn't really matter where you put it
and<00:04:31.940> a<00:04:32.150> lot<00:04:32.389> of<00:04:32.510> times<00:04:32.810> if<00:04:33.139> I<00:04:33.260> feel<00:04:33.500> like<00:04:33.530> my

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
and a lot of times if I feel like my

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.680 
and a lot of times if I feel like my
thread<00:04:34.430> is<00:04:34.520> not<00:04:34.550> very<00:04:34.850> good<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.060> just<00:04:35.360> do<00:04:35.570> it

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
thread is not very good I just do it

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.520 
thread is not very good I just do it
twice<00:04:36.500> I'll<00:04:36.830> go<00:04:36.949> through<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.130> back

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
twice I'll go through the back

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.390 
twice I'll go through the back
he'll<00:04:39.530> go<00:04:40.460> through<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.729> back<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:42.370> poke<00:04:43.370> it

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
he'll go through the back and poke it

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.350 
he'll go through the back and poke it
through<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.729> hole<00:04:43.820> again<00:04:44.330> of<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:44.720> bead<00:04:44.930> and

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
through the hole again of the bead and

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.800 
through the hole again of the bead and
into<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.900> bracelet<00:04:51.790> yep<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.510> what<00:04:53.630> you're

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
into the bracelet yep so what you're

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.030 
into the bracelet yep so what you're
going<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:53.990> do<00:04:54.169> you're<00:04:54.380> going<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.560> do<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.770> same

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
going to do you're going to do the same

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.909 
going to do you're going to do the same
steps<00:04:55.370> through<00:04:56.060> each<00:04:56.360> chain<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:57.139> you<00:04:57.740> don't

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
steps through each chain so you don't

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.950 
steps through each chain so you don't
know<00:04:58.010> what<00:04:58.160> each<00:04:58.520> chain<00:04:58.940> is<00:04:59.150> it's<00:04:59.419> basically

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
know what each chain is it's basically

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.870 
know what each chain is it's basically
this<00:05:00.229> little<00:05:00.440> section<00:05:00.710> right<00:05:00.889> there<00:05:00.979> sit

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
this little section right there sit

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.650 
this little section right there sit
there<00:05:02.150> there<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.530> then<00:05:04.130> keeps<00:05:04.610> going<00:05:04.700> on

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
there there and then keeps going on

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.830 
there there and then keeps going on
I<00:05:05.690> put<00:05:06.350> mine<00:05:06.500> through<00:05:06.740> though<00:05:06.889> kind<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.639> like<00:05:07.840> I

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
I put mine through though kind of like I

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.070 
I put mine through though kind of like I
guess<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.380> can<00:05:09.500> see<00:05:09.770> in<00:05:10.580> between<00:05:11.210> two<00:05:11.780> chains

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
guess you can see in between two chains

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.840 
guess you can see in between two chains
it<00:05:12.560> doesn't<00:05:12.889> really<00:05:13.010> matter<00:05:13.280> though<00:05:13.580> it's<00:05:13.760> up

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
it doesn't really matter though it's up

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:21.450 
it doesn't really matter though it's up
to<00:05:14.000> you

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.070 

so<00:05:22.460> this<00:05:22.640> is<00:05:22.790> how<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.030> final<00:05:23.240> product<00:05:23.690> looks

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
so this is how the final product looks

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.700 
so this is how the final product looks
like

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
like

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.580 
like
so<00:05:25.580> on<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:26.000> back<00:05:26.330> if<00:05:26.780> you<00:05:26.840> flip<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.140> over<00:05:27.290> you

so on the back if you flip it over you

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.160 
so on the back if you flip it over you
can<00:05:27.620> tie<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:28.070> knot<00:05:28.430> do<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.880> three<00:05:29.270> knots<00:05:29.840> I

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
can tie a knot do the three knots I

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:37.000 
can tie a knot do the three knots I
mentioned<00:05:30.830> earlier<00:05:31.190> at<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.370> beginning<00:05:36.010> two

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
mentioned earlier at the beginning two

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.070 
mentioned earlier at the beginning two
and<00:05:38.500> three<00:05:40.030> and<00:05:41.030> sometimes<00:05:41.480> I<00:05:41.600> like<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.780> leave

and three and sometimes I like to leave

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.710 
and three and sometimes I like to leave
it<00:05:42.110> through<00:05:42.440> another<00:05:43.010> one<00:05:43.340> just<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.940> capture

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
it through another one just to capture

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.210 
it through another one just to capture
the<00:05:45.020> loose<00:05:45.260> end<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:46.150> we're<00:05:47.150> going<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:47.300> cut<00:05:47.480> off

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:06:01.810 

and<00:05:52.270> now<00:05:53.270> you're<00:05:53.420> done<00:05:53.630> eh<00:06:00.520> now<00:06:01.520> we're<00:06:01.670> onto

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
and now you're done eh now we're onto

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.550 
and now you're done eh now we're onto
our<00:06:01.970> last<00:06:02.180> one<00:06:02.420> so<00:06:02.900> this<00:06:03.110> one's<00:06:03.290> really<00:06:03.440> easy

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
our last one so this one's really easy

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.760 
our last one so this one's really easy
it's<00:06:04.100> basically<00:06:04.670> just<00:06:04.910> three<00:06:05.480> chains<00:06:05.900> braid

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
it's basically just three chains braid

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.940 
it's basically just three chains braid
it<00:06:06.920> into<00:06:07.190> one<00:06:07.930> so<00:06:08.930> I'm<00:06:09.320> just<00:06:09.380> going<00:06:09.680> to<00:06:09.740> skip

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
it into one so I'm just going to skip

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.730 
it into one so I'm just going to skip
onto<00:06:10.510> making<00:06:11.510> three<00:06:11.990> chains<00:06:12.230> because<00:06:12.590> you

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
onto making three chains because you

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
onto making three chains because you
already<00:06:12.830> know<00:06:12.980> how<00:06:13.220> to<00:06:13.250> do<00:06:13.370> that

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
already know how to do that

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.540 
already know how to do that
here<00:06:14.420> are<00:06:14.600> my<00:06:14.720> finished<00:06:15.110> three<00:06:15.770> chains<00:06:16.220> and

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
here are my finished three chains and

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.910 
here are my finished three chains and
I'm<00:06:16.880> going<00:06:17.270> to<00:06:17.420> tie<00:06:17.630> them<00:06:17.870> into<00:06:18.050> a<00:06:18.260> knot<00:06:18.350> all

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
I'm going to tie them into a knot all

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:29.890 
I'm going to tie them into a knot all
together<00:06:19.450> so<00:06:20.450> like<00:06:20.600> this

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.640 

like<00:06:30.470> that<00:06:31.090> now<00:06:32.090> you're<00:06:32.270> going<00:06:32.330> to<00:06:33.110> put<00:06:33.380> it<00:06:33.500> on

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
like that now you're going to put it on

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.940 
like that now you're going to put it on
