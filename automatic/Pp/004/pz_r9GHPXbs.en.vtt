00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
not really no and see she didn't like

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
not really no and see she didn't like
brushing<00:00:54.989> her<00:00:55.110> hair<00:00:55.140> before<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:56.010> she<00:00:56.129> had

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
brushing her hair before because she had

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.920 
brushing her hair before because she had
gotten<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.579> many<00:00:56.670> knots<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.270> tangles<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and once you have the knots and tangles

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.240 
and once you have the knots and tangles
then<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> hurts<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.079> brush<00:01:01.289> them<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.190> you

there's some kind of a coating on the
bristles<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.610> enough<00:01:29.880> brushing<00:01:30.479> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
bristles and with enough brushing that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380 
bristles and with enough brushing that
gets<00:01:31.290> worn<00:01:32.070> off<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:32.909> you're<00:01:33.180> back<00:01:33.329> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
gets worn off and then you're back to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
gets worn off and then you're back to
having<00:01:33.570> more<00:01:33.990> or<00:01:34.079> less<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> regular<00:01:34.740> brush<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
having more or less a regular brush I

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
having more or less a regular brush I
thought<00:01:35.640> nastiness<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.450> had<00:01:36.780> thought<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
thought nastiness I had thought the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
thought nastiness I had thought the
secret<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.100> these<00:01:38.369> uneven<00:01:39.210> bristles

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
secret to it was these uneven bristles

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
secret to it was these uneven bristles
in<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> placement<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:40.829> i'm<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.100> sure<00:01:41.159> i

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
in the placement but i'm not sure i

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
in the placement but i'm not sure i
think<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.939> coating<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> bristles<00:01:43.049> may

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
think the coating on the bristles may

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.080 
think the coating on the bristles may
actually<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> secret<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.549> brush<00:01:44.850> so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
actually be the secret to this brush so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.969 
actually be the secret to this brush so

has<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.930> worn<00:02:15.110> out<00:02:15.260> yet<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:16.610> feels<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:17.330> little

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
has it worn out yet it feels a little

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.630 
has it worn out yet it feels a little
like<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:17.990> starting<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.740> but<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.370> doesn't

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
like it's starting to but it doesn't

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.790 
like it's starting to but it doesn't
feel<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:19.820> it's<00:02:20.150> completely<00:02:20.840> gone<00:02:20.870> yet<00:02:21.350> okay

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
feel like it's completely gone yet okay

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.260 
feel like it's completely gone yet okay
so<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.100> doesn't<00:02:22.310> hurt<00:02:22.400> enough<00:02:22.700> yet<00:02:22.880> that<00:02:23.060> she's

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
so it doesn't hurt enough yet that she's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.240 
so it doesn't hurt enough yet that she's
not<00:02:23.450> using<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.990> but<00:02:24.350> with<00:02:24.470> her<00:02:24.590> type<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:25.040> hair

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
not using it but with her type of hair

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.580 
not using it but with her type of hair
and<00:02:25.580> her<00:02:25.790> propensity<00:02:26.420> towards<00:02:27.410> getting

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
and her propensity towards getting

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.070 
and her propensity towards getting
tangles<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.730> type<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.120> brush<00:02:29.480> will<00:02:29.690> last<00:02:29.900> for

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
tangles this type of brush will last for

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.020 
tangles this type of brush will last for
about<00:02:30.140> three<00:02:30.560> months<00:02:30.710> so<00:02:31.070> fifteen<00:02:31.730> dollars

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
about three months so fifteen dollars

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.220 
about three months so fifteen dollars
for<00:02:32.210> three<00:02:32.360> months<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.660> think<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.080> pretty

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
for three months I think it's a pretty

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.830 
for three months I think it's a pretty
good<00:02:33.350> deal<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.070> think<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.550> think<00:02:35.510> it's

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
good deal what do you think I think it's

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.220 
good deal what do you think I think it's
a<00:02:36.320> very<00:02:36.500> good<00:02:36.650> deal<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:38.360> really<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:38.990> it

a very good deal you really see it

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.110 
a very good deal you really see it
really<00:02:39.440> seems<00:02:39.740> worth<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.040> money<00:02:40.460> with<00:02:40.880> how

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
have a lot of hard knocks and I was very

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.550

out so painlessly so for me it was very

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.910 
out so painlessly so for me it was very
worth<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.090> money<00:02:56.240> for<00:02:57.170> such<00:02:57.350> little<00:02:57.710> pain

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920
