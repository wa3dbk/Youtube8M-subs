00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.950
 how are my youtube no longer if 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome to a tutorial for minecraft 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.180
 and the student I'm going to show you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.430
 how to change your skin the minecraft 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.620
 clearly and first of all I'm going to 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.570
 say that this is only going to work 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.830
 with premium accounts so you have to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.840
 buy the game to change your 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.200
 who can not occupy a crack account 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.450
 or free those crap you can not 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.070
 occupy because I could not write your skin 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.170
 And if you can 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.170
 I do not know how because I can not count 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.610
 crack or free so afterwards since already 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.950
 I said that what they will want like that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.829
 deny your internet to your search engine or 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.880
 as you want to call it and you will go to 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.020
 minecraft dot net to the page 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120
 and if you have not bought the game 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.790
 it's just going to be here, you're going to go 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 to buy now you are going to register create 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.870
 all that but but after that you'll go 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.950
 to the kings or only to your account this 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.930
 it does not have to be the first thing 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.100
 First of all, you are going to put yourself in your 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.690

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.150

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.090
 of your account and since there is in the 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.220
 account is going to be another page not the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.860

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.320

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.450
