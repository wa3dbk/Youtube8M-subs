00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.790 
definitely more than an intermediate
hike<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.580> if<00:02:50.540> you're<00:02:50.750> not<00:02:51.280> used<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.400> hiking<00:02:52.610> I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
hike so if you're not used to hiking I

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.900 
hike so if you're not used to hiking I
would<00:02:54.800> definitely<00:02:55.100> get<00:02:55.190> in<00:02:55.280> shape<00:02:55.459> before<00:02:55.820> you

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
would definitely get in shape before you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.830 
would definitely get in shape before you
come<00:02:56.180> here<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.480> try<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:57.850> but<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.090> two<00:02:59.480> hours

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
come here and try this but the two hours

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.690 
come here and try this but the two hours
two<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.170> half<00:03:00.320> hour<00:03:00.920> hike<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.459> summit

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
two and a half hour hike to the summit

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.130 
two and a half hour hike to the summit
right<00:03:01.940> now<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:02.180> can't<00:03:02.510> see<00:03:02.750> anything<00:03:02.930> because

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
right now we can't see anything because

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.290 
right now we can't see anything because
of<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.470> mist<00:03:03.800> but<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.790> doesn't<00:03:05.180> diminish

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
of the mist but that doesn't diminish

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.270 
of the mist but that doesn't diminish
anything<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.080> was<00:03:06.170> certainly<00:03:06.470> worth<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.860> wait

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
anything it was certainly worth the wait

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.300 
anything it was certainly worth the wait
worth<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.640> hike<00:03:07.880> worth<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.330> effort<00:03:08.690> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
worth the hike worth the effort and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.250 
worth the hike worth the effort and
