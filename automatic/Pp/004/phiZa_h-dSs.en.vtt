00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.330
 hello you love her 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.240
 let's go with my 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.220
 school year review and so on and so on 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.200
 I'll just start today 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.810
 with these tips I have a few 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.890
 I had ordered things I believe 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.480
 somehow already mentioned if I 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.279
 then it is now I have such 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.269
 small daily portions ordered easily 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.599
 because I'm a little bit of something again 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.150
 want to try and you know it 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.430
 For example, it is this daily portion 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.930
 then you go in once 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.070
 in the morning and then you can do it once 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.540
 a day in portions of 345 x pour 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.170
 Tat always drinks the tea leaves 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.120
 you do not pick them up and ask 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.100
 not after or is just really 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.300
 It does not have to be perfect to take away either 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.980
 every time some teabags and 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.690
 so haul and you can just 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.530
 always just hot water 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 fill in and drink the culprit again 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.250
 I'll get some t next time 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.869
 I should have ordered for 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.369
 Test yourself and then you will 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.320
 Now, by and by, practically mine 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.420
 small pensions mini reviews you will 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.740
 then to see and if I give to him 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.349
 would buy the beginning I would like today 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.660
 wise fresh and yes that's one 

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.429
 I wanted to say fragrance no it is 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.450
 a taste of the really very very 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:29.330
 is pleasant and you get up to twice 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.429
 I can pour it three times 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.229
 the third time is already the taste 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.520
 a lot weaker so three times 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.229
 you really give them a good drink and 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.580
 then from the fourth time I have to 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.429
 say it always tastes like that 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.190
 there is only a little bit of water left 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.039
 now in there and no caffeine and that is 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.720
 white tea with lemon peel rosemary 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.459
 and apple mint and I think that 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.080
 judge student smell 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.880
 So not so good but he 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.789
 tastes just the same tastes like that 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.759
 a bit lemony has son too 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.679
 green tea white tea rosmarie tastes 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.920
 somehow not quite so out and now 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.619
 as well this easily 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.590
 fresh from this mint and yes so me 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.789
 find an absolutely great t and come 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.340
 In any case for me on the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.020
 list of the nachkaufen I always do so 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.280
 it's not me, it's me anymore 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.920
 I have to write it all down 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.750
 because there are just too many worries and 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.459
 and then comes the next 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.640
 then I still have the counter for 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.060
 fresh for you this is the number 124 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.519
 without caffeine and lemongrass mango 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.620
 Apple mint and licorice should be in it 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.930
 and of course Ginger and I have to say 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.120
 this thesis is not so the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.950
 tastes just over and has 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.030
 really very strange 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.220
 aftertaste of that too 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.630
 get a headache and he smells 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.950
 then somehow quite funny and it 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.330
 is really really sharp 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.739
 taste so who the likes of 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.630
 this somewhere i like them was though 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.739
 but not so strong and me 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.430
 I am from these other things 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.630
 Lemongrass mango apple mint sweet wood 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.940
 right or I do not taste that 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.260
 licorice comes as a bit of is 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.000
 that's what I think so what that 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.580
 combination with these something me 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.109
 Not that tastes and so that was it 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.670
 with me in any case so has one 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.410
 But now I say that because of that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.709
 is very good you have such a small 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.880
 helping and so who really cures 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.609
 sometime mark and also a bit 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.170
 this herpe then that is something for you 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:28.380
 and the xt all you live the next one yes 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:32.760
 t this is this boy orange and yes me 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:38.430
 have to say that's my second now 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.810
 infusion and it tastes very light 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.489
 so I can not necessarily it now 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.019
 recommend it tastes is not bad 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.970
 after any bitterness or 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.120
 somehow no idea when it tastes good 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.410
 I think so far anyway 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.440
 intense I call it that way I do 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.209
 Let's see you soon 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.200
 again show the pieces down there 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:01.400
 who are in there and what you see that 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.780
 are really big pieces in there and 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.400
 nice many fruits and so on though 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.670
 I'm just he does not taste at all 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.349
 to 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.110
 So something tastes so easy 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.599
 a little bit of black tea or something 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.209
 no idea so very easy 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.850
 taste and when I'm on me now 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.750
 in any case, do not buy again 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.910
 yes hello so I've pretty well the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.740
 next deep you tested and that 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.090
 is the pomegranate mint and got 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.669
 I definitely love it 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.340
 michaela get a tip I got mine 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.100
 ordered and he has now I have to 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.130
 I would like to say well 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.450
 I only buy pomegranate after buying 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.880
 somehow not tasted mainly 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.370
 a bit like mint and yes there 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.220
 were many big pieces in it first 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.490
 infusion was delicious second infusion 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.110
 was okay but since I have a beginning 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.880
 a little sugar or 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.440
 not metro and now here the third 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.570
 infusion has somehow almost only 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.940
 after water with a bit of inter 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.620
 tasted but that's okay too 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.960
 otherwise really pomegranate with can 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.540
 I recommend it was delicious so 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.190
 I have the next tea and me 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.060
 have not only a teenager but 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.630
 Unfortunately I have him at work 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.830
 to forget 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.800
 but now I'm back in the 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.229
 meanwhile in the meantime yes in 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.140
 the second try and second 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.479
 though once this fruit delight me 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.430
 bring you the picture here again 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.990
 can you see what the culprits look like? 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.930
 as I said I have now unfortunately 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.660
 no longer in the teenager but that does not matter 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:34.289
 I have to take a quick look and do it 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.280
 lemon grass red berries and fruits 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.930
 without coffein 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.150
 So I have to say that was relative 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.320
 delicious fruity but not so fruity 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.700
 like such an important classic 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.390
 The fruit you so out of the bag 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.410
 or so knows hakuto co 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.700
 Nevertheless, I have to say he has me completely 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.650
 the field tasted good, too 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.620
 definitely one that I am now yes 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.419
 would reorder, so to speak 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.650
 he was really ok and he did too 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.630
 second infusion still good 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.039
 tasted the third slow why 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.919
 a bit flatter of the taste though 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.389
 otherwise it has to be because he is really good 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.350
 I have now moment must be short 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.600
 put away 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.710
 I have one now and I have to 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.280
 I say if it is not so good 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.450
 That was this carriage or tasted 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.409
 clamp and there is no caffeine with 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.379
 becomes lemons 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.059
 berries and stevia and it already has 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.110
 by itself a bit sweetish 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:24.539
 decorated and I have to say this 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.639
 sweetish that was not at all mean 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.199
 So that was not such a honey sweet 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.279
 or sugar sweet but really one 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.589
 it's funny 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:34.679
 I had a taste for it 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.989
 the dba was otherwise was also from the 

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:38.369
 Taste not really intense 

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:40.050
 maybe a little bit after 

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:42.149
 lemon but otherwise because he 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.899
 Actually , I found that a bit 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.669
 tasteless 

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:48.269
 yes I would in any case 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:51.089
 do not reorder 132 gui or means 

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:52.709
 the good or good or so jam well 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.209
 In any case, these were the two now 

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:56.729
 I will definitely be now 

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:58.319
 cut and upload for you 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.179
 that you are a part of the ts ever 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.739
 have seen and the rest will 

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:03.929
 I also try and then 

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:05.429
 take a little deep and 

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:08.099
 otherwise, of course, as always, a good one 

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:10.499
 time and comes my hair somehow 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.389
 Totally strubbelig something stands out 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:14.339
 I was just out in the sun 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:17.459
 on the deckchair and see why 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:18.989
 So, as always, we have a good time and 

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:20.309
 if you have any the recommendations 

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:21.959
 or so then write me of course 

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:24.199
 and then stay until next time 

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:24.199
 healthy
