I<00:00:00.329> guess<00:00:01.290> my<00:00:01.589> name<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.250> Dimitri<00:00:02.760> I'm<00:00:02.970> from

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
I guess my name is Dimitri I'm from

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.670 
I guess my name is Dimitri I'm from
unico<00:00:03.720> systems<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.500> we're<00:00:05.460> finally<00:00:06.000> enabled

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
unico systems and we're finally enabled

26<00:00:07.680> inch<00:00:07.950> monitor<00:00:08.730> with<00:00:09.110> our<00:00:10.110> digital<00:00:10.920> signage

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
26 inch monitor with our digital signage

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.680 
26 inch monitor with our digital signage
solution<00:00:11.910> called<00:00:12.570> Pegasus<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:14.940> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
solution called Pegasus so this is a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.740 
solution called Pegasus so this is a
single<00:00:16.260> board<00:00:16.529> computer<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:18.210> very

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
single board computer we have very

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.189 
single board computer we have very
powerful<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.740> enables<00:00:20.490> playback<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> big

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
powerful that enables playback on a big

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.290 
powerful that enables playback on a big
screen<00:00:22.560> up<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.269> 720p<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:26.519> matter<00:00:26.849> has

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
screen up to 720p so this matter has

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.470 
screen up to 720p so this matter has
Pegasus<00:00:28.019> board<00:00:28.320> mounted<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> back

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
Pegasus board mounted on the back

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.370 
Pegasus board mounted on the back
connected<00:00:30.480> directly<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.960> lvds<00:00:31.830> interface<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
connected directly to lvds interface and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.030 
connected directly to lvds interface and
makes<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.620> work<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.760> let<00:00:36.750> me<00:00:36.780> run<00:00:37.140> small<00:00:37.800> show

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
makes it work so let me run small show

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.910 
makes it work so let me run small show
right<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.739> it<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:40.770> show<00:00:42.110> it's<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.230> really

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
right now and it will show it's a really

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
right now and it will show it's a really
small<00:00:44.280> demo<00:00:45.890> pictures<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.840> right<00:00:48.840> now<00:00:49.050> you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
small demo pictures and right now you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.290 
small demo pictures and right now you
will<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.370> three<00:00:50.670> portion<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
will see like like three portion of the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.250 
will see like like three portion of the
screen<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:54.020> pictures<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.489> video<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
screen this is a pictures of video and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.150 
screen this is a pictures of video and
text<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> our<00:00:59.730> video<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.899> actually<00:01:01.350> playing

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
text so our video is actually playing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.240 
text so our video is actually playing
from<00:01:02.579> NAND<00:01:03.270> flash<00:01:05.000> actually<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.240> killed<00:01:06.720> from

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
from NAND flash actually is killed from

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:16.999 
from NAND flash actually is killed from
7<00:01:08.250> 40<00:01:08.729> x<00:01:10.369> 480<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:12.500> rotated<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.990> word<00:01:16.009> farful

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
7 40 x 480 and rotated the word farful

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.200 
7 40 x 480 and rotated the word farful
post<00:01:18.000> processor<00:01:18.920> with<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> scalar<00:01:20.549> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
post processor with a scalar that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.840 
post processor with a scalar that
actually<00:01:21.750> makes<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> possible<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> our

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
actually makes it possible so our

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
actually makes it possible so our
pictures<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:26.360> tips<00:01:27.360> they're<00:01:28.080> pretty<00:01:28.470> rough

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
pictures and tips they're pretty rough

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.999 
pictures and tips they're pretty rough
and<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.180> full<00:01:30.450> screen<00:01:30.750> playback<00:01:31.229> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and this is full screen playback that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
and this is full screen playback that
just<00:01:32.369> shows<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.990> Pyxis<00:01:34.650> board<00:01:34.920> are<00:01:35.930> able

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
just shows that the Pyxis board are able

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.620 
just shows that the Pyxis board are able
to<00:01:37.140> play<00:01:37.590> fullscreen<00:01:37.979> video<00:01:39.140> with<00:01:40.140> 720p

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
to play fullscreen video with 720p

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.670 
to play fullscreen video with 720p
high-definition<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:44.689> now<00:01:45.689> we'll<00:01:46.380> play<00:01:46.619> some

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
high-definition and now we'll play some

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.880 
high-definition and now we'll play some
high<00:01:47.189> definition<00:01:47.759> pictures<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
high definition pictures so you see the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.330 
high definition pictures so you see the
picture<00:01:50.549> quality<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.060> quite<00:01:51.240> good<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.340> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
picture quality is quite good and this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.109 
picture quality is quite good and this
pictures<00:01:54.049> taped<00:01:55.049> video<00:01:55.770> could<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.490> delivered

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
pictures taped video could be delivered

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.880 
pictures taped video could be delivered
through<00:01:58.110> Wi-Fi<00:01:58.469> or<00:01:59.040> GSM

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
through Wi-Fi or GSM

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.960 
through Wi-Fi or GSM
to<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.610> display<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.350> display<00:02:03.950> only<00:02:04.400> needs

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
to the display so the display only needs

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.820 
to the display so the display only needs
only<00:02:05.479> one<00:02:05.750> block<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.680> AC<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:09.080> so

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
only one block to AC and that's it so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.230 
only one block to AC and that's it so
