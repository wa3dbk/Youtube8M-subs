that's that is it and its completeness

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.799 
that's that is it and its completeness
you<00:00:35.499> put<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:35.920> down<00:00:36.069> so<00:00:36.280> don't<00:00:36.399> hurt<00:00:36.579> myself

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
you put that down so don't hurt myself

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.029 
you put that down so don't hurt myself
you<00:00:37.809> notice<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:38.109> on<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.379> bottle<00:00:38.679> you<00:00:38.920> have

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
you notice that on the bottle you have

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.700 
you notice that on the bottle you have
this<00:00:39.190> little<00:00:39.399> lip<00:00:39.969> around<00:00:40.359> here<00:00:40.929> I<00:00:41.079> use<00:00:41.679> that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
this little lip around here I use that

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.410 
this little lip around here I use that
is<00:00:42.100> much<00:00:42.309> more<00:00:42.460> expedient<00:00:42.819> and<00:00:43.089> it<00:00:43.210> makes<00:00:43.359> them

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
is much more expedient and it makes them

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.689 
is much more expedient and it makes them
entry<00:00:43.870> door<00:00:44.019> cut<00:00:44.229> to<00:00:44.679> pull<00:00:44.920> this<00:00:45.159> knife<00:00:45.519> right

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
bottle like this that way you really

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.009 
bottle like this that way you really
don't<00:00:51.159> have<00:00:51.309> any<00:00:51.549> of<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.760> foils<00:00:52.149> touching<00:00:52.929> the

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
cut on that bottle at that point in time

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.629

then you open up this part of it you

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:08.580 
then you open up this part of it you
place<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.180> like<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:07.230> you<00:01:08.230> can<00:01:08.350> turn<00:01:08.470> the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
place it in like that you can turn the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.070 
place it in like that you can turn the
corkscrew<00:01:08.920> turn<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.280> bottle<00:01:09.900> maybe<00:01:10.900> if

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
corkscrew turn the bottle maybe if

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.270 
corkscrew turn the bottle maybe if
you're<00:01:11.260> ambidextrous<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.800> can<00:01:11.920> do<00:01:12.010> both<00:01:12.130> at

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
you're ambidextrous you can do both at

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.530 
you're ambidextrous you can do both at
the<00:01:12.340> same<00:01:12.400> time<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:15.460> pull<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.760> down<00:01:15.910> I<00:01:15.940> kind<00:01:16.390> of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
the same time you pull it down I kind of

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.700 
the same time you pull it down I kind of
test<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.960> here<00:01:16.990> because<00:01:17.350> you're<00:01:17.530> going<00:01:17.650> to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
test it here because you're going to

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.010 
test it here because you're going to
take<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.130> part<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.700> corkscrew<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:19.840> lay

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
take this part of the corkscrew and lay

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.290 
take this part of the corkscrew and lay
it<00:01:20.140> on<00:01:20.230> the<00:01:20.320> lip<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.650> bottle<00:01:20.860> and

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
it on the lip of the bottle and

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.080 
it on the lip of the bottle and
sometimes<00:01:22.300> if<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.510> pull<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.080> down<00:01:23.230> too<00:01:23.410> far

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
sometimes if you pull it down too far

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.670 
sometimes if you pull it down too far
then<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.180> don't<00:01:25.630> have<00:01:25.960> that<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.380> do<00:01:26.500> if<00:01:26.590> you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
then you don't have that to do if you

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.980 
then you don't have that to do if you
get<00:01:26.770> more<00:01:26.950> leverage<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.430> then<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.150> simply<00:01:28.780> I

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
get more leverage and then you simply I

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.720 
get more leverage and then you simply I
kind<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.440> hold<00:01:29.800> that<00:01:29.920> with<00:01:30.010> my<00:01:30.130> finger<00:01:30.550> on

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
kind of hold that with my finger on

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.380 
kind of hold that with my finger on
there<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.300> doesn't<00:01:31.510> slip<00:01:31.720> off<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:34.270> then

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
there so it doesn't slip off so so then

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.850 
there so it doesn't slip off so so then
all<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.630> do<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.870> pull<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.380> lever<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:35.710> like

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
all you do is pull the lever up like

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.560 
all you do is pull the lever up like
that<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.460> court<00:01:36.640> comes<00:01:36.790> up<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.090> out<00:01:37.210> and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
that and the court comes up and out and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.550 
that and the court comes up and out and
it's<00:01:38.530> really<00:01:38.590> easy<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.060> look<00:01:40.060> at<00:01:40.120> these<00:01:40.360> is<00:01:41.170> not

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
it's really easy to look at these is not

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.250 
it's really easy to look at these is not
really<00:01:42.160> easy<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.710> there<00:01:44.980> you<00:01:45.070> have<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.250> wawa

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260
