00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.950
 urania astronomy and astronautics newsletter edited by the institute 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.040
 national astrophysicist 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.040
 a nice one found by luca nobili and elena lazzaretto 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.209
 to date both - study of the universe and for example in the field of 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.910
 telecommunications we have exploited the light better radiation 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.599
 electromagnetic using its properties as is the frequency is 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.109
 polarization 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.699
 we now know that radiation has an additional labor pil city property 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.449
 in practice it is as if we had an additional channel on which to receive 8 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.160
 stop information 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.750
 if an important discovery that can revolutionize astrophysics and the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.680
 technology that we are every day and if we can do it it will be thanks to those who have 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.040
 worked on this fabrizio tamburini astrophysicist study of the university 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.020
 from padova to whom we asked some examples of possible applications 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.390
 we are already investigating the rotations of black holes that make vorticity in the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.290
 light according to our calculations 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.290
 an idea we launched on the publication that 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.550
 is now under analysis and that you can, looking at it vorticity 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.650
 of the year 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.170
 omg of light 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.220
 see if the plasma inside one of the diffusion reactors begins to 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.200
 becoming turbulent would therefore also have interesting implications 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.120
 in nuclear fusion 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.870
 and then there are also many other applications immediately 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.180
 here to give you an idea you will save a lot in frequencies and things 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.460
 even in mobile phones 6 this technology will be applied in the future 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.830
 the future, however, which is far from certain 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 I hope to stay in Italy by hand I see it hard 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.890
 it's not really a problem related to the university it's a problem of its own 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.200
 linked to the very low investments in research in Italy 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 unfortunately we are neither players nor does it outline them 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.440
 re we found out we had a neighbor 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.680
 It's small and it's decidedly inconspicuous for this it wasn't easy 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.610
 noticing his presence even if he is less than 10 light years away from us 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.130
 it is a brown dwarf a particular type of star or rather a quasi star 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.460
 the fusion reactions have never been triggered within it 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.949
 nuclear power that feeds with the stars 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.849
 price brown dwarfs still have a warm heart because of the heat it is 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.979
 developed during their formation therefore do not emit visible light 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.599
 but the infrared radiation the discovery was made by sieving only 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.719
 a small percentage saying this implies that in our vicinity 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.339
 there could be many other similar presences among those identified up to 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.339
 today this is the closest brown dwarf 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.939
 the phenomenon of shining night clouds occurs in the upper atmosphere at around 80 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.259
 kilometers high 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:02.359
 hahaha does not want them to light up that appear and disappear with intensity 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.019
 light and extension that vary from time to time leaving the researchers 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.399
 with a lot of doubts 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:13.089
 now a group of scholars has worked a possible hypothesis on their origin 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.189
 by measuring the changes in brightness it was observed that the clouds have 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:25.069
 periodic behavior according to cpt 27 days to the same period employed by 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.479
 alone to make a complete rotation on itself 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.879
 as the sun turns 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.879
 baaria the percentage of ultraviolet radiation that comes from it 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.100
 our atmosphere 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.519
 and it could be precisely this type of particularly energetic radiation 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.519
 the responsibility calls come on 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.920
 also this year the national institute of astrophysics 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.300
 and sharp as to be able to allocate the 5 per thousand is not about additional taxes 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.540
 to pay 5 per thousand a share of taxes to which the state waives for 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.940
 allocate it for scientific research tommaso maccacaro president of the institution 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.860
 give the 5 per thousand all in poker player for reload and basic research 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.160
 because because it is an investment because it is the con to tell who it is to 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.579
 search for come back then peter 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.969
 through 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.400
 vote for the job that searchers do and that only contribute to increasing the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 culture but also to produce technology that improves ours with 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.889
 top up all information on www.media.it. it 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.410
 or by searching for pina for fun facebook and twitter 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.880
 and with these. 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.880
 I am in good standing from the editorial office of urania 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.630
 urania did. won the next edition 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.680
