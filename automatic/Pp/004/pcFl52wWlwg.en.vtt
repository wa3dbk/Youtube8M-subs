00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hi this is an apple saw flyer damage

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.190 
hi this is an apple saw flyer damage
I've<00:00:02.159> just<00:00:02.370> cut<00:00:02.580> off<00:00:02.760> an<00:00:03.030> apple<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.959> bunch

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
I've just cut off an apple in a bunch

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.619 
I've just cut off an apple in a bunch
which<00:00:05.040> had<00:00:05.250> been<00:00:05.430> damaged<00:00:05.790> by<00:00:05.910> Apple<00:00:06.120> sawfly

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
which had been damaged by Apple sawfly

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.770 
which had been damaged by Apple sawfly
and<00:00:06.810> then<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.080> know<00:00:07.140> system<00:00:08.120> this<00:00:09.120> one<00:00:09.330> next<00:00:09.540> to

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
and then I know system this one next to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.200 
and then I know system this one next to
it<00:00:09.920> that's<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.010> big<00:00:11.219> hole<00:00:11.460> now<00:00:11.730> what's<00:00:11.940> happened

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
it that's a big hole now what's happened

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.700 
it that's a big hole now what's happened
as<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.300> apple<00:00:12.630> supplier<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.469> egg<00:00:13.559> has

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
as the apple supplier that the egg has

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.560 
as the apple supplier that the egg has
been<00:00:13.860> laying<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.219> laid<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.820> one<00:00:15.030> fruit<00:00:15.360> lit

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
been laying on laid on one fruit lit

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.810 
been laying on laid on one fruit lit
it's<00:00:16.260> hatched<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:16.800> burrowed<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.670> it's

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
it's hatched out burrowed in and it's

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
it's hatched out burrowed in and it's
done<00:00:18.090> most<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> damage<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.260> eating<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
done most of the damage is eating the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
done most of the damage is eating the
quarry<00:00:20.220> Apple<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.060> its<00:00:21.449> own<00:00:21.630> burrowed

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
quarry Apple out and its own burrowed

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.519 
quarry Apple out and its own burrowed
into<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.980> next<00:00:23.310> Apple<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.230> split

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
into this next Apple which I just split

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.269 
into this next Apple which I just split
open<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> any<00:00:26.820> others<00:00:27.210> there<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.890> damage

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
open and any others there the damage

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.740 
open and any others there the damage
that's<00:00:29.400> been<00:00:29.640> done<00:00:29.699> obviously<00:00:30.060> an<00:00:30.269> apple<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
that's been done obviously an apple is a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.870 
that's been done obviously an apple is a
goner<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.470> their<00:00:32.250> cm<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.899> actual<00:00:34.050> saw<00:00:34.500> fly

maggot<00:00:35.880> itself<00:00:37.309> now<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.370> weeks<00:00:38.730> ago<00:00:38.969> these

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
maggot itself now two weeks ago these

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510 
maggot itself now two weeks ago these
were<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.660> very<00:00:39.690> very<00:00:40.379> small<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.860> hardly<00:00:41.190> see

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
were so very very small we hardly see

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
were so very very small we hardly see
them<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.850> now<00:00:41.969> they've<00:00:42.149> obviously<00:00:42.989> become

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
them and now they've obviously become

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.670 
them and now they've obviously become
quite<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:44.040> larger<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> worth<00:00:48.680> going

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
quite a lot larger it is worth going

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.900 
quite a lot larger it is worth going
over<00:00:49.800> your<00:00:50.010> apple<00:00:50.960> trees<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.350> finding<00:00:53.010> apples

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
over your apple trees and finding apples

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.900 
over your apple trees and finding apples
which<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.180> been<00:00:54.239> damaged<00:00:54.629> by<00:00:54.780> soft<00:00:55.410> life<00:00:55.910> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
which have been damaged by soft life and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
which have been damaged by soft life and
I<00:00:57.030> 70<00:00:57.449> always<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.899> dropped<00:00:58.109> off<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I 70 always just dropped off and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.750 
I 70 always just dropped off and
removing<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.180> destroying<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.899> saw<00:01:01.260> fly<00:01:01.760> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
removing them destroying the saw fly to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810 
removing them destroying the saw fly to
stop<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> critter<00:01:03.809> hatching<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.339> they

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
stop the critter hatching out and they

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.550 
stop the critter hatching out and they
will<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.240> destroy<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.840> fruit<00:01:07.140> lit<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
will actually destroy one fruit lit and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.780 
will actually destroy one fruit lit and
then<00:01:07.650> creep<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.580> burrow

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
then creep out of it and then burrow

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
then creep out of it and then burrow
into<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.450> adjacent<00:01:09.659> fruitless<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.740> will

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
into an adjacent fruitless so they will

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.160 
into an adjacent fruitless so they will
destroy<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.850> multiple<00:01:12.299> fruitless<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.960> really

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
destroy it multiple fruitless it really

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.520 
destroy it multiple fruitless it really
is<00:01:13.260> worth<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.710> over<00:01:13.799> them<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.189> any<00:01:15.530> till

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
is worth going over them and any till

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.109 
is worth going over them and any till
soft<00:01:16.710> fly<00:01:16.890> damage<00:01:17.189> apple<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.549> snip<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.000> off

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
soft fly damage apple just snip them off

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.760 
soft fly damage apple just snip them off
if<00:01:18.360> you've<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> time<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.229> cut<00:01:19.530> them<00:01:19.650> in

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
if you've got the time you cut them in

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.740 
if you've got the time you cut them in
half<00:01:19.939> would<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.119> drop<00:01:21.270> them<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> ground

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
half would you drop them on the ground

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.640 
half would you drop them on the ground
old<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.979> maggot<00:01:23.280> will<00:01:23.400> probably<00:01:23.700> not<00:01:23.880> develop

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650

the only really effective control is
