00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.100 
ado let's get painting starting with the
basic<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.850> found<00:00:33.120> its<00:00:33.270> easiest<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.780> create

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
basic I found its easiest to create

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.620 
basic I found its easiest to create
little<00:00:34.290> dashed<00:00:34.649> lines<00:00:35.010> along<00:00:35.610> my<00:00:35.880> lash<00:00:36.210> line

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
little dashed lines along my lash line

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.080 
little dashed lines along my lash line
and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.170> connect<00:00:37.800> those<00:00:38.070> dashed<00:00:38.460> lines<00:00:38.790> in

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and then connect those dashed lines in

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.900 
and then connect those dashed lines in
swift<00:00:39.629> short<00:00:40.620> strokes<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> easiest

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
swift short strokes that's the easiest

way to get a nice close line to my eye
and<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.059> basic<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:45.510> give<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> most

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and the basic will give you the most

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
and the basic will give you the most
minimal<00:00:46.739> look<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.550> still<00:00:47.730> enhance<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.510> eye

you can see the comparison there taking

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
you can see the comparison there taking
the<00:00:50.640> basic<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.120> extending<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> line<00:00:51.930> with

the basic and extending the line with
about<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> 20<00:00:52.829> degree<00:00:52.980> upward<00:00:53.699> tilt<00:00:54.120> from<00:00:54.449> the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
try lining your lower waterline I
usually<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> use<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> pencil<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
usually like to use a pencil for this

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.880 
usually like to use a pencil for this
now<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.600> using<00:01:42.630> black<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.380> going

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
now because I'm using black it is going

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
now because I'm using black it is going
to<00:01:44.100> make<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> eye<00:01:44.520> look<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.240> bit

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
to make the eye look a little bit

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
to make the eye look a little bit
smaller<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.259> experiment<00:01:46.680> with

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
smaller so you can experiment with

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.410 
smaller so you can experiment with
different<00:01:46.979> colors<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.850> want<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.149> brighten

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
different colors if you want to brighten

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.160 
different colors if you want to brighten
it<00:01:48.860> if<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.009> take<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.310> brush<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.549> draw<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
it if you take your brush and draw at a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.690 
it if you take your brush and draw at a
45-degree<00:01:52.170> angle<00:01:52.200> line<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.430> your

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
45-degree angle line think of it as your

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.240 
45-degree angle line think of it as your
lower<00:01:54.060> lid<00:01:54.570> line<00:01:54.990> extending<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:55.979> way

lower lid line extending all the way

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.789 
lower lid line extending all the way
upward<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.509> make<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.960> gradual<00:01:58.740> slope

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
upward and then make it a gradual slope

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.219 
upward and then make it a gradual slope
you're<00:01:59.729> creating<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> call<00:02:00.810> an

Arabian wing

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.469 
Arabian wing
and<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.799> add<00:02:04.950> again<00:02:05.250> more<00:02:05.579> layers<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.149> the

top of this wing it's going to smooth
out<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> line<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.690> make<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.140> slope<00:02:10.470> much

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
out the line and make the slope much

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.680 
out the line and make the slope much
more<00:02:11.099> gradual<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.239> more<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.599> a

yeah<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.210> think<00:05:12.270> this<00:05:12.510> look<00:05:12.660> is<00:05:12.750> really<00:05:12.900> fun<00:05:13.200> oh

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440

the<00:05:14.130> dreaded<00:05:14.340> tight<00:05:14.729> line<00:05:15.000> this<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.330> where<00:05:15.570> you

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
the dreaded tight line this is where you

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.180 
the dreaded tight line this is where you
are<00:05:15.780> lining<00:05:15.990> your<00:05:16.260> upper<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.770> lower

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
are lining your upper and lower

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.330 
are lining your upper and lower
waterline<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:18.389> found<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:19.050> helps<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.470> lot<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:20.190> take

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
waterline I found it helps a lot to take

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.909 
waterline I found it helps a lot to take
the<00:05:20.520> end<00:05:20.700> of<00:05:20.880> a<00:05:20.970> brush<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:21.630> press<00:05:21.930> on<00:05:22.229> my<00:05:22.410> eyelid

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
the end of a brush to press on my eyelid

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.460 
the end of a brush to press on my eyelid
to<00:05:23.130> expose<00:05:23.669> my<00:05:23.940> waterline<00:05:24.479> more<00:05:24.750> easily<00:05:25.110> and

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
to expose my waterline more easily and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.040 
to expose my waterline more easily and
then<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.830> am<00:05:26.070> just<00:05:26.280> lining<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:26.849> with<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.450> pencil

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
then I am just lining it with a pencil

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.080 
then I am just lining it with a pencil
liner<00:05:28.289> and<00:05:28.620> leaving<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.310> just<00:05:29.580> like<00:05:29.760> that<00:05:29.940> this

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
liner and leaving it just like that this

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.089 
liner and leaving it just like that this
is<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.300> more<00:05:30.570> subtle<00:05:30.930> look<00:05:31.260> but<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:31.560> adds<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.950> nice

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
is a more subtle look but it adds a nice

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.980 
is a more subtle look but it adds a nice
punch<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.789> drama<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.330> your<00:05:33.450> eyes<00:05:33.599> you<00:05:33.840> can<00:05:33.960> see

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
punch and drama to your eyes you can see

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.620 
punch and drama to your eyes you can see
in<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.229> comparison<00:05:34.800> for<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:35.820> standard<00:05:36.360> drop

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
in the comparison for the standard drop

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.330
