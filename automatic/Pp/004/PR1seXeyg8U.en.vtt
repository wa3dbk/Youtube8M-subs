00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
they need to be about three centimeters

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.350 
they need to be about three centimeters
in<00:02:23.320> diameter<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:27.130> just<00:02:27.340> play<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.850> little<00:02:28.060> done

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360
