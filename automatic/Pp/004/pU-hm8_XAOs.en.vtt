00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
I think because I spent most of my

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.369 
I think because I spent most of my
career<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.549> Broadway<00:02:17.700> doing<00:02:18.450> live<00:02:18.780> theater<00:02:18.810> I

um people say you must this must be old

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.130 
um people say you must this must be old
hat<00:02:23.129> for<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.819> this<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:24.510> live<00:02:24.870> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
hat for you to do this you know live it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.780 
hat for you to do this you know live it
must<00:02:25.349> not<00:02:25.469> be<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.620> big<00:02:25.829> of<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.040> deal<00:02:26.189> and<00:02:26.459> force

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
must not be that big of a deal and force

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
must not be that big of a deal and force
I<00:02:27.090> guess<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:28.109> little<00:02:28.349> bit<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.859> not<00:02:28.980> that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
I guess a little bit of it it's not that

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.309 
I guess a little bit of it it's not that
big<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.489> deal<00:02:29.640> because<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.090> what<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.269> do<00:02:30.420> but

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
big of a deal because it's what I do but

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.020 
big of a deal because it's what I do but
usually<00:02:31.829> when<00:02:32.129> we're<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.340> stage<00:02:32.700> we're<00:02:32.969> on

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
usually when we're on stage we're on

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.449 
usually when we're on stage we're on
stage<00:02:33.329> in<00:02:33.450> front<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.750> maybe<00:02:34.019> 2,000<00:02:34.799> 3,000

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
stage in front of maybe 2,000 3,000

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.910 
stage in front of maybe 2,000 3,000
people<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:36.090> millions<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.319> millions<00:02:37.349> of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
people so that part of it is is a bit

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.869 
people so that part of it is is a bit
nerve-wracking<00:02:41.189> but<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.340> also<00:02:41.549> know<00:02:41.849> that

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879
