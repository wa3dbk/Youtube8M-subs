00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.550
 dear friends my name is alexander i 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.000
 I am a specialist of the group of companies 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.980
 alter 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.420
 today we are on the backyard 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.490
 the site where we plan to install 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.970
 plastic caisson for water intake 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.310
 wells 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.960
 caisson is needed in order to be comfortable and 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.960
 convenient to maintain the well and 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.699
 equipment that is inside 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.400
 wells in the area are ready and we 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.590
 we can start working 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.880
 marked out the pit with pegs and 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.880
 social twine 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.630
 so we have finished preparing the pit 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.210
 to install plastic caisson 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.770
 now in order to fix 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.820
 equipment in the ground to avoid surfacing 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.980
 or caisson cream 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.380
 around the casing we need 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.089
 pour concrete foundation bottom of the pit 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.520
 at the same time we align with 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.070
 sand cushion pit under caisson 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.780
 must be sized and slope excluding 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.190
 sedimentation collapse of soil on a plate 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.200
 the grounds 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.390
 the last stage of work to the device 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.670
 trenches is the installation of concrete 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.670
 reinforced base plates for caisson 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.090
 to strengthen our future 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.920
 concrete base we use 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.870
 double row reinforcement for this we 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
 assemble the frame from reinforcement using 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.240
 knitting wire pitch 200 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.240
 millimeters 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.510
 trench around its perimeter 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.400
 formwork is installed at the bottom of which 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.560
 poured concrete base plate 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.960
 reinforced with double layer reinforcement 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.119
 base plate thickness is calculated 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.380
 based on the overall dimensions of the caissons and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.380
 specific gravity of concrete 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.220
 the surface of the plate is aligned 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.930
 cement screed from deflection by 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.930
 horizontals no more than three millimeters 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.119
 everything is ready for installation 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.210
 plastic caisson on concrete 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.340
 basis and in order to ensure 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.990
 100% hermetic connection 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.720
 caisson with one pipe we use 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.820
 clutch alto connect now I'll go to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.570
 layout to show how 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.570
 coupling works 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.280
 so connect alta clutch securely 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.530
 welded to the bottom of the caisson tightly 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.569
 compresses the casing and creates 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.850
 100% hermetic connection 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.770
 however when mounting this coupling 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.380
 must use sealants on 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.300
 based on silicone it is worth noting that when 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.980
 delivery of a caisson with an already installed 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.900
 couplings coupling does not need to disassemble a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.030
 install caisson on casing 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.280
 with clutch if there is 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.590
 the need to install the coupling in place 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.750
 you must first install the clutch on 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.160
 caisson and after that caisson along with 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.160
 coupling set on the casing 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.920
 in order to hermetically start 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.019
 the water pipe in the caisson we 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.180
 use universal viola clutch you 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.269
 you connect how to do it i will show on 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.819
 mock up and so clutch viola volcanoes 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.340
 This coupling can be easily installed in place. 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.590
 on the object in the wall of the caisson we drill 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.019
 110 mm diameter hole 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.780
 further in this hole we place the coupling 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.030
 connect to viola and fix it with spacer 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.889
 ring 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.290
 further through the clutch using 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.730
 silicone based sealants we 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.730
 skip the water pipe 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.940
 the connection is 100% 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.209
 tight and moreover the coupling allows 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.560
 longitudinal axis of the pipe 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.620
 longitudinal displacement without loss 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.620
 tightness 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.410
 alta caisson is installed and now us 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.160
 comfortable and convenient to maintain 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.160
 water well equipment
