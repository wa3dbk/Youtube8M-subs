Gray's<00:01:31.410> I<00:01:32.330> leave<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.360> few<00:01:33.870> dots<00:01:34.260> of<00:01:34.620> white<00:01:34.860> paper

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
Gray's I leave a few dots of white paper

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.330 
Gray's I leave a few dots of white paper
in<00:01:36.000> between<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.690> in<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> areas<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
in between and in some of the areas that

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.770 
in between and in some of the areas that
I<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.610> are<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.150> darker<00:01:39.540> like

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
I know are going to be darker like

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.219 
I know are going to be darker like
underneath<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.350> shell<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.580> use<00:01:42.229> thicker

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
underneath the shell I can use thicker

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.290 
underneath the shell I can use thicker
paint<00:01:48.440> this<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> small<00:01:50.220> flat<00:01:51.000> brush

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
paint this is a small flat brush

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.630 
paint this is a small flat brush
probably<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.410> big<00:01:52.619> enough<00:01:52.740> brush<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.430> cover

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
probably not a big enough brush to cover

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.340 
probably not a big enough brush to cover
the<00:01:53.850> areas<00:01:54.180> I'm<00:01:54.300> covering<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.080> all<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the areas I'm covering but it's all it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.889 
the areas I'm covering but it's all it
got<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.160> I'm<00:01:56.250> using<00:01:59.570> the<00:02:00.570> cast

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
got so that's what I'm using the cast

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.969 
got so that's what I'm using the cast
shadow<00:02:01.229> goes<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.979> with<00:02:02.430> ultramarine<00:02:03.210> blue<00:02:03.240> I'm

museum to make it look like it's outdoor
light<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:13.530> areas<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.640> first<00:02:14.910> pass<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.450> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
light the areas in the first pass that I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.390 
light the areas in the first pass that I
painted<00:02:15.959> on<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.290> tortoise<00:02:16.590> itself<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.310> now

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
painted on the tortoise itself and now

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.820 
painted on the tortoise itself and now
are<00:02:17.580> pretty<00:02:17.910> close<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.360> dry<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.989> you'll

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
are pretty close to dry and you'll

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.009 
are pretty close to dry and you'll
notice<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.160> they<00:02:20.519> dry<00:02:20.850> lighter<00:02:21.630> than<00:02:21.900> they

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
notice that they dry lighter than they

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.420 
notice that they dry lighter than they
were<00:02:22.080> when<00:02:22.320> they<00:02:22.440> went<00:02:22.620> down<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.100> that's<00:02:23.220> good

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
were when they went down and that's good

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.490 
were when they went down and that's good
because<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.940> want<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.150> save<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.080> darkest

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
because I want to save the darkest

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.420 

while<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.180> area<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> shadow<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.680> still

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
while that area in the shadow is still

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.060 
while that area in the shadow is still
wet<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.239> add<00:02:36.420> some<00:02:36.780> neutral<00:02:37.170> color<00:02:37.440> wet

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
wet I can add some neutral color wet

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:46.420 
wet I can add some neutral color wet
into<00:02:38.310> wet<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.760> it'll<00:02:38.970> blend<00:02:39.180> by<00:02:39.450> itself

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.420 

now<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.640> all<00:02:47.760> that's<00:02:47.910> dry<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.750> go<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.140> with

now that all that's dry I can go in with
