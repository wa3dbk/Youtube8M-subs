00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.399 
we'd go into a town and we'd do a clinic
and<00:01:49.030> with<00:01:49.209> the<00:01:49.359> circus<00:01:49.689> would<00:01:49.869> leave<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.200> day

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.410 
and with the circus would leave that day
and<00:01:50.709> we'd<00:01:50.859> feel<00:01:51.039> good<00:01:51.340> but<00:01:52.060> there<00:01:52.179> was<00:01:52.270> nothing

that we left behind there was no legacy
this<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.420> all<00:01:55.569> about<00:01:55.689> getting<00:01:56.499> facilities

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
this is all about getting facilities

a long march we aren't going to America

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.760 
a long march we aren't going to America
we're<00:02:06.909> not<00:02:06.969> looking<00:02:07.179> for<00:02:07.240> results<00:02:07.719> in<00:02:07.899> 60<00:02:08.619> days

we're not looking for results in 60 days

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.089 
we're not looking for results in 60 days
or<00:02:09.220> or<00:02:09.939> or<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.360> two<00:02:10.780> years<00:02:11.080> we're<00:02:11.769> in<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:12.040> for

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
or or or in two years we're in this for

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.220 
or or or in two years we're in this for
the<00:02:12.310> long<00:02:12.549> haul<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:13.299> we<00:02:13.480> realized<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.019> we're

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
the long haul and we realized that we're

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.270 
the long haul and we realized that we're
going<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.709> incremental

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
going to incremental

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.699 
going to incremental
progress<00:02:15.700> over<00:02:16.090> time<00:02:16.120> but<00:02:16.990> over<00:02:17.200> time<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.470> think

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
progress over time but over time I think

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.020 
progress over time but over time I think
we<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.130> make<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> real<00:02:18.520> difference<00:02:18.550> by

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
we can make a real difference by

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.730 
we can make a real difference by
introducing<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.780> sport<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.140> swimming<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.709> a

our numbers are one in two percent in
those<00:03:50.829> same<00:03:51.040> categories<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:51.880> we'd<00:03:52.000> like<00:03:52.090> to

closer to what's happening across across
the<00:03:56.709> United<00:03:56.980> States<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:02.620> think<00:04:02.739> it's<00:04:02.829> the

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
the United States I just think it's the

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.699 
the United States I just think it's the
right<00:04:03.040> thing<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.310> do<00:04:03.430> on<00:04:03.790> one<00:04:04.540> level<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.260> on<00:04:05.680> a

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
right thing to do on one level and on a

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
want our sport to be worse we're a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.590 
want our sport to be worse we're a

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
now we're not a ball sport

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.819 
now we're not a ball sport
we're<00:04:15.700> relevant<00:04:16.120> during<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.419> Olympic<00:04:16.720> year

quadrennial<00:04:19.870> we're<00:04:20.620> kind<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:20.890> below<00:04:21.070> the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
quadrennial we're kind of below the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.279 
quadrennial we're kind of below the
radar<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.820> we<00:04:22.270> don't<00:04:22.450> want<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.690> be<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.810> niche

sport we want we want to be much more of
a<00:04:25.330> mainstream<00:04:25.870> sport<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:26.890> it's<00:04:27.039> important<00:04:27.430> for

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
a mainstream sport so it's important for

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.269 
a mainstream sport so it's important for
us<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.700> be<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.210> diversity<00:04:28.690> business

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:29.279 
us to be in the diversity business

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.189 
us to be in the diversity business
because<00:04:30.029> that'll<00:04:30.299> help<00:04:30.449> make<00:04:30.719> us<00:04:30.899> more

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
because that'll help make us more

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.299 
because that'll help make us more
relevant<00:04:31.709> as<00:04:32.039> a<00:04:32.129> sport<00:04:32.779> also<00:04:33.779> there's<00:04:34.019> a

00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:34.309 
relevant as a sport also there's a

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:37.009 
relevant as a sport also there's a
swimming<00:04:35.309> as<00:04:35.489> a<00:04:35.519> life<00:04:35.759> skill<00:04:36.059> so<00:04:36.749> there's<00:04:36.929> a

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:37.019 
swimming as a life skill so there's a

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:39.069 
swimming as a life skill so there's a
little<00:04:37.229> bit<00:04:37.319> of<00:04:37.409> a<00:04:37.469> difference<00:04:37.799> here<00:04:37.879> because

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:39.079 
little bit of a difference here because

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.719 
little bit of a difference here because
drowning<00:04:40.079> is<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.529> second<00:04:40.889> leading<00:04:41.309> cause<00:04:41.669> of

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
drowning is the second leading cause of

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.939 
drowning is the second leading cause of
accidental<00:04:42.119> death<00:04:42.539> for<00:04:43.409> young<00:04:43.529> people<00:04:43.889> in

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
accidental death for young people in

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.609 
accidental death for young people in
this<00:04:44.039> country<00:04:44.459> and<00:04:44.809> African<00:04:45.809> Americans<00:04:46.289> drown

00:04:46.609 --> 00:04:46.619 
this country and African Americans drown

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.189 
this country and African Americans drown
at<00:04:47.039> two<00:04:47.309> point<00:04:47.609> six<00:04:47.939> times<00:04:48.209> the<00:04:48.599> rate<00:04:48.779> of<00:04:48.809> their

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
at two point six times the rate of their

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.389 
at two point six times the rate of their
white<00:04:50.159> peers<00:04:50.519> so<00:04:51.419> there's<00:04:51.629> a<00:04:51.689> real

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:52.399 
white peers so there's a real

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:54.289 
white peers so there's a real
humanitarian<00:04:53.399> reason<00:04:53.669> why<00:04:53.759> we're<00:04:53.969> in<00:04:53.999> this<00:04:54.149> as

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:54.299 
humanitarian reason why we're in this as

00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:57.979 
humanitarian reason why we're in this as
well<00:04:54.569> I<00:04:56.239> mentioned<00:04:57.239> the<00:04:57.299> pilot<00:04:57.599> program<00:04:57.959> that

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:57.989 
well I mentioned the pilot program that

00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:59.839 
well I mentioned the pilot program that
we're<00:04:58.289> doing<00:04:58.379> in<00:04:58.589> Atlanta<00:04:58.679> and<00:04:59.189> we<00:04:59.219> have<00:04:59.429> we

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
we're doing in Atlanta and we have we

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.519 
we're doing in Atlanta and we have we
see<00:05:00.089> that<00:05:00.239> as<00:05:00.359> a<00:05:00.389> model<00:05:00.719> program<00:05:01.229> that<00:05:01.439> we

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:01.529 
see that as a model program that we

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.679 
see that as a model program that we
could<00:05:01.709> administer<00:05:02.579> in<00:05:02.969> cities<00:05:03.329> all<00:05:03.539> across

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689 
could administer in cities all across

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.419 
could administer in cities all across
the<00:05:04.019> country<00:05:04.169> but<00:05:04.559> the<00:05:04.679> key<00:05:04.889> to<00:05:04.949> that<00:05:05.129> program

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:05.429 
the country but the key to that program

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:08.419 
the country but the key to that program
this<00:05:06.329> local<00:05:06.749> financial<00:05:07.049> support<00:05:07.619> and<00:05:07.769> local
