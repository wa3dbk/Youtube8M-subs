00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.680
 12 spyder is the second car 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.500
 presented by mclaren the two years 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.650
 respecting the mclaren programs of ron 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.080
 dennis who want introduced on 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.300
 market a car this year 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.200
 we brought the 12c that a preview 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.870
 Italian the car to the same development 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.239
 of the coupe so let's start from one 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.180
 carbon platform weighing 75 kg 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.780
 the engine is a 3008 biturbo that it develops 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.490
 to 625 horses and we have all the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:17.950
 formula 1 technology set up 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:20.950
 street there was a great job of the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.410
 mclaren engineers in building this 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.440
 car especially with regards to 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.360
 just the roof the car weighs only 40 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.070
 more pounds than the coupe e 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.899
 this is a great innovation that 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.600
 who did was toria under a 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.100
 mclaren carbon frame roof is 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.950
 was the pioneer of carbon frames 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.880
 in formula 1 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.310
 1181 to the active suspension at the break 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.280
 stir that brakes inside rear wheel 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.860
 and acts as a self-locking differential 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.079
 on the brake which is a brake 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.990
 aerodynamics that from downforce on 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.520
 rear braking performance the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.799
 before the class they remain unchanged 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.799
 compared to the coupÃ© thanks to the weight 0 100 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.229
 in 3 seconds 10200 known seconds and novell 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.829
 top speed and 329 at their price of 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.310
 sale in Italy of 237,100 including VAT 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.230
 the p1 is the car the supercar you will see 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.410
 the light next year will be presented 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.970
 in definitive guise at the Geneva Motor Show 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.849
 it is a machine that will be in circulation 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.720
 limited to 500 in the world 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.569
 technical features are not known 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.459
 however, the will still be noteworthy 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.840
 most impressive on 103 100 not 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.239
 however the data have been communicated yet 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.239
 I think they are important data
