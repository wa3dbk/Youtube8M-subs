00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.570 

potatoes<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> microwave<00:01:25.860> we're<00:01:26.460> gonna

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
potatoes in the microwave we're gonna

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.969 
potatoes in the microwave we're gonna

leave within that at the highest setting
for<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.640> eight<00:01:29.850> minutes<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.930> soften<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.440> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
for about eight minutes to soften up a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.300 
for about eight minutes to soften up a
little<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.950> open<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.700 

Portia<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.210> said<00:01:37.480> find<00:01:37.690> me

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.560 

right<00:01:43.710> subjected<00:01:44.370> potatoes<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:45.120> been<00:01:45.150> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
right subjected potatoes have been in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.930 
right subjected potatoes have been in
the<00:01:45.720> microwave<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.230> eight<00:01:46.440> minutes<00:01:46.770> now

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
the microwave for eight minutes now

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.100 
the microwave for eight minutes now
hopefully<00:01:47.940> they've<00:01:48.210> softened<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:48.960> we're

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
hopefully they've softened up and we're

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.510 
hopefully they've softened up and we're
going<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.320> make<00:01:49.440> them<00:01:49.590> nice<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.830> let's<00:01:50.160> be<00:01:50.310> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
going to make them nice and let's be in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.600 
going to make them nice and let's be in
the<00:01:50.790> oven<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.300> another<00:01:51.360> 25<00:01:52.170> minutes<00:01:52.230> or<00:01:52.710> so

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.010 

this<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.730> a<00:01:56.760> really<00:01:57.120> good<00:01:57.240> way<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> doing<00:01:57.690> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
this is a really good way of doing it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.410 
this is a really good way of doing it
because<00:01:58.440> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> microwave<00:01:59.700> they<00:01:59.940> don't<00:02:00.180> end

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
because in the microwave they don't end

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660 
because in the microwave they don't end
up<00:02:00.720> coming<00:02:00.990> nice<00:02:01.140> crispy<00:02:01.560> skin<00:02:01.830> if<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.550> do

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
up coming nice crispy skin if you do

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.220 
up coming nice crispy skin if you do
them<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> oven<00:02:03.360> they'll<00:02:03.870> end<00:02:04.110> up

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
them in the oven they'll end up

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.260 
them in the oven they'll end up
delicious<00:02:04.830> but<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.550> take<00:02:05.760> about<00:02:05.880> two<00:02:06.210> hours

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
delicious but they take about two hours

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.530 
delicious but they take about two hours
so<00:02:07.130> if<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.399> both<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.060> best<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.390> both

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
so if you do both it's the best of both

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.930 
so if you do both it's the best of both
worlds<00:02:09.979> but<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.160> there<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> other

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
worlds but in there going to the other

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.020 
worlds but in there going to the other
leg<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.360> about<00:02:12.770> 220<00:02:13.770> ORS<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.520> high<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.000> can

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
leg is about 220 ORS as high as you can

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.120 
leg is about 220 ORS as high as you can
get<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.480> because<00:02:15.630> run<00:02:16.410> them<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.710> nice<00:02:16.860> and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
get it because run them to be nice and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.850 
get it because run them to be nice and
crispy<00:02:17.520> but<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.790> don't<00:02:17.940> want<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.210> take<00:02:18.390> long

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
crispy but we don't want it to take long

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.050
