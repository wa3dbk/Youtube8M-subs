good as a control method to sort of try

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.370 
good as a control method to sort of try
out<00:02:01.369> some<00:02:01.640> new<00:02:01.729> stuff<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.630> as<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.200> see

instead of the usual X&amp;Y asks you to

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.889 
instead of the usual X&amp;Y asks you to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
to flick and make them explode into a

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.449 
to flick and make them explode into a
dismissal<00:02:14.599> command<00:02:14.870> style<00:02:15.080> game<00:02:15.459> though

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
dismissal command style game though

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.880 
dismissal command style game though
sometimes<00:02:16.819> really<00:02:17.000> responsive<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:18.500> actually

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
sometimes really responsive it actually

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.100 
sometimes really responsive it actually
feels<00:02:19.099> really<00:02:19.280> good<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.870> we're<00:02:20.870> really<00:02:20.959> proud

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110

touchpad you see Anquan Boldin going in

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.390 
touchpad you see Anquan Boldin going in
motion<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.140> way<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.560> swiped<00:02:42.950> across<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
motion the way that I swiped across the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.940

touchpad<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:45.220> I'm<00:02:46.220> going<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.489> run<00:02:46.670> my<00:02:46.909> play

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
touchpad and I'm going to run my play

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.680 
touchpad and I'm going to run my play
another<00:02:48.950> way<00:02:49.129> it<00:02:49.280> uses<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> select<00:02:50.120> button<00:02:50.329> so

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
another way it uses a select button so

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.170 
another way it uses a select button so
the<00:02:51.409> most<00:02:52.010> important<00:02:52.459> thing<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.790> game<00:02:53.000> play

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
the most important thing in game play

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.180 
the most important thing in game play
with<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:53.480> select<00:02:53.750> button<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.140> used<00:02:54.319> for<00:02:54.650> is

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
with the select button is used for is

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.539 
with the select button is used for is
time<00:02:55.519> out<00:02:59.049> we<00:03:00.069> took<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.220> approach<00:03:01.310> that

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
time out we took the approach that

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.699 
time out we took the approach that
simple<00:03:02.420> would<00:03:02.599> be<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.750> lot<00:03:02.959> easier<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.379> mean<00:03:03.590> we

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
simple would be a lot easier I mean we

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.539 
simple would be a lot easier I mean we
kind<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.730> worked<00:03:04.909> with<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> lot<00:03:05.329> of<00:03:05.359> different

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
kind of worked with a lot of different

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.349 
kind of worked with a lot of different
scenarios<00:03:07.549> on<00:03:07.670> how<00:03:07.730> we<00:03:07.879> were<00:03:08.030> going<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.239> use

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
scenarios on how we were going to use

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.050 
scenarios on how we were going to use
this<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:09.109> essentially<00:03:09.769> when<00:03:10.459> I'm<00:03:10.549> on<00:03:10.670> offense

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
this but essentially when I'm on offense

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.670 
this but essentially when I'm on offense
or<00:03:11.209> on<00:03:11.329> defense<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:12.019> can<00:03:12.560> actually<00:03:12.859> just<00:03:13.519> call

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
or on defense I can actually just call

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.530 
or on defense I can actually just call
quick<00:03:15.680> plays<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.370> can<00:03:16.909> actually<00:03:17.060> change<00:03:17.239> my

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
quick plays I can actually change my

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.009 
quick plays I can actually change my
defense<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.079> if<00:03:18.170> I'm<00:03:18.680> scrolling<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:20.540> way<00:03:20.720> it

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
defense so if I'm scrolling this way it

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.740 
defense so if I'm scrolling this way it
will<00:03:21.139> change<00:03:21.379> to<00:03:21.530> 1<00:03:22.310> 3<00:03:22.549> 1<00:03:22.900> in<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:25.310> 3<00:03:25.670> or<00:03:25.940> 3<00:03:26.569> to

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
will change to 1 3 1 in to 3 or 3 to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.009 
will change to 1 3 1 in to 3 or 3 to
zone<00:03:27.040> or<00:03:28.040> man-to-man<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.569> additional

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
zone or man-to-man so the additional

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.759 
zone or man-to-man so the additional
thing<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.409> you<00:03:30.500> can<00:03:30.680> do<00:03:30.859> is<00:03:32.319> press<00:03:33.319> down<00:03:33.349> on

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
rhythm icons and those will kind of

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.809 
rhythm icons and those will kind of
explain<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.129> whether<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.459> particular

PlayStation 4 obviously and in the game
we<00:03:54.750> use<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.260> touchpad<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.069> PlayStation<00:03:56.610> 4

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
we use the touchpad on the PlayStation 4

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.059 
we use the touchpad on the PlayStation 4
controller<00:03:56.849> to<00:03:57.239> control<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.599> map<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.470> the
