 I wrote on how to spend summer vacation 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:29.360
 It is the first time to rent a bike to get things done first 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:32.580
 Going home , take out a notebook from the bag , spread it on the desk and hold it first, not pencil 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:37.800
 It was a controller of PlayStation 3 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:40.770
 All that made it do what you hear what you see Raising Once up the body is outside a fresh 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.810
 How many times have you ever seen the scene getting brighter? 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.520

 About people who are doing long 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.750
 I will feel the mannerism

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:10.510
 Going to choose harder things or seeking healing Soak up a mink rafter 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:15.550
 Or moved to the genre, such as use of the head such as a shift or strategy and table games to 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.150
 Along with the construction it will change gradually to play people be afraid is to become one person going to decrease together, such as time 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.090
 How many books thailand 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.119
 If you notice that you do not even automatically 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.190
 It 's normal not anything strange 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:34.909
 It is a way that everyone goes through 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:39.740

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.760

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.150
 The final match will be held, or it will have a total of 80,000 visitors in live broadcasts 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.520
 I had claimed as of them one person 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.500
 There are many comments such as extraterrestrial and extraterrestrial battle Yamecha viewpoint, etc., and the player's fine play 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.980
 Both the lively seats and comments are rising 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.800
 The final match, which took three hours in the final alone , resulted in a co-op from day to day 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.170
 The team that is cheering has lost in the final 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.580

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.650
 I think so right 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:39.440
 cod and bf are about 90% different games with just the same fps genre 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.020
 Seeing the moon's play on ef makes it go for cod's playing 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.780

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:14.970
 And still it is best to see in real time to feel the heat 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.590
 The sense of unity that the viewer and the player are looking at the same thing at the same moment makes the tournament a viewer 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.739
 I think it is the most fun way to see 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.800

 It is not play if it is the best 8 game 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:39.400
