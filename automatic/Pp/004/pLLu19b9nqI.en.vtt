00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
roughly translated it means chicken with

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.610 
roughly translated it means chicken with
a<00:00:40.020> card<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.790> um<00:00:41.790> German<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.260> first

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
a card and um German I think so first

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.060 
a card and um German I think so first
thing<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> need<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.309> chicken<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
thing you need is chicken I think a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
thing you need is chicken I think a
plate<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:49.309> knife<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:52.320> deck<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.649> playing

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
plate a knife and the deck of playing

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 
plate a knife and the deck of playing
cards<00:00:53.360> now<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.690> lot<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.960> people<00:00:55.079> make<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
cards now a lot of people make the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.150 
cards now a lot of people make the
mistake<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:56.660> getting<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.899> deck<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.410> 52

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
mistake of getting a deck with 52

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.240 
mistake of getting a deck with 52
individual<00:01:00.090> cards<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:02.039> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
individual cards and it's not really so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.860 
individual cards and it's not really so
much<00:01:02.309> how<00:01:02.640> many<00:01:02.879> cards<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.780> your

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
much how many cards do you have in your

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.160 
much how many cards do you have in your
deck<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> parameters<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:05.970> deck<00:01:06.299> for

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
deck but the parameters of your deck for

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.580 
deck but the parameters of your deck for
instance<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.650> cards<00:01:08.100> should<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.850> roughly

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
instance your cards should be roughly

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.890 
instance your cards should be roughly
one-fourth<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.860> size<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.060> chicken<00:01:12.450> what

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
one-fourth the size of the chicken what

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.219 
one-fourth the size of the chicken what
I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> chicken<00:01:15.020> also<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> lot<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I think is a chicken also a lot of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.410 
I think is a chicken also a lot of
people<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:17.369> complicate<00:01:18.119> things<00:01:18.270> by

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
people really complicate things by

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
people really complicate things by
picking<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.110> special<00:01:19.770> cards<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
picking out special cards to put in the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
picking out special cards to put in the
dish<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.030> don't<00:01:21.270> need<00:01:21.570> any<00:01:21.900> kind<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.650> special

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
dish you don't need any kind of special
