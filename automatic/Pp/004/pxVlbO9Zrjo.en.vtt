00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.219
 well let's get to the heart of the matter and see how do we do to 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.989
 create a betting agreement 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:14.360
 so for that it's just a legal condition a thing to know 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.209
 parents were the paris deals 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.590
 these are the agreements found 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.130
 we must already know some agreements found actively knew 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.650
 not 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 it's useless to attack the barea people we could not my choice 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.119
 will be done today 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.980
 and in addition we play too early for you to work 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.630
 so we're going to base ourselves we'll start by taking an agreement from minas gerais then 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.880
 just in case you do not know by heart 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.120
 small reminder the diagram 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 we have the migratory agreement the sixth body 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.700
 ouanna the major who will be placed on the fifth string the rope there the father 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.300
 p the rope of may 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.559
 will be loaned countess 2 that's also with the ring finger 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.650
 the ground agreement the third string will be loaned for the occasion a with their 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.700
 wives 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.600
 and to finish the two bodies daegu the bodies of six nice roms but it's not 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.870
 obvious 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.019
 true 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.440
 the planner 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.760
 if you have trouble with that already 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.149
 it's too early to attack paris 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.880
 come back later 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.210
 so the first of the Arab things that comes worse if we understand it but 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.510
 I insist on that 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.440
 I said that you had to know these agreements made it possible to know them 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.210
 correctly 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.040
 if you remember the lesson we saw in the agreements for 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.790
 beginners learn to read and play chords for beginners for the 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.890
 full title of the court 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.020
 we saw that our agreement we will not spit all the strings 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.609
 and that is 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.109
 indispensable know by heart if you want to harvest 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.220
 if you did not know that 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.210
 after mistakes 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.500
 It's that simple 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.110
 moqadem images one is inter boss since the meaning and scratch the six 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.570
 strings the six bodies partly agree but place apart 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.229
 but as for the agreements as the best major auto 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.189
 we will not always spit the six strings and it is by distance money so 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.949
 stosur to know which body partly agree and sneers are not part 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.760
 so make sure you have to find agreements that women are 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.030
 correct 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.979
 some sites unfortunately published at gramoun did not say which camp it takes 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.280
 scratch and that's pretty serious tonight 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.540
 a lot of mistakes 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 in case of doubt but other sites with three small dots like went 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.330
 friday on a chord all the diagrams are correctly we have 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.969
 verified g20 who even worship 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.409
 the whole school was respected correctly 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.819
 so what are we going to do because major and well we will stay in the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.779
 annals of the guitar she really had what's going on the diagram 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.729
 we learn the diagram of the imager so 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.669
 and we will take each name 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:26.500
 of the agreement 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.680
 and when I talk about our timeline on the term a note 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.879
 it's not just 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.799
 pilots who are lent by fingers on some strings 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.729
 as soon as we scratch the body dancing the corsa will produce a note 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.489
 customers finger on you that the agreement were fighting to come it makes a note 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.739
 so there in the case of the swimmer we have synapse 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.999
 the agreement will give a 52-minute course in Lille 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.400
 the agreement of the arrival will grant cash the summer rope on the 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.399
 prosthesis one that makes a good synapse different 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.600
 and that each of these notes are not pros 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.109
 and we go all the shifted the same number of boxes to treble 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.269
 he lived it's clear the medical profession 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.870
 well we'll start among which and all of a single caste 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.700
 the migratory agreement that was before in zero box 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.749
 vassor found up a 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:16.319
 not too difficult until then 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.919
 the agreement to leave it before 3 pm finding box 3 will grant it 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.339
 was as shameful also finds himself in disaster 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:27.579
 the accord of 115 a mostly castes the bodies of six he told me that I was 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.399
 again david finds himself up a 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.999
 it's really not that difficult until then everything we did 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.279
 more than a year on all case number 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.279
 and when we see this model not to predict 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.409
 chartered sinotte 6 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.219
 but we attack 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.869
 tricky thing you're not going there I was wrong somewhere 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:47.260
 but no it's complicated 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.899
 that's the concept of device 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.399
 we used in this must to celebrate 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:52.689
 several bodies 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.540
 concretely in the calculation of the chord we like to create there and so a lot 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.510
 a lot of cases 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.749
 it makes the index if the finish 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.440
 several high level corps of 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.489
 smaller boxes 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.839
 we can in this case to mark that we grant serious mine 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:09.979
 the saw cord she grants medium which are all three lent to the crate 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:11.009
 a 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:12.759
 well we'll take a text 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:13.789
 and the master 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.429
 on all strings 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.709
 like that I think in 2006 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.560
 affected 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.459
 this pensioner in question 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.799
 that's what we want 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.539
 and the places we have 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.389
 will be used to treat the three high notes of the agreement so we encase 3 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.889
 connect there because cross will grant me 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.819
 and what game on the ground rope 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.879
 rings makes our new agreement 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.749
 fluently would it be no less sitra the streak by e-mail by putting a 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.389
 big traits all know several points to indicate the road the wood goes 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.340
 to ask 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.650
 and that's why we call stop agreements because we 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.319
 has a little hasty trimmed 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.150
 all the strings 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.680
 so here if you try it at home to make this deal is likely 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.420
 for you did not succeed you had been played miserably 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.849
 quite normal an agreement will try again 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.659
 very difficult to do the first time and even the postulants at the site 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.319
 do not worry it's normal if there were not 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.389
 do not expect to find once again in the court the agreements 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.699
 stop for beginners how to work it properly 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.150
 we try to understand how to create our agreements bars &amp; co members to be in 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.969
 agreement with 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.460
 we took our image agreement 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.570
 veiled we shifted all the notes 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.570
 one box each 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.240
 we will not stop there 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.919
 later we can shifted to other cellars still class 2 m 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.210
 24 3 moment waterfall 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.330
 vexed ground 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.150
 and we can also use 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.810
 other telegrams agree but not necessarily want to use the major on 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.779
 can use mine for example 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:43.719
 or C major and ap with any other chord we know 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:44.660
 could shift 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.980
 but for that we'll see how the second part
