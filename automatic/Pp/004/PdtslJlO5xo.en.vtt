it<00:00:24.439> got<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> 16<00:00:25.980> horsepower<00:00:26.869> I'm<00:00:27.869> really<00:00:28.230> having

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
it got a 16 horsepower I'm really having

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.280 
it got a 16 horsepower I'm really having
trouble<00:00:28.590> though<00:00:30.890> with<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:33.149> jack<00:00:33.420> shaft<00:00:33.719> setup

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
trouble though with the jack shaft setup

here<00:00:34.620> I've<00:00:34.920> got<00:00:35.160> new<00:00:35.280> Baron's<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.940> now

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
here I've got new Baron's in it now

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.389 
here I've got new Baron's in it now
I<00:00:36.480> haven't<00:00:37.469> wrote<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.860> since<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.399> don't

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
I haven't wrote it since but I don't

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.630 
I haven't wrote it since but I don't
know<00:00:42.230> what<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.410> doing<00:00:43.770> wrong

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
know what I'm doing wrong

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.740 
know what I'm doing wrong
I<00:00:45.050> needed<00:00:46.050> anyone<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.129> could<00:00:48.059> give<00:00:48.239> me<00:00:48.329> advice

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
I needed anyone I could give me advice

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
I needed anyone I could give me advice
and<00:00:50.449> what<00:00:51.449> I'm<00:00:51.600> doing<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.610> field<00:00:53.610> plus

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and what I'm doing in that field plus

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.119 
and what I'm doing in that field plus
the<00:00:55.520> motors<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.820> much<00:00:56.940> torque<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:58.129> I've

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the motors got so much torque that I've

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.709 
the motors got so much torque that I've
got<00:00:59.489> a<00:01:00.500> thinking<00:01:01.500> about<00:01:02.149> hooking<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.390> brace

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
got a thinking about hooking a brace

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
got a thinking about hooking a brace
somewheres<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> motor<00:01:05.880> doesn't

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
somewheres in here so the motor doesn't

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.469 
somewheres in here so the motor doesn't
go<00:01:06.390> back<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.869> forth<00:01:07.909> because<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> give

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
go back and forth because when you give

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.370 
go back and forth because when you give
it<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> throttle<00:01:10.549> takeoffs<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> little

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
it the throttle takeoffs are a little

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:26.929 
it the throttle takeoffs are a little
rough<00:01:13.580> yeah<00:01:17.659> yeah<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> anyways<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
rough yeah yeah so anyways this is the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.730 
rough yeah yeah so anyways this is the
beast

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

sixteen<00:01:29.610> horse<00:01:29.850> Duramax<00:01:32.990> when<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.290> had<00:01:34.560> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
sixteen horse Duramax when I have had it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.390 
sixteen horse Duramax when I have had it
running<00:01:35.100> it'll<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.550> close<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.740> between<00:01:37.740> 35<00:01:38.370> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
running it'll do close to between 35 and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.990 
running it'll do close to between 35 and
40<00:01:38.850> miles<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.210> hour

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.920 

better<00:01:45.000> 62<00:01:45.570> 3r<00:01:46.070> Jack<00:01:47.070> shafts<00:01:47.370> there<00:01:50.780> was<00:01:51.780> quite

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
better 62 3r Jack shafts there was quite

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.570 
better 62 3r Jack shafts there was quite
a<00:01:51.960> bit<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> engineering<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.920> friend<00:01:53.190> Randy

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
a bit of engineering my friend Randy

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
a bit of engineering my friend Randy
Eastman<00:01:54.380> he<00:01:55.380> did<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> lot<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.520> fab<00:01:56.880> work<00:01:57.150> on<00:01:57.420> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
Eastman he did a lot of fab work on it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.889 
Eastman he did a lot of fab work on it
and<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> thank<00:01:59.010> him<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.690> he<00:02:00.690> did

come<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.500> idea<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> running

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
come up with the idea with the running

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.940 
come up with the idea with the running
boards<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:07.790> protective<00:02:08.790> plates<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.950> just

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
boards and the protective plates I just

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.510 
boards and the protective plates I just
need<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> little<00:02:11.459> bit<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:13.250> engineering<00:02:14.250> on

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
need a little bit of more engineering on

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.630 
need a little bit of more engineering on
the<00:02:14.610> rear<00:02:14.790> axle<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.280> guys<00:02:17.400> have

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the rear axle here so if you guys have

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.660 
the rear axle here so if you guys have
any<00:02:17.790> thoughts<00:02:18.060> that'd<00:02:18.390> be<00:02:18.540> great<00:02:19.489> all<00:02:20.489> right
