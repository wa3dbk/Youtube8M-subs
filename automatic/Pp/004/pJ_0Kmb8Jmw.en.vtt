example taking some like QPR and make

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.830 
example taking some like QPR and make
them<00:00:47.190> into<00:00:47.219> Europa<00:00:48.090> League<00:00:48.210> containers<00:00:48.809> or

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
them into Europa League containers or

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.150 
them into Europa League containers or
Champions<00:00:49.350> League<00:00:49.440> contenders<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.039> then

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
Champions League contenders and then

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.639 
Champions League contenders and then
like<00:00:50.340> potentially<00:00:50.969> winning<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
like potentially winning it and I I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
like potentially winning it and I I
think<00:00:53.039> that's<00:00:53.160> quite<00:00:53.250> cool<00:00:53.489> idea<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
think that's quite cool idea and I

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.450 
think that's quite cool idea and I
personally<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> good<00:00:56.309> idea

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
personally think it's a good idea

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.770 
personally think it's a good idea
because<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> means<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.329> only<00:00:57.660> one

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
because then it means I have only one

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810 
because then it means I have only one
mass<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> focus<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.460> when<00:00:59.789> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
mass with the focus on me when I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.459 
mass with the focus on me when I
actually<00:01:00.000> finish<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.539> maybe<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:00.930> for

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
actually finish it maybe when for

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
actually finish it maybe when for
example<00:01:01.500> when<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.670> champions<00:01:03.420> league<00:01:03.449> with

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
example when the champions league with

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.479 
example when the champions league with
QPR<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.409> then<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.650> move<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
QPR and then just move on because of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.690 
QPR and then just move on because of
course<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.030> move<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.600> their

thumbnails<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.799> video<00:01:38.040> which<00:01:38.250> could

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
thumbnails for this video which could

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.620 
thumbnails for this video which could
potentially<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.880> thumbnails<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.450> final

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
potentially the thumbnails for a final

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
potentially the thumbnails for a final
series<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.170> i'm<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.619> sure<00:01:40.829> yet<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.189> just

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
series so i'm not really sure yet I just

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.190 
series so i'm not really sure yet I just
saw<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> made<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.909> last<00:01:42.060> night<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:43.079> want

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
saw it made them last night I just want

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
saw it made them last night I just want
busy<00:01:43.350> wanted<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> watch<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> video<00:01:44.220> pick<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
busy wanted to watch a video pick up the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
busy wanted to watch a video pick up the
best<00:01:45.119> idea<00:01:45.329> from<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> five<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.619> five

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
best idea from the five or the five

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.410 
best idea from the five or the five
thumbnails<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:47.790> there's<00:01:47.939> basically<00:01:48.090> six

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
thumbnails but there's basically six

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
thumbnails but there's basically six
ideas<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.439> either<00:01:49.860> commenting<00:01:50.430> with

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
ideas and then either commenting with

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.039 
ideas and then either commenting with
the<00:01:50.640> team<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.000> voting<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> straw<00:01:51.659> poll<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
description so first off have the idea

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.800 
description so first off have the idea
of<00:01:56.460> playing<00:01:56.670> as<00:01:56.790> Burnley<00:01:57.210> i'm<00:01:57.479> basically

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
of playing as Burnley i'm basically

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.929 
of playing as Burnley i'm basically
Brown<00:01:58.079> you're<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> queen<00:01:58.619> sleep<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.640> can

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
Brown you're a queen sleep they I can

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.810 
Brown you're a queen sleep they I can
mold<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.299> basically<00:02:00.570> around<00:02:00.899> any<00:02:01.200> players

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
mold them basically around any players

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.100 
mold them basically around any players
to<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.939> fair<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.600> don't<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.990> much

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to be fair but I don't have that much

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.440 
to be fair but I don't have that much
money<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.640> yeah<00:02:05.640> used<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> limited

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
money to yeah used to have a limited

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150 
money to yeah used to have a limited
budget<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.259> that'd<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.590> interesting<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:08.099> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
budget so that'd be interesting if I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.740 
budget so that'd be interesting if I
could<00:02:08.280> actually<00:02:08.399> build<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.849> boat<00:02:09.239> quite<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> good

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
could actually build a boat quite a good

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.650 
could actually build a boat quite a good
team<00:02:09.959> around<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.879> young<00:02:11.879> player<00:02:12.180> player<00:02:12.480> for

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
team around a young player player for

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
team around a young player player for
the<00:02:12.690> youth<00:02:12.870> team<00:02:13.050> or<00:02:13.170> something

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the youth team or something

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.229 
the youth team or something
which<00:02:13.950> would<00:02:14.129> then<00:02:14.250> sort<00:02:14.609> of<00:02:14.670> add<00:02:14.849> more<00:02:15.090> spice

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
which would then sort of add more spice

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.149 
which would then sort of add more spice
for<00:02:15.870> example<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.230> they<00:02:16.349> left<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.040> be

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
for example if they left it would be

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.130 
for example if they left it would be
like<00:02:17.280> oh<00:02:17.430> my<00:02:17.579> God<00:02:17.760> he's<00:02:17.879> leaving<00:02:18.269> me<00:02:18.359> after<00:02:18.659> 10

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
like oh my God he's leaving me after 10

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.410 
like oh my God he's leaving me after 10
years<00:02:19.379> being<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.739> Burnley<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.609> yeah<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> thought

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
years being a Burnley so yeah I thought

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.509 
years being a Burnley so yeah I thought
burn<00:02:21.689> one<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.019> first<00:02:22.200> choice<00:02:22.439> moving<00:02:23.400> on

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
burn one of the first choice moving on

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.580 
burn one of the first choice moving on
to<00:02:23.549> Crystal<00:02:24.000> Palace<00:02:24.359> who<00:02:24.510> again<00:02:24.810> borla<00:02:25.349> sounds

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
to Crystal Palace who again borla sounds

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.899 
to Crystal Palace who again borla sounds
very<00:02:25.769> similar<00:02:25.980> team<00:02:26.219> to<00:02:26.340> Burnley<00:02:26.700> they

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
very similar team to Burnley they

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.789 
very similar team to Burnley they
survive<00:02:27.209> relegation<00:02:27.390> last<00:02:27.989> year<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.379> could

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
survive relegation last year I could

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.259 
survive relegation last year I could
take<00:02:28.920> them<00:02:29.069> take<00:02:29.609> charge<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.090> team<00:02:30.209> and

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
take them take charge of the team and

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.500 
take them take charge of the team and
push<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:30.900> into<00:02:31.109> a<00:02:31.230> higher<00:02:31.530> law<00:02:31.829> in<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.069> table

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
push them into a higher law in the table

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.089 
push them into a higher law in the table
so<00:02:33.510> with<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.019> series<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.620> particular<00:02:34.709> I'm

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
so with this series in particular I'm

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.440 
so with this series in particular I'm
not<00:02:35.219> sure<00:02:35.370> how<00:02:35.489> try<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.819> go<00:02:35.909> all<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.299> way<00:02:36.329> to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
not sure how try and go all the way to

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.789 
not sure how try and go all the way to
champions<00:02:36.900> league<00:02:37.079> or<00:02:37.260> if<00:02:37.349> i'll<00:02:37.439> just<00:02:37.469> try<00:02:37.650> and

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
champions league or if i'll just try and

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.259 
champions league or if i'll just try and
get<00:02:37.920> may<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.069> your<00:02:38.250> oppa<00:02:38.430> league<00:02:38.639> football<00:02:39.000> and

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
get may be your oppa league football and

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.699 
get may be your oppa league football and
then<00:02:39.420> actually<00:02:39.719> when<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.900> Europa<00:02:40.379> League<00:02:40.409> and

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
then actually when the Europa League and

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.470 
then actually when the Europa League and
then<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.980> know<00:02:41.099> I<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.730> move<00:02:41.939> on<00:02:42.090> from<00:02:42.269> there

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
then you know I can move on from there

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.910 
then you know I can move on from there
or<00:02:42.719> it<00:02:42.840> could<00:02:42.959> actually<00:02:43.079> just<00:02:43.230> be<00:02:43.439> like<00:02:43.560> start

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
or it could actually just be like start

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.349 
or it could actually just be like start
all<00:02:44.040> over<00:02:44.159> again<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.489> different<00:02:44.549> team<00:02:45.090> because

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
all over again a different team because

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.420 
all over again a different team because
technically<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:45.780> did<00:02:45.989> get<00:02:46.439> the<00:02:46.680> European

success so with that crystal palace or

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.369 
success so with that crystal palace or
second<00:02:50.939> choice<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.780> honest<00:02:52.019> Crystal

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
second choice to be honest Crystal

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.409 
second choice to be honest Crystal
Palace<00:02:52.620> I'm<00:02:52.769> not<00:02:53.159> really<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.579> faster<00:02:54.299> but

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
Palace I'm not really that faster but

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:55.849 
Palace I'm not really that faster but
playing<00:02:54.659> is<00:02:54.780> done<00:02:54.989> because<00:02:55.230> they<00:02:55.409> have<00:02:55.650> quite

that'll be the end of the series and

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.559 
that'll be the end of the series and
then<00:03:47.340> I'll<00:03:47.519> have<00:03:47.729> to<00:03:47.879> think<00:03:47.909> what<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.419> hell

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
then I'll have to think what the hell

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.719 
then I'll have to think what the hell
like<00:03:49.019> whatever<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.889> do<00:03:50.069> them<00:03:50.159> from<00:03:50.340> from<00:03:50.579> that

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
like whatever I do them from from that

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.939 
like whatever I do them from from that
point<00:03:50.909> onwards<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:51.389> how<00:03:51.930> really<00:03:52.319> are<00:03:52.439> as<00:03:52.620> my

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
point onwards so how really are as my

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.219 
point onwards so how really are as my
favorite<00:03:53.549> choice<00:03:53.729> but<00:03:54.419> of<00:03:54.629> course<00:03:54.930> are<00:03:55.079> there

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
favorite choice but of course are there

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.960 
favorite choice but of course are there
they're<00:03:55.439> better<00:03:55.650> choice<00:03:55.889> than<00:03:55.919> Burnley<00:03:56.759> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
they're better choice than Burnley and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.490 
they're better choice than Burnley and

that old so I catch keeping on goal for
a<00:04:24.090> good<00:04:24.240> like<00:04:24.389> four<00:04:24.900> or<00:04:25.080> five<00:04:25.110> years<00:04:25.320> before

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
a good like four or five years before

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.230 
a good like four or five years before
eventually<00:04:26.130> starts<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.580> decline

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
eventually starts to decline

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.490 
eventually starts to decline
and<00:04:27.360> become<00:04:27.569> a<00:04:27.630> dreadful<00:04:27.960> goalkeeper<00:04:28.349> as

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500
