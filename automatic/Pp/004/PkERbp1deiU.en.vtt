00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100 
at um some of the key factors let's face
it<00:01:38.340> both<00:01:38.490> these<00:01:38.670> defenses<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.509> top<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it both these defenses are not top to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.350 
it both these defenses are not top to
your<00:01:40.229> defenses<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.310> saints<00:01:41.670> /<00:01:41.850> play<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
your defenses the saints / play a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200 
your defenses the saints / play a
slightly<00:01:42.960> better<00:01:43.200> set<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.009> offensive<00:01:45.000> players

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
slightly better set of offensive players

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
slightly better set of offensive players
but<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.380> New<00:01:46.619> England<00:01:46.770> Patriots<00:01:46.950> keep

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
but I like the New England Patriots keep

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
but I like the New England Patriots keep
to<00:01:47.729> leave<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.780> football<00:01:49.140> game<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
to leave a lot in this football game to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.960 
to leave a lot in this football game to
do<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> lot<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.829> damage<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> possibly<00:01:50.759> make

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
do a lot of damage and possibly make

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.219 
do a lot of damage and possibly make
Drew<00:01:51.240> Brees<00:01:51.360> played<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.810> couple<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.110> mistakes

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Drew Brees played a couple of mistakes

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
Drew Brees played a couple of mistakes
but<00:01:52.470> I'm<00:01:53.280> picking<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> Saints<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.360> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
but I'm picking the Saints in this one I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.910 
but I'm picking the Saints in this one I
just<00:01:54.630> feel<00:01:54.780> good<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> same<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.740> them

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
just feel good about the same to them

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.520 
just feel good about the same to them
being<00:01:56.130> 50<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:57.450> looking<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
being 50 now and really looking at the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.319 
being 50 now and really looking at the
the<00:01:58.860> Doppler<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.060> moving

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the Doppler for what they can do moving

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.060 
the Doppler for what they can do moving
on<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.200> feel<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.040> many

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
on I just feel like they have so many

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.110 
on I just feel like they have so many
weapons<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.610> offense

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
weapons on offense

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.610 
weapons on offense
it's<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.480> to<00:02:03.570> matter<00:02:03.660> if<00:02:03.900> you<00:02:04.020> focus<00:02:04.500> on

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
it's not going to matter if you focus on

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.040 
it's not going to matter if you focus on
on<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:04.950> player<00:02:05.190> or<00:02:05.220> one<00:02:05.640> key<00:02:05.880> person<00:02:06.300> they<00:02:07.020> are

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
on one player or one key person they are

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.719 
on one player or one key person they are
going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.650> get<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> ball<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.220> y<00:02:08.369> receiver

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
going to get the ball to the y receiver

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.190 
going to get the ball to the y receiver
where<00:02:08.880> they<00:02:08.940> need<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.240> Drew<00:02:09.479> Brees<00:02:09.600> offensive

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
where they need to Drew Brees offensive

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320 
where they need to Drew Brees offensive
line<00:02:10.350> gets<00:02:10.619> him<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> time<00:02:11.190> he<00:02:11.220> needs<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:12.210> get
