aircraft is that this is the first one
out<00:00:23.270> of<00:00:23.570> four<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:23.840> I've<00:00:24.140> built<00:00:24.350> that<00:00:24.710> is<00:00:24.890> all

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
out of four that I've built that is all

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.440 
out of four that I've built that is all
electric<00:00:25.700> it's<00:00:26.570> got<00:00:26.779> an<00:00:26.900> acci<00:00:27.610> 5345<00:00:28.610> 14<00:00:29.119> motor

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
electric it's got an acci 5345 14 motor

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.080 
electric it's got an acci 5345 14 motor
in<00:00:29.689> it<00:00:29.869> I<00:00:30.050> have<00:00:30.829> a<00:00:30.860> castle<00:00:31.340> 110<00:00:31.700> speed

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
in it I have a castle 110 speed

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.660 
in it I have a castle 110 speed
controller<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:32.930> I'm<00:00:33.110> carrying<00:00:33.560> four<00:00:33.890> five

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
controller and I'm carrying four five

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.970 
controller and I'm carrying four five
thousand<00:00:35.210> milliamp<00:00:35.510> 6l<00:00:36.200> batteries<00:00:36.739> on<00:00:36.950> the

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
thousand milliamp 6l batteries on the

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.640 
thousand milliamp 6l batteries on the
inside<00:00:37.100> of<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.820> plane<00:00:38.060> with<00:00:38.900> those<00:00:39.079> batteries

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
inside of the plane with those batteries

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.130 
inside of the plane with those batteries
I<00:00:39.800> can<00:00:39.980> get<00:00:40.100> approximately<00:00:40.370> ten<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.420> fifteen

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
I can get approximately ten to fifteen

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.619 
I can get approximately ten to fifteen
minutes<00:00:42.469> of<00:00:42.590> flying<00:00:42.829> time<00:00:43.219> twice<00:00:43.910> with<00:00:44.449> this

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
minutes of flying time twice with this

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.360 
minutes of flying time twice with this
particular<00:00:45.350> airplane<00:00:45.710> without<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.129> recharge

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
particular airplane without a recharge

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.240 
particular airplane without a recharge
so<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.840> very<00:00:48.230> amazing<00:00:48.620> power

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
so this is a very amazing power

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.330 
so this is a very amazing power
arrangement<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:50.300> this<00:00:50.719> airplane<00:00:51.340> the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
arrangement on this airplane the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.189 
arrangement on this airplane the
airplane<00:00:52.370> is<00:00:52.940> covered<00:00:53.359> in<00:00:53.510> Glenn<00:00:53.719> Torrance

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
airplane is covered in Glenn Torrance

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.400 
airplane is covered in Glenn Torrance
actual<00:00:55.129> aircraft<00:00:55.429> linen<00:00:56.030> fabric<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:57.050> rest<00:00:57.289> of

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
actual aircraft linen fabric the rest of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.680 
actual aircraft linen fabric the rest of
the<00:00:57.500> plane<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:58.039> covered<00:00:58.429> with<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:59.239> painted

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
the plane is covered with and painted

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:37.260 
the plane is covered with and painted
with<00:01:00.170> world<00:01:01.010> tech<00:01:01.190> fabric

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.810 

so<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.500> airplane<00:01:38.799> is<00:01:39.159> really<00:01:39.549> an<00:01:39.610> amazing

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
so the airplane is really an amazing

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.300 
so the airplane is really an amazing
plane<00:01:40.299> as<00:01:40.509> far<00:01:40.720> as<00:01:40.810> applying<00:01:41.049> qualities<00:01:41.770> this

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
plane as far as applying qualities this

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.830 
plane as far as applying qualities this
point<00:01:42.579> has<00:01:42.729> two<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.090> half<00:01:43.240> times<00:01:43.540> the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
point has two and a half times the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.830 
point has two and a half times the
horsepower<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:45.009> my<00:01:45.460> gasoline<00:01:45.939> versions<00:01:46.630> with

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
horsepower of my gasoline versions with

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.230 
horsepower of my gasoline versions with
the<00:01:46.869> g26<00:01:47.649> engine<00:01:48.130> on<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.430> so<00:01:48.820> this<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.030> a

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
the g26 engine on it so this is a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.779 
the g26 engine on it so this is a
amazing<00:01:49.990> ly<00:01:50.380> powerful<00:01:50.920> aircraft<00:01:51.100> as<00:01:51.670> an

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
amazing ly powerful aircraft as an

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.090 
amazing ly powerful aircraft as an
electric<00:01:52.210> plane<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.750> two<00:01:53.289> 10-minute<00:01:53.830> flights

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
electric plane and two 10-minute flights

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.070 
electric plane and two 10-minute flights
on<00:01:54.340> one<00:01:54.520> charge<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:55.119> pretty<00:01:55.299> interesting<00:01:55.720> for

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
on one charge is pretty interesting for

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.470 
on one charge is pretty interesting for
this<00:01:56.200> plane
