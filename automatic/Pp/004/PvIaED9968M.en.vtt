myself<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.720> thought<00:03:23.930> right<00:03:23.990> next<00:03:24.710> best<00:03:24.890> bet

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950

on<00:03:56.720> took<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.590> quick<00:03:57.890> picture<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.340> once

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
on took a quick picture of that once

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.160 
on took a quick picture of that once
I've<00:03:58.640> not<00:03:58.760> seen<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:58.940> before<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.900> then<00:04:00.080> at

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
I've not seen you before and then at

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.160 
I've not seen you before and then at
first<00:04:00.350> light<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.920> left<00:04:01.850> damn<00:04:02.060> rods<00:04:02.239> gone<00:04:02.450> just

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
first light I left damn rods gone just

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.630 
first light I left damn rods gone just
tightened<00:04:03.530> up<00:04:03.590> nice<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:03.920> heavy<00:04:04.280> fight

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
tightened up nice and heavy fight

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.970 
tightened up nice and heavy fight
plotted<00:04:05.630> around<00:04:05.930> thought<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.650> might<00:04:06.770> be<00:04:06.890> the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
plotted around thought it might be the

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.740 
plotted around thought it might be the
catfish<00:04:07.310> at<00:04:07.430> first<00:04:07.670> because<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.450> was<00:04:08.510> that

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
catfish at first because it was that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.020 
catfish at first because it was that
plotting<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.590> then<00:04:09.700> when<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:10.760> got<00:04:10.790> obviously

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
plotting and then when I got obviously

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.600 
plotting and then when I got obviously
down<00:04:11.450> into<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.530> reeds<00:04:12.709> down<00:04:13.010> here<00:04:13.220> excited<00:04:13.580> to

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
down into the reeds down here excited to

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.370 
down into the reeds down here excited to
wait<00:04:14.030> out<00:04:14.209> for<00:04:14.420> its<00:04:14.540> could<00:04:14.750> see<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:14.989> was<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.110> car

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
wait out for its could see it was a car

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.909 
wait out for its could see it was a car
and<00:04:15.790> got<00:04:16.790> herself<00:04:16.910> tangled<00:04:17.450> in<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.600> reeds

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
and got herself tangled in the reeds

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.560 
and got herself tangled in the reeds
freed<00:04:18.919> it<00:04:19.070> from<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.370> then<00:04:19.910> plotted<00:04:20.239> around

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
freed it from that then plotted around

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.840 
freed it from that then plotted around
out<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.870> middle<00:04:21.080> in<00:04:21.410> which<00:04:21.580> time<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.610> did

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
out in the middle in which time I did

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.850 
out in the middle in which time I did
see<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.630> was<00:04:23.720> sloppy<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.560> old<00:04:24.680> Lake

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
see that it was sloppy so the old Lake

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.420 
see that it was sloppy so the old Lake
20<00:04:25.160> jelly<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.430> little<00:04:25.669> bit<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:27.430> basically

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
20 jelly a little bit and basically

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.800 
20 jelly a little bit and basically
rolled<00:04:28.669> in<00:04:28.850> front<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.120> net<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.300> scooped<00:04:29.630> him

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
rolled in front of the net I scooped him

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.650 
rolled in front of the net I scooped him
up<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.169> yeah<00:04:30.860> let's<00:04:31.130> have<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.250> look<00:04:31.400> at<00:04:31.520> him
