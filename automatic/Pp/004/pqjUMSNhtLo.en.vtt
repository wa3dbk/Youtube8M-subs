00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.160 
new services and tools and a lot faster
pace<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> people<00:01:03.390> were<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
pace so a lot of people were kind of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
pace so a lot of people were kind of
worried<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.830> Google<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:05.909> their

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
worried if Google was going to get their

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.820 
worried if Google was going to get their
hands<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.080> say<00:01:07.260> look<00:01:07.530> at

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
hands on this because they say look at

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.850 
hands on this because they say look at
what<00:01:08.460> they've<00:01:09.000> done<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.479> YouTube<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.350> now

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
what they've done with YouTube and now

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.190 
what they've done with YouTube and now
having<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> sign<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.670> with<00:01:11.850> Google+<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
having to sign in with Google+ and you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.690 
having to sign in with Google+ and you
know<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> lot<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> times<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.369> YouTube

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
know a lot of times with YouTube

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.240 
know a lot of times with YouTube
whenever<00:01:14.970> they<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.150> make<00:01:15.420> changes<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.189> lot<00:01:17.189> of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
whenever they do make changes a lot of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.160 
whenever they do make changes a lot of
the<00:01:17.400> changes<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.939> don't<00:01:18.210> make<00:01:18.420> any<00:01:18.780> sense

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the changes just don't make any sense

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.380 
the changes just don't make any sense
and<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.400> frustrates<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> people

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and so it frustrates a lot of people

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
and so it frustrates a lot of people
pisses<00:01:21.750> them<00:01:21.900> off<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:23.009> lot<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> people

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
pisses them off and a lot of people

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.940 
pisses them off and a lot of people
liked<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.450> streaming<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.080> they

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
liked which they like streaming and they

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.800 
liked which they like streaming and they
didn't<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.280> Google<00:01:26.820> getting<00:01:27.450> their<00:01:27.600> hands

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
didn't want Google getting their hands

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.499 
didn't want Google getting their hands
on<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.350> those<00:01:28.860> people<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.340> probably<00:01:29.610> going

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
on it so those people are probably going

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
on it so those people are probably going
to<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.960> happy<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.799> look<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.100> Amazon

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to be happy and if you look at Amazon

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
to be happy and if you look at Amazon
and<00:01:33.000> why<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.479> might<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.900> interested<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and why they might be interested of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.719 
and why they might be interested of
course<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.860> makes<00:01:35.009> sense<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.310> them<00:01:35.549> because

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
course it makes sense for them because

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.120 
course it makes sense for them because
they<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.150> increasingly<00:01:37.140> trying<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.860> get

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
they are increasingly trying to get

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.910 
they are increasingly trying to get
their<00:01:38.909> hands<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> little<00:01:40.320> piece<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.710> pie

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
their hands on a little piece of the pie

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
their hands on a little piece of the pie
from<00:01:41.280> google<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> lot<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.150> other<00:01:42.299> companies

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
from google and a lot of other companies

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.190 
from google and a lot of other companies
you<00:01:43.439> look<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.740> their<00:01:43.890> streaming<00:01:44.220> services

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
