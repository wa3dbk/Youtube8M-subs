00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.380
 so the maxiscoot license 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.029
 can be anyway huh 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.760
 advantage when we live the big 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.260
 cities like Paris Paris region 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.730
 we still have a lot more comfort 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.660
 driving 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.940
 with a scooter 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 complicated months to handle these issues of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
 nullity me I'm someone who sees 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.410
 the utility of having a motorcycle speed on 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.690
 paris in the caps for the license 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 maxi scooter there is the same test as 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.280
 for lagotto have to push the bike in 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.910
 before turning it backwards 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910
 in bodies 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.540
 then there are technical checks and after 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.190
 the difference for the test 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.230
 launched course that 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.760
 they do not have a stopwatch to manage the 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.380
 donations that can pass through 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.380
 since there is no management on the trip 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.230
 the lan weighs everything simple are mixed 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.510
 de france end separated after but his 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.200
 novels that are on speed motorcycles 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.930
 honda the clutch 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.150
 I love the brother is pretty much 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.800
 the same so for the fast and well it's 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.500
 all the same it's going to be maybe a 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.450
 little bit more complex in the management 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 of avoidance its tendency to spin a 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.310
 little and he's a little bit more 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.659
 bulky than the current bikes for 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:15.959
 the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:17.849
 this moment then the difficulty actually 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.840
 on maxi scooter is what we do when 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.640
 avoidance is avoided 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840
 we have no engine brake ie 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.459
 that as now with the new 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.459
 in front of us is 50 km 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.760
 hard for the apa the promoter whose orly 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.180
 after you have obtained your license 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.900
 we 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.020
 to the possibility of 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.120
 pass a module with the auto Ã©cole which 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.260
 it will actually allow you to drive 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 a gearbox motorcycle
