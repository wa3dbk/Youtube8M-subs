00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.119
 it's a call on 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.769
 Moreover, it is fun to watch 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.769

 the one who made the band in such sour comments at that match against Ajax 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.469
 these channels in the Netherlands 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.559
 what did he normally have 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.080
 and then very briefly and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 don't say no chance yet 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.999
 that seems like a good position 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.999
 houthulst and that's it 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.999
