and this might be a condenser microphone
that<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:40.020> right<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.780> MXL

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
that I have right here this is the MXL

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.830 
that I have right here this is the MXL
990<00:00:44.329> it<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:46.160> basic<00:00:47.300> condenser<00:00:48.300> microphone

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
990 it is a basic condenser microphone

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
990 it is a basic condenser microphone
cost<00:00:49.170> me<00:00:49.350> about<00:00:49.469> $60<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.489> nice<00:00:51.120> thing

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
cost me about $60 and the nice thing

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.410 
cost me about $60 and the nice thing
about<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.460> again<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.820> ideal<00:00:54.329> for

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
about this is that again it's ideal for

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.099 
about this is that again it's ideal for
studio<00:00:55.079> recording<00:00:56.510> however<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.899> type<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
studio recording however this type of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
studio recording however this type of
microphone<00:00:58.620> being<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> condenser<00:00:59.730> requires

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
microphone being in condenser requires

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.470 
microphone being in condenser requires
phantom<00:01:01.320> power<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.160> other<00:01:02.609> words<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.059> requires

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
phantom power in other words it requires

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.850 
phantom power in other words it requires
power<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:05.400> used<00:01:05.689> unlike<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.960> many<00:01:07.560> types

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
power to be used unlike the many types

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.850 
power to be used unlike the many types
of<00:01:08.100> dynamic<00:01:08.640> microphones<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.170> addition<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
of dynamic microphones so in addition to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.660 
of dynamic microphones so in addition to
the<00:01:11.189> microphone<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.540> also<00:01:12.780> need

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
the microphone you're going to also need

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.330 
the microphone you're going to also need
some<00:01:14.670> type<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> audio<00:01:15.600> interface<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
some type of audio interface this is the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.270 
some type of audio interface this is the
USB<00:01:17.880> dual<00:01:18.180> pre<00:01:18.270> amp<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.619> very<00:01:19.890> small

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
USB dual pre amp it's a very small

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.179 
USB dual pre amp it's a very small
preamp<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.229> people<00:01:22.229> might<00:01:22.409> ask<00:01:22.619> what's<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
preamp and people might ask what's the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.760 
preamp and people might ask what's the
difference<00:01:23.520> between<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.939> audio<00:01:24.930> interface<00:01:25.530> of

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
difference between a audio interface of

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770 
difference between a audio interface of
preamp<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.850> sound<00:01:27.150> card

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
preamp and a sound card

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
preamp and a sound card
well<00:01:28.200> basically<00:01:28.740> sound<00:01:29.100> cards<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.729> built

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
well basically sound cards are built

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899 
well basically sound cards are built
into<00:01:30.479> computers<00:01:31.350> generally<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.640> also

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
into computers generally there are also

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
into computers generally there are also
external<00:01:33.600> sound<00:01:33.990> cards<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> nice<00:01:35.159> thing

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
external sound cards but the nice thing

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880 
external sound cards but the nice thing
about<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.850> audio<00:01:36.390> interface<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.650> work

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
about an audio interface which will work

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.580 
about an audio interface which will work
with<00:01:38.220> many<00:01:38.820> types<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.390> microphones<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> also

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
with many types of microphones and also

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.920 
with many types of microphones and also
work<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> dynamic<00:01:41.579> microphone<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.810> has
