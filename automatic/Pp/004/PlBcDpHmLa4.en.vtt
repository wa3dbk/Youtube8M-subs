can you tell us a little bit about this

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.890 
can you tell us a little bit about this
new<00:00:14.370> initiative<00:00:14.549> we've<00:00:14.969> got<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.360> brand<00:00:15.839> new

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
new initiative we've got a brand new

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.710 
new initiative we've got a brand new
green<00:00:16.770> clay<00:00:17.039> court<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.699> Sydney<00:00:18.000> yeah<00:00:18.449> look

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
green clay court in Sydney yeah look

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.080 
green clay court in Sydney yeah look
it's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> little<00:00:19.170> bit<00:00:19.289> quicker<00:00:19.500> than<00:00:20.000> in<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
it's a little bit quicker than in the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.720 
it's a little bit quicker than in the
European<00:00:21.570> clay<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.560> think<00:00:22.830> probably<00:00:23.310> for

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
European clay but I think probably for

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.210 
European clay but I think probably for
our<00:00:23.880> conditions<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> hot<00:00:25.529> summers<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
our conditions with the hot summers and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.370 
our conditions with the hot summers and
wind<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.570> probably<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.050> very

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
wind that this will probably be a very

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.259 
wind that this will probably be a very
good<00:00:28.529> surface<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.130> us<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> very

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
good surface for us this is the very

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
good surface for us this is the very
first<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.840> we've<00:00:31.019> had<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.289> Australia<00:00:31.410> it's

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
first one we've had in Australia it's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.440 
first one we've had in Australia it's
only<00:00:32.130> been<00:00:32.279> late<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.730> last<00:00:32.910> few<00:00:33.120> weeks<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
only been late in the last few weeks a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.209 
only been late in the last few weeks a
couple<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:34.110> weeks<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.890> what's<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> idea

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
couple of weeks there so what's the idea

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.950 
couple of weeks there so what's the idea
behind<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> achieve

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
behind it what do we have to achieve

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
behind it what do we have to achieve
with<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.380> title<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.280> look<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.550> all<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
with this title and you look at all the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.270 
with this title and you look at all the
top<00:00:38.940> players<00:00:39.379> that<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.530> doing<00:00:40.860> well<00:00:41.070> these

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
top players that are doing well these

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
top players that are doing well these
days<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.850> they've<00:00:42.180> probably<00:00:42.420> been<00:00:42.660> all

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
days that they've probably been all

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.229 
days that they've probably been all
brought<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.590> clay<00:00:43.860> or<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> majority<00:00:45.030> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
brought up on clay or the majority of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.510 
brought up on clay or the majority of
them<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.770> something<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> think

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
them have so it's something that I think

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.880 
them have so it's something that I think
tennis<00:00:47.910> Australia<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.450> considered<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.350> quite

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
tennis Australia is considered for quite

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.110 
tennis Australia is considered for quite
a<00:00:49.920> while<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.520> they're<00:00:50.730> doing<00:00:50.850> something

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a while and now they're doing something

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.630 
a while and now they're doing something
about<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.070> 50s<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
about it you can go back in the 50s and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
about it you can go back in the 50s and
60s<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:54.239> Australia<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:54.960> dominated

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
60s when Australia really dominated

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.750 
60s when Australia really dominated
tennis<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.829> think<00:00:58.829> nearly<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
tennis and I think nearly all the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.939 
tennis and I think nearly all the
players<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.600> Labour's<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.379> Rose<00:01:01.559> rules

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
players the Labour's and the Rose rules

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.460 
players the Labour's and the Rose rules
and<00:01:02.190> Newcomb's<00:01:02.879> were<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.750> brought<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and Newcomb's were all brought up on the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.160 
and Newcomb's were all brought up on the
sandy<00:01:05.159> loam<00:01:05.339> courts<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:06.330> went<00:01:06.540> away<00:01:06.659> from<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
sandy loam courts we went away from that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.660 
sandy loam courts we went away from that
we<00:01:07.320> lost<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.619> lot<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> courts<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.490> course

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
we lost a lot of courts and of course

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.300 
we lost a lot of courts and of course
the<00:01:08.880> synthetic<00:01:09.390> grass<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:09.930> came<00:01:10.200> came<00:01:11.100> in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the synthetic grass then came came in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640 
the synthetic grass then came came in
and<00:01:11.549> yeah<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.290> did<00:01:13.470> help

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and yeah I think that really did help

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.770 
and yeah I think that really did help
hurt<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> development<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> Australian

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
hurt the development of Australian

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
hurt the development of Australian
tennis<00:01:16.070> movement<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.189> very<00:01:17.369> important<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
tennis movement is very important in the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.749 
tennis movement is very important in the
game<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.570> tennis<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.619> clay<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.100> allows<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
game of tennis and on clay it allows you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.940 
game of tennis and on clay it allows you
it's<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> different<00:01:22.110> type<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> movement<00:01:22.799> than

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it's a different type of movement than

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.060 
it's a different type of movement than
you<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> hard<00:01:24.299> courts<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.070> because

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you do on on the hard courts but because

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
you do on on the hard courts but because
you<00:01:26.490> know<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.909> many<00:01:27.000> tournaments<00:01:27.570> played<00:01:27.750> on

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you know so many tournaments played on

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.330 
you know so many tournaments played on
clay<00:01:28.080> around<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> world<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.070> it's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
clay around the world that it's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
clay around the world that it's
important<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.909> our<00:01:30.000> juniors<00:01:30.509> become

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
important that our juniors become

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.140 
important that our juniors become
accustomed<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.250> surface<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> think

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
accustomed to this surface but I think

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.390 
accustomed to this surface but I think
more<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.079> teaches<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
more it just teaches you more about the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.469 
more it just teaches you more about the
game<00:01:35.430> how<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> develop<00:01:36.930> how<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:38.479> construct

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
game how to develop how to construct

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.440 
game how to develop how to construct
points<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.829> least<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.159> long<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.579> rally<00:01:41.790> gives

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
points at least as long that rally gives

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.179

Italian clay courts in the background
here<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.259> imagine<00:01:52.649> you'd<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> few

here I imagine you'd like to see a few

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.859 
here I imagine you'd like to see a few
more<00:01:53.520> those<00:01:53.729> introduced<00:01:54.210> around<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> country

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
more those introduced around the country

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.950 
more those introduced around the country
as<00:01:54.960> well<00:01:55.110> yeah<00:01:55.860> look<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.189> think<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.659> we

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
as well yeah look I think as as we

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.530 
as well yeah look I think as as we
mentioned<00:01:58.320> tennis<00:01:58.560> Australia<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.159> still

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
mentioned tennis Australia are still

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.639 
mentioned tennis Australia are still
considering<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> different<00:02:01.110> surfaces<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
considering all the different surfaces I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
considering all the different surfaces I
think<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:01.950> important<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:03.119> get<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
think it's important that we get the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.110 
think it's important that we get the
right<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.290> our<00:02:04.439> conditions<00:02:04.979> because

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
right one for our conditions because

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.690 
right one for our conditions because
as<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.260> know<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.710> weather<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.400> a<00:02:08.490> lot

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
as you know the weather is a lot

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.219 
as you know the weather is a lot
different<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.119> Europe<00:02:09.420> than<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:09.900> in

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
different in Europe than it is here in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.750 
different in Europe than it is here in
Australia<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:11.070> know<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.310> our<00:02:11.460> harsh

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
Australia you know with our harsh

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.370 
Australia you know with our harsh
conditions<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.570> important<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.050> we<00:02:13.200> get

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
conditions it's important that we get

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.920 
conditions it's important that we get
the<00:02:13.500> right<00:02:13.680> surface<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:15.390> handle<00:02:15.810> those

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the right surface to handle those

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.750 
the right surface to handle those
conditions<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.890> go<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.280> clubs<00:02:17.550> in

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
you know it's just the culture I mean

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.170 
you know it's just the culture I mean
it's<00:02:25.170> their<00:02:25.350> baby<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:26.040> their<00:02:26.340> their<00:02:26.550> passion

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
it's their baby it's their their passion

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.930 
it's their baby it's their their passion
and<00:02:27.740> we've<00:02:28.740> just<00:02:28.770> got<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.220> develop<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.700> here

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and we've just got to develop that here

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.880 
and we've just got to develop that here
in<00:02:30.060> Australia<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.750> no<00:02:30.930> good<00:02:31.140> putting<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.770> the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
in Australia it's no good putting in the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.650 
in Australia it's no good putting in the
courts<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.430> don't<00:02:32.610> maintain<00:02:32.790> them<00:02:33.060> how<00:02:33.600> do

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
courts if you don't maintain them how do

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.300 
courts if you don't maintain them how do
you<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.140> introduction<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.920> more<00:02:35.100> clay

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
you see the introduction of more clay

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.250 
you see the introduction of more clay
courts<00:02:35.670> impacting<00:02:36.210> Australian<00:02:36.660> tennis<00:02:36.810> going

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
courts impacting Australian tennis going

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.160 
courts impacting Australian tennis going
forward<00:02:37.970> look<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.120> think<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.960> very

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
forward look I think it's a very

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.110 
forward look I think it's a very
important<00:02:40.620> step<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.070> think<00:02:41.190> it's<00:02:41.550> it's<00:02:41.910> one

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
important step I think it's it's one

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.380 
important step I think it's it's one
that<00:02:42.300> we've<00:02:42.800> needed<00:02:43.800> for<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> long<00:02:44.340> time<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
that we've needed for a long time and I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.090 
that we've needed for a long time and I
think<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> sooner<00:02:46.110> they<00:02:46.260> put<00:02:46.710> them<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:46.950> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
think the sooner they put them in the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.030 
think the sooner they put them in the
better<00:02:47.280> it'll<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.150> Australian<00:02:48.690> tennis

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
better it'll be for Australian tennis

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.410 
better it'll be for Australian tennis

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
what realistic expectations can we have
