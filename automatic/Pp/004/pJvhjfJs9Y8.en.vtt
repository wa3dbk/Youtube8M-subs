00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
of surprising but this piece is angled

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
of surprising but this piece is angled
and<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.320> fitted<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> back<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> case

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and it's fitted to the back of the case

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.580 
and it's fitted to the back of the case
and<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:39.869> really

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and so it's actually a really really

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
and so it's actually a really really
snug<00:01:41.040> fit<00:01:41.430> that's<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.810> neat

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
snug fit that's just that's a neat

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
snug fit that's just that's a neat
design<00:01:43.200> feature<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> I've<00:01:43.979> noticed<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
design feature that I've noticed now the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
design feature that I've noticed now the
point<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.600> removal<00:01:46.079> piece<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.829> that's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
point of this removal piece and that's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.039 
point of this removal piece and that's
kind<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> entire<00:01:47.759> design<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.750> case

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
kind of the entire design of this case

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.499 
kind of the entire design of this case
is<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.979> add<00:01:50.250> an<00:01:50.640> extra<00:01:51.030> 900

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
is that you can add an extra 900

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.440 
is that you can add an extra 900
milliamp<00:01:51.899> hour<00:01:52.140> battery<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.210> may

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
milliamp hour battery to it now this may

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
milliamp hour battery to it now this may
not<00:01:54.479> seem<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:54.960> much<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.040> 900<00:01:56.490> milliamp

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
not seem like much but the 900 milliamp

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
not seem like much but the 900 milliamp
battery<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.659> removable<00:01:58.049> part<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
battery the removable part is that it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.440 
battery the removable part is that it
actually<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.460> makes<00:01:59.670> sense<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.030> me

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
actually kind of makes sense to me

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
actually kind of makes sense to me
now<00:02:00.630> there's<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> big<00:02:01.110> long<00:02:01.320> explanation<00:02:01.920> on

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
now there's a big long explanation on

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.679 
now there's a big long explanation on
the<00:02:02.100> press<00:02:02.340> release<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:02.850> all<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.149> all<00:02:03.270> I'm

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the press release but all in all I'm

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.270 
the press release but all in all I'm
gonna<00:02:03.840> sum<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> all<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.439> for<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
gonna sum it all up for you is if you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.819 
gonna sum it all up for you is if you
need<00:02:05.430> power<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.659> power<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.680> on

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
need power you can get power right so on

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.380 
need power you can get power right so on
a<00:02:07.890> day<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.099> day<00:02:08.190> basis<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> might<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.119> need

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
a day to day basis you might not need

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.150 
a day to day basis you might not need
that<00:02:09.660> spare<00:02:09.959> battery<00:02:10.379> because<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
that spare battery because you know the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
that spare battery because you know the
battery<00:02:11.370> any<00:02:11.670> sort<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.150> spare<00:02:12.390> battery<00:02:12.660> pack

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
battery any sort of spare battery pack

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.390 
battery any sort of spare battery pack
is<00:02:13.110> pretty<00:02:13.200> bulky<00:02:13.860> so

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
is pretty bulky so

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.070 
is pretty bulky so
if<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.819> need<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.420> know<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.569> take<00:02:15.900> out

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
if you do need it you know you take out

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.899 
if you do need it you know you take out
the<00:02:16.470> receiver<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.159> just<00:02:17.400> slide<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
the receiver and you just slide the

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.210 
the receiver and you just slide the
spare<00:02:18.810> battery<00:02:19.110> pack<00:02:19.379> in<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.799> then<00:02:19.950> there<00:02:20.190> you

for your iPhone it can be charged

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.910 
for your iPhone it can be charged
independently<00:02:24.690> from<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> phone<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.739> can

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
independently from the phone you can

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.039 
independently from the phone you can
just<00:02:26.099> plug<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.430> into<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.790> wall<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.720> allows<00:02:27.930> you

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
just plug it into the wall it allows you

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.050

to sync your iPhone into the case but

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.300 
to sync your iPhone into the case but
from<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.840> see<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.500> can't<00:02:31.769> charge<00:02:32.129> it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
from what I can see you can't charge it

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.610 
from what I can see you can't charge it
wirelessly<00:02:32.849> which<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.780> become<00:02:34.140> awesome<00:02:34.379> if

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
wirelessly which it become awesome if

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.190 
wirelessly which it become awesome if
you<00:02:34.709> could<00:02:34.980> charge<00:02:35.310> its<00:02:35.879> wirelessly<00:02:36.599> but<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
you could charge its wirelessly but I

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.930 
you could charge its wirelessly but I
don't<00:02:37.440> see<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.739> in<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:38.010> description<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:38.730> their

now the qi wireless charging base on the

a box there's a raised bump in towards
the<00:03:22.590> bottom<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.069> case<00:03:23.250> that's<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:23.669> to

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
the bottom of the case that's just to

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.000 
the bottom of the case that's just to
help<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.120> fit<00:03:24.690> your<00:03:24.720> backbone<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.919> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
help you fit your backbone on to the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.250 
help you fit your backbone on to the
base<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.180> bottom<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.660> case<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.049> bit

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
base the bottom of the case is a bit

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.839 
base the bottom of the case is a bit
rubbery<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.859> won't<00:03:29.010> slide<00:03:29.220> off<00:03:29.280> tables

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
rubbery so it won't slide off tables

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.490 
rubbery so it won't slide off tables
easily<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.720> also<00:03:31.049> notice<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.349> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
easily and I also notice that the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.140 
easily and I also notice that the
thickness<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.220> base<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.579> almost<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.000> same

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
thickness of the base is almost the same

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.300 
thickness of the base is almost the same
as<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.389> thickness<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> case<00:03:34.349> so<00:03:35.040> those

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
as the thickness of the case so those

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.740 
as the thickness of the case so those
are<00:03:35.489> basically<00:03:35.879> all<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.060> features<00:03:36.510> again

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
are basically all the features again

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.240 
are basically all the features again
it's<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.019> pretty<00:03:37.200> simple<00:03:37.500> case<00:03:37.859> what<00:03:38.099> do<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
it's a pretty simple case what do you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.349 
it's a pretty simple case what do you
guys<00:03:38.400> think<00:03:38.669> about<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.970> qi<00:03:39.150> wireless

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
guys think about the qi wireless

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.199 
guys think about the qi wireless
charging<00:03:39.540> system<00:03:40.260> i<00:03:40.650> think<00:03:41.129> i<00:03:41.639> would<00:03:41.849> actually

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
charging system i think i would actually

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.000 
charging system i think i would actually
use<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:42.510> case<00:03:42.810> quite<00:03:43.199> a<00:03:43.260> bit<00:03:43.560> only<00:03:43.859> because

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
use this case quite a bit only because

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.670 
use this case quite a bit only because
you<00:03:44.669> know<00:03:44.790> i<00:03:45.060> go<00:03:45.510> from<00:03:45.690> office<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.049> office<00:03:46.139> if<00:03:46.560> i

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
you know i go from office to office if i

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.900 
you know i go from office to office if i
was<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.949> have<00:03:47.069> one<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.310> these<00:03:47.400> charging

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
was to have one of these charging

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.849 
was to have one of these charging
stations<00:03:48.299> at<00:03:48.510> everyone<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:48.989> could<00:03:49.199> just<00:03:49.319> plop

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
stations at everyone I could just plop

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.020

my<00:03:50.010> phone<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.489> wouldn't<00:03:50.699> have<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.879> worry

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
my phone in I wouldn't have to worry

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.970 
my phone in I wouldn't have to worry
about<00:03:51.150> other<00:03:51.359> cables<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.079> whatnot<00:03:52.349> but<00:03:52.829> this

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
about other cables and whatnot but this

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
about other cables and whatnot but this
is<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.190> pretty<00:03:53.459> expensive<00:03:53.910> setup<00:03:54.419> this<00:03:54.569> setup

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
is a pretty expensive setup this setup

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.520 
is a pretty expensive setup this setup
is<00:03:55.019> 140<00:03:55.709> bucks<00:03:55.949> so<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:57.290> how<00:03:58.290> do<00:03:58.349> you

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
is 140 bucks so you know the how do you

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.259 
is 140 bucks so you know the how do you
weigh<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.010> benefits<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.910> having<00:04:00.030> this

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
weigh the benefits of having this

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.789 
weigh the benefits of having this
wireless<00:04:00.629> charging<00:04:00.900> system<00:04:01.139> when<00:04:01.440> compared

to<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.280> know<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.459> could<00:04:02.669> probably<00:04:02.760> buy<00:04:03.169> three

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
to you know you could probably buy three

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.039 
to you know you could probably buy three
of<00:04:04.530> those<00:04:04.739> lightning<00:04:05.040> cables<00:04:05.699> I<00:04:06.090> think<00:04:06.629> so

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
of those lightning cables I think so

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.150 
of those lightning cables I think so
that<00:04:07.199> you<00:04:07.260> can<00:04:07.379> have<00:04:07.500> one<00:04:07.620> in<00:04:07.769> every<00:04:07.859> single

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
that you can have one in every single
