with<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:46.149> wire<00:01:46.329> that<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:46.570> need<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.840> hook<00:01:46.929> up

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
with the wire that you need to hook up

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.050 
with the wire that you need to hook up
at<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.289> camera<00:01:47.530> because<00:01:48.399> we're<00:01:48.549> frequently

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
at the camera because we're frequently

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.910 
at the camera because we're frequently
using<00:01:49.630> our<00:01:49.840> pocket<00:01:50.259> wizards<00:01:50.469> and<00:01:50.590> stuff<00:01:50.649> on

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
using our pocket wizards and stuff on

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.919 
using our pocket wizards and stuff on
camera<00:01:51.310> during<00:01:51.490> these<00:01:51.700> shoots<00:01:51.969> we<00:01:52.420> generally

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
camera during these shoots we generally

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.660 
camera during these shoots we generally
use<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.289> actual<00:01:53.560> wired<00:01:53.890> function<00:01:54.310> instead<00:01:54.520> of

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
use the actual wired function instead of

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.249 
use the actual wired function instead of
the<00:01:54.729> wireless<00:01:55.060> functionality<00:01:55.210> but<00:01:55.689> both<00:01:55.929> work

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
the wireless functionality but both work

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.380 
the wireless functionality but both work
great<00:01:56.289> so<00:01:57.039> let's<00:01:57.310> show<00:01:57.429> you<00:01:57.490> exactly<00:01:57.999> how<00:01:58.179> this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
great so let's show you exactly how this

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.910 
great so let's show you exactly how this
works<00:01:58.450> now<00:01:58.840> take<00:01:59.049> a<00:01:59.079> look<00:01:59.229> at<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.560> scene<00:01:59.799> that

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
works now take a look at the scene that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.679 
works now take a look at the scene that
you<00:01:59.979> see<00:02:00.219> here<00:02:00.579> in<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.240> thing<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:01.539> have<00:02:01.659> a

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
you see here in this thing we have a

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.090 
you see here in this thing we have a
beautiful<00:02:02.109> couple<00:02:02.320> that's<00:02:02.499> standing<00:02:02.890> over

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
beautiful couple that's standing over

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.800 
beautiful couple that's standing over
this<00:02:03.189> tide<00:02:03.460> pool<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.909> it's<00:02:04.060> just<00:02:04.420> after

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
this tide pool and it's just after

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.959 
this tide pool and it's just after
sunset<00:02:05.109> and<00:02:05.469> you<00:02:05.499> can<00:02:05.950> see<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.249> if<00:02:06.340> we<00:02:06.369> expose

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
sunset and you can see that if we expose

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.059 
sunset and you can see that if we expose
the<00:02:07.210> couple<00:02:07.539> for<00:02:07.719> their<00:02:07.810> skin<00:02:08.200> tones<00:02:08.470> we

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
the couple for their skin tones we

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.950 
the couple for their skin tones we
completely<00:02:09.610> lose<00:02:09.940> all<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.390> color<00:02:10.630> in<00:02:10.869> the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
completely lose all the color in the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.290 
completely lose all the color in the
detail<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.440> our<00:02:11.560> sky<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.640> what<00:02:12.819> we<00:02:12.910> need<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.210> do

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
detail in our sky so what we need to do

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.000 
detail in our sky so what we need to do
is<00:02:13.450> we<00:02:13.540> need<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.720> light<00:02:13.990> up<00:02:14.200> our<00:02:14.350> couple<00:02:14.740> now

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
is we need to light up our couple now

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.990 
is we need to light up our couple now
what<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.190> would<00:02:15.310> generally<00:02:15.730> do<00:02:15.819> in<00:02:15.910> this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
what I would generally do in this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.480 
what I would generally do in this
situation<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.660> throw<00:02:17.020> say<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> grid<00:02:17.740> or<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> snoot

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
situation is throw say a grid or a snoot

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.580 
situation is throw say a grid or a snoot
onto<00:02:18.910> my<00:02:19.030> flashes<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:20.050> way<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> light

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
onto my flashes that way the light

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.020 
onto my flashes that way the light
doesn't<00:02:20.920> spill<00:02:21.160> everywhere<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.790> scene

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
doesn't spill everywhere in the scene

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.420 
doesn't spill everywhere in the scene
I'll<00:02:22.390> place<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.960> outside<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.920> frame<00:02:24.220> and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
I'll place it outside of the frame and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.130 
I'll place it outside of the frame and
then<00:02:24.580> also<00:02:24.790> direct<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.840> towards<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
then also direct it just towards the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.960 
then also direct it just towards the
couple<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.190> don't<00:02:27.310> get<00:02:27.460> any<00:02:27.520> splash

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
couple so that we don't get any splash

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.850 
couple so that we don't get any splash
or<00:02:28.150> anything<00:02:28.300> on<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.510> rocks<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:29.230> forth<00:02:29.500> we

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
or anything on the rocks and so forth we

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.740 
or anything on the rocks and so forth we
keep<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.160> light<00:02:30.340> just<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.880> them<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.450> problem

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
keep the light just on them the problem

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.880 
keep the light just on them the problem
with<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:31.930> shot<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.410> since<00:02:32.680> we're<00:02:32.860> using

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
with this shot is that since we're using

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.160 
with this shot is that since we're using
a<00:02:33.340> very<00:02:33.640> wide<00:02:33.849> composition<00:02:34.450> our<00:02:34.659> flashes

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
a very wide composition our flashes

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.500 
a very wide composition our flashes
don't<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:35.739> enough<00:02:35.980> throw<00:02:36.280> or<00:02:36.549> power<00:02:36.849> to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
don't have enough throw or power to

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.880 
don't have enough throw or power to
reach<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.959> couple<00:02:38.260> when<00:02:38.440> place

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
reach the couple when place

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.770 
reach the couple when place
outside<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> frame<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.480> where<00:02:40.660> we

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
outside of the frame so this is where we

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.000 
outside of the frame so this is where we
turn<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.080> these<00:02:41.200> simple<00:02:41.380> compositing

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
turn to these simple compositing

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.290 
turn to these simple compositing
techniques<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> first<00:02:43.000> thing<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.150> need<00:02:43.270> to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
techniques so the first thing we need to

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.730 
techniques so the first thing we need to
do<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.600> we<00:02:43.750> need<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.930> actually<00:02:44.020> set<00:02:44.440> up<00:02:44.470> our

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
do is we need to actually set up our

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.500 
do is we need to actually set up our
tripod<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.850> field<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.300> I'm<00:02:46.360> gonna

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
tripod in the field and I'm gonna

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.420 
tripod in the field and I'm gonna
demonstrate<00:02:46.720> as<00:02:47.200> we're<00:02:47.380> going<00:02:47.620> here<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.370> I'm

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
demonstrate as we're going here so I'm

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.620 
demonstrate as we're going here so I'm
gonna<00:02:48.550> set<00:02:48.640> up<00:02:48.670> my<00:02:48.760> tripod<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.270> me<00:02:49.390> photo

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
gonna set up my tripod the me photo

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.420 
gonna set up my tripod the me photo
tripods<00:02:50.050> they<00:02:50.200> use<00:02:50.350> arca-swiss<00:02:50.740> plates<00:02:51.250> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
tripods they use arca-swiss plates and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.530 
tripods they use arca-swiss plates and
we're<00:02:51.520> gonna<00:02:51.640> pop<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.120> thing<00:02:52.390> on<00:02:52.600> here<00:02:54.540> like

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
we're gonna pop this thing on here like

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.240 
we're gonna pop this thing on here like
so<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:56.200> let<00:02:56.320> me<00:02:56.380> actually<00:02:56.650> bring<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.010> over

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
so and let me actually bring this over

so and let me actually bring this over
the<00:02:57.340> other<00:02:57.490> side<00:02:57.640> as<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.850> see<00:02:58.090> because<00:02:58.750> we

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
the other side as you can see because we

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.199 
the other side as you can see because we
have<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.980> pocket<00:03:00.310> wizard<00:03:00.520> setup<00:03:01.000> I'm

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
have the the pocket wizard setup I'm

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.820 
have the the pocket wizard setup I'm
gonna<00:03:01.420> go<00:03:01.570> ahead<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:02.020> use<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.380> wired

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
gonna go ahead and just use the wired

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.130 
gonna go ahead and just use the wired
trigger<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.459> if<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.090> don't<00:03:04.360> have<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.840> shutter

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
trigger and if you don't have a shutter

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.800 
trigger and if you don't have a shutter
release<00:03:05.220> it's<00:03:06.220> not<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.580> huge<00:03:07.150> deal<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.540> can

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
release it's not a huge deal you can

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.290 
release it's not a huge deal you can
actually<00:03:08.140> use<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.280> camera<00:03:09.850> internal

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
actually use like the camera internal

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.910 
actually use like the camera internal
timer<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:10.750> I'll<00:03:10.840> use<00:03:10.989> either<00:03:11.140> like<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> two<00:03:11.680> or

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
timer so I'll use either like the two or

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.560 
timer so I'll use either like the two or
the<00:03:12.370> ten-second<00:03:12.910> timer<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.270> these<00:03:13.390> kind<00:03:13.540> of

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
the ten-second timer in these kind of

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.660 
the ten-second timer in these kind of
situations<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.709> only<00:03:14.739> issue<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.459> since

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
situations the only issue is that since

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.949 
situations the only issue is that since
we're<00:03:15.820> shooting<00:03:16.060> these<00:03:16.180> kind<00:03:16.330> of<00:03:16.360> composites

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
we're shooting these kind of composites

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.020 
we're shooting these kind of composites
if<00:03:17.110> we<00:03:17.500> bump<00:03:17.890> or<00:03:18.130> move<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.489> frame<00:03:18.700> at<00:03:18.820> all<00:03:18.880> with

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
if we bump or move the frame at all with

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.670 
if we bump or move the frame at all with
our<00:03:19.120> hands<00:03:19.570> it's<00:03:19.959> gonna<00:03:20.080> make<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.410> much<00:03:20.530> more

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
our hands it's gonna make it much more

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.410 
our hands it's gonna make it much more
difficult<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:21.280> basically<00:03:21.730> line<00:03:21.940> them<00:03:22.090> up<00:03:22.239> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
difficult to basically line them up and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.030 
difficult to basically line them up and
to<00:03:22.630> create<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.110> shot<00:03:23.290> inside<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.620> Photoshop

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
to create the shot inside of Photoshop

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040 
to create the shot inside of Photoshop
that's<00:03:24.580> why<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> shutter<00:03:25.060> release<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.510> optimal

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
that's why a shutter release is optimal

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.180 
that's why a shutter release is optimal
for<00:03:26.080> these<00:03:26.290> kind<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.470> situations<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:27.010> way

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
for these kind of situations that way

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.259 
for these kind of situations that way
you<00:03:27.250> don't<00:03:27.400> need<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.670> bring<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.000> hands

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
you don't need to bring the hands

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.940 
you don't need to bring the hands
anywhere<00:03:28.660> near<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.110> camera<00:03:29.380> once<00:03:29.800> it's

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
anywhere near the camera once it's

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.740 
anywhere near the camera once it's
already<00:03:30.130> set<00:03:30.340> up<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.940> once<00:03:31.150> we're<00:03:31.300> set<00:03:31.480> up<00:03:31.510> we

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
already set up so once we're set up we

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.810 
already set up so once we're set up we
dial<00:03:32.050> in<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.470> desired<00:03:32.769> exposure<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.550> want<00:03:33.730> to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
dial in the desired exposure we want to

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.220 
dial in the desired exposure we want to
go<00:03:33.910> from<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.180> more<00:03:34.390> dramatic<00:03:34.570> look<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:35.140> this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
go from a more dramatic look in this

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.990 
go from a more dramatic look in this
particular<00:03:35.380> shot<00:03:35.920> really<00:03:36.610> drawing<00:03:36.850> attention

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
particular shot really drawing attention

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.880 
particular shot really drawing attention
into<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.540> sky<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.230> reflections<00:03:38.709> in<00:03:38.800> a

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
into the sky and the reflections in a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.430 
into the sky and the reflections in a
tidepool<00:03:39.130> so<00:03:39.610> we<00:03:39.700> set<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.090> camera<00:03:40.420> up<00:03:40.600> for<00:03:41.230> one

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
tidepool so we set the camera up for one

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.110 
tidepool so we set the camera up for one
two<00:03:41.680> hundred<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.100> second<00:03:42.459> shutter<00:03:42.640> speed<00:03:42.940> at

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
two hundred of a second shutter speed at

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.380 
two hundred of a second shutter speed at
f-16<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:43.959> ISO<00:03:44.380> 100<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:44.950> with<00:03:45.459> both<00:03:45.820> flashes

f-16 and ISO 100 and with both flashes

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.449 
f-16 and ISO 100 and with both flashes
at<00:03:46.540> full<00:03:46.900> power<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.530> light<00:03:47.680> our<00:03:47.799> couple<00:03:48.130> well

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
at full power to light our couple well

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.890 
at full power to light our couple well
we're<00:03:48.579> ready<00:03:48.850> we<00:03:49.060> would<00:03:49.180> capture<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.630> first

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
we're ready we would capture the first

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.479 
we're ready we would capture the first
shot<00:03:50.110> using<00:03:50.410> our<00:03:50.500> shutter<00:03:50.739> release<00:03:51.010> or<00:03:51.190> the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
shot using our shutter release or the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.009 
shot using our shutter release or the
internal<00:03:51.790> timer<00:03:52.120> if<00:03:52.360> you<00:03:52.480> are<00:03:52.630> using<00:03:52.870> the

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
internal timer if you are using the

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.259 
internal timer if you are using the
timer<00:03:53.230> again<00:03:53.530> be<00:03:53.680> extremely<00:03:54.370> careful<00:03:54.579> now

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
timer again be extremely careful now

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.759 
timer again be extremely careful now
you're<00:03:55.420> gonna<00:03:55.540> shoot<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.870> exact<00:03:56.320> same<00:03:56.530> shot

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
you're gonna shoot the exact same shot

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.560 
you're gonna shoot the exact same shot
with<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.070> second<00:03:57.459> shot<00:03:57.610> as<00:03:57.730> well<00:03:57.880> but<00:03:58.239> simply

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
with the second shot as well but simply

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.120 
with the second shot as well but simply
have<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.959> assistant<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.680> flashes

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
have the assistant and the flashes

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.650 
have the assistant and the flashes
everyone<00:04:00.549> is<00:04:00.730> removed<00:04:01.150> from<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.420> frame

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
everyone is removed from the frame

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.509 
everyone is removed from the frame
generally<00:04:02.650> we'd<00:04:02.769> keep<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.100> settings<00:04:03.430> on<00:04:03.489> the

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
generally we'd keep the settings on the

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.699 
generally we'd keep the settings on the
second<00:04:04.000> shot<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.360> exact<00:04:04.780> same<00:04:04.989> as<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
second shot the exact same as on the

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.199 
second shot the exact same as on the
first<00:04:05.980> but<00:04:06.549> once<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.760> get<00:04:06.880> good<00:04:07.060> at<00:04:07.120> this

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
first but once you get good at this

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.550 
first but once you get good at this
technique<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.690> can<00:04:07.780> actually<00:04:07.930> vary<00:04:08.410> the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
technique you can actually vary the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.259 
technique you can actually vary the
exposures<00:04:09.130> if<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.459> need<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.880> in<00:04:10.030> order<00:04:10.150> to

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
exposures if you need to in order to

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.670 
exposures if you need to in order to
create<00:04:10.480> different<00:04:10.750> kind<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.290> artistic

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
create different kind of artistic

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.470 
create different kind of artistic
effects<00:04:12.190> but<00:04:12.730> just<00:04:12.880> remember<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.269> if<00:04:13.360> the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
effects but just remember that if the

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.360 
effects but just remember that if the
exposures<00:04:14.110> are<00:04:14.260> different<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:14.739> any<00:04:14.920> way<00:04:15.130> it's

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
exposures are different in any way it's

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.340 
exposures are different in any way it's
gonna<00:04:15.459> be<00:04:15.640> more<00:04:15.970> work<00:04:16.030> matching<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:16.989> blending

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
gonna be more work matching and blending

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.140 
gonna be more work matching and blending
them<00:04:17.440> in<00:04:17.590> Photoshop<00:04:17.890> so<00:04:18.579> to<00:04:18.669> keep<00:04:18.940> things

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
them in Photoshop so to keep things

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.280 
them in Photoshop so to keep things
simple<00:04:19.329> we're<00:04:19.570> gonna<00:04:19.660> keep<00:04:19.900> everything

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
simple we're gonna keep everything

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.960 
simple we're gonna keep everything
identical<00:04:20.919> between<00:04:21.160> these<00:04:21.280> two<00:04:21.430> shots<00:04:21.700> and

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
identical between these two shots and

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.820 
identical between these two shots and
their<00:04:22.419> shot<00:04:22.690> fairly<00:04:23.080> close<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.440> each<00:04:23.500> other<00:04:23.650> as

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
their shot fairly close to each other as

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.850 
their shot fairly close to each other as
well<00:04:23.979> with<00:04:24.729> sunset<00:04:25.570> our<00:04:25.900> light<00:04:26.229> is<00:04:26.380> changing

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
well with sunset our light is changing

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.830 
well with sunset our light is changing
minute<00:04:27.280> by<00:04:27.310> minute<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.030> if<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.240> space<00:04:28.660> out

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
minute by minute and so if you space out

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.570 
minute by minute and so if you space out
those<00:04:29.050> two<00:04:29.229> shots<00:04:29.380> too<00:04:29.740> much<00:04:29.950> you're<00:04:30.460> gonna

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
those two shots too much you're gonna

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.070 
those two shots too much you're gonna
actually<00:04:30.729> have<00:04:30.910> different<00:04:31.240> exposures<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:31.990> be

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
actually have different exposures so be

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.690 
actually have different exposures so be
sure<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.320> take<00:04:32.500> them<00:04:32.710> very<00:04:33.070> quickly<00:04:33.250> if<00:04:33.580> you

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
sure to take them very quickly if you

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.610 
sure to take them very quickly if you
are<00:04:33.850> shooting<00:04:34.090> in<00:04:34.270> sunset<00:04:34.690> we<00:04:35.169> take<00:04:35.470> them

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
are shooting in sunset we take them

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.740 
are shooting in sunset we take them
between<00:04:35.890> like<00:04:36.190> maybe<00:04:36.820> 15<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.240> 20<00:04:37.479> seconds

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
between like maybe 15 to 20 seconds

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.960 
between like maybe 15 to 20 seconds
apart<00:04:38.020> alright<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:38.950> we<00:04:39.070> have<00:04:39.100> our<00:04:39.250> two<00:04:39.640> frames

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
apart alright so we have our two frames

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.430 
apart alright so we have our two frames
for<00:04:40.150> our<00:04:40.240> simple<00:04:40.479> composite<00:04:40.930> at<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.200> point

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
for our simple composite at this point

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.080 
for our simple composite at this point
the<00:04:41.590> rest<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.130> magic<00:04:42.430> is<00:04:42.550> created<00:04:42.970> in

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
the rest of the magic is created in

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.880 
the rest of the magic is created in
post-production<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:44.260> stepping<00:04:44.800> the

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
post-production so stepping the

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.500 
post-production so stepping the
lightroom<00:04:45.250> first<00:04:45.520> we're<00:04:45.700> gonna<00:04:45.760> use<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.270> SR

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
lightroom first we're gonna use the SR

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.390 
lightroom first we're gonna use the SR
Lounge<00:04:46.720> ligand<00:04:47.200> preset<00:04:47.560> system<00:04:47.680> first<00:04:48.220> to

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
Lounge ligand preset system first to

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.279 
Lounge ligand preset system first to
process<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.120> images<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.630> then<00:04:50.050> we're<00:04:50.200> gonna

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
process the images and then we're gonna

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.020 
process the images and then we're gonna
synchronize<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.979> settings<00:04:51.310> over<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.700> second

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
synchronize the settings over the second

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.300 
synchronize the settings over the second

that<00:04:52.460> way<00:04:52.580> they're<00:04:52.790> both<00:04:53.030> exactly<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.720> same

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
that way they're both exactly the same

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.020 
that way they're both exactly the same
in<00:04:54.200> terms<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.560> overall<00:04:54.890> exposure<00:04:55.370> as<00:04:55.700> well<00:04:55.940> as

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
in terms of overall exposure as well as

in terms of overall exposure as well as
the<00:04:56.150> way<00:04:56.270> they've<00:04:56.480> been<00:04:56.510> processed<00:04:56.890> once<00:04:57.890> that

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
the way they've been processed once that

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.620 
the way they've been processed once that
has<00:04:58.160> been<00:04:58.190> completed<00:04:58.310> we're<00:04:58.850> gonna<00:04:58.970> open<00:04:59.240> both

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
has been completed we're gonna open both

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.600 
has been completed we're gonna open both
these<00:04:59.810> files<00:05:00.050> together<00:05:00.260> as<00:05:00.680> layers<00:05:01.070> inside<00:05:01.550> a

gonna<00:05:03.830> put<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.070> image<00:05:04.340> with<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.580> flash<00:05:04.850> and

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
gonna put the image with the flash and

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.790 
gonna put the image with the flash and
the<00:05:05.120> assistants<00:05:05.600> everything<00:05:06.050> visible<00:05:06.260> on<00:05:06.650> the

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
top layer that way I can see it as I'm

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.930 
top layer that way I can see it as I'm
masking<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.560> out<00:05:09.710> at<00:05:10.070> this<00:05:10.430> point<00:05:10.670> all<00:05:10.820> we're

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
masking it out at this point all we're

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.000 
masking it out at this point all we're
gonna<00:05:11.060> do<00:05:11.300> is<00:05:11.330> add<00:05:11.780> in<00:05:11.990> a<00:05:12.080> mask<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:12.590> then<00:05:12.650> mask

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
gonna do is add in a mask and then mask

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.040 
gonna do is add in a mask and then mask
out<00:05:13.190> our<00:05:13.340> assistant<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:13.940> Flash's<00:05:14.480> using<00:05:14.960> a

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
out our assistant and Flash's using a

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.830 
out our assistant and Flash's using a
black<00:05:15.290> brush<00:05:15.670> using<00:05:16.670> a<00:05:16.760> mask<00:05:17.120> rather<00:05:17.570> than<00:05:17.750> the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
black brush using a mask rather than the

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.630 
black brush using a mask rather than the
eraser<00:05:18.410> tool<00:05:18.620> is<00:05:18.860> gonna<00:05:19.040> allow<00:05:19.250> us<00:05:19.280> to<00:05:19.460> work

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
eraser tool is gonna allow us to work

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.460 
eraser tool is gonna allow us to work
non-destructively<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.960> modify<00:05:21.320> the

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
non-destructively and to modify the

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.830 
non-destructively and to modify the
selection<00:05:22.010> at<00:05:22.160> any<00:05:22.370> point<00:05:22.760> if<00:05:22.910> necessary<00:05:23.420> so

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
selection at any point if necessary so

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.150 
selection at any point if necessary so
i'd<00:05:23.930> highly<00:05:24.140> recommend<00:05:24.230> it<00:05:24.680> using<00:05:24.950> masks

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
i'd highly recommend it using masks

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.370 
i'd highly recommend it using masks
instead<00:05:25.580> of<00:05:25.670> erasing<00:05:26.000> remember<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:26.990> mask<00:05:27.200> out

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
instead of erasing remember to mask out

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.930 
instead of erasing remember to mask out
also<00:05:27.590> any<00:05:27.980> of<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.220> shadows<00:05:28.700> and<00:05:28.880> reflections

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
also any of the shadows and reflections

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.090 
also any of the shadows and reflections
and<00:05:29.690> anything<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.020> would<00:05:30.200> be<00:05:30.290> caused<00:05:30.590> that

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
and anything that would be caused that

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.260 
and anything that would be caused that
would<00:05:31.250> be<00:05:31.340> basically<00:05:31.640> caused<00:05:32.030> by<00:05:32.210> the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
would be basically caused by the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.660 
would be basically caused by the
unwanted<00:05:32.930> objects<00:05:33.320> as<00:05:33.470> well<00:05:33.680> one<00:05:34.490> of<00:05:34.610> the

unwanted objects as well one of the

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.160 
unwanted objects as well one of the
easiest<00:05:34.970> ways<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.210> catch<00:05:35.600> these<00:05:35.870> kind<00:05:36.110> of

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
easiest ways to catch these kind of

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.840 
easiest ways to catch these kind of
compositing<00:05:36.770> techniques<00:05:36.950> or<00:05:37.340> composited

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
compositing techniques or composited

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.790 
compositing techniques or composited
images<00:05:38.210> is<00:05:38.360> due<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:39.050> these<00:05:39.140> kind<00:05:39.380> of<00:05:39.470> mistakes

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800

that was originally blocked by the
lighting<00:05:52.640> assistant<00:05:53.090> now<00:05:53.540> once<00:05:53.750> we're<00:05:53.870> done

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
lighting assistant now once we're done

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.480 
lighting assistant now once we're done
with<00:05:54.080> our<00:05:54.140> masking<00:05:54.560> we<00:05:54.740> are<00:05:54.890> finished<00:05:55.340> we've

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
with our masking we are finished we've

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.890 
with our masking we are finished we've
created<00:05:55.670> a<00:05:55.880> simple<00:05:56.150> composite<00:05:56.690> and<00:05:56.840> the

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
created a simple composite and the

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.870 
created a simple composite and the
entire<00:05:57.260> post-production<00:05:57.980> time<00:05:58.160> really
