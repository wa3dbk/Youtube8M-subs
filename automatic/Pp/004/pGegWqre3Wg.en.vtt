 rain mud in the swamp and off road for 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:23.459
 ATVs is a familiar environment 

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:26.269
 habitat they even have a bad belief 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.099
 weather good competition 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.079

 jitter such prelaunch 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.790
 excitement 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.500
 All the more weather conditions here. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.100
 surprised at years 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.920
 14 hours 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.640
 enterprises 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.430
 Yes, and Bert Nordberg team bert I probably 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.970
 owes 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.550
 but the team seems to be the first stage 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 open off-road quad series length 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.540
 surface rush 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.600
 the hall was full on a country road 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.990
 prefecture fire 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.660
 this place is not chosen randomly landscape 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.620
 allows you to position 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.540
 control points of various 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.540
 places 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.380
 and in some places 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.500
 even need to overcome 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.590
 small turbulent river 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.970
 off the coast 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.550
 but usually very hard 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.570
 but I think that 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.060
 not so beautiful 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.100
 very much private lands but since 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.740
 today provided 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.610
 at one point where her work and 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.190
 the emotions that brought to the finish today 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.790
 in the evening is a real challenge for everyone 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.840
 The first two are such 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.120
 to get to them had to be beaten 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.180
 bend over in an icy shell 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.440
 some cars are tied so that 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.780
 using a winch or mate was not 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
 get along 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.509
 dirty but satisfied athletes 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.299
 get to the control point 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.009
 make it necessary to enter 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.240
 criteria 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.669
 such a navigation system 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.659
 people can damage the skin 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.659
 one of the five teams kikilo 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.839
 in the end lost lost 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.679
 in total, 66 participants arrived at the first stage 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.129
 St. Petersburg Penza Kazan 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.129
 and Chelyabinsk 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.999
 the races took two days 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.990
 did not consist of three special stages 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.860
 it's 180 kilometers off-road saturday 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.680
 the athletes held a briefing that is 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 everyone got on the legends and 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.900
 reference point designations 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.609
 Our Vitaly Gavrilov 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.419
 first brought over had to 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.769
 overcome two thirds of the way therefore 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 prosecutors have proved a gift 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.619
 in may company 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.619
 Attorney General

 Volodarsky d 1 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.599
 work in this direction 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.049
 first he 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.029
 but since this 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.200
 the crew he got to the finish 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 however, more than others were lucky in the team 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.849
 in the first stage, the men went to 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:26.809
 good pace 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.219
 and confidently led 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.469
 but the guys didn't calculate 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:30.789
 amount of gasoline 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.789
 15 meters per year 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:55.309
 last year 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:56.869
 cnn turk is good 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.579
 if in Russia competition 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.219
 started for the first time and also passed in three 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.279
 stage 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.869
 its founder is an open field 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.709
 For several years I was carrying Andrei 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:07.519
 mowers 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.709
 earlier he himself participated in races 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.809
 in former years 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:12.389
 one of the edition 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.389
 further motorists quadrocycle 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.789
 but completely different 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.909
 found a typo 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.020
 to give way 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.889
 Well, that's even 10 competitions today 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.030

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.479
 Photo ATVs 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.500

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.680
 on competition according to organizers 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.680
 regarding demand 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.470
 I again all other competitions Turkey 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.809

 and all in the southern Urals the best in their 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.449
