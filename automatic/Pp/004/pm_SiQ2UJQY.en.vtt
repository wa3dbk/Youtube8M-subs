00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
to make the wing structure for this

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.669 
to make the wing structure for this
thing<00:00:06.870> anyway<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.760> wood<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.900> it

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
thing anyway this is the wood this is it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.640 
thing anyway this is the wood this is it
was<00:00:10.830> originally<00:00:11.460> 8<00:00:11.759> feet<00:00:12.090> by<00:00:12.120> four<00:00:12.630> feet<00:00:12.660> right

was originally 8 feet by four feet right

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129 
was originally 8 feet by four feet right
now<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.280> four<00:00:14.610> feet<00:00:14.759> long<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.839> foot

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
now it is four feet long and one foot

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.670 
now it is four feet long and one foot
tall<00:00:16.730> this<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:18.990> use<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> four

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
tall this is a I actually use the four

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.650 
tall this is a I actually use the four
inch<00:00:19.800> PVC<00:00:19.980> pipe<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.930> just<00:00:21.930> did<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:23.630> diameter<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
inch PVC pipe I just did the diameter of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.279 
inch PVC pipe I just did the diameter of
it<00:00:24.869> which<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.890> half<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.099> circumference<00:00:27.289> well

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
it which is half the circumference well

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.890 
it which is half the circumference well
you<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.279> get<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> mean<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.689> did

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you know you get what I mean I just did

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.120 
you know you get what I mean I just did
a<00:00:30.929> half<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> circumference<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.669> then<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
a half the circumference and then I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.850 
a half the circumference and then I
moved<00:00:35.130> six<00:00:35.430> inches<00:00:35.760> along<00:00:36.059> Rose<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.380> inch<00:00:37.559> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
moved six inches along Rose one inch and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.450 
moved six inches along Rose one inch and
then<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.280> goes<00:00:38.399> back<00:00:38.460> down<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.390> three<00:00:39.960> feet

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
then it goes back down to three feet

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.389 
then it goes back down to three feet
simple<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.020> then<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.440> did<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> in

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
simple as that and then I did it in

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.580 
simple as that and then I did it in
opposite<00:00:45.120> form<00:00:45.360> i'ma<00:00:45.989> show<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.200> how<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> cut

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
it up cutting it out is the hardest part

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.069 
it up cutting it out is the hardest part
these<00:00:49.410> these<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:51.030> little<00:00:51.329> cheapo

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
these these are just little cheapo

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
need them but it's kind of annoying to

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.369

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
end there then cut this shorter to like

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.620 
end there then cut this shorter to like
right<00:02:06.440> there<00:02:06.620> let<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.730> cut<00:02:08.060> off<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.330> excess

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
right there let it cut off the excess

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.500 
right there let it cut off the excess
cut<00:02:08.899> off<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.140> excess<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.500> yeah<00:02:10.490> you're<00:02:11.330> going

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
cut off the excess and yeah you're going

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.820 
cut off the excess and yeah you're going
to<00:02:11.600> want<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.810> keep<00:02:11.930> cutting<00:02:12.260> off<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.530> excess

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
to want to keep cutting off the excess

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.140 
to want to keep cutting off the excess
and<00:02:12.890> getting<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.310> smaller<00:02:13.640> because<00:02:13.820> if<00:02:14.000> you

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
and getting it smaller because if you

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.610 
and getting it smaller because if you
try<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.330> do<00:02:14.540> in<00:02:14.660> one<00:02:14.840> fell<00:02:14.990> swoop<00:02:15.050> you're<00:02:15.500> going

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
try to do in one fell swoop you're going

00:02:15.620 --> 00:03:57.590 
try to do in one fell swoop you're going
to<00:02:15.680> be<00:02:15.770> screwed

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.850 

as<00:03:58.600> you<00:03:58.810> can<00:03:58.930> see<00:03:59.140> it's<00:03:59.320> getting<00:03:59.620> closer

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
as you can see it's getting closer

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.640 
as you can see it's getting closer
closer<00:04:00.540> once<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.660> get<00:04:01.750> here<00:04:01.990> you're<00:04:02.200> just

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
closer once you get here you're just

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.200 
closer once you get here you're just
gonna<00:04:03.040> want<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.370> keep<00:04:03.670> cutting<00:04:03.970> off<00:04:04.060> the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
gonna want to keep cutting off the

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.690 
gonna want to keep cutting off the
excess<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.600> smaller<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.740> smaller<00:04:05.950> shapes

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
excess and smaller and smaller shapes

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.940 
excess and smaller and smaller shapes
and<00:04:07.090> then<00:04:07.660> eventually<00:04:07.750> your<00:04:08.200> son<00:04:08.470> want<00:04:08.710> to<00:04:08.800> put

and then eventually your son want to put
it<00:04:09.070> on<00:04:09.190> there<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.850> then<00:04:10.030> like<00:04:10.300> turn<00:04:10.570> it<00:04:10.720> in

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
it on there and then like turn it in

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.930 
it on there and then like turn it in
this<00:04:11.320> sort<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.560> way<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:13.030> yet<00:04:13.890> but<00:04:14.890> I've<00:04:15.610> done
