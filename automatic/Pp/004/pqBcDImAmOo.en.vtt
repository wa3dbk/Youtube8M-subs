other<00:01:28.920> than<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.130> Christmas<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.600> spirit

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
other than that Christmas is the spirit

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
something for Christmas I think would be

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.280 
something for Christmas I think would be
depending<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.060> who<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> person<00:01:39.300> was<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
depending on who the person was you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.720 
depending on who the person was you
can't<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.650> give<00:01:40.890> something<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.370> people

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
can't really give something to people

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.800 
can't really give something to people
you<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.940> that's<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.300> a<00:01:45.360> sexual

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you don't know and that's not a sexual

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.000 
you don't know and that's not a sexual
reference<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.710> would<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.400> of

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.170 

kind<00:01:51.010> of<00:01:51.040> trying<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.400> understand<00:01:52.000> what

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
kind of trying to understand what

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.640 
kind of trying to understand what
Christmas<00:01:52.720> really<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:53.050> about<00:01:53.320> because

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
Christmas really is about because

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.670 
Christmas really is about because
sometimes<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:54.190> abbreviated<00:01:54.700> by<00:01:54.820> Xmas<00:01:55.390> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.630 

because<00:01:59.680> I<00:01:59.800> grew<00:02:00.130> up<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:02.740> Christian<00:02:03.610> school

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
because I grew up in a Christian school

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.710 
because I grew up in a Christian school
I<00:02:04.320> hated<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.440> religious<00:02:05.860> element<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.720> but

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
I hated the religious element of it but

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.840 
I hated the religious element of it but
I<00:02:07.750> also<00:02:07.990> grew<00:02:08.380> up<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.979> house<00:02:09.369> where

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
I also grew up in a house where

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.390 
I also grew up in a house where
Christmas<00:02:10.479> wasn't<00:02:10.869> greatly<00:02:11.740> celebrated

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
Christmas wasn't greatly celebrated

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.880 
Christmas wasn't greatly celebrated
mostly<00:02:13.330> because<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.690> think<00:02:13.840> my<00:02:14.140> father<00:02:14.500> hated

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
mostly because I think my father hated

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.810 
mostly because I think my father hated
it<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.500> would<00:02:17.710> associate<00:02:18.220> him<00:02:18.790> with

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
it and then I would associate him with

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.420 
it and then I would associate him with
father<00:02:19.240> Christmas<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.680> if<00:02:20.770> Santa<00:02:20.950> Claus<00:02:21.130> came

father Christmas but if Santa Claus came

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.770 
father Christmas but if Santa Claus came
