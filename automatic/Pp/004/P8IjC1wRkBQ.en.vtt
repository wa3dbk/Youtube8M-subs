ball oh I thought the bank oh ok but we
got<00:00:18.270> them<00:00:19.609> the<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.060> check<00:00:22.020> benoni<00:00:28.039> there's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
got them the the check benoni there's

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.640 
got them the the check benoni there's
also<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.609> idea<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:30.179> H<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.810> Bishop<00:00:31.199> age<00:00:31.349> 3

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
also this idea with H for Bishop age 3

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.819 
also this idea with H for Bishop age 3
which<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.250> bad<00:00:32.279> oh<00:00:35.540> but<00:00:36.540> okay<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.020> don't

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
which is not bad oh but okay I don't

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.979 
which is not bad oh but okay I don't
mind<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:39.000> classical<00:00:39.690> approach<00:00:44.809> yeah<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
mind this classical approach yeah this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.110 
mind this classical approach yeah this
is<00:00:46.170> always<00:00:46.530> funny<00:00:46.800> sometimes<00:00:47.460> people<00:00:47.730> play

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
is always funny sometimes people play

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.910 
is always funny sometimes people play
that<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.320> blundering

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that and it's just really blundering

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.209 
that and it's just really blundering
upon<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.489> mean<00:00:51.199> one<00:00:52.199> needs<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.739> honest<00:00:53.070> about

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
upon I mean one needs to be honest about

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.040 
upon I mean one needs to be honest about
this<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.050> absolutely<00:00:55.050> no<00:00:55.320> compensation

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
this this is absolutely no compensation

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.569 
this this is absolutely no compensation
it's<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> bank-owned<00:00:58.890> gambit<00:00:59.280> where<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it's like a bank-owned gambit where you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's like a bank-owned gambit where you
have<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> center<00:01:00.359> closed<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> bishop

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
have the center closed and the bishop

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.719 
have the center closed and the bishop
only<00:01:01.620> seven<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.300> just<00:01:04.189> just<00:01:05.189> giving<00:01:05.519> away

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
only seven this is just just giving away

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.359 
only seven this is just just giving away
upon<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.299> no<00:01:06.420> compensation<00:01:09.350> okay<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> form

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
upon for no compensation okay so a form

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.710 
upon for no compensation okay so a form
and<00:01:13.189> still<00:01:14.189> need<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:15.180> precise<00:01:15.689> about

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and still need to be precise about

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:31.539 
and still need to be precise about
things<00:01:18.710> how<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.509> b3<00:01:21.509> maybe<00:01:24.799> mp3<00:01:29.750> maybe

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
things how to do this b3 maybe mp3 maybe

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.649 
things how to do this b3 maybe mp3 maybe
maybe<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> most<00:01:33.420> precise<00:01:35.090> if<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.420> get

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
maybe this is the most precise if I get

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.499 
maybe this is the most precise if I get
in<00:01:36.960> rookie<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.650> Bishop<00:01:37.920> f1<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.970> then<00:01:39.299> it's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
in rookie one Bishop f1 and then it's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.200 
in rookie one Bishop f1 and then it's
basically<00:01:40.020> over<00:01:41.180> with<00:01:42.180> any<00:01:42.479> sort<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:44.210> claim

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
basically over with any sort of claim

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.770 
basically over with any sort of claim
for<00:01:45.509> compensation<00:01:49.310> c4<00:01:50.310> i<00:01:50.340> also<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.329> for

frustrating if you lose on time as is

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.560 
frustrating if you lose on time as is
