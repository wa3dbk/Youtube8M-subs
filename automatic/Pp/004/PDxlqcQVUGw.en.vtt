00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.509
 August is the month of the dog and so 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 apparently created the theme playlist 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.870
 with various hot dog recipes 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.849
 very long 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.889
 I chose to make a dog recipe 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.020
 hot in a pot that besides being super 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.390
 easy to make is served in a way 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.039
 very creative to see other recipes 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.039
 of this playlist click here 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.150
 in two tablespoons olive oil sautÃ© in this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.420
 cake and two chopped garlic cloves 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.309
 add a quarter of chopped 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.540
 stir for a few minutes until it 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.390
 be soft 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.920
 add 6 chopped sausages into slices 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.320
 add a packet of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.050
 Tomato ready and if you get the eye too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.570
 thick adds a little water 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.570
 let simmer for 3 minutes 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.000
 now let's do the coverage that takes 3 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.489
 large potatoes cooked and mashed one 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.530
 tablespoon mayonnaise and half a cup 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.240
 grated mozzarella cheese 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.240
 just mix everything up 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.000
 preheat the oven to 200 degrees while 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.159
 ride your hot dog to ride 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.960
 This year you need pots that 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.810
 they can go to the oven 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.479
 an uncle the pots with olive oil and in the background 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.539
 of each of them place the bread cubes 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.750
 peel a layer of sauce 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.210
 of sausages and mashed potatoes 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.700
 finalize with grated mozzarella cheese 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.460
 bake in the oven and even 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.190
 stay golden for this recipe 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.140
 we can do four reasons 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.090
 now if you want to increase the number 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.020
 units or make a single 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.520
 refractory 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.009
 You have to increase the amount of 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.110
 puree since the eye will be left 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.220
 You can serve your hot dog. 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.330
 in the pot accompanied by potato xe 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.330
 now it's a good part 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.050
