hoped that the package comes to me in
one<00:02:03.409> piece<00:02:03.439> and<00:02:04.360> she<00:02:05.360> drew<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:05.900> little

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
sending the package shipping it and like

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.319 
sending the package shipping it and like
walking<00:02:12.890> away<00:02:13.040> from<00:02:13.189> the<00:02:13.459> package<00:02:13.879> and<00:02:13.909> then

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
walking away from the package and then

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.929 
walking away from the package and then
when<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.659> went<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.900> go<00:02:15.110> pick<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.349> up<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:16.519> okay
