motorcycle
as<00:01:48.350> far<00:01:48.710> as<00:01:48.740> inspiration<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.850> was<00:01:50.000> again<00:01:50.869> I

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
as far as inspiration it was again I

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.780 
as far as inspiration it was again I
wanted<00:01:51.259> something<00:01:51.470> very<00:01:51.740> industrial<00:01:52.549> very

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
wanted something very industrial very

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.760 
wanted something very industrial very
industrial<00:01:55.790> meets<00:01:56.060> bling<00:01:56.450> by<00:01:57.020> if<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.500> frame

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
industrial meets bling by if the frame

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.590 
industrial meets bling by if the frame
is<00:01:57.799> abroad<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.700> just<00:01:58.880> treated<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.210> with<00:01:59.360> an<00:01:59.450> oil

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
is abroad we just treated it with an oil

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.960 
is abroad we just treated it with an oil
so<00:01:59.810> then<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.080> rust<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:01.280> then<00:02:01.460> on<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.820> other

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
so then it rust and then on the other

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.580 
so then it rust and then on the other
end<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.420> went<00:02:02.600> with<00:02:02.689> gold<00:02:02.899> leaf<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.409> gas

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
end we went with gold leaf on the gas

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.550 
end we went with gold leaf on the gas
tank<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.130> some<00:02:04.940> heavy<00:02:05.659> metal<00:02:05.990> flakes<00:02:06.259> and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
tank and some heavy metal flakes and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.180 
tank and some heavy metal flakes and
Reds<00:02:06.890> just<00:02:07.869> kind<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.959> have<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> real<00:02:09.470> contrast

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190

good it's cheap everything's great about
it<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.240> ugly<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.780> hell<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:28.800> what<00:02:29.340> we

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
it but it is ugly as hell so we what we

it but it is ugly as hell so we what we
do<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.850> we<00:02:29.970> have<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> replacement<00:02:30.480> front<00:02:31.110> leg

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
do is we have a replacement front leg

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.500 
do is we have a replacement front leg
which<00:02:32.070> gives<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.459> nice<00:02:32.610> round<00:02:32.940> look<00:02:33.300> with

which gives it a nice round look with

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.240 
which gives it a nice round look with
speed<00:02:33.750> holes<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.440> gives<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.890> totally

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
speed holes and it gives it a totally

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.280 
speed holes and it gives it a totally
new<00:02:35.370> look<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:36.240> makes<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.600> look<00:02:36.840> good<00:02:37.050> as

and<00:02:40.579> let's<00:02:40.970> move<00:02:41.180> back<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.689> the<00:02:41.810> frame<00:02:42.079> now<00:02:42.319> as

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
and let's move back on the frame now as

we<00:02:51.799> also<00:02:52.150> purposely<00:02:53.150> laid<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.689> welds<00:02:54.319> very

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
we also purposely laid the welds very

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.220 
we also purposely laid the welds very
thick<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.099> give<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.459> real<00:02:56.269> industrial<00:02:56.689> tough
