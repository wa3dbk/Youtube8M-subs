okay<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.380> give

next

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.790 

it's<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.850> terrible<00:03:08.300> mama<00:03:08.570> so<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.320> can<00:03:09.440> put<00:03:09.590> two

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
it's a terrible mama so you can put two

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.730 
it's a terrible mama so you can put two
big<00:03:10.040> bombs<00:03:10.310> inside<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.150> thing<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:12.590> know

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
big bombs inside this thing you know

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.300 
big bombs inside this thing you know
which<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> ridiculous<00:03:13.880> payload<00:03:14.300> ok<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.100> then

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
which is a ridiculous payload ok so then

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.330 
which is a ridiculous payload ok so then
what<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.670> world<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.210> this<00:03:17.360> thing<00:03:17.630> good<00:03:17.930> for

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
what in the world is this thing good for

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.280 
what in the world is this thing good for
so<00:03:19.340> what<00:03:19.490> is<00:03:19.610> it<00:03:19.640> good<00:03:19.910> at<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.870> not<00:03:21.050> good<00:03:21.200> at

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
so what is it good at it's not good at

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.790 
so what is it good at it's not good at
anything<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:22.640> you're<00:03:23.060> telling<00:03:23.390> me<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.620> bad

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
anything so you're telling me it's a bad

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.760 
anything so you're telling me it's a bad
airplane<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.610> can't<00:03:26.480> do<00:03:26.660> dogfights<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.500> can't
