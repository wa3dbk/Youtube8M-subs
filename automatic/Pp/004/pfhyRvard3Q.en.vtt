 they started with that little event at 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.670
 At the beginning of this story we will see a 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.129
 great empathy between these two brothers of 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.079
 how they spend it how they are rolling 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.510
 all cities have conflicts 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.549
 pretty canyons between them and between 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.829
 loved ones who are accompanying them 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.959
 during the different adventures and 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.840
 there will also be rivalry that transcends the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.450
 world of mortals all music is 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.750

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.040
 zeppelin and on that flag all that 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.250
 generation of rockers are those that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.769
 accompany you in your car each time you go to 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.990
 an adventure the whole soundtrack is 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.440
 full of this kind of music 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.440
 d 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.579
 yes 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.770
 another protagonist of this series is the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.690
 automobile if it is a chevrolet impala 67 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.070
 who travels everywhere with them 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.260
 many of the cars that are here are 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.150
 classics and the producers and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.170
 directors of this series are lovers of 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.170
 this type of cars 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.100
 nine seasons and counting at the beginning 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.960
 they did not know that it would last so long and they have 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.430
 been rewriting the stories 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.930
 because I had in each of the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.490
 seasons practically already given by 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.500
 done that the roll is over and you're 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.110
 waiting for the end but not 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.880
 they give another twist to the nut and continue 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.710
 the story even in these same 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.100
 moments the whole series has this 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.110
 humor content this sarcastic black 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.610
 very cool that thanks and to do 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.500
 their investigations well they do not 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.810
 they are policemen they are like you and like me 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.030
 an outlaw watts that actually live 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.800
 besides being cloning cards and so 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.960
 see we take out their resources to be able 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.610
 continue this fight against evil but 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.800
 every time they are going to take out information 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.620
 they dress as priests or 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.630
 police or investigators and always 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.970
 they are presented with false names or they are 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.570
 account as seen here in Mexico when 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.370
 current 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.590
 I'm Saúl Hernández and my partner 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.060
 Alejandro Lora we come to talk about what 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.330
 what happened the other day at school 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.100
 they always use names of rockers but 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.500
 not wanting to access the time that 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.940
 I'm commenting, it's pretty funny 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.940
 for rock lovers too 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.430
 between some curiosities in one of the 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.500
 first chapters the phone comes out of 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.240
 dean winchester if on the screen the 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.150
 phone all numbers come out and there's 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.090
 some fans because they beat him and 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.469
 they talked obviously that was before 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.349
 thought by the producers 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:04.180
 then they bought that line that line 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.219
 phone and when you dial more you 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.860
 answered a message from bing winchester 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:11.770
 the character in the series say is the 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.960
 actor who plays ring currently 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.669
 but at the beginning this brother had 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.409
 been thought to interpret the 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.120
 minor of the winchesters however not 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.190
 they found the right big brother 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.610
 until he arrived jared and they realized 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.289
 he did not give the paper for dyn but yes 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.389
 for the younger brother so nothing else 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.490
 they exchanged the characters and ready 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.560
