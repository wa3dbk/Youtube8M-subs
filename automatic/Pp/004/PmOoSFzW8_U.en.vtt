people to help me with this but here is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.689 
people to help me with this but here is
the<00:00:18.300> original<00:00:18.500> down<00:00:19.500> test<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.160> all<00:00:20.520> devices

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the original down test on all devices

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.179 
the original down test on all devices
when<00:00:21.240> aleko<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> exact<00:00:22.320> same<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:22.920> so

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
when aleko at the exact same time so

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.650 
when aleko at the exact same time so
there<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> goes

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
there it goes

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.200 
there it goes
surprisingly<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.590> 3GS<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.699> followed

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
surprisingly the 3GS was first followed

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
surprisingly the 3GS was first followed
by<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> 3G<00:00:27.930> then<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> 4<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> 2g

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
by the 3G then the 4 and then the 2g

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.669 
by the 3G then the 4 and then the 2g
there's<00:00:30.119> something<00:00:30.510> about<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:31.230> 6<00:00:31.529> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
there's something about I was 6 and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.620 
there's something about I was 6 and
lower<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.189> actually<00:00:32.669> makes<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.210> shutdown

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
lower that actually makes the shutdown

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.380 
lower that actually makes the shutdown
time<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.050> lot<00:00:34.290> faster<00:00:34.860> than<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.399> 7<00:00:35.790> although

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
time a lot faster than I was 7 although

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
time a lot faster than I was 7 although
all<00:00:36.600> devices<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.170> Iowa<00:00:37.500> 7<00:00:37.829> shut<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
all devices on Iowa 7 shut down at the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760 
all devices on Iowa 7 shut down at the
exact<00:00:39.030> same<00:00:39.360> time<00:00:39.690> which<00:00:39.989> makes<00:00:40.290> me<00:00:40.500> think

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
exact same time which makes me think

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.130 
exact same time which makes me think
what<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.460> change<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> second<00:00:43.020> here

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
what do they change and in a second here

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810 
what do they change and in a second here
they<00:00:43.290> should<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:43.890> turning<00:00:44.370> off<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
they should all be turning off at the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
they should all be turning off at the
exact<00:00:45.090> same<00:00:45.390> time<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.350> performing<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
exact same time now all performing the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
exact same time now all performing the
boot<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.280> test<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.670> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.030> leave<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
boot up test I just want to leave you

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
boot up test I just want to leave you
guys<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.750> important<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> notice<00:00:49.590> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
guys know it's important to notice that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160 
guys know it's important to notice that
from<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.550> 5s<00:00:51.120> end<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> 2g<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
from the 5s end to the 2g there's a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260 
from the 5s end to the 2g there's a
massive<00:00:52.590> difference<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.489> processing<00:00:54.059> power

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
massive difference in processing power

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.020 
massive difference in processing power
and<00:00:54.420> RAM<00:00:54.809> obviously<00:00:55.590> also<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.370> software<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and RAM obviously also the software is

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.760 
and RAM obviously also the software is
different<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:57.899> majorly<00:00:58.289> affect

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
different so that could majorly affect

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
different so that could majorly affect
this<00:00:58.980> no<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.640> wasn't<00:01:00.120> too<00:01:00.300> surprised<00:01:00.660> because

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
this no I wasn't too surprised because

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
this no I wasn't too surprised because
the<00:01:01.109> 5s<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> course<00:01:01.890> came<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.280> first<00:01:02.550> followed

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the 5s of course came in first followed

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.420 
the 5s of course came in first followed
by<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> five<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> five<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.979> came<00:01:05.220> next

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
by the five and five see what came next

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.370 
by the five and five see what came next
was<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:06.270> pretty<00:01:06.450> surprising<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.170> just

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
was actually pretty surprising and just

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.840 
was actually pretty surprising and just
to<00:01:07.500> let<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.710> guys<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.310> these

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
to let you guys know all of these

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.100 
to let you guys know all of these
devices<00:01:09.150> are<00:01:09.360> freshly<00:01:09.960> restored

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
devices are freshly restored

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.770 
devices are freshly restored
non-jailbroken<00:01:11.010> completely<00:01:12.000> stock<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
non-jailbroken completely stock so the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.100 
non-jailbroken completely stock so the
5c<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.320> five<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:13.920> followed<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.430> 4s<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
5c and five was followed by the 4s and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.140 
5c and five was followed by the 4s and
surprisingly<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.409> 2g<00:01:16.770> came<00:01:17.549> before<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
surprisingly the 2g came before the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.800 
surprisingly the 2g came before the
iPhone<00:01:18.509> 4<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> 3GS<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> iPhone<00:01:21.180> 4

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
iPhone 4 then the 3GS then the iPhone 4

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.370 
iPhone 4 then the 3GS then the iPhone 4
and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.830> iPhone<00:01:23.400> 3G<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.299> long<00:01:24.630> last<00:01:24.900> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and then the iPhone 3G at long last I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.200 
and then the iPhone 3G at long last I
was<00:01:25.619> actually<00:01:25.799> really<00:01:26.220> surprising<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:26.909> me<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
was actually really surprising for me to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
was actually really surprising for me to
see<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.560> running<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
see because these are all running the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
see because these are all running the
latest<00:01:29.340> firmware<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.630> 2g<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> obviously

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
latest firmware and the 2g is obviously

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
latest firmware and the 2g is obviously
not<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.340> powerful<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> 4<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
not as powerful as the 4 it's just the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
not as powerful as the 4 it's just the
booting<00:01:34.680> sequence<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> way<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> works

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
booting sequence in the way it works

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in this test as well as all others then

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.980 
in this test as well as all others then
comes<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.649> 5<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> 5c<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> 4s

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
comes the 5 then the 5c then the 4s

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.110 
comes the 5 then the 5c then the 4s
the<00:02:13.200> four<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.700> what<00:02:14.880> did<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.090> learn

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the four and so on so what did I learn

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.300 
the four and so on so what did I learn
doing<00:02:15.480> these<00:02:15.780> tests<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.320> learned<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.100> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
doing these tests I learned that the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.280 
doing these tests I learned that the
amount<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.820> processing<00:02:18.210> power<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.870> greater<00:02:19.200> of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
amount of processing power is greater of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.410 
amount of processing power is greater of
course<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> generation<00:02:20.340> goes<00:02:20.520> on<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.240> it's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
course as a generation goes on but it's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780 
course as a generation goes on but it's
marginally<00:02:22.230> less<00:02:22.620> noticeable<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.610> higher

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
marginally less noticeable the higher

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.720 
marginally less noticeable the higher
you<00:02:24.060> go<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> five<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:26.040> wouldn't

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you go so if you have a five I wouldn't

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.520 
you go so if you have a five I wouldn't
really<00:02:26.910> recommend<00:02:27.030> upgrading<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.960> know<00:02:28.080> 5s

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
really recommend upgrading you know 5s

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.870 
really recommend upgrading you know 5s
just<00:02:28.830> based<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.190> fact<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.670> want

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
just based on the fact that you want

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.760 
just based on the fact that you want
extra<00:02:30.300> little<00:02:30.540> bit<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.810> power<00:02:30.990> because<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.530> has

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
extra little bit of power because it has

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.800 
extra little bit of power because it has
an<00:02:31.920> amazing<00:02:32.460> amount<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.760> power<00:02:32.940> as<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.510> if

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
an amazing amount of power as it is if

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.360 
an amazing amount of power as it is if
you're<00:02:34.020> always<00:02:34.200> upgrading<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> latest

and greatest just based on that little
spike<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.770> power<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.520> know<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.760> video<00:02:38.970> I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
spike in power you know this video I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.730 
spike in power you know this video I
just<00:02:39.240> showed<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.720> guys<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.320> isn't<00:02:40.650> even
