 hello friends today is August 2, 2014 and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.560
 after the beginning of this 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.700

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.530
 2007 because today I want to make the video 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.130
 presentation and see after seven 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.400
 years ago I realized that this channel did not 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.500
 I had a video in which it will be a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.950
 information about what can be seen in 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.930

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.990
