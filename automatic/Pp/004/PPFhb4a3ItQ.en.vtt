predators and you know predators would

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.379 
predators and you know predators would
not<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.009> fight<00:01:26.399> it<00:01:26.429> out<00:01:26.639> in<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.999> gun<00:01:27.149> fight

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:28.519 
not just fight it out in a gun fight
like<00:01:27.569> that<00:01:27.599> they<00:01:27.959> would<00:01:28.139> hide<00:01:28.319> in<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.499> shadows

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:28.529 
like that they would hide in the shadows

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:30.859

immediately<00:01:56.219> go<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.609> stealth<00:01:56.849> unless<00:01:57.359> there's

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:57.599 
immediately go in stealth unless there's

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.510 
immediately go in stealth unless there's
like<00:01:57.689> another<00:01:57.899> guy<00:01:58.139> sitting<00:01:58.499> next<00:01:58.529> to<00:01:58.739> him<00:01:58.919> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
try to relocate and it's very important

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.800 
try to relocate and it's very important
to<00:02:02.369> us

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
top to fill that one sniper but then I

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.220 
top to fill that one sniper but then I
noticed<00:02:16.640> there's<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> guy<00:02:17.209> cloak<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.780> his<00:02:17.959> left

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and a guy close to cross so there's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.809 
and a guy close to cross so there's
really<00:02:20.090> three<00:02:20.569> guys<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:21.050> there<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.700> know

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
really three guys up there so you know

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.820 
really three guys up there so you know
if<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.300> attack<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.959> cloak<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.349> first<00:02:24.650> I

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
if I attack the cloak I first I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.290 
if I attack the cloak I first I
immediately<00:02:25.099> can<00:02:25.430> kill<00:02:25.640> him<00:02:25.819> because<00:02:26.000> he'll

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
immediately can kill him because he'll

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.809 
immediately can kill him because he'll
have<00:02:26.450> no<00:02:26.630> energy<00:02:26.870> or<00:02:27.319> shields<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.610> can

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
have no energy or shields and then I can

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.009 
have no energy or shields and then I can
switch<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.300> other<00:02:29.390> guy<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.810> try<00:02:29.959> to

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
switch to the other guy and try to

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.199 
switch to the other guy and try to
regroup<00:02:30.380> from<00:02:30.590> there<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:31.849> really<00:02:32.030> about

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
regroup from there so it's really about

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.890 
regroup from there so it's really about
like<00:02:32.900> moving<00:02:33.319> into<00:02:33.530> an<00:02:33.620> area<00:02:34.480> observing<00:02:35.480> the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
like moving into an area observing the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.750 
like moving into an area observing the
battlefield<00:02:36.049> and<00:02:36.680> ends<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.370> then<00:02:37.489> making

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
battlefield and ends and then making

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.360 
battlefield and ends and then making
your<00:02:38.030> move<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.900> think<00:02:39.440> it's<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.769> think<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.190> good

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
your move I think it's I think a good

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.240 
your move I think it's I think a good
motto<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.850> keep<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.209> mind<00:02:41.239> is<00:02:41.660> do<00:02:42.380> not<00:02:42.590> move<00:02:42.890> out

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
motto to keep in mind is do not move out

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.280 
motto to keep in mind is do not move out
in<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.640> open<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:44.180> you're<00:02:44.480> not<00:02:44.630> stealth<00:02:45.080> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
in the open if you're not stealth and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.339 
in the open if you're not stealth and
never<00:02:46.040> engage<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:47.120> target<00:02:47.360> unless<00:02:48.110> you're<00:02:48.260> in

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
never engage a target unless you're in

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.559 
never engage a target unless you're in
the<00:02:48.410> heart<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.799> if<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.880> just<00:02:50.060> keep<00:02:50.269> doing

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
the heart of it if you just keep doing

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.020 
the heart of it if you just keep doing
that<00:02:50.690> back<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.200> forth<00:02:51.380> back<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.590> forth<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that back and forth back and forth you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.949 
that back and forth back and forth you
will<00:02:53.060> do<00:02:53.299> very<00:02:53.569> very<00:02:53.810> well<00:02:54.019> i<00:02:54.940> usually<00:02:55.940> get<00:02:56.720> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
will do very very well i usually get the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.870 
will do very very well i usually get the
skills<00:02:57.319> almost<00:02:57.799> every<00:02:58.099> single<00:02:58.400> game<00:02:58.549> for

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
skills almost every single game for

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.900 
skills almost every single game for
adaptability<00:02:59.299> meaning<00:03:00.019> i<00:03:00.110> change<00:03:00.769> suit<00:03:01.130> in

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
adaptability meaning i change suit in

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.210 
adaptability meaning i change suit in
and<00:03:02.090> out<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.390> most<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.680> really<00:03:03.920> think<00:03:04.099> that

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
and out the most and I really think that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.440 
and out the most and I really think that
that<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.640> what<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.030> game<00:03:05.269> is<00:03:05.299> about

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
that is what this game is about

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.930 
that is what this game is about
obviously<00:03:06.349> is<00:03:06.530> maintaining<00:03:07.459> your<00:03:07.549> energy

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
obviously is maintaining your energy

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.420 
obviously is maintaining your energy
maintaining<00:03:08.540> your<00:03:08.630> suit<00:03:09.040> right<00:03:10.040> here<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.280> have

maintaining your suit right here I have
no<00:03:10.670> ammo<00:03:11.060> that's<00:03:11.390> another<00:03:11.570> thing<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.840> maintain

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
no ammo that's another thing to maintain

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.140 
no ammo that's another thing to maintain
if<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.650> have<00:03:12.829> like<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.430> Scarab<00:03:13.760> which<00:03:14.030> is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150

what<00:03:14.329> i'm<00:03:14.420> using<00:03:14.660> as<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.959> rifle<00:03:15.829> of<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.070> feline

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
what i'm using as a rifle of a feline

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.479 
what i'm using as a rifle of a feline
for<00:03:17.570> certain<00:03:17.900> guns<00:03:18.109> if<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.799> survive<00:03:19.130> for<00:03:19.459> a

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
for certain guns if you survive for a

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.490 
for certain guns if you survive for a
little<00:03:19.640> bit<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.810> will<00:03:20.900> run<00:03:21.049> out<00:03:21.109> of<00:03:21.200> ammo

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.920 
little bit you will run out of ammo
quickly<00:03:21.859> so<00:03:22.180> just<00:03:23.180> like<00:03:23.329> i<00:03:23.450> say<00:03:23.690> in<00:03:23.810> other

quickly so just like i say in other
first-person<00:03:24.350> shooter<00:03:24.739> games<00:03:24.920> if<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.400> kill

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.789 
around the map for a minute trying to
find<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.850> gun<00:03:35.380> you'll<00:03:36.380> just<00:03:36.590> have<00:03:36.769> one<00:03:36.980> already

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
find a gun you'll just have one already

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.490 
find a gun you'll just have one already
also<00:03:39.799> another<00:03:40.430> key<00:03:40.790> thing<00:03:40.819> is<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.450> never<00:03:42.079> stay

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
also another key thing is is never stay

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.800 
also another key thing is is never stay
in<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.680> same<00:03:42.769> position<00:03:43.489> i<00:03:43.880> noticed<00:03:44.660> this<00:03:44.720> a

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
in the same position i noticed this a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.509 
in the same position i noticed this a
lot<00:03:45.200> with<00:03:45.230> snipers<00:03:45.889> and<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.160> mean<00:03:46.340> clearly

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
lot with snipers and I mean clearly

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.340 
lot with snipers and I mean clearly
obviously<00:03:47.120> snipers<00:03:47.569> are<00:03:47.720> going<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.900> get<00:03:48.079> in<00:03:48.230> a

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
obviously snipers are going to get in a

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.099 
obviously snipers are going to get in a
good<00:03:48.470> position<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.100> try<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.609> stay<00:03:49.880> there<00:03:50.120> but

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
good position and try to stay there but

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.020 
good position and try to stay there but
I<00:03:51.170> really<00:03:51.560> feel<00:03:51.799> like<00:03:51.829> if<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.489> get<00:03:52.730> into<00:03:52.910> a

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
I really feel like if you get into a

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.759 
I really feel like if you get into a
good<00:03:53.239> area<00:03:53.600> as<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> sniper<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.590> should

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
good area as a sniper you should

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.789 
good area as a sniper you should
constantly<00:03:55.400> relocate<00:03:56.209> within<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.799> because

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
constantly relocate within it because

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.530 
constantly relocate within it because
for<00:03:57.980> example<00:03:58.010> i<00:03:58.489> know<00:03:58.549> there's<00:03:58.880> like<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.239> sniper

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
for example i know there's like a sniper

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.340 
for example i know there's like a sniper
2<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.290> my<00:04:00.410> left<00:04:00.650> on<00:04:00.980> this<00:04:01.220> back<00:04:01.430> wall<00:04:01.459> there

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
2 to my left on this back wall there

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.160 
2 to my left on this back wall there
and<00:04:02.980> for<00:04:03.280> me<00:04:03.400> when<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:03.670> see<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.240> sniper<00:04:04.630> shooting

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
and for me when I see a sniper shooting

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.810 
and for me when I see a sniper shooting
because<00:04:05.290> snipers<00:04:05.740> can<00:04:05.920> be<00:04:06.010> pretty<00:04:06.280> nasty<00:04:06.370> in

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
because snipers can be pretty nasty in

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.940 
because snipers can be pretty nasty in
the<00:04:06.880> spoon<00:04:07.120> they<00:04:07.810> can<00:04:07.990> really<00:04:08.320> devastate<00:04:08.860> your

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
the spoon they can really devastate your

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.280 
the spoon they can really devastate your
team<00:04:09.190> if<00:04:09.880> I<00:04:10.000> see<00:04:10.210> a<00:04:10.240> sniper<00:04:10.540> shooting<00:04:10.960> me<00:04:11.080> or<00:04:11.260> a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
team if I see a sniper shooting me or a

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.410 
team if I see a sniper shooting me or a
teammate<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:11.890> can<00:04:12.250> guarantee<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:13.300> will

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
teammate you can guarantee that I will

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.930 
teammate you can guarantee that I will
be<00:04:13.660> behind<00:04:13.840> them<00:04:14.260> breaking<00:04:14.680> their<00:04:14.950> neck<00:04:15.130> by

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
be behind them breaking their neck by

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.490 
be behind them breaking their neck by
the<00:04:16.000> time<00:04:16.300> they<00:04:16.480> probably<00:04:16.750> take<00:04:17.020> their<00:04:17.230> fourth

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
the time they probably take their fourth

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.710 
the time they probably take their fourth
or<00:04:17.650> fifth<00:04:17.890> shot<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:19.390> know<00:04:19.480> if<00:04:19.570> you're<00:04:19.690> going

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
or fifth shot you know if you're going

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.540 
or fifth shot you know if you're going
to<00:04:19.900> sit<00:04:20.080> in<00:04:20.110> the<00:04:20.230> same<00:04:20.410> area<00:04:20.680> I'm<00:04:21.010> going<00:04:21.400> to

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
to sit in the same area I'm going to

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.640 
to sit in the same area I'm going to
track<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:22.000> down<00:04:22.030> into<00:04:22.450> two<00:04:22.630> seconds<00:04:23.050> because

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
track you down into two seconds because

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.280 
track you down into two seconds because
you<00:04:23.830> can<00:04:23.980> really<00:04:24.100> run<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:25.600> can<00:04:25.780> run<00:04:25.810> across

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
you can really run you can run across

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.530 
you can really run you can run across
like<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.650> entire<00:04:26.950> map<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:27.550> in<00:04:27.850> seconds<00:04:28.450> and

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
like the entire map in in seconds and

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.300 
like the entire map in in seconds and
really<00:04:28.780> be<00:04:28.960> anywhere<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.590> like<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.980> was<00:04:30.070> saying

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
really be anywhere and like I was saying

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.070 
really be anywhere and like I was saying
before<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.820> can<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.150> can<00:04:31.300> park<00:04:31.540> or<00:04:31.810> anywhere

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
before you can you can park or anywhere

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.340 
before you can you can park or anywhere
so<00:04:33.070> you're<00:04:33.220> really<00:04:33.310> not<00:04:33.400> safe<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.900> every<00:04:35.320> time

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
so you're really not safe so every time

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.110 
so you're really not safe so every time
you<00:04:35.500> kill<00:04:35.890> somebody<00:04:36.130> every<00:04:36.460> time<00:04:36.670> you<00:04:36.970> know

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
you kill somebody every time you know

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.500 
you kill somebody every time you know
somebody<00:04:37.960> sees<00:04:38.560> your<00:04:38.740> location<00:04:39.340> it's<00:04:40.210> very

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
somebody sees your location it's very

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.130 
somebody sees your location it's very
important<00:04:41.140> to<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.770> relocate<00:04:42.430> immediately

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
important to to relocate immediately

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.420 
important to to relocate immediately
just<00:04:44.140> so<00:04:44.260> that<00:04:44.290> people<00:04:44.710> can't<00:04:44.920> track<00:04:45.100> you<00:04:45.400> and

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
just so that people can't track you and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.180 
just so that people can't track you and
you<00:04:45.670> always<00:04:45.700> keep<00:04:46.240> them<00:04:46.780> guessing<00:04:47.190> because

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
you always keep them guessing because

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.740 
you always keep them guessing because
it's<00:04:48.460> really<00:04:48.700> about<00:04:48.790> positioning<00:04:49.600> and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
it's really about positioning and

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.240 
it's really about positioning and
knowing<00:04:50.050> where<00:04:50.230> people<00:04:50.530> are<00:04:50.710> in<00:04:50.890> this<00:04:51.040> game

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
knowing where people are in this game

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.910 
knowing where people are in this game
and<00:04:52.060> then<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.660> know<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:53.020> then<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.740> then

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
and then you know and then and then

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.340 
and then you know and then and then
chasing<00:04:54.340> them<00:04:54.430> down<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:55.660> always<00:04:55.900> stay<00:04:56.200> in<00:04:56.230> the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
chasing them down so always stay in the

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.200 
chasing them down so always stay in the
shadows<00:04:56.590> always<00:04:57.100> stay<00:04:57.280> hidden<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.730> make<00:04:58.030> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
shadows always stay hidden and make the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.980 
shadows always stay hidden and make the
other<00:04:58.360> team<00:04:58.660> guess<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.290> wearing<00:05:00.190> your<00:05:00.280> actor

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
other team guess of wearing your actor

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.960 
other team guess of wearing your actor
and<00:05:01.990> you'll<00:05:02.110> see<00:05:02.290> here<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.790> activate<00:05:03.790> this

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
and you'll see here I activate this

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.130 
and you'll see here I activate this

kill streak on some of the maps of some
of<00:05:10.810> them<00:05:10.960> you'll<00:05:11.410> get<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.830> set<00:05:12.070> gunship<00:05:12.580> which

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
of them you'll get the set gunship which

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.690 
of them you'll get the set gunship which
is<00:05:13.660> like<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.930> know<00:05:14.020> an<00:05:14.080> attack<00:05:14.380> alien<00:05:15.250> chopper

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
is like you know an attack alien chopper

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.090 
is like you know an attack alien chopper
or<00:05:15.820> whatever<00:05:16.140> and<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.290> other<00:05:17.440> half<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:17.890> maps
