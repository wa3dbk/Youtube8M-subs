proper counters now and like I said I
would<00:00:43.379> adapt<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.129> ever<00:00:44.250> forced<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
would adapt if I was ever forced to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.910 
would adapt if I was ever forced to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
adapt and in this video I'll be

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.900 
adapt and in this video I'll be
attempting<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.809> is<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:50.340> didn't<00:00:50.760> know

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
attempting to do so is I didn't know

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.930 
attempting to do so is I didn't know
what<00:00:51.600> he<00:00:51.719> would<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.489> maybe<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.610> could<00:00:53.850> have

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
what he would do and maybe I could have

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
what he would do and maybe I could have
beaten<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> six<00:00:54.870> pole<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> just

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
beaten this with a six pole it just

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
beaten this with a six pole it just
depends<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.800> his<00:00:55.949> micro<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> wouldn't<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
depends on his micro but it wouldn't be

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.430 
depends on his micro but it wouldn't be
a<00:00:57.660> guarantee<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:01:00.109> he's<00:01:01.109> um

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a guarantee and as you can see he's um

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.560 
a guarantee and as you can see he's um

six full here without the only thing I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.640 
six full here without the only thing I

was really trying to do was a scout him
out<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.610> did<00:01:14.850> succeed<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:16.140> my

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
out and I did succeed at that I got my

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.469 
out and I did succeed at that I got my
way<00:01:16.439> through<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:17.040> he's<00:01:17.790> gonna<00:01:17.909> attack<00:01:18.240> my

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
way through here he's gonna attack my

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.969 
way through here he's gonna attack my
drone<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.960> was<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> micro<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> around

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
drone and I was going to micro it around

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.370 
drone and I was going to micro it around
to<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.729> he<00:01:21.540> actually<00:01:21.659> completes<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to I can see he actually completes the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.560 
to I can see he actually completes the
wall<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> photon<00:01:23.790> cannon<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
wall in with a photon cannon this is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170 
wall in with a photon cannon this is
reasonably<00:01:25.439> an<00:01:25.590> unorthodox<00:01:25.830> opening<00:01:26.580> because

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
reasonably an unorthodox opening because

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.300 
reasonably an unorthodox opening because
I<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.810> tight<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.799> two<00:01:28.979> Ling's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
I think that's tight not just two Ling's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.819 
I think that's tight not just two Ling's
for<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> his<00:01:29.880> outlets<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.350> help<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> wait

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
for to his outlets to so help to wait

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.719 
for to his outlets to so help to wait
until<00:01:32.100> he<00:01:32.820> gets<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> rocks<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:34.490> really<00:01:35.490> find

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
until he gets the rocks to really find

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.800 
until he gets the rocks to really find
his<00:01:35.850> way<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.340> yeah<00:01:41.570> let's<00:01:42.570> see

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
his way out of here so yeah let's see

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.560 
his way out of here so yeah let's see
what<00:01:42.960> he<00:01:43.049> does<00:01:43.700> meanwhile<00:01:44.700> i'm<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
what he does meanwhile i'm just going a

isn't<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.930> dynamic<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.590> mean<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.740> guess<00:01:52.890> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
isn't very dynamic I mean I guess I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.850 
isn't very dynamic I mean I guess I
could<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.220> roaches<00:01:53.780> but<00:01:54.780> seeing<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> cannon<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
could go roaches but seeing the cannon I

going to be able to pile on hide he
killed<00:04:01.709> my<00:04:01.829> base<00:04:02.190> but<00:04:02.639> because<00:04:02.970> he's<00:04:03.180> got<00:04:03.359> just

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
killed my base but because he's got just

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.569 
killed my base but because he's got just
void<00:04:03.870> rays<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.290> they're<00:04:04.410> focusing<00:04:04.889> the<00:04:05.069> more

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
void rays and they're focusing the more

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
last building meanwhile actually I'm

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.300 
last building meanwhile actually I'm
kind<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.870> curious<00:04:42.050> what<00:04:42.410> he<00:04:42.560> was<00:04:42.800> trying<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.220> do

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
kind of curious what he was trying to do

kind of curious what he was trying to do
with<00:04:43.460> his<00:04:43.580> voids<00:04:43.790> like<00:04:44.150> where<00:04:44.330> he<00:04:44.450> is<00:04:44.660> moving

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
with his voids like where he is moving

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.990 
with his voids like where he is moving
them<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:45.580> don't<00:04:46.580> think<00:04:46.880> he<00:04:47.060> ever<00:04:47.090> saw<00:04:48.760> where<00:04:49.760> my

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
them I don't think he ever saw where my

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.600 
them I don't think he ever saw where my
stuff<00:04:50.300> was<00:04:50.540> yeah<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.800> killed<00:04:52.010> his<00:04:52.190> pile<00:04:52.400> on

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
stuff was yeah and I killed his pile on

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.430 
stuff was yeah and I killed his pile on
for<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.030> win<00:04:53.120> so<00:04:53.480> that<00:04:53.750> will<00:04:53.840> be<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:53.990> good<00:04:54.200> game

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
for the win so that will be a good game

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.129 
for the win so that will be a good game
on<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.800> base<00:04:55.430> trace<00:04:55.790> all<00:04:56.360> in<00:04:56.630> baneling<00:04:57.110> bust

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
on a base trace all in baneling bust

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.980 
on a base trace all in baneling bust
versus<00:04:57.889> early<00:04:58.430> void<00:04:58.610> rays<00:04:58.880> quite<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.690> mess

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
versus early void rays quite a mess

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.080 
versus early void rays quite a mess
maybe<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.830> should<00:05:00.919> get<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.430> off<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.639> little<00:05:01.940> bit

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
maybe I should get that off a little bit

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.260 
maybe I should get that off a little bit
sooner<00:05:02.479> so<00:05:03.080> that<00:05:03.110> he<00:05:03.410> doesn't<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:04.310> don't<00:05:05.150> get

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
sooner so that he doesn't I don't get

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.240 
sooner so that he doesn't I don't get
avoid<00:05:05.450> right<00:05:05.660> death<00:05:05.930> but<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.710> went<00:05:06.919> for<00:05:07.100> well

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
avoid right death but it went for well

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.850 
avoid right death but it went for well
for<00:05:07.490> me<00:05:07.580> this<00:05:07.700> time<00:05:07.970> well<00:05:08.960> sort<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.620> well

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
for me this time well sort of well

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.550 
for me this time well sort of well
enough<00:05:10.190> so<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.210> would<00:05:11.510> be<00:05:11.570> good<00:05:11.810> game<00:05:12.050> see

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
enough so that would be good game see

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.370 
enough so that would be good game see
you<00:05:12.680> guys<00:05:12.740> next<00:05:13.100> time
