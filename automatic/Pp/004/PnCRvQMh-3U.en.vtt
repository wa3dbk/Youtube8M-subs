00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.400

 ingenious the guys of pc-world I have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 namely invited the hell machine 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.570
 a lot to test 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.570
 and I would say 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.330

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:21.270
 in addition to external programs

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 detectives 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.079
 who does not have a finished conference 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.530
 if you get me on the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.210
 So I think it's a bit sad 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.210
 when I am with my 13 to 1000 m 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.730
 I would just mention that I am the one 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.730
 best am 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.979
 mega hyper high appeared high 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.939
 his 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.310
 it's really hard interesting though 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.490
 better 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:19.670
 you're dead bad because the bullets 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:23.030
 fly as long as it showed 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.590
 boring even though before the game 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.870
 first time is strong and then it comes 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.170
 an eternally long beginning sequence at am 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.170
 Beginning 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.290
 the 3d we have issued me 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.290
 adjusted 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:04:04.640
 this is now fast control tns 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:17.390
 Fabian in absorbing water you can 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:20.320
 I promise I will not 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.320
 watch what movies 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.940
 you already have very good is not mine 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.940
 plan 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.580
 you can be sure that I have something like that 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.110
 are just not used when we 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.139
 then no video material will be on 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.740
 I do not use something like that and with it 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.740
 end the video 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.930
 suddenly make 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.580
 Pelzer Unser said to us now 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.440
 have the pc tested us one 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.090
 opinion formed wanted but first 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.580
 Let's say a huge thank you 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.240
 thank you first to pc world for it 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.430
 just that we have this possibility 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.890
 had this money to test and 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.760
 otherwise they were just great guys 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.230
 So really happy 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.060
 That's why we want to be huge again 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.770
 Thank you for doing all this 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.540
 All in all, it was simply great 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.630
 gaming experience i think we will never 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.650
 again in the next years something first 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.650
 the future will bring the next one 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.960
 year first try such a hot tt 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.710
 allowed 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.930
 Personally, that was just me 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.790
 soundsystem so blatant my bed fell so 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.220
 the ears explode it seems to me 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.070
 as if it were the list that the 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.450
 cheap and almost 180 degrees to almost one has 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.370
 the feeling you are right in the middle 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.510
 and if the 3D effect at that come 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.920
 then as in real life exactly from 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.440
 with the topic 3d effect you have to go 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.120
 we do not just want to say here now 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.800
 It was our job to mucilate 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.390
 the pc to test what he can do everything and 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.040
 you have to say fair 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.660
 the pc also has its limits to 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.610
 For example, if you are just like that 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.520
 on three screens on the highest 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.470
 image setting with ultra and 3d 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.650
 Of course, there are a few 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.700
 problems and so we can look at what 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.360
 Almost everything is appetizing 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.590
 he can not do it all but who 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.360
 needs the masses small 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.740
 knickknack so overall easy 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.120
 Sick 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.610
 overall and wc everyone wants to have 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.930
 Everyone wants everyone to be muslim, I say 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.450
 Just because you do not have it 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.200
 played and I just I tell 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.270
 added and forth 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.590
 if I know everyone plays tomorrow 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.720
 in the game also that is one 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.350

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.700
