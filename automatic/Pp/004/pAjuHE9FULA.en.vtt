management services a great program
provides<00:00:55.920> that's<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.430> spike<00:00:56.670> source<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
provides that's what spike source is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
provides that's what spike source is
known<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.360> right<00:00:57.539> exactly<00:00:58.079> well<00:00:58.500> that's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
software companies can deliver higher

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.940 
software companies can deliver higher
quality<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.450> trustworthy<00:01:07.200> software<00:01:07.799> that's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
quality more trustworthy software that's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 
quality more trustworthy software that's
been<00:01:08.100> optimized<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> Intel<00:01:09.210> platform<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
been optimized for the Intel platform so

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
been optimized for the Intel platform so
everyone's<00:01:10.409> best<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.770> Intel

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
everyone's best on Intel

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.499 
everyone's best on Intel
it's<00:01:12.329> secure<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.320> been<00:01:13.909> tested<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.299> could

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's secure it's been tested you could

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's secure it's been tested you could
put<00:01:15.689> through<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.020> an<00:01:16.289> ongoing<00:01:16.740> set<00:01:17.490> of

great<00:01:25.450> can<00:01:25.960> you<00:01:26.050> talk<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.260> little<00:01:26.409> bit<00:01:26.680> about

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
great can you talk a little bit about

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.680 
great can you talk a little bit about
what<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.130> means<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.909> customers<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.450> the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
what that means to the customers of the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.930 
what that means to the customers of the
software<00:01:29.380> out<00:01:29.590> there<00:01:29.620> yes<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.370> this<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> big

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
software out there yes so this is a big

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.450 
software out there yes so this is a big
benefit<00:01:31.690> customers<00:01:32.020> as<00:01:32.440> well<00:01:32.470> that<00:01:33.250> means

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
benefit customers as well that means

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.770 
benefit customers as well that means
that<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.970> software<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.540> they're

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
that the software that they're

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.240 
that the software that they're
purchasing<00:01:35.260> they<00:01:35.530> know<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:35.860> it's<00:01:36.010> been

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
purchasing they know that it's been

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.460 
purchasing they know that it's been
tested<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.090> validated<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.780> work<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.260> the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
tested and validated to work it's the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.590 
tested and validated to work it's the
highest<00:01:38.650> quality<00:01:38.950> standards<00:01:39.250> it's<00:01:40.150> secure

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
highest quality standards it's secure

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.510 
highest quality standards it's secure
and<00:01:40.840> again<00:01:41.290> it's<00:01:41.440> optimized<00:01:41.950> for<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.250> Intel

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and again it's optimized for the Intel

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.240 
and again it's optimized for the Intel
platform<00:01:43.000> well<00:01:43.450> that's<00:01:43.780> great<00:01:44.110> as<00:01:44.650> I<00:01:44.890> if<00:01:45.160> I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
platform well that's great as I if I

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.830 
platform well that's great as I if I
recall<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.580> think<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.119> suffer<00:01:46.630> in

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
recall I think that that suffer in

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.020 
recall I think that that suffer in
partner<00:01:47.229> program<00:01:47.530> has<00:01:47.770> one<00:01:48.130> about<00:01:48.369> 8,000

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030
