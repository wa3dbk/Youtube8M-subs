one<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.559> his<00:00:11.059> sterno<00:00:12.059> stoves<00:00:12.389> it's

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
one of his sterno stoves it's

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.500 
one of his sterno stoves it's
reminiscent<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.219> old<00:00:14.370> heaven<00:00:15.209> he<00:00:15.330> once

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
reminiscent of the old heaven he once

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.290 
reminiscent of the old heaven he once
though<00:00:16.430> the<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.520> short<00:00:17.760> wind<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.119> there's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
though the in short wind that there's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.810 
though the in short wind that there's
like<00:00:18.630> ten<00:00:18.960> different<00:00:19.170> improvements<00:00:19.919> and<00:00:20.130> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
like ten different improvements and I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580 
like ten different improvements and I
have<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> tendency<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.540> believe<00:00:21.660> them<00:00:21.900> didn't

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
have a tendency to believe them didn't

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.339 
have a tendency to believe them didn't
think<00:00:22.770> that<00:00:22.919> the<00:00:23.040> stove<00:00:23.310> could<00:00:24.080> boil<00:00:25.080> water

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
think that the stove could boil water

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.260 
think that the stove could boil water
ever<00:00:25.740> really<00:00:27.410> used<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.619> because<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.059> told

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
ever really used it because it was told

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.560 
ever really used it because it was told
that<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.540> didn't<00:00:30.779> boil<00:00:30.960> water<00:00:31.200> and<00:00:32.120> it's<00:00:33.120> kind

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that it didn't boil water and it's kind

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.940 
that it didn't boil water and it's kind
of<00:00:33.660> slow<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.020> heavy<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> don't<00:00:34.649> think<00:00:34.770> I'm

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
of slow and heavy so I don't think I'm

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.319 
of slow and heavy so I don't think I'm
gonna<00:00:35.040> carry<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.850> pretty<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.270> for

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
gonna carry it but it is pretty good for

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
gonna carry it but it is pretty good for
different<00:00:36.540> outings<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> tried<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.309> home

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
different outings so I tried it at home

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.119 
different outings so I tried it at home
and<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.790> actually<00:00:38.969> did<00:00:39.390> boil<00:00:39.690> water<00:00:40.129> except

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and it actually did boil water except

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
and it actually did boil water except
that<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:42.270> doesn't<00:00:42.570> give<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:42.840> parents<00:00:43.380> of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that it doesn't give you the parents of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.400 
that it doesn't give you the parents of
boiling<00:00:43.830> water<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.550> none<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> none

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
boiling water because none of the none

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.330 
boiling water because none of the none
of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.560> bubbles<00:00:46.860> come<00:00:47.010> off<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.790> you<00:00:47.880> use<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
of the bubbles come off but if you use a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.860 
of the bubbles come off but if you use a
thermometer<00:00:50.340> you'll<00:00:50.910> find<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.390> indeed

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
thermometer you'll find out that indeed

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.979 
thermometer you'll find out that indeed
the<00:00:52.020> water<00:00:52.230> does<00:00:52.470> reach<00:00:52.680> 212<00:00:53.340> degrees<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.630> what

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the water does reach 212 degrees so what

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.300 
the water does reach 212 degrees so what
we're<00:00:55.079> gonna<00:00:55.200> do<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.650> I'm<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.130> gonna

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
we're gonna do here is I'm just gonna

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.750 
we're gonna do here is I'm just gonna
reheat<00:00:56.760> some<00:00:57.890> some<00:00:58.890> chicken<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.400> I<00:00:59.430> made<00:00:59.640> at

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
reheat some some chicken that I made at

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.550 
reheat some some chicken that I made at
home<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.480> Portuguese<00:01:00.750> chicken<00:01:01.290> dish<00:01:01.410> my

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
home some Portuguese chicken dish my

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.939 
home some Portuguese chicken dish my
grandmother<00:01:01.980> used<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.190> make<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.829> we've<00:01:04.829> got

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
grandmother used to make and we've got

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.810 
grandmother used to make and we've got
some<00:01:05.189> trunk<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.840> cook<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.470> we'll<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.610> back

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
some trunk to cook up and we'll get back

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.639 
some trunk to cook up and we'll get back
all<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.899> seems<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.290> doing<00:01:10.439> pretty

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
all right so it seems to be doing pretty

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.899 
all right so it seems to be doing pretty
good<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:11.850> really<00:01:12.119> liking<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:14.460> surface

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
good I'm not really liking the surface

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.809 
good I'm not really liking the surface
its<00:01:15.090> slippery<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.630> hell<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.710> thinking<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.609> just

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
its slippery as hell so thinking I just

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.010 
its slippery as hell so thinking I just
need<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.030> put<00:01:18.179> a<00:01:18.210> couple<00:01:18.359> of<00:01:18.479> Neuros<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.929> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
need to put a couple of Neuros on the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.309 
need to put a couple of Neuros on the
top<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.499> solve<00:01:20.249> that<00:01:20.399> problem<00:01:20.880> i<00:01:21.079> look<00:01:22.079> i

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
top and solve that problem i look i

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.590 
top and solve that problem i look i
accidentally<00:01:23.189> erase<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.179> footage<00:01:24.420> i

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
accidentally erase that the footage i

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.069 
accidentally erase that the footage i
had<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.079> the<00:01:25.229> stove<00:01:25.499> at<00:01:25.649> home<00:01:25.679> boiling<00:01:26.399> water

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
had of the stove at home boiling water

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.080 
had of the stove at home boiling water
so<00:01:28.079> i'll<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.289> to<00:01:28.350> redo<00:01:29.249> it<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.639> believe<00:01:29.909> me

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so i'll have to redo it but believe me

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
so i'll have to redo it but believe me
it<00:01:30.450> does<00:01:30.719> boil<00:01:30.990> water<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.380> you'll<00:01:31.679> have<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it does boil water but you'll have to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
it does boil water but you'll have to
have<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.819> said<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.060> temperature<00:01:33.450> gauge

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
have like I said a temperature gauge

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.529 
have like I said a temperature gauge
because<00:01:34.499> it<00:01:34.829> reaches<00:01:35.130> 212<00:01:35.609> and<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.450> you're

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
because it reaches 212 and all you're

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.899 
because it reaches 212 and all you're
gonna<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.929> is<00:01:36.959> a<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.920> fine<00:01:38.130> steam<00:01:38.549> coming

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
gonna see is a really fine steam coming

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.370 
gonna see is a really fine steam coming
off<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.090> top<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.539> you'll<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.109> pre

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
off the top and you'll think it's a pre

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
off the top and you'll think it's a pre
boil<00:01:40.649> temperature<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.490> fact<00:01:41.819> it's<00:01:41.999> not

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
boil temperature in fact it's not

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.510 
boil temperature in fact it's not
there's<00:01:42.749> just<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:43.079> enough<00:01:43.139> BTUs<00:01:43.859> to<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
there's just not enough BTUs to get it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.109 
there's just not enough BTUs to get it
rolling<00:01:44.789> but<00:01:45.719> on<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:47.100> should<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.549> this

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
rolling but on this should be this

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.419 
rolling but on this should be this
should<00:01:48.179> be<00:01:48.420> done<00:01:48.569> in<00:01:48.719> probably<00:01:49.020> 10<00:01:49.740> 15<00:01:50.130> minutes

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
should be done in probably 10 15 minutes

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.039 
should be done in probably 10 15 minutes
this<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:50.999> already<00:01:51.359> cooked<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.840> we're<00:01:51.929> just

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
this is already cooked and we're just

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:05.740 
this is already cooked and we're just
heating<00:01:52.229> up

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.740 

alright<00:02:06.440> guys<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.830> guess<00:02:07.180> yes<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.330> strana<00:02:08.540> does

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
alright guys I guess yes the strana does

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.900 
alright guys I guess yes the strana does
a<00:02:08.780> pretty<00:02:08.960> good<00:02:09.050> job<00:02:09.229> over<00:02:09.649> do<00:02:10.520> something

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
a pretty good job over do something

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.160 
a pretty good job over do something
really<00:02:11.090> quick<00:02:11.240> tell<00:02:11.570> him<00:02:11.690> in<00:02:11.780> about<00:02:11.930> five

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
really quick tell him in about five

minutes like I said I had lost the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.110 
minutes like I said I had lost the
footage<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:14.900> boiling<00:02:15.620> water<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.370> it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
footage of this boiling water and it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.480 
footage of this boiling water and it
certainly<00:02:17.450> does<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.130> was<00:02:19.280> very

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
for this new different is put on the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.750 
for this new different is put on the
knurled<00:03:34.790> on<00:03:34.940> top<00:03:36.070> as<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:37.130> can<00:03:37.310> see<00:03:37.550> there's

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
knurled on top as you can see there's

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.240 
knurled on top as you can see there's
bubbles<00:03:38.120> on<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.360> bottom<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.710> bubbles<00:03:40.070> on<00:03:40.160> the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
bubbles on the bottom and bubbles on the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.180 
bubbles on the bottom and bubbles on the
side<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.850> it's<00:03:41.120> not<00:03:41.300> steaming<00:03:41.720> up<00:03:41.900> enough<00:03:42.190> so

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
side and it's not steaming up enough so

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.740 
side and it's not steaming up enough so
it's<00:03:43.340> probably<00:03:43.760> not<00:03:43.940> at<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.150> boil<00:03:44.390> this<00:03:44.600> is

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
it's probably not at a boil this is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.900 
it's probably not at a boil this is
probably<00:03:45.020> at<00:03:45.140> around<00:03:45.290> 200<00:03:45.710> degrees<00:03:45.740> but<00:03:46.730> this

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
probably at around 200 degrees but this

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.430 
probably at around 200 degrees but this
is<00:03:47.060> reminiscent<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.630> what<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.020> looks<00:03:48.260> like

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
is reminiscent to what it looks like

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.440 
is reminiscent to what it looks like
when<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.740> actually<00:03:48.890> does<00:03:49.100> boil<00:03:49.550> except<00:03:50.360> you'll

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
when it actually does boil except you'll

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.820 
when it actually does boil except you'll
have<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.660> little<00:03:50.840> more<00:03:50.930> steam<00:03:51.320> coming<00:03:51.710> off<00:03:51.770> the

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
have a little more steam coming off the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.460 
have a little more steam coming off the
top<00:03:52.090> you'll<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.420> won't<00:03:53.570> see<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.870> bubbles<00:03:54.230> at

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
top you'll you won't see the bubbles at

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.680 
top you'll you won't see the bubbles at
least<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:54.980> when<00:03:55.790> I've<00:03:55.940> done<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.270> I<00:03:56.480> haven't

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
least I when I've done this I haven't

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.240 
least I when I've done this I haven't
seen<00:03:56.930> any<00:03:57.080> bubbles<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.590> come<00:03:57.770> up<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.100> it's

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
seen any bubbles that come up and it's

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.650 
seen any bubbles that come up and it's
not<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:58.580> get<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:58.910> rolling<00:03:59.120> boil

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
not just get this rolling boil

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.720 
not just get this rolling boil
actually<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.230> only<00:04:00.340> streaking<00:04:01.340> more<00:04:01.520> than

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
actually the only streaking more than

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.340 
actually the only streaking more than
this<00:04:01.850> this<00:04:02.360> happens<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.900> then<00:04:03.020> it<00:04:03.110> slows<00:04:03.320> down

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
this this happens and then it slows down

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.060 
this this happens and then it slows down
and<00:04:03.800> you<00:04:03.890> just<00:04:04.070> not<00:04:04.220> getting<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:05.500> thicker<00:04:06.500> head

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
and you just not getting a thicker head

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.530 
and you just not getting a thicker head
of<00:04:07.190> steam<00:04:07.430> coming<00:04:07.790> off<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.000> top

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
of steam coming off the top

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.509 
of steam coming off the top
so<00:04:10.730> like<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.849> said<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.269> close<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.569> 212<00:04:13.140> now

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
so like I said this is close to 212 now

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.920 
so like I said this is close to 212 now
and<00:04:14.519> I'll<00:04:14.730> have<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:14.970> I'll<00:04:15.209> have<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.450> retest<00:04:15.750> it

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
and I'll have to I'll have to retest it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.240 
and I'll have to I'll have to retest it
at<00:04:16.019> home<00:04:16.139> but<00:04:16.260> at<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> monitor<00:04:16.829> on<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.190> you

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
at home but at the monitor on so you
