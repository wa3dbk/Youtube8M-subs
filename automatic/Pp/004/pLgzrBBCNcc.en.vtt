okay but actually like it better with
the<00:01:01.649> lip<00:01:01.800> gloss<00:01:02.010> because<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.730> um<00:01:03.439> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the lip gloss because it it's um it

the lip gloss because it it's um it
makes<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:04.949> lips<00:01:05.100> more<00:01:05.430> moisturize<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.119> what

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
stick together a little bit because it's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.260

it's definitely not the most
moisturizing<00:01:15.060> lipstick<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.369> lot

an<00:01:53.970> actual<00:01:54.240> stick<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.170> looks<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:56.460> looks<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
an actual stick like it looks it looks a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
an actual stick like it looks it looks a
bit<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:56.880> deeper<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.570> plum<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.320> it's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
bit more deeper more like plum but it's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.480 
bit more deeper more like plum but it's
bright<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> put<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.360> lips<00:02:00.570> um<00:02:01.490> and

bright when you put on your lips um and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.109 
bright when you put on your lips um and

I don't actually know what what lines on

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
I don't actually know what what lines on
the<00:02:06.180> proper<00:02:06.390> call<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.409> it's

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the proper call this is from I know it's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.050 
the proper call this is from I know it's
like<00:02:07.799> new<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.310> I've<00:02:08.429> never<00:02:08.729> seen<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
like new because I've never seen it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.270 
like new because I've never seen it

guys
yeah<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.700> mean<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.240> like<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:14.930> not<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.140> color<00:02:15.410> that

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
yeah I mean I like it's not a color that

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.199 
yeah I mean I like it's not a color that
I<00:02:15.650> would<00:02:15.770> wear<00:02:15.890> all<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> time<00:02:16.370> I'd<00:02:16.760> rather

I would wear all the time I'd rather

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.930 
I would wear all the time I'd rather
probably<00:02:18.050> more<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.319> hot<00:02:18.709> pink<00:02:18.980> or<00:02:19.250> hot

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
probably more like hot pink or hot

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.180 
probably more like hot pink or hot
orange<00:02:20.720> or<00:02:20.840> red<00:02:20.870> over<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.069> like

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
orange or red over this this is like

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.480 
orange or red over this this is like
typically<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.760> clothes<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.120> wear<00:02:23.300> anyways

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
typically the clothes I wear anyways

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.030 
typically the clothes I wear anyways
yeah<00:02:25.490> like<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.209> okay<00:02:26.690> it's<00:02:26.870> okay<00:02:27.020> yeah<00:02:27.500> I

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
yeah like it's okay it's okay yeah I

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.970 
yeah like it's okay it's okay yeah I
don't<00:02:28.340> know<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:28.640> um<00:02:28.989> I'm<00:02:29.989> not<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.500> big<00:02:30.770> fan<00:02:30.800> of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
don't know like um I'm not a big fan of

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.210 
don't know like um I'm not a big fan of
like<00:02:31.220> darker<00:02:32.030> purple<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:33.410> just<00:02:33.800> want<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.040> try

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
like darker purple I just want to try

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.860 
like darker purple I just want to try
something<00:02:34.310> new<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.209> just<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.480> see<00:02:35.660> how<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
something new and just to see how it

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.559 
something new and just to see how it
would<00:02:36.440> turn<00:02:36.470> out<00:02:36.860> but<00:02:37.520> um<00:02:37.730> yeah<00:02:38.270> if<00:02:38.360> you're

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
would turn out but um yeah if you're

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.940 
would turn out but um yeah if you're
into<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.050> deeper<00:02:39.350> Purple's<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.890> you

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
into the deeper Purple's and you

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.729 
into the deeper Purple's and you
probably<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.870> nice<00:02:42.080> like

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
probably like it's like it's a nice like

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.360 
probably like it's like it's a nice like
bright<00:02:43.130> color<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:44.709> think<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.800> probably<00:02:45.830> would

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
bright color I think it probably would

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.759 
bright color I think it probably would
look<00:02:46.519> better<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:47.120> people<00:02:48.019> with<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.380> paler

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
look better on people with like paler

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.729 
look better on people with like paler
skin<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.370> guess<00:02:51.310> because<00:02:52.310> it's<00:02:52.459> just<00:02:52.670> more<00:02:53.120> as<00:02:53.600> a

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
skin I guess because it's just more as a

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.790 
skin I guess because it's just more as a
cheaper<00:02:54.739> undertones<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:56.000> feel<00:02:56.300> like<00:02:56.480> if

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
cheaper undertones and I feel like if

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.070 
cheaper undertones and I feel like if
you<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.310> have<00:02:58.430> like<00:02:58.610> Tanner<00:02:59.209> scanned<00:02:59.900> like

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
you if you have like Tanner scanned like

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.680 
you if you have like Tanner scanned like
olive<00:03:00.440> color<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:01.010> might<00:03:01.280> not<00:03:01.940> look<00:03:02.150> as<00:03:02.360> as

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
olive color and might not look as as

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.910 
olive color and might not look as as
good<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:04.940> what<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.300> looks<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.920> the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
good so this is what it looks like the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.820 
good so this is what it looks like the
lighting<00:03:07.130> is<00:03:07.340> kind<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.640> off<00:03:07.850> but<00:03:08.269> it's<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:09.110> think

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
lighting is kind of off but it's I think

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.860 
lighting is kind of off but it's I think
it<00:03:09.890> looks<00:03:09.950> kind<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.400> more<00:03:10.700> pink<00:03:11.090> than<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.540> does

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
it looks kind of more pink than it does

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.320 
it looks kind of more pink than it does
in<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.230> camera<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:13.340> more<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:14.239> the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
in the camera like it's more and the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.640 
in the camera like it's more and the
camera<00:03:14.569> looks<00:03:14.720> more<00:03:14.840> pink<00:03:15.080> but<00:03:15.319> it's<00:03:15.500> actually

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
camera looks more pink but it's actually

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.449 
camera looks more pink but it's actually
a<00:03:15.860> little<00:03:15.980> more<00:03:16.100> purple<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:18.130> yeah<00:03:19.130> that's<00:03:19.250> what

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
a little more purple so yeah that's what

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.330 
a little more purple so yeah that's what
it<00:03:19.489> looks<00:03:19.640> like<00:03:20.560> um<00:03:22.000> actually<00:03:23.000> it's<00:03:24.280> when<00:03:25.280> I

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
it looks like um actually it's when I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.930 
it looks like um actually it's when I
put<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.700> lip<00:03:25.910> gloss<00:03:26.150> on<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.860> kind<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.190> took

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
put the lip gloss on it it kind of took

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.069 
put the lip gloss on it it kind of took
away<00:03:29.180> from<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.390> color<00:03:29.600> like<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.959> actually

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
away from the color like it actually

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.380 
away from the color like it actually
made<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:32.260> more<00:03:33.260> i<00:03:33.739> guess<00:03:33.890> like<00:03:33.940> tone<00:03:34.940> down<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
made it more i guess like tone down the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.380 
made it more i guess like tone down the
color<00:03:35.570> and<00:03:35.930> not<00:03:36.350> make<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.100> as<00:03:37.220> like<00:03:37.400> bright<00:03:38.060> and

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
color and not make it as like bright and

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.330 
color and not make it as like bright and
um<00:03:39.280> purpley<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.459> guess<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.590> but<00:03:42.590> yeah<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.010> like<00:03:43.250> it

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
um purpley I guess so but yeah I like it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.949 
um purpley I guess so but yeah I like it
better<00:03:43.430> with<00:03:43.579> a<00:03:43.640> gloss<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.060> suggest<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.630> if

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
better with a gloss so I suggest that if

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.720 
better with a gloss so I suggest that if
you<00:03:45.079> guys<00:03:45.410> did<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:46.010> end<00:03:46.130> up<00:03:46.220> getting<00:03:46.370> like<00:03:46.700> a

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
you guys did you end up getting like a

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.340 
you guys did you end up getting like a
darker<00:03:47.150> purple<00:03:47.450> color<00:03:47.890> all<00:03:48.890> right<00:03:49.070> I
