00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
recorded with the camera so that's on my

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.590 
recorded with the camera so that's on my
phone<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.520> will<00:02:49.730> be<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.090> person<00:02:50.450> that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
phone that will be the person that

also<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.350> don't<00:02:54.709> know<00:02:54.890> if<00:02:55.130> every<00:02:55.370> movie<00:02:55.550> works

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
also I don't know if every movie works

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.250 
also I don't know if every movie works
