00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 and the o what do they say welcome back to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.970
 this new part of the former play a 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.730
 pokémon white version 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.530
 I'm a club and last part later 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.210
 almost fifty minutes of video 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.070
 we finally managed to defeat 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.920
 for the second time and in a manner 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.210
 definitive the pokémon alloy we have 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.789
 dispossessed nardò 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.980
 the former champion becoming ourselves i 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.920
 new champions and after defeating 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.170
 also as in the part before 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 previous we can dedicate ourselves to 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.619
 last three coaches remained from 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.460
 deal within this game 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.469
 some ports and others a little less 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 today we will start with our beautiful 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 rival our childhood friend so 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.070
 you have understood which category 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 I'm referring to those exactly 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.750
 less strong we are obviously in 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.930
 our room where every time 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.910
 restart after the challenge against the league 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.469
 at least in case of victory of our mother 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 and rightly tells us nothing 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.940
 so the only thing to do is to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 head to the laboratory of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.369
 lia professor here with a light breath 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.020
 where it all started to be able to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.510
 face beautiful indeed 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 then I would advise you to start with 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.500
 a pokemon-type fight because she 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.119
 will start with studies end then gold 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 what are you doing? I'd say go more with cats 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.170
 fight which by the way is the only one that is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.729
 still remained at level 70 unfortunately 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 I didn't perform very well 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.270
 I did not make one with her 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.970
 very good performance to the league in 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.799
 general so what i talk for 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.780
 face beautiful you have to go talk 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.329
 with her on a day that is not the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 weekend then from Monday to Friday 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.150
 or even on other days but then 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 it gets more complicated I tell you how I have it 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.840
 I made it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.119
 talk to beautiful from Monday to Friday 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 only once that it is Monday Tuesday 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.079
 Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, choose 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.939
 you the day after which you wait for the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.890
 weekend or Saturday and Sunday e 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.869
 talk to her again like this vi 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 will ask to challenge you now you can 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.369
 wait for good children or you can 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 change the time of the console or 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.000
 computer has played itself and emulators 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.119
 anyway over the weekend 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.579
 she will welcome with much happiness 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.620
 your request to fight and after 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.030
 comfortable 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.240
 I absolutely could not even do it 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.730
 fine how about a good fight 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.700
 today and we also jump with benevolence 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.140
 not even a good hello of the art 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.200
 we try not to overdo it, though 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.580
 we are not outdoors and after the first one 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.520
 part of the former play we have 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.320
 learned the lesson or not 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.230
 make struggles within buildings 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.460
 today and we send all that country because 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.370
 we are fighting in another 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.650
 building and is an excellent laboratory 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.090
 will start with studying level at 63 non 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.120
 with very strong pokémon 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.520
 better so obviously with arrogance than 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.290
 reduces the attack 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.440
 then I would say to do it first 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.360
 a nice sword dance to raise mine 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.520
 attack in this way I will also recover 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.350
 to the little variation he made to me 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.750
 that damn studying he uses 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:05.390
 lightness harshness so it moved well randomly 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.430
 it also suffers the backlash 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.180
 I would say to do another sword dance 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.180
 the last one 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.240
 and he uses obvious spritz again 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.850
 now to recover all the lost energy 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.940
 obviously it absorbs punch than after two 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.540
 sword dance will surely send ko stood 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.660
 perfect real land I did not expect to 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:38.360
 better and we took refuge almost all 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.990
 life finally level 70 or come on 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.820
 members to be level 71 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.010
 motian bouchard 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.920
 I leave catfight only because I am 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.180
 very confident that I will succeed in 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.120
 send her ko 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.010
 I'm sure I will succeed 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.630
 reverse I can make it sure but not 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.620
 I want to change 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:05.330
 I don't want to risk making a 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:11.480
 acrobatics at random rom find ourselves at 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:17.390
 it works and now level if it goes up to 71 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.549
 yes ok but let's go to the pokémon 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.720
 completely random since I don't know 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.500
 who to send I would say to send lumière 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.500
 I will regret it 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:35.879
 yes I do like this water but 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.689
 let alone oh so much that asks us to 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:42.150
 already change pokémon then good togas 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:48.479
 I don't know if sending him does not send him fear of 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:51.689
 a sky ray something like this e 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.120
 vice stripe 50 hp place the monkey 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:57.120
 of water and we obviously go with 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:04.219
 spritz lightning should make you wany that 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:09.659
 I quietly and I would say yes 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:12.599
 get off at the next choice then 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.500
 in this case I would say to send the 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.500
 our get off 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.520
 let's see some level and its 60 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.600
 something 63 all to 63 well in the shade 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:43.930
 I should do what I do even now 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:47.710
 I hope boom maximum choice if more 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.440
 I leave I can leave we could go 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:56.370
 federer but that's okay and let's go with 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.370
 piro toss rolls up ok he used coil 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.710
 so now all that increases a bit 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.150
 precision attack and piro launch defense 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:10.440
 the special defense for has not increased 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:13.510
 sure and boom too at a stroke 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.620
 michelle we always leave lumiere let's see 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.570
 if we can all do it in one 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.630
 blow only now that I said it there 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:24.190
 I can still have nuts certainly defeated 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:28.260
 psychic reversing farmyard to another 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.260
 pokémon with which I don't think social 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:39.410
 boom ugly blow in the end gentlemen ce 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.410
 we made it a shot each 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.289
 defeat fine thanks for fighting 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.520
 with me I learned a lot he learned that 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:53.729
 we no longer have to struggle in buildings 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:55.139
 true no heck if really strong and me 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.770
 you really like the way you notice 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:01.590
 even your pokémon and they look happy 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.970
 all here ok fine last information 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.340
 before removing the part you can 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.500
 note with beautiful every weekend 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.789
 and obviously always like mine 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.010
 victory as I have shown you two 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:14.220
 share every day so if you want 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.949
 risk giving it well do it now me 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.539
 I would go to our mother's choir and vi 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:21.479
 I would say a little bit what he intends 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:24.560
 to do in the next parts then I am 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:29.639
 apart from this there are two other parts 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.199
 the 49 and the 50 in the 49 the next one 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:33.360

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:35.130
 I should go and face camilla 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.860
 aspire to and morimoto 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.630
 if I'm not mistaken in the fight and if 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.860
 in the company fight against toe spa like 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.449
 cabbage was called it seems to me that yes 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.180
 find yourself there now, maybe I'm saying 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:49.110
 a bullshit I don't remember in the 50 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.970
 I'm going to catch care and so yes we are 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.280
 almost arrived at the end and at the 50th 

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.810
 you can ask me if the ex play is 

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.639
 finished because despite last 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.949

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:01.710
