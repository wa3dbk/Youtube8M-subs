00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.760 
score once at home all season as well I
I<00:01:38.880> can't<00:01:39.360> home<00:01:39.540> even<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.930> i<00:01:40.020> netted<00:01:40.200> win<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I can't home even if i netted win I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
I can't home even if i netted win I
think<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> terrible<00:01:41.790> price<00:01:42.150> yeah<00:01:42.720> yeah

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
think it's a terrible price yeah yeah

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.749 
think it's a terrible price yeah yeah
well<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> three-way<00:01:43.860> line<00:01:44.040> has<00:01:44.220> my<00:01:44.340> United

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
well the three-way line has my United

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.620 
well the three-way line has my United
price<00:01:44.939> 1.5<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.960> draw<00:01:46.610> 4.75<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.909> press<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
price 1.5 the draw 4.75 and press and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
price 1.5 the draw 4.75 and press and
eight<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> value<00:01:49.470> has<00:01:49.770> gone<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.250> win

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
eight so the value has gone for the win

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
eight so the value has gone for the win
but<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> question<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.810> whether<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.079> would

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
but the question is is whether you would

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.260 
but the question is is whether you would
use<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.799> man<00:01:52.950> united<00:01:53.399> win<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> then

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
use the man united win and then

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
use the man united win and then
obviously<00:01:54.450> combine<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.740> something

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
obviously combine that with something

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
obviously combine that with something
like<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> total<00:01:57.119> goals<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.570> both<00:01:58.020> teams<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
like the total goals or both teams to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260 
like the total goals or both teams to
score<00:01:58.729> obviously<00:01:59.729> you've<00:01:59.820> got<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.119> sure

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
score obviously you've got to be sure

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.580 
score obviously you've got to be sure
that<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.479> United<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> win<00:02:01.409> this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that one United are going to win this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.080 
that one United are going to win this
would<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.189> do<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.310> combination<00:02:02.820> bet<00:02:02.969> for

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
would you do the combination bet for

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.780 
would you do the combination bet for
this<00:02:03.180> map<00:02:03.829> not<00:02:04.829> with<00:02:04.950> Manchester<00:02:05.340> United<00:02:05.369> now

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
this map not with Manchester United now

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.980 
this map not with Manchester United now
I<00:02:05.820> think<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.329> avoid<00:02:06.630> them<00:02:06.899> all

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
I think I have to avoid them all

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.330 
I think I have to avoid them all
together<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.439> mean<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.799> know<00:02:07.890> I'm<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.160> don't

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
together I mean you know I'm just don't

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.499 
together I mean you know I'm just don't

mid-february you know there's just away
from<00:02:20.530> home<00:02:20.770> they<00:02:21.310> seem<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.640> find<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.000> very

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
from home they seem to find it very

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.720 
from home they seem to find it very
difficult<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.870> create<00:02:23.110> chances<00:02:23.550> now<00:02:24.550> look

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
difficult to create chances now look

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.640 
difficult to create chances now look
interesting<00:02:25.599> i<00:02:25.690> could<00:02:26.020> go<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.349> pressed

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
interesting i could go and be pressed

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.260 
interesting i could go and be pressed
and<00:02:26.739> three<00:02:26.980> nil<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.400> look<00:02:27.550> stupid<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.120> you

fantastic<00:02:30.220> I'd<00:02:30.700> rather<00:02:31.000> look<00:02:31.239> at<00:02:31.360> Preston<00:02:31.840> I'd

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
fantastic I'd rather look at Preston I'd

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.840 
fantastic I'd rather look at Preston I'd
rather<00:02:32.500> look<00:02:32.709> at<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.950> way<00:02:33.069> how<00:02:33.340> hard<00:02:33.640> they<00:02:33.819> are

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
rather look at the way how hard they are

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.790 
rather look at the way how hard they are
to<00:02:33.970> break<00:02:34.300> down<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.780> think<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.260> could<00:02:35.410> see<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> low

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
to break down I think we could see a low

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.699 
to break down I think we could see a low
on<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.040> goals<00:02:36.250> game<00:02:36.730> here<00:02:37.030> even<00:02:37.510> under<00:02:37.780> 1.5<00:02:37.989> it

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
on the goals game here even under 1.5 it

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.740 
on the goals game here even under 1.5 it
could<00:02:38.830> be<00:02:38.920> nil<00:02:39.190> nil<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> long<00:02:39.940> time<00:02:40.269> before

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
could be nil nil for a long time before

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.780 
could be nil nil for a long time before
one<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.319> two<00:02:41.500> teams<00:02:41.769> breaks<00:02:42.190> through<00:02:42.550> and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
one of the two teams breaks through and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.820 
one of the two teams breaks through and
if<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.540> was<00:02:43.630> betting<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.050> outright<00:02:44.349> side<00:02:44.650> go

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
if I was betting on the outright side go

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.199 
if I was betting on the outright side go
for<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.040> draw<00:02:45.280> that's<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.760> only<00:02:45.970> bet<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.120> could

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
for the draw that's the only bet I could

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.479 
for the draw that's the only bet I could
have<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.870> impression<00:02:47.050> of<00:02:47.290> quite<00:02:47.590> got<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:47.890> to

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
have the impression of quite got it to

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.759 
have the impression of quite got it to
beat<00:02:48.670> manchester<00:02:49.209> united<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:49.780> but<00:02:50.560> i've<00:02:50.650> been

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
beat manchester united and but i've been

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.590 
beat manchester united and but i've been
looking<00:02:50.830> at<00:02:51.069> handicaps<00:02:51.459> that's<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.330> actually

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
looking at handicaps that's the actually

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.259 
looking at handicaps that's the actually
in<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.739> Preston<00:02:53.739> plus<00:02:54.010> two<00:02:54.400> goals<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:55.209> the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
in that Preston plus two goals on the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.880 
in that Preston plus two goals on the
handicap<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.049> get<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.319> Manchester<00:02:56.860> United

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
handicap so you get a Manchester United

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.789 
handicap so you get a Manchester United
win<00:02:57.370> by<00:02:57.549> one<00:02:57.819> goal<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.330> draw<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.200> Preston<00:02:59.620> win

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
win by one goal a draw and a Preston win

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.640 
win by one goal a draw and a Preston win
on<00:02:59.920> your<00:03:00.040> side<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> nice<00:03:02.019> price<00:03:02.410> you're

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
on your side is it's a nice price you're

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.460 
on your side is it's a nice price you're
looking<00:03:02.860> at<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.130> price<00:03:03.519> of<00:03:03.549> around<00:03:03.790> 1.6<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.080> just

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
looking at a price of around 1.6 to just

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.320

mean<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.690> just<00:03:13.870> too<00:03:14.080> short<00:03:14.319> you're<00:03:14.500> getting

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650

three<00:03:14.860> results<00:03:15.220> they're<00:03:15.400> no<00:03:15.910> good<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.120> be<00:03:16.239> a

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
three results they're no good to be a

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.670 
three results they're no good to be a
lot<00:03:16.360> in<00:03:16.480> this<00:03:16.600> thing<00:03:16.780> could<00:03:16.900> be<00:03:16.989> tight<00:03:17.230> even<00:03:17.590> if

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680

my<00:03:17.799> new<00:03:17.980> win<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.220> think<00:03:18.459> they'll<00:03:18.549> win<00:03:18.670> by<00:03:18.820> 10<00:03:19.269> so

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
think if you could imagine that it's the
