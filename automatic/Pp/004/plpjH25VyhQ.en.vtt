00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
especially this look it is so easy for

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.860 
especially this look it is so easy for
every<00:00:49.320> day<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.710> super<00:00:49.980> convenient<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.870> you

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
every day it's super convenient and you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.000 
every day it's super convenient and you
know<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> don't<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.590> straighten

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
know I don't really have to straighten

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.650 
know I don't really have to straighten
it<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.370> often<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.910> usually<00:00:54.329> straighten

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
it that often and I usually straighten

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.220 
it that often and I usually straighten
my<00:00:54.719> hair<00:00:54.800> maybe<00:00:55.800> once<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.250> week<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.850> this

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
my hair maybe once a week but this

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.330 
my hair maybe once a week but this
hairstyle<00:00:58.230> has<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.829> made<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.280> much

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
hairstyle has just made it so much

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.639 
hairstyle has just made it so much
easier<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
easier and I really really like it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740 
easier and I really really like it
because<00:01:01.890> before<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.670> could<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.120> necessarily

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
because before I could not necessarily

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
because before I could not necessarily
get<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> shower<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.369> be

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
get out of the shower and then like be

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.520 
get out of the shower and then like be
ready<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> go<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:06.990> hair<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
ready to go out with my hair because it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.780 
ready to go out with my hair because it
would<00:01:07.650> always<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.100> frizzy<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.610> just

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
would always get really frizzy and just

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
would always get really frizzy and just
look<00:01:08.909> bad<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:10.290> kind<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.770> know

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
look bad but now I can kind of you know

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920 
look bad but now I can kind of you know
do<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.640> scrunching<00:01:12.390> thing<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.080 
do this little like scrunching thing and
it's<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.290> necessarily<00:01:14.159> wavy<00:01:14.670> hair<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's not necessarily wavy hair I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.570 
it's not necessarily wavy hair I
wouldn't<00:01:15.540> say<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> has<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.979> tasseled

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
wouldn't say but it has that tasseled

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.969 
wouldn't say but it has that tasseled
kind<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.479> textured<00:01:18.960> look<00:01:19.140> which<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.710> it's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
kind of textured look which I like it's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.649 
kind of textured look which I like it's
really<00:01:20.159> cute<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.820> pull<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.060> back<00:01:21.360> or

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
anything like that and so that's kind of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
anything like that and so that's kind of
what<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.659> every<00:01:25.470> day<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> most<00:01:26.130> part

but<00:05:00.950> it<00:05:01.040> does<00:05:01.160> give<00:05:01.340> me<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.550> little<00:05:01.820> bit<00:05:01.910> of<00:05:02.000> hold

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
but it does give me a little bit of hold

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.810 
but it does give me a little bit of hold
on<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:03.260> weights<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:04.310> that's<00:05:04.430> pretty<00:05:04.580> much<00:05:04.670> the

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
on the weights so that's pretty much the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.940 
on the weights so that's pretty much the
technique<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.540> used<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:06.020> get<00:05:06.230> like<00:05:06.410> the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
technique I used to get like the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.830 
technique I used to get like the
waviness<00:05:07.370> into<00:05:07.790> my<00:05:07.910> hair<00:05:08.150> without<00:05:08.330> using<00:05:08.480> any

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
waviness into my hair without using any

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.020 
waviness into my hair without using any
heat<00:05:09.110> so<00:05:09.770> I'm<00:05:09.950> gonna<00:05:10.040> let<00:05:10.220> this<00:05:10.370> dry<00:05:10.640> and<00:05:10.670> come

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
heat so I'm gonna let this dry and come

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.150 
heat so I'm gonna let this dry and come
back<00:05:11.210> in<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.420> little<00:05:11.570> bit<00:05:11.810> bye<00:05:12.140> okay<00:05:12.800> once<00:05:13.040> it's

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
back in a little bit bye okay once it's

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.190 
back in a little bit bye okay once it's
dry<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.850> pretty<00:05:14.090> much<00:05:14.270> turns<00:05:14.540> out<00:05:14.750> like<00:05:14.900> this

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
dry it pretty much turns out like this

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.770 
dry it pretty much turns out like this
and<00:05:15.680> it's<00:05:16.310> not<00:05:16.370> necessarily<00:05:16.970> wavy<00:05:17.510> like<00:05:17.750> I

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
and it's not necessarily wavy like I

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.380 
and it's not necessarily wavy like I
said<00:05:18.110> it's<00:05:18.320> just<00:05:18.410> more<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:19.130> you<00:05:20.120> know<00:05:20.210> that

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
said it's just more of you know that

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.570 
said it's just more of you know that
tousled<00:05:21.050> kind<00:05:21.290> of<00:05:21.380> textured<00:05:21.919> look<00:05:22.130> and<00:05:22.430> I

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
tousled kind of textured look and I

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.580 
tousled kind of textured look and I
really<00:05:22.790> like<00:05:22.970> it<00:05:23.150> now<00:05:23.510> one<00:05:23.780> thing<00:05:23.990> I<00:05:24.140> would<00:05:24.380> do

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
really like it now one thing I would do

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.980 
really like it now one thing I would do
if<00:05:24.950> my<00:05:25.610> hair<00:05:26.120> was<00:05:26.300> getting<00:05:26.419> a<00:05:26.570> little<00:05:26.630> frizzy

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
if my hair was getting a little frizzy

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.360 
if my hair was getting a little frizzy
which<00:05:27.110> it<00:05:27.230> actually<00:05:27.590> is<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.740> little<00:05:27.919> bit<00:05:28.070> today

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
which it actually is a little bit today

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.550 
which it actually is a little bit today
I<00:05:28.640> would<00:05:29.330> take<00:05:29.480> my<00:05:29.630> John<00:05:29.870> Frieda<00:05:30.169> Frizz<00:05:30.260> Ease

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
I would take my John Frieda Frizz Ease

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.840 
I would take my John Frieda Frizz Ease
and<00:05:30.890> I<00:05:30.919> know<00:05:31.040> you're<00:05:31.190> supposed<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.490> use<00:05:31.669> this

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
and I know you're supposed to use this

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.240 
and I know you're supposed to use this
on<00:05:32.150> wet<00:05:32.780> hair<00:05:32.810> but<00:05:33.320> I<00:05:33.500> like<00:05:33.770> to<00:05:33.860> use<00:05:33.950> it<00:05:34.040> on<00:05:34.100> dry

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
on wet hair but I like to use it on dry

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.530 
on wet hair but I like to use it on dry
yeah<00:05:34.430> because<00:05:34.700> I<00:05:34.760> think<00:05:34.820> it<00:05:34.970> works<00:05:35.150> out<00:05:35.330> better

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
yeah because I think it works out better

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.390 
yeah because I think it works out better
but<00:05:36.260> I'm<00:05:36.410> just<00:05:36.500> gonna<00:05:36.680> take<00:05:36.890> a<00:05:36.919> little<00:05:37.100> bit<00:05:37.280> on

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
but I'm just gonna take a little bit on

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.880 
but I'm just gonna take a little bit on
my<00:05:37.550> hands<00:05:38.060> rub<00:05:38.419> it<00:05:38.540> in<00:05:38.660> and<00:05:39.229> what<00:05:39.410> I'm<00:05:39.500> gonna<00:05:39.620> do

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
my hands rub it in and what I'm gonna do

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.650 
my hands rub it in and what I'm gonna do
is<00:05:40.130> just<00:05:40.490> scrunch<00:05:40.790> a<00:05:41.000> little<00:05:41.210> bit<00:05:41.330> with<00:05:41.450> this

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
is just scrunch a little bit with this

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.780

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
and obviously my hair is dry so it's not

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.580 
and obviously my hair is dry so it's not
gonna<00:05:43.910> do<00:05:44.150> much<00:05:44.300> scrunching<00:05:44.810> but<00:05:45.050> I<00:05:45.260> don't

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
gonna do much scrunching but I don't

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.750 
gonna do much scrunching but I don't
want<00:05:45.740> to<00:05:45.800> get<00:05:45.890> rid<00:05:46.130> of<00:05:46.160> all<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.430> texture

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
want to get rid of all the texture

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.130 
want to get rid of all the texture
that's<00:05:46.910> already<00:05:47.060> in<00:05:47.180> my<00:05:47.270> hair<00:05:47.450> and<00:05:47.600> then<00:05:47.810> just

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
that's already in my hair and then just

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.200 
that's already in my hair and then just
flatten<00:05:48.440> around<00:05:49.010> the<00:05:49.070> top<00:05:49.250> of<00:05:49.280> my<00:05:49.490> head<00:05:49.669> where

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
flatten around the top of my head where

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.420 
flatten around the top of my head where
the<00:05:50.240> frizz<00:05:50.600> would<00:05:50.810> be<00:05:51.050> that's<00:05:51.800> pretty<00:05:52.130> much<00:05:52.250> it

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430
