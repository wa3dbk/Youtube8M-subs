like<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.650> said<00:01:31.860> earlier<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> great

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
like I said earlier with a great

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.210 
like I said earlier with a great
reflector<00:01:33.360> system<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.259> allows<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.770> maximum

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
reflector system that allows for maximum

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.980 
reflector system that allows for maximum
output<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.240> about<00:01:37.220> 220<00:01:38.220> lumens<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.240> made

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
output which is about 220 lumens is made

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.850 
output which is about 220 lumens is made
of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> creek<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.400> fallible<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
of the creek you fallible and the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.789 
of the creek you fallible and the
distance<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.189> 100<00:01:45.149> meters<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.350> runtime

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
distance is about 100 meters the runtime

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
distance is about 100 meters the runtime
is<00:01:47.070> two<00:01:47.280> hours<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.210> said<00:01:48.420> earlier<00:01:48.780> it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
is two hours but like I said earlier it

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.380 
is two hours but like I said earlier it
is<00:01:49.079> rechargeable<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.850> does<00:01:51.090> come<00:01:51.360> with

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
is rechargeable and it does come with

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
is rechargeable and it does come with
the<00:01:51.689> battery<00:01:53.450> it's<00:01:54.530> black<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.520> said

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the battery it's black and like I said

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
the battery it's black and like I said
the<00:01:56.790> weight<00:01:56.939> earlier<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.689> 1.8<00:01:58.409> pounds

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the weight earlier it's about 1.8 pounds

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
the weight earlier it's about 1.8 pounds
which<00:01:59.070> isn't<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.520> heavy<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.090> pretty<00:02:00.299> light

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
which isn't that heavy it's pretty light

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.490 
which isn't that heavy it's pretty light
you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.219> also<00:02:02.369> buy<00:02:02.610> replacement<00:02:03.210> parts<00:02:03.600> like
