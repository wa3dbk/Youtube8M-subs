00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.940
 hello and nice that you again 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.820
 turned on his other 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:18.669
 small unboxing of mobile review sdi 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:21.550
 before you the g2 lg g2 the successes the lg 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:24.220
 optimus in all its splendor very much 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.259
 very thick packaging in white 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.429
 with eco sign and had to defend 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.619
 you obviously with tesa film 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.150
 ensure that the thing is not the same 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.890
 independently what I open at the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.079
 ask nevertheless simply times will meet 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.020
 Of course, the device comes first 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.090
 himself the lg g2 in his 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 There are all kinds of splendor in black and white 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.920
 I'll show you later later 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.660
 test if I open the box now 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.149
 a lot of things are coming to light 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.890
 wrapped in foil short instructions the 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.109
 But you do not have to read it 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.969
 the very very good quad beat two 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.039
 but they are almost the same, so to speak 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.219
 Buy values have a moderate what 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.289
 now in following model also loading 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.379
 Data cable available and of course 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.320
 the right charger and very important 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.180
 the so-called pommes pixar around the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.790
 opening the shaft for the memory card 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.310
 not marked here with 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.600
 lg for the space was not available 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.970
 actually only the nora is missing 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.520
 chain trailer then we are complete 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.350
 the uncle has rolled up again and you 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.140
 I do not need a battery at all 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.220
 because this is directly fixed 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.170
 device installed 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.420
 of course we will say solemnly 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.530
 remove the beautiful foil here 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.149
 which actually also no meaningful 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.250
 makes us to point out that 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.840
 we have great technical details the device 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.189
 everyone has tried this one now 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.390
 to find the right point she has 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.880
 By the way, no nipple where you turn 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.729
 So nothing can be done just once 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.590
 Attract back, of course, too 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.610
 I'll do that too 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.530
 nice to retrieve 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.570
 and then we have a slide upstairs 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.950
 on the camera around it all 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.490
 schÃ¼tz I also remove it so that we 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.960
 no fake pictures then gets 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.270
 the lg g just times in 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.509
 size comparison with the current hammer 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.520
 namely the samsung galaxy note 3 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.239
 and direct competition when you do it 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.950
 so samsung wants to say galaxy s 4 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.840
 being with a slower one 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.810
 processor but thanks to the new 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.640
 this is going to happen soon 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.190
 to change 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.090
 in terms of numbers, this means 139 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.879
 millimeter in length about 71 mm in 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.709
 the width and just under 8.9 millimeters 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.319
 thinner with it is a tick thicker 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.200
 at least on paper as the samsung 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.049
 galaxy s 4 or the samsung galaxy note 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.150
 3 weighs only 140 grams 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.849
 Plastic is black in the colors 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.670
 and knows and available with one 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.190
 seamless operated thanks to apple the new 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.930
 standard on the back we have 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.819
 meanwhile a key too 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.099
 at the same time as quietly the gate and 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.959
 to unlock the screen 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.010
 lets or transforms is also this 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.060
 I'm watching with a protective film 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.980
 Provided 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.810
 I have the foil for optical reasons 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.640
 removed we see now here the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.860
 On and off switch we see now 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.230
 here loudly quietly button there we have the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.030
 Camera 3 10 megapixels solves them too 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.340
 Of course, she makes full-HD videos as 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.650
 The led is almost complete these days 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.819
 standard what we can see here 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.470
 by designer is a high gloss 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.000
 the surface naturally the fingers 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.250
 magically attracts and we see too 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.880
 no buttons on the display edge neither 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.060
 left still have to the right up and down 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.290
 we only speaker the 35 mm jackpot 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.359
 and of course the connection charge 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.590
 data cable here the ugly sticker 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.810
 printed on it will become 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.370
 probably in the course of time I think in 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.769
 well dissolve 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.090
 The back itself is slightly bent 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.209
 by the way, inside, too, comes in 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.609
 snapdragon 800 for use with company 2 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.410
 26 gigahertz two gigabyte ram so 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.139
 a little less than the galaxy note 3 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.030
 despite all this, one of the fastest 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.280
 processors 16 gigabytes internal 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.680
 memory and no extension per 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.569
 micro sd card there is nothing with 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.889
 you have to expand the memory 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.510
 You can only accept that in Korea 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:06.400
 expand there's the model namely 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.750
 Fortunately, with micro sd as pr 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.230
 plus with lte will be supported 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.000
 wlan supports the usual frequencies 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.410
 The mill delivers 3000 milliamps 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.169
 built-in battery the display has one 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.349
 diagonal of 52 inches and resolves naturally 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.539
 with full HD with 1080 x 1920 pixels 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.640
 on getting used to the first 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.180
 back side you see the display is 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.740
 completely almost the edge 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.270
 I would say that you can properly 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.830
 pushing to the edge that one here 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.389
 Of course, no push buttons to install 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.039
 could then be clear 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.720
 At the start I can choose now 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.100
 How would like to have a step backwards 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.050
 left or right I would have it 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.970
 I can not decide 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.400
 I think I take the samsung from 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.770
 market purchase next and can now here to 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.770
 example, set up my network and co 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.810
 the whole procedures installation 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.240
 Madness, I'm finally in the user 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.850
 interface from lg some like it some 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.900
 find it ugly to switch off 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.580
 the back he is natural 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.650
 I would like to say sorry because of myself 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.849
 Every time you have to go to the appropriate 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.030
 back what am I doing now 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.530
 I want to activate my device I do 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.169
 klick klack hello someone at home yes 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.300
 probably the device responds immediately thanks to the 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.009
 I can do so called knock on technique 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.320
 The device also activate without me 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.919
 pick it up and on the back 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.990
 press appropriate button if I 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.729
 the volume control when switched off 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.770
 display pressed up a little longer 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.419
 then stop the device and it also 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.310
 offers me the so-called quick memo 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.720
 Function on where I am here for example 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.099
 It is possible to quickly make a note 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.870
 practically when the device is switched off 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.320
 is so I can just as 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.849
 use a sales slip or similar 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.520
 Look again before I go again 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.500
 put the salt on the table for 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.510
 have been unboxing and hands-on 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.570
 more as always in my test report 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.340
 on my website mobile - DE or here 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.229
 click in my youtube channel 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.180
 just lower left for one but if 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.710
 I liked the video, I am glad 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.470
 me of course, every thumbs up 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.470
 and until then I say as always
