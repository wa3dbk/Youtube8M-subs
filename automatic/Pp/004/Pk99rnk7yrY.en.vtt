mean me anyways you can see the shadow

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.619 
mean me anyways you can see the shadow
um<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.550> necessarily<00:00:44.789> shadow<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
um not necessarily shadow but the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.549 
um not necessarily shadow but the
reflection<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.219> nikon<00:00:47.969> d50<00:00:48.930> 100<00:00:49.410> which

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
reflection of the nikon d50 100 which

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
reflection of the nikon d50 100 which
i'm<00:00:49.710> using<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> middle<00:00:51.149> towards<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> end

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
i'm using in the middle towards the end

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.080 
i'm using in the middle towards the end
of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.960> video<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.530> switch<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.250> switch

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
of the video i do switch it up switch

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.479 
of the video i do switch it up switch
positions<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> fair

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
positions so you can kind of get a fair

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.060 
positions so you can kind of get a fair
comparison<00:00:56.910> i'm<00:00:57.570> no<00:00:57.930> expert<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.649> doing<00:00:58.949> these

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
comparison i'm no expert at doing these

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.580 
comparison i'm no expert at doing these
videos<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.050> i<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.379> i<00:01:01.559> have
