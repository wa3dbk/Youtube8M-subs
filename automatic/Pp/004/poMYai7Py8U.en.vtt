drew<00:00:17.169> a<00:00:17.200> spot<00:00:17.500> new<00:00:17.740> memory<00:00:18.040> but<00:00:18.160> when<00:00:18.250> I<00:00:18.279> put<00:00:18.460> it

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
drew a spot new memory but when I put it

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.339 
drew a spot new memory but when I put it
in<00:00:18.580> my<00:00:18.640> computer<00:00:18.820> it<00:00:19.210> doesn't<00:00:19.390> show<00:00:19.660> up<00:00:19.779> at<00:00:19.990> the

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
in my computer it doesn't show up at the

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.859 
in my computer it doesn't show up at the
right<00:00:20.529> speed<00:00:21.099> well<00:00:21.789> there's<00:00:22.300> a<00:00:22.390> reason<00:00:22.599> for

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
right speed well there's a reason for

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.540 
right speed well there's a reason for
that<00:00:22.989> most<00:00:23.529> of<00:00:23.649> the<00:00:23.710> time<00:00:23.890> your<00:00:24.099> computer<00:00:24.520> just

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
that most of the time your computer just

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.909 
that most of the time your computer just
defaults<00:00:25.419> at<00:00:25.570> whatever<00:00:25.840> its<00:00:26.050> standard<00:00:26.529> memory

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
defaults at whatever its standard memory

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.740 
defaults at whatever its standard memory
clock<00:00:27.160> speed<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.489> so<00:00:28.059> if<00:00:28.180> you<00:00:28.270> see<00:00:28.450> the<00:00:28.540> board

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
clock speed is so if you see the board

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.479 
clock speed is so if you see the board
and<00:00:28.930> says<00:00:29.020> 1300<00:00:29.919> and<00:00:30.070> that's<00:00:30.189> what<00:00:30.309> it's<00:00:30.430> gonna

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
and says 1300 and that's what it's gonna

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.729 
and says 1300 and that's what it's gonna
be<00:00:30.759> at<00:00:30.910> when<00:00:31.119> you<00:00:31.239> boot<00:00:31.540> it<00:00:31.719> up<00:00:31.930> now<00:00:32.410> with<00:00:32.469> that

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
be at when you boot it up now with that

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.470 
be at when you boot it up now with that
said<00:00:33.010> though<00:00:33.190> there<00:00:33.399> is<00:00:33.579> a<00:00:33.610> way<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.090> engage

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
said though there is a way to engage

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.670 
said though there is a way to engage
your<00:00:34.690> memory<00:00:35.079> and<00:00:35.170> make<00:00:35.320> sure<00:00:35.469> you're<00:00:35.620> getting

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
your memory and make sure you're getting

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.950 
your memory and make sure you're getting
the<00:00:35.829> maximum<00:00:36.430> performance<00:00:36.640> out<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.540> it<00:00:37.660> now

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
the maximum performance out of it now

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.110 
the maximum performance out of it now

to<00:00:58.239> put<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.570> memory<00:00:58.780> onto<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.470> board<00:00:59.710> and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
to put the memory onto the board and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.530 
to put the memory onto the board and
then<00:01:00.310> we're<00:01:00.399> gonna<00:01:00.520> jump<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.030> BIOS<00:01:01.270> and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
then we're gonna jump in the BIOS and

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.790 
then we're gonna jump in the BIOS and
I'll<00:01:01.600> show<00:01:01.810> you<00:01:01.840> how<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.140> make<00:01:02.350> sure<00:01:02.470> that<00:01:02.590> your

I'll show you how to make sure that your

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.259 
I'll show you how to make sure that your
memory<00:01:03.040> is<00:01:03.100> running<00:01:03.370> at<00:01:03.460> all<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.910> correct

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
memory is running at all the correct

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.719 
memory is running at all the correct
speeds<00:01:04.629> so<00:01:05.259> with<00:01:05.409> that<00:01:05.530> said<00:01:05.829> let's<00:01:06.369> jump<00:01:06.490> over

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
speeds so with that said let's jump over

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.580 
speeds so with that said let's jump over
now<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.090> let's<00:01:07.509> first<00:01:07.750> install<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.290> memory

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
now and let's first install the memory

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.709 
now and let's first install the memory
onto<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.220> motherboard<00:01:09.369> alright<00:01:10.299> folks<00:01:10.509> so

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
onto the motherboard alright folks so

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.300 
onto the motherboard alright folks so
here<00:01:10.960> we<00:01:11.049> can<00:01:11.170> see<00:01:11.380> we<00:01:11.530> have<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.770> z77

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
here we can see we have the z77

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.770 
here we can see we have the z77
motherboard<00:01:12.880> on<00:01:12.969> the<00:01:13.090> test<00:01:13.299> station

motherboard on the test station

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.359 
motherboard on the test station
I'm<00:01:13.869> gonna<00:01:13.990> go<00:01:14.200> install<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.829> first<00:01:15.009> set<00:01:15.280> of

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
I'm gonna go install the first set of

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.279 
I'm gonna go install the first set of
memory<00:01:15.639> sticks<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.420> can<00:01:16.569> see<00:01:16.719> that<00:01:16.869> back<00:01:16.990> here

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
memory sticks you can see that back here

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.200 
memory sticks you can see that back here
this<00:01:17.499> is<00:01:17.679> locked<00:01:18.039> this<00:01:18.460> doesn't<00:01:18.819> move<00:01:18.909> at<00:01:19.090> all

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
this is locked this doesn't move at all

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.609 
this is locked this doesn't move at all
so<00:01:19.689> you're<00:01:19.780> gonna<00:01:19.899> want<00:01:20.139> to<00:01:20.200> make<00:01:20.319> sure<00:01:20.350> that

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
so you're gonna want to make sure that

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.319 
so you're gonna want to make sure that
you<00:01:20.799> have<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:21.009> little<00:01:21.219> notch<00:01:21.460> in<00:01:21.729> here<00:01:21.969> that

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
you have a little notch in here that

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.849 
you have a little notch in here that
matches<00:01:22.569> up<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.990> notch<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.469> the

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
matches up to the notch in the

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.099 
matches up to the notch in the

gonna do this four times until I get all
four<00:01:36.100> sticks<00:01:36.429> in<00:01:36.639> the<00:01:36.969> slots<00:01:37.209> so<00:01:37.929> just<00:01:38.859> keep

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
four sticks in the slots so just keep

four sticks in the slots so just keep
doing<00:01:39.310> this<00:01:39.429> one<00:01:39.639> at<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.819> time<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.990> kind<00:01:41.289> of<00:01:41.319> at

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
doing this one at a time I'm kind of at

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.599 
doing this one at a time I'm kind of at
a<00:01:41.469> weird<00:01:41.679> angle<00:01:41.889> when<00:01:42.130> I'm<00:01:42.219> doing<00:01:42.399> this<00:01:42.490> I

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
a weird angle when I'm doing this I

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.069 
a weird angle when I'm doing this I
should<00:01:42.789> rip<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:42.999> stood<00:01:43.270> up<00:01:43.389> for<00:01:43.509> this<00:01:43.569> video<00:01:43.840> but

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
should rip I stood up for this video but

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.700 
should rip I stood up for this video but
here's<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.920> here's<00:01:45.069> a<00:01:45.189> third<00:01:45.399> slot<00:01:45.670> here

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.919 

and<00:01:49.710> last<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.759> least<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.750> four

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
stick we have all four sticks of memory

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.260 
stick we have all four sticks of memory
in<00:01:58.500> place<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.850> go<00:01:59.969> ahead<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
now I'm gonna go ahead and set the test

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.130 
now I'm gonna go ahead and set the test
station<00:02:08.729> back<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.239> where<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.450> goes<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.959> we're

folks so now I'm gonna go ahead and
start<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.660> system<00:02:16.019> up<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.379> when<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.340> start

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
start the system up and when you start

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.860 
start the system up and when you start
the<00:02:17.670> system<00:02:17.940> up<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.299> very<00:02:18.450> first<00:02:18.720> thing

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870

Asus<00:02:33.569> works<00:02:34.110> very<00:02:34.379> very<00:02:34.500> well<00:02:34.799> works<00:02:35.549> with

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
Asus works very very well works with

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.309 
Asus works very very well works with
very<00:02:36.090> many<00:02:36.329> different<00:02:36.450> mice<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.019> tried<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> bunch

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
very many different mice I tried a bunch

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.319 
very many different mice I tried a bunch
of<00:02:37.620> different<00:02:37.920> ones<00:02:38.010> working<00:02:38.819> really<00:02:39.150> good

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
of different ones working really good

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.880 
of different ones working really good
now<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:39.989> see<00:02:40.110> when<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.290> first<00:02:40.470> come<00:02:40.739> in

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
now you can see when you first come in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.910 
now you can see when you first come in
here<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.819> target<00:02:42.060> DRAM<00:02:42.569> speed<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.170> 13

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
here it is the target DRAM speed of 13

here it is the target DRAM speed of 13
33<00:02:44.610> megahertz<00:02:44.849> now<00:02:45.390> that's<00:02:45.989> not<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.290> 1866

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
33 megahertz now that's not the 1866

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.100 
33 megahertz now that's not the 1866
that<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.700> memory<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.239> geared<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:48.989> many

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
that this memory was geared for so many

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.809 
that this memory was geared for so many
people<00:02:49.379> just<00:02:49.799> go<00:02:50.280> ahead<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.549> start<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
people just go ahead and start the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.520 
people just go ahead and start the
computer<00:02:51.209> up<00:02:51.329> leave<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.019> there<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.350> don't

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
computer up leave it in there and don't

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.349 
computer up leave it in there and don't
do<00:02:52.680> anything<00:02:52.889> so<00:02:53.790> we're<00:02:53.880> gonna<00:02:54.000> go<00:02:54.150> down<00:02:54.299> here

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
do anything so we're gonna go down here

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.849 
do anything so we're gonna go down here
through<00:02:54.930> different<00:02:55.230> stuff<00:02:57.139> don't<00:02:58.139> do<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
through different stuff don't do this a

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.800 
through different stuff don't do this a
lot<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.250> people<00:02:59.370> just<00:02:59.730> go<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.480> they

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
lot of people just go in here and they

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.559 
lot of people just go in here and they
change<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.290> memory<00:03:01.470> frequency<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.329> high

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
change the memory frequency to a high

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.990 
change the memory frequency to a high
rate<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.739> can<00:03:04.980> sometimes<00:03:05.310> result<00:03:05.609> in<00:03:05.760> your

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000

we'll watch the system reboot and you'll

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.759 
we'll watch the system reboot and you'll
see<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.690> system<00:03:48.810> recognizes<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
see that the system recognizes the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.059 
see that the system recognizes the
memory<00:03:50.099> that's<00:03:50.819> correct<00:03:51.269> values<00:03:51.799> it's<00:03:52.799> very

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
memory that's correct values it's very

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.979 
memory that's correct values it's very
easy<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:53.639> but<00:03:53.849> so<00:03:54.090> many<00:03:54.209> people<00:03:54.630> forget<00:03:54.810> to

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
easy to do but so many people forget to

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.830 
easy to do but so many people forget to
do<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.700> ok<00:03:56.700> everybody<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.239> really<00:03:57.599> hope<00:03:57.780> that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
do this ok everybody I really hope that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.899 
do this ok everybody I really hope that
that<00:03:58.170> helps<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.829> very<00:03:59.069> simple<00:03:59.610> thing<00:03:59.879> to

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
that helps it's a very simple thing to

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:00.790 
that helps it's a very simple thing to
do<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:00.239> it's

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
do but it's

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.560 
do but it's
important<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.430> do<00:04:01.610> in<00:04:01.850> many<00:04:02.390> other

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
important to do in many other

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.000 
important to do in many other
motherboards<00:04:03.140> it<00:04:03.260> may<00:04:03.410> look<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.680> little<00:04:03.710> bit

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
motherboards it may look a little bit

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.530 
motherboards it may look a little bit
different<00:04:04.370> but<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:04.580> gonna<00:04:04.700> be<00:04:04.880> also<00:04:05.240> very

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
different but it's gonna be also very

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.910 
different but it's gonna be also very
similar<00:04:05.930> just<00:04:06.140> gonna<00:04:06.320> want<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.620> make<00:04:06.770> sure

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
similar just gonna want to make sure

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.740 
similar just gonna want to make sure
that<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.130> happened<00:04:07.460> the<00:04:07.550> BIOS<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.060> make<00:04:08.540> sure

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
that you happened the BIOS and make sure

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.040 
that you happened the BIOS and make sure
you<00:04:09.110> engage<00:04:09.530> your<00:04:09.860> XMP<00:04:10.490> profile<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.660> extreme

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
you engage your XMP profile the extreme

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.450 
you engage your XMP profile the extreme
memory<00:04:12.230> profile<00:04:12.710> is<00:04:12.890> there<00:04:13.070> for<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.400> reason

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
memory profile is there for a reason

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.210 
memory profile is there for a reason
make<00:04:14.330> sure<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.630> use<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:14.900> now<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:15.950> screen

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
make sure you use it now on the screen

behind me I have a shot of CPU ID where

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.830 
behind me I have a shot of CPU ID where
it<00:04:19.580> actually<00:04:19.730> shows<00:04:20.120> all<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.510> different

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
it actually shows all the different

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.600 
it actually shows all the different
memory<00:04:21.019> timings<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.739> all<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:22.130> things<00:04:22.340> about

memory timings and all the things about
the<00:04:22.790> crucial<00:04:23.180> memory<00:04:23.450> as<00:04:23.540> well<00:04:23.690> here<00:04:24.230> you<00:04:24.350> can

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
the crucial memory as well here you can

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.920 
the crucial memory as well here you can
see<00:04:24.680> all<00:04:24.920> of<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.400> cast<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.910> Rass<00:04:26.180> values<00:04:26.630> you

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
see all of the cast and Rass values you

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.970 
see all of the cast and Rass values you
can<00:04:27.080> see<00:04:27.230> there's<00:04:27.380> also<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.680> bunch<00:04:27.890> of

can see there's also a bunch of

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.350 
can see there's also a bunch of
different<00:04:28.040> settings<00:04:28.580> into<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:28.880> far<00:04:29.120> right

you<00:04:29.660> can<00:04:29.810> see<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.080> one<00:04:30.230> that<00:04:30.380> we're<00:04:30.560> using

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
you can see the one that we're using

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.590 
you can see the one that we're using
which<00:04:31.310> is<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.670> one<00:04:31.820> that's<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.120> next<00:04:32.240> MP
