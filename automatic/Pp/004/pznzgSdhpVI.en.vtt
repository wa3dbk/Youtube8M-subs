00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.380
 Hi everybody, welcome, it's more here. 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.290
 a video and I'll pass it on to you here 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.890
 the second bike of the seventh night which 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.990
 shine 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.760
 so let's go there like that for those who do not 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 is on so it only has 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.700
 the new critters and they are there at level 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.540
 10 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.739
 the fox in it appears only as it is 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.960
 90 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.360
 she's going to be so aggressive so give it 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.829
 to carry you well is much more than 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.070
 half the music box 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:38.489
 Just have a problem let me explain 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.280
 for you despite being at level 10 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.570
 they are fast elison are key to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.969
 here these animals 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.969
 the one that appears in front of you 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.539
 I will not come because the duct is the freight, right? 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.429
 so this is can be a problem if the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.070
 music box ends because if you 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.289
 is every 100 the music box you 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.460
 load it whole by fred perry 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.399
 so you have to be careful with that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.150
 search load to finish there 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.530
 one quarter or less of that to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.540
 America was understood because it is a way 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 easy only if you do not take a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.190
 careful you die right 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.530
 I already lived here, I think a couple of 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.940
 times here because of fred is because I 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.740
 I was loaded with your music a little 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.360
 there he got me, do not take 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.090
 careful about it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.790
 is the other would be the following see here there 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.190
 if the boni even this is not in the duct 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.050
 because everyone I've seen several channels 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.460
 different corners of the world does this see 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.860
 There, I was fine and I ended up going to bed, right? 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.810
 for here it is at level 10 has 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.690
 a certain tolerance, right? 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.720
 you can go back and color 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.610
 mark is an accountant and fred fred's goal se 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.190
 If you had it, you 'd be cool and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.760
 already it then here still the game of 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.080
 slippers and give one is to take a look at 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.790
 camera went wrong but no no no 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.310
 And if you take advantage of this, not only will you 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.140
 die, understand, then look , dance. 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.460
 Otoni moneta ali 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.100
 There you go to bed, beauty. 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.990
 Then another problem is the next face is the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.780
 second question level 10 so I 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.680
 I realized they take so long from at least 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.060
 an excerpt from the duct 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.630
 they take four to six seconds 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.630
 to get out of the ghetto but how is it only? 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.170
 duca is a problem 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.130
 You're never good to want to stay the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.570
 try to watch him in the noise 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.090
 to see if he 's leaving or not because 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.850
 It begins on 20 August and is a noise 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.990
 behind the other and you do not know if he 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.890
 then with 36 seconds versus 6 seconds 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.890
 beyond america 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:01.990
 I think this is it, man has nothing else. 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.990
 otherwise you can take care 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.030
 I do not know, I think you 'll get it. 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.290
 see here but I have a custom fake 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.060
 how to play 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.180
 sapodilla game here spending a lot to 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:26.730
 flashlight but until now it never gave a shit 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.360
 Cinderella horse finishes in the middle of the game 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.360
 always until the very end 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:47.959
 I'd better just look at the left side. 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.959
 12 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:04:02.180
 there will appear the fred who care too 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.180
 which fed the tea too expensive 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.450
 however the left payroll 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.480
 the guy is the last time I played like 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.400
 Rita was a crappy living being talking 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.100
 face appeared again my balloon 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.840
 me here you see that luck right 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.120
 if you show up here on the easter egg dude no 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.110
 I'm going to stop the game, I'm going to the game. 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.970
 because only if it's a very new stranger 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.540
 so nobody saw that I think 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.540
 difficult 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.500
 Look here, fuck 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:23.419
 the guy has a block tomorrow I do not have it 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:25.660
 nothing in lantana 4 or it was delayed to 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.660
 go out now 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.199
 Now the people ask me that. 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.050

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:10.189

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.270

 What do you get for that toy doll? 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.270
 Bonin, I think it's well remembered. 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:45.449
 And look at my face, but yes 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:06.820

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:13.860
