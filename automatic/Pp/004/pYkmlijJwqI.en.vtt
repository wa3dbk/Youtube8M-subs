00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.379
 on May 31, 2009 the airbus a330 of the 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.730
 air france takes off from rio de janeiro with 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.029
 destination to paris 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.540
 it was 17 29 a.m. local time on board 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:24.220
 of flight af447 were 12 crew members 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.050
 being three pilots and 216 passengers 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.660
 three hours and fifteen minutes later 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.269
 crew last communicated with the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.809
 the Brazilian air control they were 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:38.960
 instructed to maintain flight level 350 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.700
 which corresponds to altitude 10,700 meters 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.989
 the flight started crossing the ocean 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.329
 Atlantic 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.579
 twenty minutes later the captain 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.620
 control from the beginning of the flight agreement 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.989
 with the pilot taking his place 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.760
 the three pilots meet and the pilot in the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.559
 command tells others 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.350
 the little turbulence you just saw 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.899
 It is the same as we find in front of the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.579
 Captain leaves the cabin to rest. 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.800
 leaving the two co-pilots in charge 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.930
 shortly after the pilot announces entered 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.180
 a zone of turbulence in two minutes 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.310
 we must enter an area where we are going 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.240
 move us a little more should take 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 caution 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.810
 the plane then makes a 12 degree curve 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.909
 to the left 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.869
 turbulence increases and aircraft 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.610
 slow down 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.009
 a few minutes later the pilot 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.990
 self-propelled 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.900
 probably disabled due to problems 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.750
 in the speed sensors the pilot in the 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.060
 assume the command has the control 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.460
 of the aircraft begins to rotate to the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.860
 right the pilot react pulling 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.470
 up the altitude loss warning 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.409
 Souza twice the speed falls 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.840
 quickly from 500 to 110 kilometers 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.270
 for an hour trying to regain control 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.460
 the rider climbs rapidly reaching a 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.399
 vertical velocity of 2 thousand meters per 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.299
 minute and the altitude of 11 thousand and 400 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.490
 meters 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.470
 trajectory is no longer controlled by 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.420
 two pilots who tried several times 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.610
 call the commander 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.070
 the altitude loss alarm sounds 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.530
 again the engines but the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.610
 maximum the plane reaches its altitude 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.259
 maximum 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.810
 the captain enters the cabin while the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.180
 crashes and turns violently into the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.830
 seconds at speed 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.410
 registered is invalid and the alarm 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.120
 altitude loss for logo restarting 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.700
 while the pilots struggle to 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.020
 control the airplane the alarm sounded until the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.660
 airplane fall into the sea 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.510
 the last two data show a 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.580
 fall of 3,300 meters per minute and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.340
 speed of 200 kilometers per hour 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.850
 tragedy lasted three minutes and 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.850
 30 seconds
