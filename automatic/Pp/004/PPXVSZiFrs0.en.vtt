00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
what I like to run it's gonna be fast

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.600 
what I like to run it's gonna be fast
mags<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.480> laser<00:00:31.410> sight<00:00:31.710> laser<00:00:32.099> sights<00:00:32.369> great

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
mags and laser sight laser sights great

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.830 
mags and laser sight laser sights great
for<00:00:32.790> hip<00:00:32.910> firing<00:00:33.180> through<00:00:33.510> corners

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
for hip firing through corners

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930 
for hip firing through corners
especially<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.500> rusher<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.070> fast

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
especially if you are rusher and fast

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.580 
especially if you are rusher and fast
mags<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:36.540> work<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> lot<00:00:36.960> better<00:00:37.170> than<00:00:37.350> say

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
mags I think work a lot better than say

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.650 
mags I think work a lot better than say
extended<00:00:38.160> mags<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.090> hardcore<00:00:39.480> you

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
extended mags because in hardcore you

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.869 
extended mags because in hardcore you
can't<00:00:39.899> take<00:00:40.050> any<00:00:40.230> damage<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.340> need<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> be

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
can't take any damage so you need to be

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
can't take any damage so you need to be
able<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> reload<00:00:42.480> fast<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.590> next

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
able to reload fast and get that next

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
able to reload fast and get that next
engagement<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.489> you're<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> tight<00:00:44.940> spot<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
engagement if you're on a tight spot and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.190 
engagement if you're on a tight spot and
then<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> run<00:00:47.070> hardline<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
then I like to run hardline and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.779 
then I like to run hardline and
lightweight<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.890> take<00:00:50.160> note<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.640> run

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
lightweight and take note I don't run

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.380 
lightweight and take note I don't run
ghost<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.390> most<00:00:51.600> people<00:00:51.930> who<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:53.120> ghost<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
ghost like most people who do ghost I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
ghost like most people who do ghost I
find<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.559> useless<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.010> hardcore

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
find it's kind of useless in hardcore

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.090 
find it's kind of useless in hardcore
because<00:00:56.579> there's<00:00:56.910> no<00:00:57.000> mini-map<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.100> UAV

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
because there's no mini-map and UAV

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740 
because there's no mini-map and UAV
spamming<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.090> much<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> would<00:01:00.690> be

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
spamming is not as much as it would be

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
spamming is not as much as it would be
in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> core<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.100> hard<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> hold<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
in the core because it's hard to hold a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
in the core because it's hard to hold a
kill<00:01:02.969> streak<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.329> hardcore<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
kill streak in hardcore for a lot of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
kill streak in hardcore for a lot of
people<00:01:05.570> then<00:01:06.570> lightweight<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.080> move<00:01:07.290> around

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
people then lightweight you move around

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
people then lightweight you move around
the<00:01:07.500> back<00:01:07.830> faster<00:01:08.310> hardline<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> great

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the back faster hardline is great

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.520 
the back faster hardline is great
especially<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.780> hold<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.049> kill<00:01:10.260> streak

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
especially if you can hold a kill streak

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.990 
especially if you can hold a kill streak
their<00:01:11.189> killer<00:01:11.430> shakes<00:01:11.610> we'll<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.880> keep

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
their killer shakes we'll just keep

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.280 
their killer shakes we'll just keep
cycling<00:01:12.299> through<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.810> getting<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> more

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
kill streaks and then cold blood is

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
kill streaks and then cold blood is
great<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.080> rushing<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.770> spawn

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
great for rushing in and we spawn

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
great for rushing in and we spawn
because<00:01:17.430> there's<00:01:17.729> no<00:01:17.850> name<00:01:18.060> above<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.450> head

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
and getting booted out of the game just

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.710 
and getting booted out of the game just
because<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.930> can't<00:02:41.170> see<00:02:41.440> anything<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:41.799> I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
because you can't see anything so I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.970 
because you can't see anything so I
recommend<00:02:43.720> not<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> run<00:02:44.140> any<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.470> those<00:02:44.590> just

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
recommend not to run any of those just

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.780 
recommend not to run any of those just
rely<00:02:45.549> on<00:02:45.579> your<00:02:45.700> gun<00:02:45.970> skill<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.480> perks

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
rely on your gun skill and perks

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.920 
rely on your gun skill and perks
that's<00:02:48.790> where<00:02:48.910> I'd<00:02:49.000> recommend<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.569> trying<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
that's where I'd recommend you trying to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.500 
that's where I'd recommend you trying to
practice<00:02:50.530> with<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.739> higher<00:02:50.920> sensitivity

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
practice with a higher sensitivity

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.430 
practice with a higher sensitivity
because<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.599> hardcore<00:02:52.989> if<00:02:53.079> you're<00:02:53.200> getting

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
because in hardcore if you're getting

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.559 
because in hardcore if you're getting
shot<00:02:53.680> from<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> back<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.970> likelihood<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.420> you

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
shot from the back the likelihood of you

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.509 
shot from the back the likelihood of you
bill<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.810> turn<00:02:56.049> around<00:02:56.379> fast<00:02:56.859> enough<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.340> win<00:02:57.489> a

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
bill to turn around fast enough to win a

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.890 
bill to turn around fast enough to win a
gunfight<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.209> have<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.359> low<00:02:58.540> sensitivity

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
gunfight if you have a low sensitivity

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.000 
gunfight if you have a low sensitivity
is<00:02:59.349> not<00:02:59.560> very<00:02:59.859> good<00:03:00.069> so<00:03:01.139> if<00:03:02.139> you<00:03:02.349> try<00:03:02.829> out<00:03:02.859> a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
is not very good so if you try out a

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.009 
is not very good so if you try out a
higher<00:03:03.220> sensitivity<00:03:03.579> go<00:03:04.180> from<00:03:04.359> like<00:03:04.480> level<00:03:04.780> 8

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
higher sensitivity go from like level 8

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.750 
higher sensitivity go from like level 8
and<00:03:05.349> then<00:03:05.440> progressively<00:03:05.769> go<00:03:06.130> up<00:03:06.340> from<00:03:06.519> there

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
and then progressively go up from there

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.089 
and then progressively go up from there
to<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.810> point<00:03:08.079> where<00:03:08.319> your<00:03:08.560> accuracy<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.069> not

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
to the point where your accuracy is not

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.940 
to the point where your accuracy is not
affected<00:03:09.810> then<00:03:10.810> that'll<00:03:11.139> be<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.349> best<00:03:11.500> for

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
affected then that'll be the best for

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.370 
affected then that'll be the best for
you<00:03:12.099> for<00:03:12.459> hardcore<00:03:12.790> gaming<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.510> play<00:03:13.989> on<00:03:14.109> level

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
you for hardcore gaming I play on level

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.860 
you for hardcore gaming I play on level
14<00:03:14.880> that's<00:03:15.880> what<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.120> feel<00:03:16.389> comfortable<00:03:16.419> with

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
14 that's what I feel comfortable with

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.900 
14 that's what I feel comfortable with
but<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.769> would<00:03:17.919> start<00:03:18.190> off<00:03:18.250> at<00:03:18.340> level<00:03:18.519> 8<00:03:18.609> like<00:03:18.790> I

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
but I would start off at level 8 like I

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.410 
but I would start off at level 8 like I
said<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.359> just<00:03:19.450> go<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:19.750> from<00:03:19.900> there
