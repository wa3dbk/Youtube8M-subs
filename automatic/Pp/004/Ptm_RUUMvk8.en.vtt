00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
actually going to go in with that purple

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.090 
actually going to go in with that purple
again<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.450> use<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.840> as<00:03:58.960> a<00:03:59.260> water<00:03:59.500> line<00:03:59.770> just<00:04:00.010> to

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
again and use it as a water line just to

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.780 
again and use it as a water line just to
make<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.520> little<00:04:00.670> more<00:04:00.790> vibrant<00:04:02.400> if<00:04:03.400> you

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.260 
have sensitive eyes don't try this
because<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:06.250> shadow<00:04:06.580> will<00:04:06.760> definitely

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
because the shadow will definitely

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.330 
because the shadow will definitely
irritate<00:04:07.720> your<00:04:07.810> eyes<00:04:07.990> but<00:04:08.530> I'm<00:04:08.710> so<00:04:08.740> used<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.310> it

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
irritate your eyes but I'm so used to it

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.280 
irritate your eyes but I'm so used to it
it's<00:04:09.550> fine<00:04:09.790> for<00:04:10.030> me<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.420> probably<00:04:10.930> most<00:04:11.140> of

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
it's fine for me and probably most of

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.800 
it's fine for me and probably most of
you<00:04:11.350> it'll<00:04:11.650> just<00:04:11.860> be<00:04:11.950> fine<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:15.330> then<00:04:16.330> I<00:04:16.510> like

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
you it'll just be fine and then I like

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.080 
you it'll just be fine and then I like
to<00:04:16.930> use<00:04:17.080> waterproof<00:04:17.500> mascara<00:04:18.400> all<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.850> time

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
to use waterproof mascara all the time

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.450 
to use waterproof mascara all the time
definitely<00:04:20.049> suggest<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.590> if<00:04:20.770> you<00:04:20.920> ever<00:04:20.950> expect

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
definitely suggest it if you ever expect

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.060 
definitely suggest it if you ever expect
yourself<00:04:21.670> to<00:04:21.880> cry<00:04:22.330> or<00:04:22.780> pretty<00:04:23.440> much<00:04:23.560> just<00:04:23.770> wear
