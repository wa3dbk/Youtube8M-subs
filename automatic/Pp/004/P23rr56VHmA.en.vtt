00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
whole foreground about this much into my

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.490 
whole foreground about this much into my
composition<00:00:49.750> you<00:00:50.750> have<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.050> make<00:00:51.230> sure<00:00:51.260> that

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
composition you have to make sure that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.319 
composition you have to make sure that
everything<00:00:52.160> on<00:00:52.250> your<00:00:52.370> canvas<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:52.969> smaller

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
everything on your canvas is smaller

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.299 
everything on your canvas is smaller
than<00:00:53.600> what<00:00:53.719> you<00:00:53.870> see<00:00:54.050> in<00:00:54.140> nature<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:55.129> have<00:00:55.160> to

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
than what you see in nature you have to

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.150 
than what you see in nature you have to
shrink<00:00:55.730> everything<00:00:55.940> down<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:57.500> tendency<00:00:58.100> is

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
shrink everything down the tendency is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.139 
shrink everything down the tendency is
to<00:00:58.430> paint<00:00:58.670> everything<00:00:59.440> too<00:01:00.440> large<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.280> if<00:01:02.030> you

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
to paint everything too large and if you

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.700 
to paint everything too large and if you
want<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:02.420> get<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.690> whole<00:01:02.930> scene<00:01:03.289> into<00:01:03.590> your

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
want to get the whole scene into your

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.500 
want to get the whole scene into your
painting<00:01:04.160> you're<00:01:04.790> gonna<00:01:04.910> have<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.300> start

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
painting you're gonna have to start

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.900 
painting you're gonna have to start
shrinking<00:01:05.840> everything<00:01:06.680> down<00:01:06.920> there's<00:01:07.550> a<00:01:07.640> dead

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
shrinking everything down there's a dead

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.880 
shrinking everything down there's a dead
tree<00:01:08.210> towards<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.750> right<00:01:08.930> on<00:01:09.080> my<00:01:09.200> composition

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
tree towards the right on my composition

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.920 
tree towards the right on my composition
I'm<00:01:10.430> not<00:01:10.759> sure<00:01:11.000> if<00:01:11.150> I'm<00:01:11.299> gonna<00:01:11.450> put<00:01:11.750> all<00:01:11.900> of

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
I'm not sure if I'm gonna put all of

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.539 
I'm not sure if I'm gonna put all of
that<00:01:12.049> in<00:01:12.380> I'm<00:01:12.740> just<00:01:12.979> gonna<00:01:13.130> put<00:01:13.310> in<00:01:13.400> a<00:01:13.520> little

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
that in I'm just gonna put in a little

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.429 
that in I'm just gonna put in a little
footnote<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.450> see<00:01:14.659> how<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.990> works

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
footnote to see how it works

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.289 
footnote to see how it works
now<00:01:16.040> I'm<00:01:16.130> gonna<00:01:16.310> switch<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.850> larger<00:01:17.060> brush

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
now I'm gonna switch to a larger brush

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.870 
now I'm gonna switch to a larger brush
and<00:01:17.869> one<00:01:18.799> of<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:18.979> important<00:01:19.430> things<00:01:19.700> about

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
and one of the important things about

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.120 
and one of the important things about
painting<00:01:20.869> especially<00:01:21.020> early<00:01:21.619> in<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.770> morning

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
painting especially early in the morning

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.859 
painting especially early in the morning
is<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.579> you<00:01:22.880> have<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.210> indicate<00:01:23.450> all<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
is that you have to indicate all the

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.050 
is that you have to indicate all the
shadows<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.530> there's<00:01:24.710> definitely<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.460> direct

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
shadows and there's definitely a direct

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.620 
shadows and there's definitely a direct
line<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.409> Sun<00:01:27.680> creates<00:01:28.070> at<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.369> edge<00:01:28.549> of

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
line that the Sun creates at the edge of

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.609 
line that the Sun creates at the edge of
the<00:01:29.630> canyon<00:01:29.930> in<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.829> distance<00:01:31.299> all<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.869> these

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
the canyon in the distance all of these

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.609 
the canyon in the distance all of these
formations<00:01:34.420> sticking<00:01:35.420> out<00:01:35.600> into<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.170> canyon

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
formations sticking out into the canyon

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.100 
formations sticking out into the canyon
all<00:01:36.829> are<00:01:37.100> casting<00:01:37.610> shadows<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.840> what<00:01:39.020> I'm

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
all are casting shadows so what I'm

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.789 
all are casting shadows so what I'm
doing<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.500> I'm<00:01:39.680> creating<00:01:40.280> all<00:01:41.320> these<00:01:42.320> shadows

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
doing is I'm creating all these shadows

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.190 
doing is I'm creating all these shadows
at<00:01:42.979> exactly<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.790> same<00:01:44.000> angle<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.960> can<00:01:45.079> almost

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
at exactly the same angle you can almost

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.929 
at exactly the same angle you can almost
follow<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.799> shadow<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.340> find<00:01:46.549> out<00:01:46.670> where<00:01:46.820> the

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
follow the shadow and find out where the

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.660 
follow the shadow and find out where the
Sun<00:01:47.149> is<00:01:47.590> I'm<00:01:48.590> gonna<00:01:48.799> take<00:01:49.100> some<00:01:49.340> more<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.610> that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
Sun is I'm gonna take some more of that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.760 
Sun is I'm gonna take some more of that
blue<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.149> I'm<00:01:50.240> gonna<00:01:50.360> very<00:01:50.659> quickly<00:01:50.930> just<00:01:51.049> put

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
blue and I'm gonna very quickly just put

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.219 
blue and I'm gonna very quickly just put
a<00:01:51.799> stain<00:01:52.250> in<00:01:52.460> for<00:01:52.670> my<00:01:52.790> sky<00:01:53.119> make<00:01:53.869> sure<00:01:54.049> the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
a stain in for my sky make sure the

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.880 
a stain in for my sky make sure the
negative<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.799> positive<00:01:54.829> shapes<00:01:55.549> are<00:01:55.850> correct

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
negative and positive shapes are correct

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.010 
negative and positive shapes are correct
make<00:01:57.890> sure<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.310> these<00:01:58.520> these<00:01:59.119> shapes<00:01:59.540> this

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
make sure that these these shapes this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.289 
make sure that these these shapes this
air<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:00.770> here<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.250> negative<00:02:01.579> shape<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
air in here this negative shape of the

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.929 
air in here this negative shape of the
canyon<00:02:02.840> against<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.619> positive<00:02:04.369> shape<00:02:04.700> of

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
canyon against this positive shape of

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.980 
canyon against this positive shape of
the<00:02:05.299> rock<00:02:05.539> in<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.780> foreground<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.520> this

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
the rock in the foreground that this

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:17.200 
the rock in the foreground that this
area<00:02:08.990> in<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.740> feels<00:02:10.220> correct

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.120 

I'm<00:02:18.210> gonna<00:02:18.510> take<00:02:18.750> some<00:02:18.930> time<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.470> mix<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:20.040> a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
I'm gonna take some time and mix up a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.000 
I'm gonna take some time and mix up a
darker<00:02:20.490> variation<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.180> my<00:02:21.330> tone<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:22.709> put<00:02:22.890> in

ready to start putting in our branches
now<00:03:23.850> where<00:03:24.090> these<00:03:24.269> branches<00:03:25.230> go<00:03:25.470> up<00:03:25.769> against

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
now where these branches go up against

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.170 
now where these branches go up against
the<00:03:26.459> blue<00:03:27.019> really<00:03:28.019> take<00:03:28.769> some<00:03:29.040> time<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.700> do
