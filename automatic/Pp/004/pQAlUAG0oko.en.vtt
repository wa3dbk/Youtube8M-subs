00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.080
 province or by posting the name 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.830
 prometheus ridley scott director that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.730
 published in the United Kingdom and has 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:31.500
 audio caption in Brazilian Portuguese 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.399
 both in 3d and in version 2d that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.250
 you may already have an idea the glove that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.260
 accompanies this first edition batch 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 a beautiful glove 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.860
 looking ahead and I know you have 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.860
 some effects the effect is bright 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.690
 here on the spine is not here anymore 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.700
 traditional and on the reverse there is also the law 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.970
 the effect 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:11.460
 brilliant in every verse of this struggle 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 here you do not have the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.430
 which has audio subtitles in Portuguese 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.190
 Brazilian 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.410
 but the trails in Portuguese are without 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.640
 on the disk you know what a 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.000
 feature of imported editions of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.369
 not contain on the back all 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.710
 subtitle audio tracks but here already 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.570
 is proven to have audi legend in 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.690
 Brazilian Portuguese and evidently the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.759
 disco is region free as you can see the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.200
 ABC 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.720
 this movie and that is a prologue of the clean 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 the four alien films and that was 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.310
 launched this year in a group and a 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.930
 legal feature of this issue is this 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.690
 here not only does it have a movie on 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.570
 3d and 2 law but that has more than seven 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.960
 and it's to be a lot of extra material 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.820
 and they are also subtitled in 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.940
