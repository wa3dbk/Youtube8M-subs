00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
so you can enable Google search or I
have<00:01:47.909> screen<00:01:48.479> off<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.920> those

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
have screen off so I can do one of those

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.800 
have screen off so I can do one of those
two<00:01:50.340> things

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
two things

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.359 
two things
next<00:01:51.810> under<00:01:51.990> looking<00:01:52.590> behavior<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.130> pretty

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
next under looking behavior it's pretty

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.940 
next under looking behavior it's pretty
extensive<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.240> I'll<00:01:54.600> briefly<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.680> over

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
extensive so I'll briefly be going over

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.219 
extensive so I'll briefly be going over
this<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.820> adjust<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> haptic<00:01:58.200> feedback

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
this you can adjust the haptic feedback

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.219 
this you can adjust the haptic feedback
the<00:01:59.219> pin<00:01:59.610> size<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.329> make<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.540> large<00:02:00.780> very

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the pin size you can make it large very

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.110 
the pin size you can make it large very
large

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
large

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.780 
large
you<00:02:03.330> might<00:02:03.510> have<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.720> restart<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:04.410> one

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
you might have to restart for that one

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.120 
you might have to restart for that one
switch<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.000> recent<00:02:06.420> tasks<00:02:06.630> upon<00:02:06.990> pinning<00:02:07.410> this

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
switch to recent tasks upon pinning this

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.620 
switch to recent tasks upon pinning this
one<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.460> actually<00:02:08.580> pretty<00:02:08.910> useful<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.240> suggest

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
one is actually pretty useful I suggest

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.000 
one is actually pretty useful I suggest
not<00:02:09.990> enabling<00:02:10.650> it

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
not enabling it

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.250 
not enabling it
so<00:02:11.550> essentially<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> does<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.720> when<00:02:13.050> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so essentially what it does is when you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.070 
so essentially what it does is when you
were<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.770> pin<00:02:14.610> something<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.630> would<00:02:15.750> bring<00:02:15.930> you

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
were to pin something it would bring you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.690 
were to pin something it would bring you
back<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.740> leave<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> current<00:02:17.490> screen

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
back it will leave the current screen

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.070 
back it will leave the current screen
you<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.030> took<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> recent<00:02:18.870> tasks

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
you on it took you to the recent tasks

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.900 
you on it took you to the recent tasks
that's<00:02:19.410> kind<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.620> annoying<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.490> don't<00:02:20.790> end

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
that's kind of annoying so I don't end

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.790 
that's kind of annoying so I don't end
able<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.230> there's<00:02:22.410> also<00:02:22.590> some

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
able that and then there's also some

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.430 
able that and then there's also some
options<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.910> animations<00:02:24.540> ignore<00:02:25.170> pin

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
options for the animations ignore pin

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.580 
options for the animations ignore pin

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
tasks as a previous one so this won't

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.030 
tasks as a previous one so this won't
consider<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.640> pin<00:02:30.150> task<00:02:30.770> let's<00:02:31.770> say<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> do

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
consider the pin task let's say I do

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.490 
consider the pin task let's say I do
that<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.430> we'll<00:02:32.550> consider<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.500> recent

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
that and we'll consider this a recent

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.070 
that and we'll consider this a recent
tasks<00:02:35.400> or<00:02:35.550> absolutely<00:02:36.150> won't<00:02:36.360> bring<00:02:36.780> me<00:02:36.930> back

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
tasks or absolutely won't bring me back

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.360

to<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.410> one<00:02:37.560> under<00:02:38.040> one<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> other

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
to that one under one of the other

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.130 
to that one under one of the other
options

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
options

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.570 
options
then<00:02:40.140> there's<00:02:40.320> browser<00:02:40.650> extension<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.430> is

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
then there's browser extension this is

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.440 
then there's browser extension this is
useful<00:02:41.940> as<00:02:42.030> well<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.630> allows<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.830> select

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
useful as well it allows you to select

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.900 
useful as well it allows you to select
HTTP<00:02:45.450> links<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.080> pin<00:02:46.620> them<00:02:46.770> for<00:02:46.980> later<00:02:47.130> so

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
HTTP links and pin them for later so

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.340 
HTTP links and pin them for later so
let's<00:02:48.090> say<00:02:48.270> you're<00:02:48.570> in<00:02:48.600> Twitter<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.080> you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
let's say you're in Twitter and you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.300 
let's say you're in Twitter and you
select<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.890> link<00:02:50.600> it'll<00:02:51.600> pop<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:52.100> right<00:02:53.100> here

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
select a link it'll pop up right here

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.790 
select a link it'll pop up right here
and<00:02:53.520> then<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.090> say<00:02:54.840> pin<00:02:55.200> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
and then you can just say pin and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.890 
and then you can just say pin and
continue<00:02:56.220> browsing<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.360> do<00:02:57.420> whatever<00:02:57.630> you're

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
continue browsing and do whatever you're

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.200 
continue browsing and do whatever you're
doing<00:02:58.140> as<00:02:58.530> its<00:02:58.800> loads<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.400> then<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.880> access

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
doing as its loads and then I can access

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.140 
doing as its loads and then I can access
it<00:03:00.390> later<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.960> go<00:03:01.860> through<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.460> you're

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
it later and go through it if you're

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.390 
it later and go through it if you're
using<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.630> Google<00:03:03.930> now<00:03:04.230> launcher<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:05.160> can

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
using the Google now launcher you can

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.290 
using the Google now launcher you can
also<00:03:06.330> repurpose<00:03:07.050> this<00:03:07.560> action<00:03:08.070> as<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:09.120> did

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
also repurpose this action as I just did

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.110 
also repurpose this action as I just did
right<00:03:09.420> now<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:10.770> do<00:03:11.130> one<00:03:11.370> up<00:03:11.489> two<00:03:11.610> things<00:03:11.880> you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
right now to do one up two things you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.630 
right now to do one up two things you
can<00:03:12.270> allow<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.870> pin<00:03:13.350> this<00:03:14.040> current<00:03:14.430> task

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
can allow it to pin this current task

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.260 
can allow it to pin this current task
but<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.360> already<00:03:15.570> have<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.550> two<00:03:17.550> pin<00:03:17.730> tasks<00:03:17.970> so

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
but I already have that two pin tasks so

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.240 
but I already have that two pin tasks so
I'm<00:03:18.420> gonna<00:03:18.570> allow<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.380> take<00:03:19.860> me<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.130> the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
I'm gonna allow it to take me to the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.250 
I'm gonna allow it to take me to the
recent<00:03:20.820> tasks<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.570> I'm<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> select<00:03:21.989> all

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
recent tasks so I'm going to select all

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.100 
recent tasks so I'm going to select all
ways<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.920> also<00:03:23.310> bring<00:03:23.670> me<00:03:23.850> back<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.270> a<00:03:24.630> recent

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
ways I also bring me back to a recent

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.990 
ways I also bring me back to a recent
tasks<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.680> was<00:03:25.830> using<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.820> took<00:03:26.940> me

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
tasks that I was using so it took me

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000 
tasks that I was using so it took me
back<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.420> Twitter<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:28.170> pretty<00:03:28.410> useful<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
back to Twitter it's pretty useful and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.220 
back to Twitter it's pretty useful and
that<00:03:29.370> way<00:03:29.520> I<00:03:29.550> have<00:03:29.760> recent<00:03:30.180> sound<00:03:30.450> here<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.900> I

that way I have recent sound here and I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.979 
that way I have recent sound here and I
have<00:03:31.380> pinning<00:03:31.860> up<00:03:32.070> there<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.690> ever<00:03:33.720> want

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
have pinning up there if you ever want

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.690
