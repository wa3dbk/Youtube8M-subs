kem<00:02:26.209> strikes<00:02:26.450> especially<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.930> beginning

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
got really plain and boring and that's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.050 
got really plain and boring and that's
why<00:02:30.800> we<00:02:30.830> came<00:02:31.190> out<00:02:31.310> with<00:02:31.400> our<00:02:31.459> unique<00:02:31.700> kem

why we came out with our unique kem

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.850 
why we came out with our unique kem
strike<00:02:32.330> series<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.050> we<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> lot<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.709> fun

with<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.160> but<00:02:34.819> let's<00:02:35.000> talk<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> little<00:02:35.239> bit

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
with that but let's talk a little bit

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.930 
with that but let's talk a little bit
about<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.840> map<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.470> honestly<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.340> didn't<00:02:37.819> play

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
about this map so honestly I didn't play

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.410 
about this map so honestly I didn't play
modern<00:02:38.269> warfare<00:02:38.300> 2<00:02:38.660> very<00:02:39.200> much<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.880> my<00:02:40.880> time<00:02:41.150> on

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
modern warfare 2 very much so my time on

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.240 
modern warfare 2 very much so my time on
modern<00:02:41.959> warfare<00:02:42.080> 2<00:02:42.349> which<00:02:42.530> obviously<00:02:42.950> isn't

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
modern warfare 2 which obviously isn't

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.030 
modern warfare 2 which obviously isn't
very<00:02:43.489> much<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:45.080> definitely<00:02:45.290> wasn't<00:02:45.680> my

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
very much this definitely wasn't my

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.920 
very much this definitely wasn't my
favorite<00:02:46.250> map<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.790> don't<00:02:47.120> like<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.540> map<00:02:47.690> too

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
favorite map I don't like the map too

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.350 
favorite map I don't like the map too
much<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.500> from<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.549> hear<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.060> what<00:02:50.299> I

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
much it's from what I hear and what I

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.940 
much it's from what I hear and what I
understand<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.959> map<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.319> more<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.650> trick

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
understand the map it's more of a trick

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.860 
understand the map it's more of a trick
shotting<00:02:52.190> map<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.700> could<00:02:52.940> be<00:02:53.090> wrong<00:02:53.510> or

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
shotting map I could be wrong or

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.809 
shotting map I could be wrong or
mistaken<00:02:54.319> but<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.470> lot<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.620> snipers<00:02:55.130> liked

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
mistaken but a lot of snipers liked

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.620 
mistaken but a lot of snipers liked
using<00:02:56.120> or<00:02:56.599> playing<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.079> this<00:02:57.230> map<00:02:57.430> um<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.700> it's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
an okay map it's kinda I feel I felt

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.009 
an okay map it's kinda I feel I felt
like<00:03:02.150> when<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.329> played<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.630> on<00:03:02.660> modern<00:03:02.840> warfare

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
like when I played it on modern warfare

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.780 
like when I played it on modern warfare
2<00:03:03.349> I<00:03:03.380> haven't<00:03:03.769> had<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> chance<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.280> play<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.640> yet

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
2 I haven't had a chance to play it yet

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.660 
2 I haven't had a chance to play it yet
on<00:03:05.000> ghosts<00:03:05.299> but<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.349> felt<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.130> was<00:03:07.310> kind<00:03:07.610> of

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
on ghosts but I felt that it was kind of

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.270 
on ghosts but I felt that it was kind of
campy<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.750> played<00:03:08.959> decently<00:03:09.709> fast<00:03:09.950> paced

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
campy and it played decently fast paced

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.600 
campy and it played decently fast paced
on<00:03:10.459> ground<00:03:10.730> war<00:03:10.940> but<00:03:11.239> it's<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:12.470> little<00:03:13.130> campy
