00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.630
 Walter Wagner Mr. he 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:15.710
 harder 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.589
 hor 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.529
 so also this tournament to a second group 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.550
 the mind drives the ball 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.609
 not being attacked sees the gap and now a wonderful shot with 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.489
 right 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.199
 the ball gets longer and longer 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.489
 and what exactly in the upper right goal corner a dream goal 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.610
 yes dear viewers that was once so relatively quiet now block 2 in the eighth 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.610
 Minute that was the kick off right after the goal 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.910
 and the attacks of Hagen Haspe 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.180
 Zombies at this time look like the following will show the veins 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.910
 The ball is knocked forward 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.150
 way too long for the striker here with the number 9 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.620
 and he can not reach the ball anymore 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.970
 so were the attacks in the initial phase of Hagen Haspe 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.400
 exclusively 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.080
 until then no danger 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 for the goalkeeper of TuS eving-lindenhorst 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 Light is light 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 ready for tee 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
 the long slag comes forward 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 and things Slam attack 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.990
 Dr 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200
 Dr 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.520
 at 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.600
 more 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.090
 here 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 Dr 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.580
 if you do that the man should not believe it 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.770
 tactical change has paid off 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.119
 the lively Marko hin that against the long defensive player what pass from 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.679
 Regardless of how beautiful you are, you did not know what to do 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.649
 over the plot Kom the 2 2 0 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.649
 Maybe there is already the decision 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.759
 the seven novels are news 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.399
 the aggression and then guys have continued to put a lot of pressure 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.779
 You can see them immediately as a Hagen attack is intercepted 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.779
 or are you already in attack again? 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.699
 now comes another of Hagen's attempt there is already werder-striker 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.280
 in between or the midfielder in this case and the next attacks 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:49.049
 started double comes deep it could have been the preliminary decisions counter 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.689
 can to 3 2 0 again small man could SAP d-moll beautiful over 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.939
 but unfortunately after the rings forests 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.510
 believes that we have the final decision after only 25 minutes 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.899
 Been playing time 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.789
 yes, I also believe that this has been the preliminary decision in this game 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:04.330
 would 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.630
 especially since you have to tell her for our viewers at home the Porsche 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.369
 a draw would have been enough 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.689
 So we will be second in the group even in a draw 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.219
 Unwerth ascended 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.359
 Lopez was the first warning shot at our goal yes 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.929
 is still relatively harmless and answer 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.679
 to connect to it who now believes the first corner 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.679
 we have Haspa 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.959
 what a shame 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.369
 Yes 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.470
 MR 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.479
 Erhard 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.759
 Dr 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.409
 Dr 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.290
 because uninvited though will know again 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.860
 and the discrepancy is exactly three defenders around the striker 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.040
 Nevertheless, he is free to header but clear defense error 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.869
 can not blame it there are four like me now or 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.909
 Fourth match for a striker and something like that should just not happen 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.309
 so that was the connection score of 2 20 per year to say I have ' 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:12.009
 the player actually saw Hagen Haspe's first serious attack 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.579
 immediately led to the goal 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.739
 or stuck then pretty youngster in the bone you can see her immediately 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.019
 second chance 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.870
 the defense where a bit now 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.330
 careless 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.129
 You also see a wonderful shot of a player from Hagen Haspe 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.370
 thanks to a super action from Milan thanks, one must say so 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.300
 I did not see it rising so high for a long time 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.540
 Zuma the mistake happened lights you can not the striker so free to 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.830
 Shot to come 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.360
 told such guys sacrifice because we lasted a little bit smaller 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 Becker we are now very nice straight with the fist up 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.360
 LinkedIn on the latte 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.490
 So a wonderful parade determines something for RTL 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.509
 yes I want to be out for a long time was the parade of the month 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.620
 Hagen became much stronger at this time than in the opening minutes 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.099
 Here we see the next corner questions 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.240
 who wants can be turned away 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.129
 now a bit of confusion in the defense 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.099
 but then your sadness I think to make sure I was so happy teacher 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.589
 Choose time consciously 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.439
 Heinz Besch at the same time k2 Sports will understand 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.659
 Temme 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.189
 it was very confused in the victims 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.499
 yes, that was the half-time whistle 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:27.270
 at half-time for TuS eving-lindenhorst against Hagen Haspe 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.030
 Mr. Christian 30 degrees heavy games what do you say to a young troupe Â«Da 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.830
 as a coach at halftime 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.889
 there is of course a people will be the Wallis hardest task with 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.490
 Coins Games End to us at 1 we just need a draw 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.210
 of course, in the boys' minds as well 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.439
 like tsunami I know the ten face his boys 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.439
 achieved despite always plenty of bubbling field edge 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.879
 that was an irresistible heat 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.439
 I tried to build them the Dransfelder Messi still 35 minutes from 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.240
 away from the big goal 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.889
 the defense must have been a bit confused just before the victory 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.220
 Halftime we now want to play a secured cover and 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.319
 try right after the kickoff 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.559
 with full pressure to score our next goal for the decision 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:15.150
 bring about 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.419
 who without 7-10 also the same beautiful I was really surprised it was so 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:20.839
 Initiation for hasp 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.279
 and again the little mark or between goes and you have so directly the 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.309
 First chance if you can in this case if Jonas Rehmann 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.650
 I think leads enter quite interesting 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.979
 Weimar Prof Achim Frank Teufel running in the ball with Benzema 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.020
 here comes the club women all questions of the player free kick for you 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.490
 and 8 this trial in court again through a very dangerous scene 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.099
 where the preliminary decision could have gone 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.939
 Noss same in the weather could not play great and many 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.080
 long balls played what you can see more now a long ball in 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.979
 the penalty area and now 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.089
 Is evaluated 

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:59.189
 Daniel Schmid was rigid on the lips and again in retrospect to the 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.199
 bar 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.830
 incredible 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.169
 r 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:11.139
 Dr Dr 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:17.330
 i just like it because he 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:23.809
 Harrer once more have the Eiger 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.919
 He is doing a pure question, sir 

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:35.569
 H 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:37.830
 Hall 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.830
 Dr 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:45.360
 4 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.360
 Yes 

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:54.909
 that he comes to this huge opportunity a local I believe because I one 

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:56.389
 Lucky child does not meet planned 

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:58.909
 but now only everything is completely elicited
