phone<00:01:16.220> calls<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.670> there's<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> mic<00:01:17.450> inbuilt<00:01:17.750> as

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
phone calls and there's a mic inbuilt as

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.170 
phone calls and there's a mic inbuilt as
well<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.130> cable<00:01:19.520> length<00:01:19.700> between<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
well the cable length between the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.270 
well the cable length between the
microphone<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.900> headset<00:01:21.409> is<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.100> few

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
microphone and the headset is just a few

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.640 
microphone and the headset is just a few
inches<00:01:22.430> long<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.570> probably<00:01:23.870> to<00:01:24.320> keep<00:01:24.350> the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
inches long this is probably to keep the

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.890 
inches long this is probably to keep the
microphone<00:01:25.100> within<00:01:25.970> reasonable<00:01:26.600> distance

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900

plug<00:02:00.619> from<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.920> tops<00:02:01.130> unplug<00:02:01.520> from<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.729> side

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
plug from the tops unplug from the side

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.539 
plug from the tops unplug from the side
so<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:02.930> is<00:02:03.080> sort<00:02:03.619> of<00:02:03.650> like<00:02:03.799> tedious<00:02:04.220> answer

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
so this is sort of like tedious answer

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.609 
so this is sort of like tedious answer
to<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.820> middle<00:02:05.060> ground<00:02:05.299> now<00:02:06.049> let's<00:02:06.290> look<00:02:06.439> at

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
to the middle ground now let's look at

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.529 
to the middle ground now let's look at
the<00:02:06.770> various<00:02:07.070> aspects<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.970> headset

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
the various aspects of the headset

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.229 
the various aspects of the headset
itself<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.860> headband<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.369> adjustable<00:02:10.970> by

plastic and there is no cushioning or
anything<00:02:18.620> like<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.769> on<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.129> top<00:02:19.340> having

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
anything like that on the top having

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.119 
anything like that on the top having
said<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.420> there<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.349> some<00:02:21.680> amount<00:02:21.950> of

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
said that there is some amount of

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.459 
said that there is some amount of
firmness<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.760> some<00:02:23.540> amount<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.900> flexibility

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
firmness and some amount of flexibility

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.090 
firmness and some amount of flexibility
in<00:02:24.980> such<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:25.879> way<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.689> headset<00:02:27.379> remains

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
in such a way that the headset remains

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.730 
in such a way that the headset remains
on<00:02:28.190> our<00:02:28.370> ears<00:02:28.700> even<00:02:29.270> when<00:02:29.840> we<00:02:30.050> are<00:02:30.170> walking<00:02:30.350> or

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
on our ears even when we are walking or

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.860 
on our ears even when we are walking or
up<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.160> light<00:02:31.370> job<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.570> further

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
up to light job and that is further

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.390 
up to light job and that is further
helped<00:02:33.140> by<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.350> fact<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:33.950> very<00:02:34.250> very

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
helped by the fact that it is very very

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.780 
helped by the fact that it is very very
light<00:02:34.820> it's<00:02:35.630> just<00:02:35.900> about<00:02:36.080> 500<00:02:36.560> grams<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
light it's just about 500 grams so the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.570 
light it's just about 500 grams so the
headband<00:02:38.360> need<00:02:38.570> not<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:38.930> too<00:02:39.350> firm<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:39.890> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
headband need not be too firm and the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.550 
headband need not be too firm and the
earcups<00:02:41.060> do<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.270> reasonably<00:02:41.870> decent<00:02:42.050> job<00:02:42.350> in

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
earcups do a reasonably decent job in

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.320 
earcups do a reasonably decent job in
keeping<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.950> cuffs<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.430> position<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.030> the

keeping the cuffs in position and the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.880 
keeping the cuffs in position and the
padding<00:02:44.630> itself<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.110> made<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.590> fully

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
padding itself is made of fully

synthetic<00:02:46.160> material<00:02:46.790> which<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.690> either<00:02:48.230> make

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
synthetic material which can either make

reminds<00:02:53.000> me<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.690> audio<00:02:54.020> technica<00:02:54.320> ath<00:02:54.590> m30

reminds me of the audio technica ath m30

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.640 
reminds me of the audio technica ath m30
that<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:55.820> reviewed<00:02:56.120> earlier<00:02:56.240> which<00:02:57.170> also<00:02:57.380> has

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
that we reviewed earlier which also has

that we reviewed earlier which also has

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
synthetic material for its ear cups but

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.350 
synthetic material for its ear cups but
it<00:03:00.260> feels<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.650> little<00:03:00.740> bit<00:03:00.920> better<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
it feels a little bit better and the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.090 
it feels a little bit better and the
headphone<00:03:02.870> itself<00:03:02.990> is<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.620> course<00:03:03.770> in<00:03:04.010> a

headphone itself is of course in a
different<00:03:04.400> league<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.970> has<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.180> feel

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
different league so it has to feel

different league so it has to feel
better<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.200> reason<00:03:06.470> why<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.620> showed<00:03:06.920> the

better but the reason why I showed the

better but the reason why I showed the
audio<00:03:07.250> technica<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:07.790> because<00:03:08.090> it's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
audio technica is because it's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.140 
audio technica is because it's
surprising<00:03:09.530> how<00:03:09.710> close<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:10.790> headphone

actually<00:03:11.600> gets<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.960> that<00:03:12.080> not<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.740> there<00:03:12.950> is

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
actually gets to that not that there is

word<00:03:38.900> i'm<00:03:39.050> going<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.290> say<00:03:39.440> is<00:03:39.710> that<00:03:39.800> it's

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
word i'm going to say is that it's

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.670 
word i'm going to say is that it's
reasonable<00:03:40.700> for<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.810> duration<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.380> time<00:03:42.530> that
