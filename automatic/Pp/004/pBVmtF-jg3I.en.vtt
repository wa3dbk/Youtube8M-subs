 donated sum and I participated 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.670
 think this is a very good start 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.110
 when you're together so just a bit 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.459

 and not a bit on the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.590
 I think that's the way playstation had happened 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.630
 an important story in recent years 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.820
