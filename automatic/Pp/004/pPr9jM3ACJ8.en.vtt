this<00:00:35.130> book<00:00:35.430> first<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:37.050> book<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
this book first of all my book is the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.869 
this book first of all my book is the
shortest<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> books<00:00:41.460> I've<00:00:41.640> just

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
shortest of of all the books I've just

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.490 
shortest of of all the books I've just
mentioned<00:00:42.120> my<00:00:42.870> book<00:00:43.309> is<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.420> 82<00:00:45.870> pages

mentioned my book is on just 82 pages
and<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.700> were<00:00:47.850> judging<00:00:48.739> how<00:00:49.739> good

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and I think if we were judging how good

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.799 
and I think if we were judging how good
books<00:00:50.460> are<00:00:50.760> by<00:00:51.719> their<00:00:52.079> brevity<00:00:53.420> no<00:00:54.420> well<00:00:54.629> which

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
books are by their brevity no well which

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.950 
books are by their brevity no well which
we're<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.710> were<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:57.180> book<00:00:57.449> my

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
we're not but if we were then my book my

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
we're not but if we were then my book my
book<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.289> clearly<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> best<00:00:58.980> people<00:00:59.460> say<00:00:59.760> to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.600 
love with the Bible so I first phone it
up<00:02:13.780> at<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.959> Bible<00:02:14.230> about<00:02:14.320> 20<00:02:14.830> years<00:02:14.980> ago<00:02:15.130> and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
up at the Bible about 20 years ago and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.090 
up at the Bible about 20 years ago and
that's<00:02:15.850> what<00:02:16.120> I'm<00:02:16.360> hoping<00:02:16.870> people<00:02:17.530> will<00:02:17.860> do

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
that's what I'm hoping people will do

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.949 
that's what I'm hoping people will do
the<00:02:18.459> best-case<00:02:18.880> scenario<00:02:18.910> for<00:02:19.420> me<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:19.840> that

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
the best-case scenario for me is that

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.650 
the best-case scenario for me is that
people<00:02:20.140> stop<00:02:20.709> reading<00:02:21.100> my<00:02:21.250> book<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.760> they<00:02:22.300> go

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
people stop reading my book and they go

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.300 
people stop reading my book and they go
straight<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> Bible<00:02:23.650> no<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.190> know

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
straight to the Bible no you know

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.140 
straight to the Bible no you know
everything<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.570> instead
