00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.330
 but 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.900

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.170

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.860
 When even once after using this 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.860
 Let it go 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.990

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.690

 Believe in the information on the internet and it's easy to write how to do this 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:27.750
 I think 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:27.750
 Usually prepare 500 ml of water Into this water I will put the previous cleaning agent 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.190

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.710

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:13.980

 Accidental button on wash mode 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.370

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.359
