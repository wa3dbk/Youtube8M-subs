00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:16.947
It's a great honor for me
to command such a traditional team,

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.750
historically speaking,

00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:25.785
Santos FC has influenced
everyone who loves soccer,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.119
throughout several generations,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.573
it's a great honor to be here,
I'm very pleased.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.822
I have the highest expectations,

00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:37.765
I hope we manage to play well
and to win all the matches and titles...

00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:40.812
that our fans want and deserve.

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:42.774
You've just had your first contact,

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.375
do you think the Club
has the infrastructure...

00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:49.449
needed for you to develop your job
and to make the team evolve?

00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:51.441
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.609
This Training Center is exactly
what we expect...

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.097
from a huge team
just like Santos FC,

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:04.241
the squad is extremely qualified,

00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:06.793
there are players
]who are seeking for a chance,

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:11.650
who want to establish themselves
in the soccer world,

00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:16.167
who are full of expectations
concerning their professional career.

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:20.442
We have the best possible conditions
to develop our job,

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:23.220
and, as I always say,
to achieve great results,

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:26.481
which is crucial for teams
such as Santos FC,

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:28.852
which are always disputing titles.

00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:31.595
How was your first contact
with the team's squad,

00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:34.566
and how do you think they will do
in the Brazilian championship?

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:37.128
Particularly speaking,

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:41.958
I am very positive about them,
I know most of them,

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.539
I had the chance to work
with some of them,

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:47.151
I had the chance to face
practically all of them,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.187
and it's very hard
to play against Santos FC,

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:54.307
it doesn't matter where,
at Vila Belmiro or not,

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:59.744
I trust our team,
our players are very qualified.

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:02.269
Oswaldo de Oliveira
did an excellent job, 

00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:06.217
we are certainly going to
keep up the good work,

00:02:06.428 --> 00:02:10.825
and, gradually, I will promote
the changes I believe are needed.

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.430
I have the highest expectations,

00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:17.887
and, along with our athletes,
we'll build a very competitive team.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:20.273
Welcome to Santos FC,
and good luck!

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:22.200
Thank you so much!
