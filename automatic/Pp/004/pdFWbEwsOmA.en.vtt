core we're seeing the galaxy edge on
from<00:00:51.329> inside<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> Galactic

stars with no structure and because we

stars with no structure and because we

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.070 
astronomers map the arms
by<00:02:14.010> looking<00:02:14.670> at<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.030> distribution<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.870> gas

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
by looking at the distribution of gas

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.790 
by looking at the distribution of gas
which<00:02:16.830> pulls<00:02:17.310> together<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.300> star<00:02:19.230> forming

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
which pulls together in star forming

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.730

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
the major arms are from the Sun and in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the Milky Way is obscured by gas and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.130 
the Milky Way is obscured by gas and
