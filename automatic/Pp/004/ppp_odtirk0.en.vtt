I<00:01:15.479> had<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> try<00:01:15.900> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
I had to try it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
I had to try it
the<00:01:16.439> only<00:01:16.590> thing<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.150> sold<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.689> my

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the only thing is it's not sold in my

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.679 
the only thing is it's not sold in my
stores<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.650> any<00:01:19.770> stories<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.369> area<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
stores or any stories in my area and I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.740 
stores or any stories in my area and I
had<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> order<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.259> online<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.750> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
had to order it online and I think if it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
had to order it online and I think if it
was<00:01:24.990> sold<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.860> my<00:01:26.159> local<00:01:26.340> beauty<00:01:26.670> supply<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
was sold and my local beauty supply and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.020 
was sold and my local beauty supply and
the<00:01:27.299> price<00:01:27.540> would<00:01:27.720> probably<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.320> more

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
the price would probably be more

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.100 
the price would probably be more
cost-effective<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:31.250> think<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.640> maybe

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
cost-effective I think it was like maybe

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.080 
cost-effective I think it was like maybe
four<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:34.350> five<00:01:34.560> hundred<00:01:34.650> nine<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> peck<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
four or five hundred nine a peck at the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.050 
four or five hundred nine a peck at the
