down at this point I'm identifying the
muscle<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.450> elevates<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.110> upper<00:00:13.380> eyelid<00:00:13.799> so

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
muscle that elevates the upper eyelid so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.919 
muscle that elevates the upper eyelid so
mastic<00:00:14.849> when<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.059> found<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> muscle<00:00:15.809> that

lifts<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.289> eye<00:00:16.410> now<00:00:16.920> we're<00:00:17.039> gonna<00:00:17.130> try<00:00:17.400> to

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
lifts the eye now we're gonna try to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.609 
lifts the eye now we're gonna try to
reconnect<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.600> cartilage<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> upper

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
reconnect to the cartilage of the upper

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.090 
reconnect to the cartilage of the upper
eyelid<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.100> he<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.400> open<00:00:20.820> his<00:00:20.910> eye<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:23.070> a

eyelid so he can open his eye and have a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.580 
eyelid so he can open his eye and have a
more<00:00:23.369> normal<00:00:23.760> appearance<00:00:24.260> right<00:00:25.260> now<00:00:25.439> we're

us<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.670> reverse<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.150> process<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.869> those<00:01:25.020> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
us to reverse this process so those I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
us to reverse this process so those I
could<00:01:25.439> function<00:01:25.650> again<00:01:26.040> our<00:01:26.369> state<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
could function again our state of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.730 
could function again our state of
medical<00:01:27.210> knowledge<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:28.409> believe<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
medical knowledge I don't believe that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
medical knowledge I don't believe that
he<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.250> regain<00:01:29.400> vision<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> eye<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
he will regain vision in that eye I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.240 
he will regain vision in that eye I
believe<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.439> continue<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.890> shrink

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
believe that I will continue to shrink

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.380 
believe that I will continue to shrink
and<00:01:32.430> there<00:01:32.549> will<00:01:32.670> come<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> time<00:01:32.970> where<00:01:33.329> he

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and there will come a time where he

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.130 
and there will come a time where he
finally<00:01:33.600> decides<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> remove<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.900> I'm<00:01:36.900> now

roof<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.930> his<00:01:49.049> upper<00:01:49.350> mouth<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.220> graft<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
roof of his upper mouth the graft is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
roof of his upper mouth the graft is
gonna<00:01:50.880> give<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.450> support<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> lower<00:01:52.350> lip

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
gonna give some support to the lower lip

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.590 
gonna give some support to the lower lip
internally<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.460> help<00:01:53.640> lift<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.360> it's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
internally and help lift it because it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.260 
internally and help lift it because it's
too<00:01:54.780> low<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.890> our<00:01:56.039> graph<00:01:56.280> does<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
too low this is our graph does the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.450 
too low this is our graph does the
lining<00:01:57.689> tissue<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> mouth<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.920> hard

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
lining tissue in the mouth that is hard

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.090 
lining tissue in the mouth that is hard
I<00:01:59.490> need<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> hardness<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.689> give<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.929> support

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
I need the hardness to give it support

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.010 
I need the hardness to give it support
I'm<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:02.369> placing<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.179> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.450> inner<00:02:03.750> aspect

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
I'm now placing it on the inner aspect

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.889 
I'm now placing it on the inner aspect
of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.470> lower<00:02:04.679> lid<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.840> as

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
of the lower lid so think of this as

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.620 
of the lower lid so think of this as
he's<00:02:07.530> put<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> spacer<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.000> lining<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.569> his

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
he's put a spacer in the lining of his

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.259 
he's put a spacer in the lining of his
eye<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.500> make<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.709> deeper<00:02:11.099> pocket<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:12.150> you

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
eye to make a deeper pocket have you

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.729 
eye to make a deeper pocket have you
ever<00:02:12.450> put<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.750> contact<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.410> pull<00:02:13.590> your<00:02:13.709> eye

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
ever put on a contact you pull your eye

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.199 
ever put on a contact you pull your eye
back<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.220> there's<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.400> pocket<00:02:14.790> there<00:02:14.970> he

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
back and there's a pocket there he

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.600 
back and there's a pocket there he
didn't<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:15.510> enough<00:02:15.540> pocket<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.250> he<00:02:17.310> has

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
didn't have enough pocket so now he has

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.120 
didn't have enough pocket so now he has
a<00:02:17.970> deeper<00:02:18.540> pocket<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.200> his<00:02:19.350> lower<00:02:19.620> lid<00:02:19.890> comes

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
a deeper pocket and his lower lid comes

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.729 
a deeper pocket and his lower lid comes
up<00:02:20.280> higher<00:02:20.519> now<00:02:20.850> let's<00:02:21.840> see<00:02:22.049> where<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.319> are

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.289 

she's<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:25.830> externally<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> can't<00:02:26.670> tell<00:02:26.940> she

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
she's so externally you can't tell she

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.870 
she's so externally you can't tell she
had<00:02:27.420> all<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.690> stuff<00:02:27.959> done<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.640> take<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> look

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
had all that stuff done I take a look

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.880 
had all that stuff done I take a look
how<00:02:30.000> normal<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.540> looks<00:02:30.780> after<00:02:31.380> we<00:02:31.650> placed

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
how normal that looks after we placed

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.470 
how normal that looks after we placed
the<00:02:32.040> graph<00:02:32.250> then<00:02:32.580> we<00:02:32.700> close<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.970> lower<00:02:33.269> lid

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
the graph then we close the lower lid

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.509 
the graph then we close the lower lid
incisions<00:02:33.989> pulling<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.680> lower<00:02:34.860> lid<00:02:35.099> up<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
incisions pulling the lower lid up and

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.250 
incisions pulling the lower lid up and

securing it to the forehead prevents the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.960 
securing it to the forehead prevents the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
scar tissues from pulling it downward

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.930 
scar tissues from pulling it downward

fall<00:02:42.049> okay<00:02:44.420> Landon<00:02:45.420> surgery<00:02:45.690> went<00:02:45.870> extremely

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
fall okay Landon surgery went extremely

the results the next step is probably

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.740 
the results the next step is probably
around<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.280> month<00:02:50.489> or<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:50.880> he's<00:02:51.120> gonna<00:02:51.239> be<00:02:51.329> fit

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
the difference is pretty remarkable if

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.900 
the difference is pretty remarkable if
you<00:03:51.590> look<00:03:51.740> at<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.950> shape<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.340> your<00:03:52.400> eye<00:03:52.550> it's

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
you look at the shape of your eye it's

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.540 
you look at the shape of your eye it's
almond<00:03:53.330> shaped<00:03:53.600> again<00:03:53.930> now<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:54.830> eye<00:03:55.100> and

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
almond shaped again now this eye and

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.430 
almond shaped again now this eye and
that<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:55.880> don't<00:03:56.060> quite<00:03:56.480> perfectly<00:03:56.990> match<00:03:57.170> but

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
that I don't quite perfectly match but

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.140 
that I don't quite perfectly match but
we'll<00:03:57.709> find<00:03:57.890> is<00:03:58.220> over<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.520> next<00:03:58.700> month<00:03:58.970> or<00:03:59.090> so

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
we'll find is over the next month or so

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.270 
we'll find is over the next month or so
that's<00:03:59.450> gonna<00:03:59.630> settle<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.200> little<00:04:00.350> bit<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.769> as

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
that's gonna settle a little bit and as

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.860 
that's gonna settle a little bit and as
it<00:04:01.459> does<00:04:01.640> I<00:04:01.850> think<00:04:02.090> you'd<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.300> pretty<00:04:02.480> close<00:04:02.810> to

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
it does I think you'd be pretty close to

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.750 
it does I think you'd be pretty close to
right<00:04:03.260> on<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:03.709> think<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.190> could<00:04:04.340> have<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.519> new

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
right on I think you could have a new

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.970 
right on I think you could have a new
eye<00:04:04.820> refitted<00:04:05.690> for<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.290> about<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.560> month<00:04:06.830> or

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
eye refitted for you in about a month or

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.800 
eye refitted for you in about a month or
so<00:04:07.160> we're<00:04:07.670> very<00:04:07.700> happy<00:04:08.030> with<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:08.360> outcome<00:04:08.390> at

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
so we're very happy with the outcome at

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.660 
so we're very happy with the outcome at
this<00:04:08.959> point<00:04:09.200> I'm<00:04:09.530> ecstatic<00:04:09.830> you<00:04:10.340> know<00:04:10.430> this

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
this point I'm ecstatic you know this

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.370 
this point I'm ecstatic you know this
could<00:04:10.850> have<00:04:10.970> been<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.150> very<00:04:11.570> difficult<00:04:11.870> outcome

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
could have been a very difficult outcome

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.780
