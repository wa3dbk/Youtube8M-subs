reinforcement training through operant

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.410 
reinforcement training through operant
conditioning<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:08.420> do

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
conditioning and the way that we do

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
conditioning and the way that we do
behaviors<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.200> ask<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.040> something

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
behaviors that we ask we use something

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
behaviors that we ask we use something
called<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.790> target<00:01:12.180> goal<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.690> our

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
called that target goal this is our

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.410 
called that target goal this is our
target<00:01:13.170> polls<00:01:13.500> look<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:14.180> these<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.240> just

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
target polls look like these are just

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
target polls look like these are just
old<00:01:15.690> brake<00:01:15.960> handles<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:16.890> these<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
old brake handles and then these a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
old brake handles and then these a
little<00:01:17.430> bit<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.610> paper<00:01:17.790> towel<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.330> duct

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
tape to have to tape the end and make it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
tape to have to tape the end and make it
a<00:01:21.570> little<00:01:21.810> bit<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> soft<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.399> it<00:01:23.580> but

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
a little bit of a soft and to it but

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.740 
a little bit of a soft and to it but
you'll<00:01:24.300> see<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.899> bamboo<00:01:25.710> stakes<00:01:26.310> big<00:01:27.210> big

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you'll see a bamboo stakes big big

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.469 
you'll see a bamboo stakes big big
pieces<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.550> get<00:01:29.700> pretty<00:01:29.880> fancy<00:01:30.330> with

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
pieces and you can get pretty fancy with

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.850 
pieces and you can get pretty fancy with
them<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.899> want<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.649> pretty

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
them if you want to but this is pretty

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.150 
them if you want to but this is pretty
big<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.750> positive<00:01:33.960> reinforcement<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
big so for positive reinforcement the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.240 
big so for positive reinforcement the
way<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> works<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:36.539> an<00:01:36.690> elephant<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
way that it works with an elephant is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
way that it works with an elephant is
you<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.789> have<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> communicate

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you have to have a way to communicate

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.670 
you have to have a way to communicate
with<00:01:41.130> them<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.850> us<00:01:42.380> something<00:01:43.380> called<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
with them so for us something called a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.850 
with them so for us something called a
bridge<00:01:44.000> or<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> whistle<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.289> actually

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
bridge or a whistle so this is actually

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.719 
bridge or a whistle so this is actually
a<00:01:46.890> dog<00:01:47.190> whistle

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
a dog whistle

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.450 
a dog whistle
the<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.720> fish<00:01:48.960> aquarium<00:01:49.830> tubing<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the little fish aquarium tubing on the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.620 
the little fish aquarium tubing on the
end<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
end of it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.469 
end of it
and<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.050> it<00:01:52.170> makes<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:53.670> high-pitched<00:01:54.179> noise

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and so it makes this high-pitched noise

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.120 
and so it makes this high-pitched noise
so<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.940> not<00:01:56.940> area<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:58.289> is<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
so this is not area this is the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.940 
so this is not area this is the
communication<00:01:59.910> bridge<00:02:00.660> between<00:02:01.020> me

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
communication bridge between me

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.050 
communication bridge between me

year so just going to be my elephant
here

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
here

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.410 
here
if<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.220> was<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.550> ask<00:02:20.849> gosh<00:02:21.000> Burfoot

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
if I was going to ask gosh Burfoot

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.660 
if I was going to ask gosh Burfoot
behavior<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.110> first<00:02:22.800> need<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.040> teach<00:02:23.340> him<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
behavior I first need to teach him that

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.800 
behavior I first need to teach him that
whistle

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
whistle

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.020 
whistle
telling<00:02:25.500> him<00:02:25.650> yes<00:02:25.830> he's<00:02:26.340> gonna<00:02:26.520> get<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> treat

telling him yes he's gonna get a treat

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.540 
telling him yes he's gonna get a treat
so<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.569> would<00:02:27.959> touch<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.350> target<00:02:28.590> hole<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.400> his

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
so I would touch the target hole to his

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.170 
so I would touch the target hole to his
foot<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.780> then<00:02:31.380> 30<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:35.490> then<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.819> would

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
foot and then 30 and then I would

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:47.330 
foot and then 30 and then I would
continue<00:02:36.510> doing<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:45.770> would<00:02:46.770> do<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> would

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
continue doing that I would do I would

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.570 
continue doing that I would do I would
flip<00:02:47.730> elephants<00:02:48.239> are<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.750> intelligent<00:02:49.580> there

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
flip elephants are so intelligent there

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.120 
flip elephants are so intelligent there
are<00:02:51.300> good<00:02:51.900> trainers<00:02:52.380> but<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> elephants<00:02:53.069> are

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
are good trainers but the elephants are

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.520 
are good trainers but the elephants are
so<00:02:53.340> smart<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:53.910> do<00:02:53.970> make<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.360> easier<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.080> us

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
so smart they do make it easier on us

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.940 
so smart they do make it easier on us
so<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> would<00:02:56.640> lift<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.120> target<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.950> come

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
so I would lift the target just come

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.410 
so I would lift the target just come
into<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.489> lady's<00:02:59.910> left<00:03:00.090> leg<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.800> most<00:03:01.800> likely

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.580 

that<00:03:06.709> touching<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.890> end<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.580> is

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
that touching the end of this is

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.420 
that touching the end of this is
positive<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:10.800> they're<00:03:11.069> going<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:11.400> a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
positive because they're going to get a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.120 
positive because they're going to get a
treat<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:13.170> would<00:03:13.739> just<00:03:13.769> keep

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
treat for it so I would just keep

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.720 
treat for it so I would just keep
lifting<00:03:14.459> up

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.640 

little<00:03:18.730> by<00:03:18.879> little<00:03:18.909> until<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.659> got<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.260> desired

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
little by little until I got the desired

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.949 
little by little until I got the desired
behavior<00:03:20.829> which<00:03:21.519> was<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.420> foot<00:03:23.069> up<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.370> here

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
behavior which was a foot up to here

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.649 
behavior which was a foot up to here
lift<00:03:25.959> their<00:03:26.140> foot<00:03:26.319> up<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.519> it's<00:03:28.180> all<00:03:28.390> about

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
lift their foot up and it's all about

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.160 
lift their foot up and it's all about
the<00:03:29.370> reinforcements<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.760> timing<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.599> then

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
the reinforcements the timing and then

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.119 
the reinforcements the timing and then
also<00:03:32.470> about<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:35.079> elephants<00:03:35.620> with<00:03:35.769> target

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
also about the elephants with target

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.759 
also about the elephants with target
poles<00:03:36.340> move<00:03:36.579> toward<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.480> target<00:03:37.769> whereas

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
poles move toward the target whereas

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.619 
poles move toward the target whereas
when<00:03:38.920> you<00:03:39.010> see<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> bull<00:03:39.519> hook<00:03:39.730> that's<00:03:40.299> a

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
when you see a bull hook that's a

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.000 
when you see a bull hook that's a
negative<00:03:41.109> reinforcement

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
negative reinforcement

00:03:42.010 --> 00:04:19.249 
negative reinforcement
so<00:03:42.189> that's<00:03:42.400> they're<00:03:42.879> trained<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.150> move<00:03:43.540> away

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.350 

so<00:04:20.259> most<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.680> your<00:04:20.769> training<00:04:21.190> that<00:04:21.519> we<00:04:21.910> do<00:04:22.090> here

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
so most of your training that we do here

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.540 
so most of your training that we do here
is<00:04:22.569> for<00:04:22.900> medical<00:04:23.289> purposes<00:04:23.470> keepers<00:04:24.310> have

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
is for medical purposes keepers have

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.909 
is for medical purposes keepers have
such<00:04:24.789> a<00:04:24.819> close<00:04:25.449> relationship<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:26.380> elephants

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
such a close relationship of elephants

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.529 
such a close relationship of elephants
that<00:04:27.250> we<00:04:28.030> do<00:04:28.180> blood<00:04:28.479> draws<00:04:28.949> ultrasound<00:04:30.539> most

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
that we do blood draws ultrasound most

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.330 
that we do blood draws ultrasound most
us<00:04:31.870> because<00:04:32.259> we<00:04:32.440> work<00:04:32.620> with<00:04:32.800> them<00:04:32.949> every

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
us because we work with them every

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.710 
us because we work with them every
single<00:04:33.610> day<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:33.970> here<00:04:34.180> we<00:04:34.360> check<00:04:34.539> our

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
single day so here we check our

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.749 
single day so here we check our
elephants<00:04:35.110> feet<00:04:35.289> every<00:04:35.590> single<00:04:35.889> day<00:04:36.009> we<00:04:36.610> also

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
elephants feet every single day we also

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.850 
elephants feet every single day we also
give<00:04:37.090> them<00:04:37.270> baths<00:04:37.479> when<00:04:37.840> necessary<00:04:38.020> check

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
give them baths when necessary check

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.890 
give them baths when necessary check
their<00:04:39.039> tests<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.699> check<00:04:39.970> their<00:04:40.180> skin<00:04:40.509> and

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
their tests to check their skin and

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.559 
their tests to check their skin and
those<00:04:41.319> are<00:04:41.530> kind<00:04:41.919> of<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.160> big<00:04:42.310> ones<00:04:42.580> feet<00:04:43.120> skin

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
those are kind of the big ones feet skin

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.469 
those are kind of the big ones feet skin
processor<00:04:44.319> the<00:04:44.590> three<00:04:44.830> main<00:04:45.009> things<00:04:45.759> that<00:04:45.880> are

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
processor the three main things that are

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.330 
processor the three main things that are
really<00:04:46.780> important<00:04:47.259> for<00:04:47.289> elephant<00:04:48.009> husbandry

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
really important for elephant husbandry

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.360 
really important for elephant husbandry
and<00:04:48.460> care<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:50.169> then<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.919> know<00:04:51.009> there's<00:04:51.190> not

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
and care and then you know there's not

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.710 
and care and then you know there's not
only<00:04:51.520> medical<00:04:52.060> but<00:04:52.180> they're<00:04:52.330> also<00:04:52.479> the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
only medical but they're also the

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.779 
only medical but they're also the
enrichment<00:04:53.110> training<00:04:53.650> so<00:04:53.860> like<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.550> saw<00:04:54.759> I

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
enrichment training so like you saw I

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.820 
enrichment training so like you saw I
was<00:04:55.000> having<00:04:55.479> him<00:04:55.630> catch<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.050> target<00:04:56.409> Pole<00:04:56.590> and

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
was having him catch the target Pole and

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.469 
was having him catch the target Pole and
pick<00:04:57.039> up<00:04:57.190> objects<00:04:57.729> for<00:04:58.030> me

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
pick up objects for me

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.719 
pick up objects for me
not<00:04:59.080> kind<00:04:59.440> of<00:04:59.530> fun<00:04:59.800> stuff<00:05:00.159> and<00:05:00.340> there's<00:05:00.490> the

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
not kind of fun stuff and there's the

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.670 
not kind of fun stuff and there's the
ton<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.060> fun<00:05:01.389> behaviors<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.050> that's<00:05:02.470> really

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
ton of fun behaviors and that's really

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.110 
ton of fun behaviors and that's really
good<00:05:02.949> because<00:05:03.099> that's<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.610> lot<00:05:03.819> of<00:05:03.849> like

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
good because that's like a lot of like

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.360 
good because that's like a lot of like
stimulating<00:05:04.690> for<00:05:04.930> them<00:05:05.110> as<00:05:05.560> well<00:05:05.889> but<00:05:06.190> it's

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
stimulating for them as well but it's

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.100 
stimulating for them as well but it's
also<00:05:06.490> important<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.030> do<00:05:07.210> enrichment<00:05:07.840> training

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
also important to do enrichment training

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.499 
also important to do enrichment training
and<00:05:08.229> training<00:05:08.380> just<00:05:08.710> for<00:05:08.800> fun<00:05:09.099> not<00:05:09.509> something

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
and training just for fun not something

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.749 
and training just for fun not something
that's<00:05:10.630> medical<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:11.560> can<00:05:11.830> sometimes<00:05:12.250> be<00:05:12.460> a

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
that's medical and can sometimes be a

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.540 
that's medical and can sometimes be a
little<00:05:12.970> versus<00:05:13.750> when<00:05:14.289> you're<00:05:14.409> able<00:05:14.500> under<00:05:15.400> all

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
little versus when you're able under all

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.010 
little versus when you're able under all
go<00:05:15.729> but<00:05:16.210> all<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.509> stuff<00:05:16.750> they<00:05:16.990> are

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
go but all of that stuff they are

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.469 
go but all of that stuff they are
heavily<00:05:17.500> talking<00:05:18.340> with<00:05:18.430> me<00:05:18.520> very<00:05:18.669> unfortunate

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
heavily talking with me very unfortunate

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.279 
heavily talking with me very unfortunate
so<00:05:19.720> they<00:05:20.940> 99%<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:21.969> the<00:05:22.060> time<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.630> I<00:05:23.110> should

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
so they 99% of the time that I should

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.340 
so they 99% of the time that I should
say<00:05:23.500> with<00:05:23.680> us

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.410
