the Sun decided produced for C flares

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.030 
the Sun decided produced for C flares
they<00:00:30.720> almost<00:00:30.869> look<00:00:31.109> periodic<00:00:31.710> don't<00:00:31.920> they

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
they almost look periodic don't they

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280 
they almost look periodic don't they
they're<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:32.790> impulsive<00:00:33.120> events<00:00:33.750> which

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
they're very impulsive events which

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.780 
they're very impulsive events which
means<00:00:34.320> they're<00:00:34.680> associated<00:00:35.250> with<00:00:35.280> growth<00:00:35.550> of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
means they're associated with growth of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
means they're associated with growth of
a<00:00:35.880> region<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.899> region<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.260> we

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
a region and the region that we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.619 
a region and the region that we
associated<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.090> new<00:00:39.270> region

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that was the case also a bit later

ejection from the same region I have

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.799 
ejection from the same region I have
movies<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.500> all<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.680> those<00:00:52.770> later<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> let's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
movies of all of those later so let's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
movies of all of those later so let's
take<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> sunspot<00:00:55.680> picture<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
take a look at the sunspot picture and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.060 
take a look at the sunspot picture and
see<00:00:56.219> what's<00:00:56.370> been<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:57.410> region<00:00:58.410> 12<00:00:58.440> 43

they're listening to me perhaps they

keep<00:01:39.479> an<00:01:39.630> eye<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.990> area<00:01:40.350> too

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
keep an eye on that area too

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.020 
keep an eye on that area too
I<00:01:41.530> find<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.160> interesting<00:01:42.310> that<00:01:42.580> when<00:01:42.790> you<00:01:42.910> look

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
I find it interesting that when you look

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.030 
I find it interesting that when you look
at<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.330> movies<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.260> magnetic<00:01:44.680> field<00:01:44.890> and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
at the movies of the magnetic field and

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.880 
at the movies of the magnetic field and
sun<00:01:45.280> spots<00:01:45.550> but<00:01:46.480> just<00:01:46.660> a<00:01:46.720> few<00:01:46.750> days<00:01:47.050> ago<00:01:47.260> all

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
sun spots but just a few days ago all

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.350

the<00:01:48.130> regions<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.520> discs<00:01:48.760> were<00:01:48.970> decaying

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
the regions of the discs were decaying

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.050 
the regions of the discs were decaying
away<00:01:49.690> rapidly<00:01:49.980> and<00:01:50.980> now<00:01:51.160> we<00:01:51.220> have<00:01:51.370> multiple

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
away rapidly and now we have multiple

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.610 
away rapidly and now we have multiple
regions<00:01:52.450> both<00:01:52.990> in<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.230> northern<00:01:53.560> and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
regions both in the northern and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.990 
regions both in the northern and
southern<00:01:53.800> hemisphere<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.430> across<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.670> wide

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000

range of longitudes growing together

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.400

this<00:01:58.330> implies<00:01:58.570> some<00:01:58.900> sort<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.140> blower

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
this implies some sort of blower

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.260 
this implies some sort of blower

off of the West limb it also might be

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.140 
off of the West limb it also might be
worth<00:02:17.860> keeping<00:02:18.220> an<00:02:18.310> eye<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.640> province<00:02:19.000> in

worth keeping an eye on that province in

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.970 
worth keeping an eye on that province in

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
region 12 47 in the southeast you will

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.330 
region 12 47 in the southeast you will
see<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> dark<00:02:28.450> filament<00:02:28.960> sneaking<00:02:29.470> away<00:02:29.950> from

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
see a dark filament sneaking away from

see a dark filament sneaking away from
the<00:02:30.460> region<00:02:30.850> by<00:02:31.330> filming<00:02:31.660> starts<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.080> grow<00:02:32.320> and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
the region by filming starts to grow and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.970 
the region by filming starts to grow and
become<00:02:32.770> unstable<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.700> suddenly<00:02:34.450> lifts<00:02:34.690> off

become unstable and suddenly lifts off
it<00:02:35.980> very<00:02:36.190> much<00:02:36.310> reminds<00:02:36.730> me<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.240> huge

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
it very much reminds me of the huge

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.300 
it very much reminds me of the huge
event<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.960> we<00:02:38.050> saw<00:02:38.290> on<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.620> west<00:02:38.800> limb<00:02:39.070> on

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
event that we saw on the west limb on

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.150 
event that we saw on the west limb on
june<00:02:40.120> seventh<00:02:40.600> but<00:02:41.530> only<00:02:41.740> seen<00:02:41.920> from<00:02:42.040> above

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
june seventh but only seen from above

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.300 
june seventh but only seen from above
rather<00:02:42.580> than<00:02:42.760> from<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.060> side

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.850 

next<00:02:47.060> there's<00:02:47.209> been<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> spectacular

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
next there's been a spectacular

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.610 
next there's been a spectacular
prominence<00:02:48.860> eruption<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.640> west<00:02:50.360> limb<00:02:50.660> it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
prominence eruption on the west limb it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.410 
prominence eruption on the west limb it
looks<00:02:51.800> as<00:02:51.890> though<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.099> activity<00:02:52.550> starts

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
looks as though the activity starts

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.300 
looks as though the activity starts
behind<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.900> west<00:02:54.080> limb<00:02:54.319> which<00:02:54.950> means<00:02:55.160> it's

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
behind the west limb which means it's

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.780 
behind the west limb which means it's
probably<00:02:55.370> associated<00:02:55.819> with<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.420> region<00:02:56.650> 1244

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
probably associated with the region 1244

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.610 
probably associated with the region 1244
this<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.940> an<00:02:59.030> absolutely<00:02:59.450> spectacular<00:02:59.720> event

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
this is an absolutely spectacular event

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.120 
this is an absolutely spectacular event
look<00:03:01.220> at<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.489> contorted<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.390> distorted
