of your hair with the little white tip

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.840 
of your hair with the little white tip
because<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.300> pulling<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.690> out<00:02:22.810> by<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.020> root

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
so I choose wigs with bangs because I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.680 
so I choose wigs with bangs because I
have<00:02:27.010> those<00:02:27.250> two<00:02:27.580> caps<00:02:27.820> aligned<00:02:28.150> under<00:02:28.270> here
