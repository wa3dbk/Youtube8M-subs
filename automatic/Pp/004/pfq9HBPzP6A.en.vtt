options that are new though new options

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.110 
options that are new though new options
basically<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:58.100> thermal<00:00:59.100> rolls<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.670> I

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
basically I have thermal rolls that I

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
basically I have thermal rolls that I
kind<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.660> disregarded<00:01:01.320> using<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
kind of just disregarded using in the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.179 
kind of just disregarded using in the
past<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:03.019> figured<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.199> could<00:01:04.500> actually<00:01:04.830> sell

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
past but I figured I could actually sell

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
past but I figured I could actually sell
them<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> bulk<00:01:06.090> whole<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
them as a bulk whole so if you want to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.310 
them as a bulk whole so if you want to
get<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.409> full<00:01:07.860> roll<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.280> stickers<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:10.140> has

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
get a full roll of stickers that has

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.980 
get a full roll of stickers that has
like<00:01:11.040> adjust<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.000> design<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> it's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
like adjust your design on it and it's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.740 
like adjust your design on it and it's
rolled<00:01:13.439> back<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.420> way<00:01:15.540> they're

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
rolled back up because the way they're

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
rolled back up because the way they're
rolled<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.590> inefficient<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.520> me<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
rolled is pretty inefficient for me to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.340 
rolled is pretty inefficient for me to
actually<00:01:17.850> print<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.630> compared<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
actually print on now compared to the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
actually print on now compared to the
fan<00:01:19.619> fold<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.360> being<00:01:21.509> said<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.900> want

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
fan fold so that being said if you want

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.899 
fan fold so that being said if you want
to<00:01:22.740> buy<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> full<00:01:23.250> roll<00:01:23.460> those<00:01:23.670> will<00:01:23.820> be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to buy a full roll those will be

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.210 
to buy a full roll those will be
available<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.509> they're<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.229> lot<00:01:25.409> cheaper<00:01:25.680> as

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
available and they're a lot cheaper as

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.249 
available and they're a lot cheaper as
it's<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:27.119> straight<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.780> print<00:01:28.140> your

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it's just straight up I print your

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's just straight up I print your
design<00:01:28.350> straight<00:01:29.009> through<00:01:29.220> re-roll<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
design straight through re-roll them and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.910 
design straight through re-roll them and
that<00:01:30.960> isn't<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that isn't what it is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.240 
that isn't what it is
so<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.939> also<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.600> other<00:01:33.720> options<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.799> 3<00:01:35.130> by

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so I also have my other options the 3 by

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.770 
so I also have my other options the 3 by

4 and 4 by 6 are the ones that will be

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.990 
4 and 4 by 6 are the ones that will be
cut<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.380> 4<00:01:37.560> by<00:01:37.710> 8<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.040> 4<00:01:38.189> by<00:01:38.310> 6<00:01:38.640> they'll
