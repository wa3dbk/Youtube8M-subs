00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
what's up internet Sean Hines here you

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.539 
what's up internet Sean Hines here you
can<00:00:02.700> call<00:00:02.850> me<00:00:02.909> speed<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.740> today<00:00:04.740> we're<00:00:05.520> going

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
can call me speed and today we're going

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.560 
can call me speed and today we're going
to<00:00:05.819> do<00:00:06.060> something<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.410> find<00:00:07.830> really

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
to do something that I find really

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.640 
to do something that I find really
hilarious<00:00:09.570> because<00:00:10.550> basically<00:00:11.550> bungee<00:00:12.650> in

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
hilarious because basically bungee in

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.760 
hilarious because basically bungee in
their<00:00:14.519> wisdom<00:00:14.990> decided<00:00:15.990> they<00:00:16.320> were<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.650> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
their wisdom decided they were going to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.029 
their wisdom decided they were going to
cut<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:18.029> exploits<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> crotas<00:00:19.830> end'

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
cut the exploits out of the crotas end'

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.920 
cut the exploits out of the crotas end'
raid<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.910> game<00:00:21.090> destiny<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:23.359> they<00:00:24.359> almost

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
raid in the game destiny and they almost

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.029 
raid in the game destiny and they almost
succeeded<00:00:25.410> i<00:00:26.039> guess<00:00:26.279> because<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:28.619> way<00:00:28.830> we

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
succeeded i guess because the way we

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.350 
succeeded i guess because the way we
used<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.429> choose<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.970> raid<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:32.360> basically

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
used to choose the raid was basically

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.190 
used to choose the raid was basically
rendered<00:00:33.930> impossible<00:00:34.880> but<00:00:35.880> literally<00:00:36.750> it's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
rendered impossible but literally it's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.020 
rendered impossible but literally it's
been<00:00:38.690> 12<00:00:39.690> no<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.469> guess<00:00:40.739> 24<00:00:41.190> hours<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.820> been<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
been 12 no I guess 24 hours it's been a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.360 
been 12 no I guess 24 hours it's been a
day<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.690> day<00:00:43.110> since<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.789> patch<00:00:45.329> hit<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
day a day since the patch hit and

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.650 
day a day since the patch hit and
already<00:00:48.170> we've<00:00:49.170> figured<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.739> how<00:00:50.070> did<00:00:50.280> she<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
already we've figured out how did she is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.939 
already we've figured out how did she is
pretty<00:00:51.660> much<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> same<00:00:52.500> place<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.920> were

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
pretty much up to the same place we were

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.209 
pretty much up to the same place we were
before<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.980> I'm

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
before so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
before so what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna<00:00:56.550> try<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
gonna try and do this right now for you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.590 
gonna try and do this right now for you
guys<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.730> attempted<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.270> yet<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.539> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
guys I have not attempted it yet but I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920 
guys I have not attempted it yet but I
watched<00:01:00.870> somebody<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.930> pretty

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
watched somebody do it and it's pretty

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.910 
watched somebody do it and it's pretty
much<00:01:05.540> yeah<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.750> mean<00:01:06.930> we'll<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.740> pretty

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
much yeah I mean we'll see it's pretty

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.730 
much yeah I mean we'll see it's pretty
much<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.460> before<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.740> basically

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
much the way it was before so basically

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.640 
much the way it was before so basically
I<00:01:10.920> am<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.909> pit<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> first<00:01:13.200> area

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I am in the pit which is the first area

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.170 
I am in the pit which is the first area
of<00:01:13.950> crotas<00:01:14.430> end<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.960> I<00:01:15.960> am<00:01:16.290> running<00:01:17.180> from

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
of crotas end and I am running from

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
of crotas end and I am running from
deacon<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.840> Cano<00:01:19.200> exploding<00:01:19.799> guy<00:01:19.890> probably

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
deacon to be Cano exploding guy probably

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.210 
deacon to be Cano exploding guy probably
gonna<00:01:20.310> die<00:01:21.290> see<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> trick<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.890> beacon

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
gonna die see the trick with this beacon

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.530 
gonna die see the trick with this beacon
run<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:25.200> want<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> hope<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.650> there's<00:01:25.979> no

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
run is you want to hope that there's no

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.660 
run is you want to hope that there's no
explosive<00:01:27.540> thralls<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.259> appear<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.400> run

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
explosive thralls that appear as you run

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.770 
explosive thralls that appear as you run
from<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.329> beacon<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> second<00:01:32.150> now<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
from one beacon to the second now at the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780 
from one beacon to the second now at the
second<00:01:34.170> beacon<00:01:34.350> normally<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.430> would<00:01:35.549> jump<00:01:35.729> on

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
second beacon normally you would jump on

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
second beacon normally you would jump on
top<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.240> rock<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.750> wait<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> beacon

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
top of this rock and wait for the beacon

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.350 
top of this rock and wait for the beacon
to<00:01:37.890> explode<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> physics<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:39.119> push

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to explode and the physics would push

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
to explode and the physics would push
you<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:40.500> onto<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> upper<00:01:41.310> level<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.000> pit

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
you up onto the upper level of the pit

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.569 
you up onto the upper level of the pit
well<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.649> took<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> physics<00:01:44.310> off<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
well they took the physics off the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.370 
well they took the physics off the
beacons<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.659> you're<00:01:45.810> standing<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.229> one

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
beacons now so if you're standing on one

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.090 
beacons now so if you're standing on one
is<00:01:46.560> explodes<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.579> will<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.030> kill<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
is explodes it will just kill you but it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.260 
is explodes it will just kill you but it
doesn't<00:01:50.369> seem<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> matter<00:01:50.759> anymore<00:01:50.939> because

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
doesn't seem to matter anymore because

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.980 
doesn't seem to matter anymore because
you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.869> actually<00:01:52.110> double<00:01:52.740> jump<00:01:53.780> from<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you can actually double jump from this

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.530 
you can actually double jump from this
rock<00:01:55.290> oh<00:01:55.500> snap<00:01:55.829> almost<00:01:56.430> had<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.640> come<00:01:57.360> on

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
rock oh snap almost had it come on

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.780 
rock oh snap almost had it come on
see<00:01:59.110> if<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.290> can<00:01:59.440> make<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.650> Oh<00:02:01.860> stay<00:02:02.860> alive<00:02:03.160> all

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
see if I can make it Oh stay alive all

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:13.940 
see if I can make it Oh stay alive all
right<00:02:04.030> we're<00:02:04.210> good<00:02:04.420> all<00:02:05.170> right<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.700> now<00:02:10.110> oh

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.990 

there's<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.070> many<00:02:15.480> hmm<00:02:16.480> oh<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:19.300> didn't<00:02:19.810> let<00:02:19.960> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
there's so many hmm oh I didn't let the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
there's so many hmm oh I didn't let the
darkness<00:02:22.000> get<00:02:22.330> off<00:02:22.420> me<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.630> might<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:22.930> taken

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
darkness get off me I might have taken

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.130 
darkness get off me I might have taken
just<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.320> little<00:02:23.500> too<00:02:23.590> long<00:02:23.770> on<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.950> beacon<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
just a little too long on the beacon the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.310 
just a little too long on the beacon the
trick<00:02:26.410> with<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> beacons<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.190> your

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
trick with the beacons is your

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.660 
trick with the beacons is your
encumbered<00:02:29.320> by<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.590> weight<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.370> darkness

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
encumbered by the weight of the darkness

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.120 
encumbered by the weight of the darkness
and<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:32.080> limits<00:02:32.500> how<00:02:32.620> high<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.860> can<00:02:33.070> jump

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
and that limits how high you can jump

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.190 
and that limits how high you can jump
and<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:34.180> probably<00:02:34.420> didn't<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.810> my<00:02:34.930> double

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
and I probably didn't have my double

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.230 
and I probably didn't have my double
jump<00:02:35.380> yet<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.459> beacon<00:02:36.730> was<00:02:36.970> about<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
jump yet but that beacon was about to

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.730 
jump yet but that beacon was about to
blow<00:02:37.450> up<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.959> all<00:02:38.590> right<00:02:38.740> do<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.670> again<00:02:43.740> sorry

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
blow up so all right do this again sorry

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.490 
blow up so all right do this again sorry
for<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.040> multiple<00:02:45.130> attempts<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.120> not

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
for the multiple attempts it's just not

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.620 
for the multiple attempts it's just not
the<00:02:47.500> easiest<00:02:48.160> way<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:50.850> completing<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:52.090> task<00:02:52.270> all

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
the easiest way of completing a task all

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.380 
the easiest way of completing a task all
right<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> weight<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.170> darkness<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.620> off<00:02:57.390> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
right the weight of darkness is off and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.449 
right the weight of darkness is off and
we're<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:58.989> we<00:02:59.709> made<00:02:59.890> it<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.160> edge<00:03:00.280> I

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
we're there we made it to the edge I

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.740 
we're there we made it to the edge I
can't<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.239> cannot<00:03:02.080> believe<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:03.239> can<00:03:04.239> still<00:03:04.540> do

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
can't I cannot believe I can still do

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.930 
can't I cannot believe I can still do
this<00:03:04.989> it's<00:03:05.290> crazy<00:03:05.709> bungee<00:03:06.430> crazy<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.420> right

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
this it's crazy bungee crazy all right

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.060 
this it's crazy bungee crazy all right
so<00:03:09.940> from<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:11.140> cheese<00:03:11.410> behaves<00:03:11.830> about

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
so from here this cheese behaves about

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.789 
so from here this cheese behaves about
the<00:03:12.190> same<00:03:12.370> way<00:03:12.720> what<00:03:13.720> I'm<00:03:13.780> going<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.930> do<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.260> I'm

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
the same way what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.160 
the same way what I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:03:14.920> going<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.130> follow<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.549> ledge<00:03:15.989> all<00:03:16.989> the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
just going to follow this ledge all the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.830 
just going to follow this ledge all the
way<00:03:17.290> around<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:20.310> I'll<00:03:21.310> basically<00:03:22.180> walk<00:03:22.420> up<00:03:22.630> to

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
way around and I'll basically walk up to

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.020 
way around and I'll basically walk up to
this<00:03:22.989> new<00:03:23.290> beacon<00:03:23.560> that's<00:03:23.950> it's<00:03:24.580> all<00:03:24.730> fresh

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
this new beacon that's it's all fresh

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.100 
this new beacon that's it's all fresh
shining<00:03:26.190> explodey<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:28.239> let<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.570> take<00:03:28.810> my<00:03:28.959> way

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
shining explodey and let it take my way

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.840 
shining explodey and let it take my way
to<00:03:29.170> darkness<00:03:29.500> off

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.480 

I'm<00:03:33.780> doing<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.230> with<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> level<00:03:34.740> 31<00:03:35.160> right<00:03:35.310> now

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
I'm doing this with a level 31 right now

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.040 
I'm doing this with a level 31 right now
but<00:03:35.970> theoretically<00:03:36.480> with<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.900> way<00:03:36.960> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
but theoretically with the way the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.320 
but theoretically with the way the
cheese<00:03:37.260> works<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.980> part<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.520> could<00:03:38.790> be<00:03:38.910> did<00:03:39.060> I

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
cheese works this part I could be did I

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.550 
cheese works this part I could be did I
could<00:03:39.870> probably<00:03:40.080> do<00:03:40.290> with<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.970> 28-27<00:03:41.970> even<00:03:42.560> you

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
could probably do with a 28-27 even you

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.810 
could probably do with a 28-27 even you
really<00:03:43.830> only<00:03:43.950> need<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.280> able<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.490> kill<00:03:44.640> one

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
really only need to be able to kill one

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.290 
really only need to be able to kill one
thing<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.500> have<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.800> right<00:03:46.920> guns

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
thing and if you have the right guns

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.160 
thing and if you have the right guns
it's<00:03:48.300> not<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.540> big<00:03:48.870> problem<00:03:49.220> all<00:03:50.220> right<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.670> I'm

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
it's not a big problem all right so I'm

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.390 
it's not a big problem all right so I'm
crouched<00:03:52.170> down<00:03:52.320> because<00:03:52.740> there's<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:53.010> night<00:03:53.220> up

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
crouched down because there's a night up

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.280 
crouched down because there's a night up
there<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.820> don't<00:03:54.180> really<00:03:54.360> need<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.720> kill<00:03:54.960> him<00:03:55.170> I

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
there I don't really need to kill him I

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.630 
there I don't really need to kill him I
just<00:03:55.320> need<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.680> get<00:03:55.770> this<00:03:55.950> weight<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.280> darkness

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
just need to get this weight of darkness

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.010 
just need to get this weight of darkness
off<00:03:56.790> me<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.030> can<00:03:57.150> see<00:03:57.270> it<00:03:57.360> ticking<00:03:57.660> down<00:03:57.840> there

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
off me you can see it ticking down there

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.270 
off me you can see it ticking down there
on<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.200> left<00:03:58.410> side<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.940> once<00:04:00.150> we<00:04:00.300> get<00:04:00.420> down

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
on the left side so once we get down

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.170 
on the left side so once we get down
basically<00:04:02.280> 22<00:04:03.320> all<00:04:04.320> right<00:04:04.820> i'm<00:04:05.820> just<00:04:05.880> going<00:04:06.120> to

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
basically 22 all right i'm just going to

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.070 
basically 22 all right i'm just going to
run<00:04:06.390> past<00:04:06.600> this<00:04:06.900> night<00:04:11.480> don't<00:04:12.480> fall<00:04:12.750> into<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
run past this night don't fall into the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.690 
run past this night don't fall into the
pits<00:04:13.350> that's<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.800> other<00:04:13.920> thing<00:04:14.070> about<00:04:14.250> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
pits that's the other thing about the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.300 
pits that's the other thing about the
pit<00:04:14.940> are<00:04:15.150> there<00:04:16.050> are<00:04:16.200> these<00:04:16.320> pits<00:04:16.680> everywhere

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
pit are there are these pits everywhere

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.000 
pit are there are these pits everywhere
and<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:17.970> keep<00:04:18.930> following<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.530> left<00:04:19.739> side

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
and just keep following the left side

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.040 
and just keep following the left side
and<00:04:20.310> that's<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.390> man<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:23.600> what<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:24.630> just

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
and that's it man so what I just

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.040 
and that's it man so what I just
circumvented<00:04:25.770> was<00:04:25.950> probably<00:04:26.430> oh<00:04:27.090> there's

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
circumvented was probably oh there's

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.840 
circumvented was probably oh there's
another<00:04:28.170> pit<00:04:28.530> ah<00:04:29.630> no<00:04:30.630> probably<00:04:31.440> like<00:04:31.760> 20<00:04:32.760> of

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
another pit ah no probably like 20 of

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.840 
another pit ah no probably like 20 of
these<00:04:32.940> lanterns<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:34.250> basically<00:04:35.250> me<00:04:35.490> having

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
these lanterns and basically me having

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.120 
these lanterns and basically me having
to<00:04:35.880> run<00:04:36.240> Lantern<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.350> Lantern<00:04:37.770> while<00:04:37.950> being

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
to run Lantern to Lantern while being

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.510 
to run Lantern to Lantern while being
chased<00:04:38.220> by<00:04:38.760> crazy<00:04:39.300> thralls<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:43.250> where<00:04:44.250> we<00:04:44.400> are

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
chased by crazy thralls and where we are

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.760 
chased by crazy thralls and where we are
now<00:04:44.700> is<00:04:44.730> basically<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.750> bridge<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.590> that

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
now is basically a bridge to that

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.910 
now is basically a bridge to that
hallway<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:48.060> can't<00:04:48.270> really<00:04:48.420> see<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:48.890> you<00:04:49.890> will

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
hallway you can't really see it you will

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.980
