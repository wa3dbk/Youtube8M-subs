00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that and that's just a little bit of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.440 
that and that's just a little bit of
inspiration<00:01:43.909> if<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.090> how<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> work

my city and in real life has a sitting
area<00:03:32.660> like<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.350> decided<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.770> put<00:03:34.070> one

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
area like this so I decided to put one

area like this so I decided to put one
in<00:03:34.340> here<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.790> think<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.780> looks<00:03:35.870> pretty<00:03:36.140> nice

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
in here and I think it looks pretty nice

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.570 
in here and I think it looks pretty nice
so<00:03:37.100> we<00:03:37.460> use<00:03:37.580> stone<00:03:37.850> brick<00:03:38.120> for<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.330> ground<00:03:39.580> and

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
so we use stone brick for the ground and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.830 
so we use stone brick for the ground and
we<00:03:40.700> built<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.000> before<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.390> texture<00:03:41.660> pack

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
we built this before the texture pack

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.090 
we built this before the texture pack
came<00:03:42.050> out<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:43.209> it's<00:03:44.209> pretty<00:03:44.330> cool<00:03:44.630> okay<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.070> I

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
came out so it's pretty cool okay so I

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.230 
came out so it's pretty cool okay so I
think<00:03:46.220> that's<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.580> end<00:03:46.670> of<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.850> video<00:03:47.030> so
