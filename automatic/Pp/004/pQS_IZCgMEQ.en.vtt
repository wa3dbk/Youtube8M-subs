 finals day at this year's k &amp; k cup and 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.940
 that meant once again full house in the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.429
 Hallein Münsterland nearly 2,500 spectators 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.259
 feverishly praised the great price of Münster 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.560
 against a jumping competition of the class 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.480
 s with four stars and they had it too 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 this time in parcours chef hans 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.949
 Saddler had horses and riders again 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 once put to a tough test 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.779
 conditioned by the hall tightly moored 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.029
 course with a time of 65 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.029
 Seconds that was a challenge 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 the first of these was mastered 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.579
 Johann Ehning of riding and driving club 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.710
 borken on quintana roo ehning steered 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.910
 with his nine-year gelding 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.829
 purposeful and clean by the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.829
 parcours the first zero round ever 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.920
 in addition in the allowed time of 65 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.920
 seconds 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.950
 yes and then nothing came for a long time 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 either the riders stayed and either 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.360
 riders in time then had 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.250
 at least four penalty points or you 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.890
 came with zero errors in the goal then 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.890
 but prevented the time a sting 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.539
 here's an example in the parcours lars 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.270
 bak andersen the danish master of 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.850
 2013 was with his 10-year-old stallion 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.859
 acardo on a zero round and still 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.759
 really fast on the way but at the end 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:36.420
 65 65 seconds standing on the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.849
 Clock 500 will be eternal and that was called 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.899
 for others, a quarter penalty points 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:44.569
 there was still no sting 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.859
 this was to be replaced by hendrik 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.590
 enable his nine-year-old gelding 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.149
 Lufthansa made his name all honor 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.640
 took all obstacles with ease 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.579
 a super round zero penalty in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.579
 a time of 61 92 seconds 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.470
 But dear spectators, I anticipate it 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.780
 it did not stay with two participants in the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.170
 sting still six whole pairs came 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.150
 and an Amazon was katrin 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.990
 Eckermann on her 10-year-old stallion 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.420
 first floor zero penalty 63 41 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.130
 Seconds that's enough for one 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.280
 second occurs in the hall 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.280
 münsterland 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.849
 in the sting awaited the eight participants 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.650
 a shortened parcours 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.810
 here it was just to stay without mistakes 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.480
 and of course really fast 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.799
 get through and start again 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.489
 johannes ehning zero penalty 38 56 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.290
 seconds 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.689
 The rest had to do that 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.480
 let participants measure and do that 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.010
 she first nisse Lüneburg the boy 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.530
 rider on his eleven-year gelding 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.439
 west bridge also 0 in the sting 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.439
 much faster than Johann Ehning 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.190
 tension rose and now was katrin 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.190
 Eckermann in the row 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.310
 and what came now was dear spectator 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.580
 an absolute madness step eckermann 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.080
 swept without brake through the parcours 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.100
 breakneck fast and in the end too 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.470
 successful zero error 34.63 seconds 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.670
 for the time being, that meant just one 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.480
 two seconds ago 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.480
 Lüneburg 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.280
 only two couples could eckermann 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.190
 to dispute the victory was one 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.709
 Toni haßmann he too clean and good 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.840
 on the way at the time of eckermann 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.920
 you hate the teeth from the end 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.780
 stood a zero defect ride but also 38 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.790
 22 seconds ago, three were in contention 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.950
 for toni haßmann the decision was 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.230
 fallen as hans thorben brothers on 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.220
 hollander allowed a mistake here 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.139
 that was clear 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.010
 katrin eckermann wins first woman 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.850
 since 1926 the big prize at the kk cup 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.850
 in Munster 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.690
 Of course, first of all, dear 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.099
 first woman am and especially here in 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.050
 to win Münster at home 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.250
 to have the whole audience behind a 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.960
 is something special 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.090
 Of course Kathrin saw that but that was 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.009
 really fast I had with 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.840
 which they already completed clearly in the 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.310
 in advance you wanted to try that already 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.259
 also to win but we have 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.210
 my missing now no chance against 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.069
 Katharina went to ride and as well as in the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.780
 third place super satisfied 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.460
 then in stinging you have one 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.490
 That was really good time presented 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.620
 already more than breakneck yes goes 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.509
 you just go from zero to one hundred 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.310
 full risk or how are you there 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.979
 So, go in there already 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.750
 Survey I had a bit more 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.449
 respectful of toni and especially fans 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.690
 thorben rüder and in the end it is 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.690
 I succeeded
