white<00:02:56.690> red<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.410> white<00:02:57.620> means<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.950> increased

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
white red and white means I increased

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.120 
white red and white means I increased
view<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.180> if<00:02:59.990> you<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.560> flash

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
view and if you just in a flash

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.490 
view and if you just in a flash
that<00:03:01.280> means<00:03:01.460> they<00:03:01.580> went<00:03:01.760> into<00:03:01.880> memory<00:03:02.500> every

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
that means they went into memory every

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.750 
that means they went into memory every
three<00:03:03.710> seconds<00:03:04.130> they<00:03:04.220> will<00:03:04.370> go<00:03:04.490> into<00:03:04.610> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
three seconds they will go into the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.200 
three seconds they will go into the
memory<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:05.930> keep<00:03:06.200> adding<00:03:06.620> field<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:08.030> red

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
memory so I keep adding field the red

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.690 
memory so I keep adding field the red
LED<00:03:08.540> will<00:03:08.570> just<00:03:08.840> get<00:03:08.930> brighter<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.320> brighter

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
LED will just get brighter and brighter

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.670 
LED will just get brighter and brighter
okay<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.780> now<00:03:11.930> I'm<00:03:12.020> going<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.230> set<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.470> back<00:03:12.560> to

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
okay so now I'm going to set it back to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.280 
okay so now I'm going to set it back to
default<00:03:12.860> mode<00:03:13.280> since<00:03:14.260> my<00:03:15.260> p<00:03:15.320> SS<00:03:16.120> 125<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:18.020> all

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290

stock just an air filter in a CVT kid

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.170 
stock just an air filter in a CVT kid
okay<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.890> let's<00:03:25.130> go<00:03:25.460> ahead<00:03:25.490> and<00:03:25.760> start<00:03:26.060> to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
okay so let's go ahead and start to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.020 
okay so let's go ahead and start to
scooter

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.370 

okay<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:33.560> we're<00:03:33.860> in<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.100> mold<00:03:34.400> one<00:03:35.230> title<00:03:36.230> to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
okay so we're in the mold one title to

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.600 
okay so we're in the mold one title to
7000rpm<00:03:37.990> what<00:03:38.990> I'll<00:03:39.140> do<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.740> I<00:03:40.010> will<00:03:40.040> increase

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
7000rpm what I'll do is I will increase

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.770 
7000rpm what I'll do is I will increase
view<00:03:40.910> since<00:03:41.300> it's<00:03:41.630> easy<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:42.050> see<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.410> red<00:03:42.590> LED

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
view since it's easy to see the red LED

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.470 
view since it's easy to see the red LED
so<00:03:44.780> there<00:03:45.020> I<00:03:45.260> just<00:03:45.380> increased<00:03:45.920> view<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:47.450> just

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
so there I just increased view it just

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.500 
so there I just increased view it just
flash<00:03:47.930> red<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.470> means<00:03:48.500> I'm<00:03:48.739> going<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.980> memory

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
flash red that means I'm going to memory

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.960 
flash red that means I'm going to memory
so<00:03:50.510> now<00:03:50.690> it's<00:03:50.959> on<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.459> added<00:03:52.760> fuel

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
so now it's on the it just added fuel

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.870 
so now it's on the it just added fuel
into<00:03:53.300> this<00:03:53.709> programming<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.489> I'll<00:03:55.580> just<00:03:55.730> keep

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
into this programming so I'll just keep

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.050 
into this programming so I'll just keep
adding<00:03:56.090> for<00:03:56.330> you<00:03:56.390> again<00:03:56.690> 1<00:03:56.959> 2<00:03:57.200> 3<00:03:57.440> 4<00:03:57.860> or<00:03:57.950> 5<00:03:58.030> 3<00:03:59.030> 3

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
seconds 1 2 3 going to memory you can

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.600 
seconds 1 2 3 going to memory you can
hear<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.640> sudden<00:04:04.640> drop<00:04:05.269> in<00:04:05.300> rpm<00:04:05.959> now<00:04:06.519> we're<00:04:07.519> just

fuel<00:05:30.259> mixture<00:05:30.740> mode<00:05:31.490> I<00:05:31.759> press<00:05:32.150> M<00:05:32.449> for<00:05:32.870> mode<00:05:34.270> now

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
fuel mixture mode I press M for mode now

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.029 
fuel mixture mode I press M for mode now
this<00:05:35.539> is<00:05:35.629> the<00:05:35.719> air<00:05:35.870> fuel<00:05:36.080> mixture<00:05:36.169> mode<00:05:36.680> how

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
this is the air fuel mixture mode how

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.309 
this is the air fuel mixture mode how
you<00:05:37.099> can<00:05:37.339> tell<00:05:37.580> is<00:05:37.879> right<00:05:38.330> now<00:05:38.509> is<00:05:38.719> just<00:05:38.990> read

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
you can tell is right now is just read

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:45.680 
you can tell is right now is just read
meaning<00:05:40.099> is<00:05:40.370> rich

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.660 

see<00:05:46.200> when<00:05:46.320> I<00:05:46.350> let<00:05:46.560> go<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.710> gas<00:05:46.980> it<00:05:47.340> just

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
see when I let go the gas it just

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.960 
see when I let go the gas it just
dropped<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.270> Blue<00:05:48.980> means<00:05:49.980> lean<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.670> then<00:05:50.760> what

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
dropped to Blue means lean and then what

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.880 
dropped to Blue means lean and then what
is<00:05:51.120> perfect<00:05:51.540> and<00:05:51.660> now<00:05:51.780> back<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.050> red<00:05:52.380> right<00:05:52.740> now

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
is perfect and now back to red right now

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.620 
is perfect and now back to red right now
it's<00:05:53.040> red<00:05:53.250> it's<00:05:53.940> rich

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.720 

that's<00:05:58.290> how<00:05:58.380> you<00:05:58.440> can<00:05:58.620> tell<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:59.340> air/fuel

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
that's how you can tell the air/fuel

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:05.830 
that's how you can tell the air/fuel
mixture<00:06:00.030> move

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.650 

okay<00:06:06.410> this<00:06:07.040> is<00:06:07.160> to<00:06:07.310> help<00:06:07.490> you<00:06:07.610> tune<00:06:07.940> when

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
okay this is to help you tune when

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.960 
okay this is to help you tune when
you're<00:06:08.780> tuning<00:06:09.020> for<00:06:09.350> top<00:06:09.560> speed<00:06:09.889> you<00:06:10.699> should

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
you're tuning for top speed you should

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.920 
you're tuning for top speed you should
only<00:06:11.150> mostly<00:06:12.139> use<00:06:12.350> it<00:06:12.380> if<00:06:12.830> you're<00:06:13.479> 7,000<00:06:14.479> rpms

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
only mostly use it if you're 7,000 rpms

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.960 
only mostly use it if you're 7,000 rpms
and<00:06:15.110> higher<00:06:15.820> to<00:06:16.820> 7,000<00:06:17.540> rpms<00:06:18.669> it<00:06:19.669> doesn't

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
and higher to 7,000 rpms it doesn't

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.090 
and higher to 7,000 rpms it doesn't
really<00:06:20.060> do<00:06:20.330> much<00:06:20.540> it<00:06:21.169> just<00:06:21.290> tells<00:06:21.590> you<00:06:21.770> what's

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
really do much it just tells you what's

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.280 
really do much it just tells you what's
going<00:06:22.340> on<00:06:22.460> if<00:06:22.610> it's<00:06:22.760> functioning<00:06:23.240> properly

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
going on if it's functioning properly

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.390 
going on if it's functioning properly
but<00:06:24.290> it<00:06:24.380> shouldn't<00:06:24.650> be<00:06:24.680> used<00:06:24.949> as<00:06:25.130> a<00:06:25.930> pudding<00:06:26.930> -

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
but it shouldn't be used as a pudding -

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.780 
but it shouldn't be used as a pudding -
okay<00:06:28.400> so<00:06:29.180> now<00:06:29.330> let's<00:06:29.570> go<00:06:29.660> down<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.520> the<00:06:31.520> next

okay so now let's go down to the next
mode<00:06:32.650> okay<00:06:37.540> five<00:06:38.540> percent<00:06:38.990> which<00:06:39.530> it

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
mode okay five percent which it

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.629 
mode okay five percent which it
shouldn't<00:06:40.700> be<00:06:40.970> because<00:06:41.150> my<00:06:41.630> pike<00:06:41.870> is<00:06:42.020> stuck<00:06:42.639> so

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
shouldn't be because my pike is stuck so
