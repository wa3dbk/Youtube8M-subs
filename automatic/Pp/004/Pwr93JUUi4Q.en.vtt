00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.550
 today is April 20 and this video is about collecting 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.270
 birch sap 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.390
 maple syrup and walnut juice Mozyr 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.369
 playing on now without and birch many 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.160
 mistakenly believe that the juice is running deck 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.400
 tree empirically I'm angry at what it is 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.739
 not during sap flow with Ukraine 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.410
 wood and the more charming 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.070
 the fibers you cross the more intense 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.830
 there will be a drop of juice from the hole find 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.540
 naturalists including reimers 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.520
 recommends and even adjusts after 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.680
 collecting juice 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.070
 infect the wound with potassium permanganate or even 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.630
 to seal the acting garden 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.070
 obviously this excessive action since 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.090
 woody sap itself is 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.059
 antiseptics 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.620
 this statement is confirmed by experienced 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.390
 by those who takes the breeding oyster 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.149
 know that on a woody substrate 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.600
 harvested sap flow collection time 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.670
 mushrooms do not survive it noticed yet 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 our ancestors and therefore harvested 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.679
 birch for construction in the spring in 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.110
 time sap flow so pinotex 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.360
 biotex and others in this and liked 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.880
 it's just not very successful skillful 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.350
 noticed birch sap 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.130
 you can fight with birch sap even 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.130
 black shoulders 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:41.679
 I myself went now we will do well 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.679
 tap 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:24.010
 Yes . excess moisture did not come out well, that's how 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.800
 see birch misses birch sap 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.500
 through the rim of the tap we have birch and 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.230
 dug away 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.250
 just open the tap and the bow to be with 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.250
 correct hole 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.080
 You can go home to wait while typed 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.079
 no cable 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.260
 dripped over night in a pair of one syrup i 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.920
 I will do next week of August and 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.920
 the amount of little steam they into the city 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:18.020
 hello does not raise try 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.020
 take a hard nut juice juice from birch 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.290
 us 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.070
 as you can see today 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.580
 his hooves Nikon bloom so juice 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.460
 should already move away as you understand not 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.720
 is growing 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.440
 Norway Canadian Maple is 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.440
 ordinary 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.269
 saved or ask us 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.590
 big wind as you can see drops happen 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.240
 when you lift up 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.180
 besides there could have been a lot of it so far 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.740
 since ah you can see the wind even blowing 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:49.850
 so we had to be so extreme 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.850
 inwardly stuffed last drops 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:10.910
 birch sand is decent sweetie 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:14.180
 your roads let's go see us 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.180
 sponsored nut 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.310
 and taman nut he also embroider

 promotion all, too, from April 20 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.550
 Now we are thinning it 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:59.500
 rarely do we know we will try it out 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:01.830
 see it here let's see 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.780
 how many leaked in 5 days 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:11.920
 our can still keeps dripping 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:16.050
 oozing aside but everything seems to be past 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.570
 the past will get a failed virus i 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.870
 somehow need spoons 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:34.780
 anyway much let's do debtors 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:43.590
 and something in between birch and maple 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:43.590
 bale leg tart cleverly try 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:51.070
 let's look let's see how much 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:56.620
 the volume has gathered this maple is 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:59.740
 sponsor nut I was planning to make 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.990
 Mongolian syrup and maple but 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.960
 it seems the volume is not enough here for a spoon 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.050
 will be typed no more therefore we will 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.260
 try to evaporate birch sap 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.440
 birch sap and many more will run 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.440
 him 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.830
 make chains extremely for collecting birch 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.830
 juice 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:34.720
 and now the light timber truck is about 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.720
