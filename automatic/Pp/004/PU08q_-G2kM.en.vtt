00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.460
 I missed but I'm here to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.500
 stay and in this first video of this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.140
 new stage of beauty backstreet os 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 I want to teach what are for me 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 favorite trends so to speak 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.400
 this fall-winter so without further 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.170
 procrastination let's go to it 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.780
 I'm going to start telling you what I 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.490
 like a peplum cut every time 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.710
 I use try to combine it with garments 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.920
 tight and the hair collected for not 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.660
 bring more volume to the look the effect of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.640
 this cut is definitely stylize the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.560
 waist but eye because at the same time 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.820
 accentuate the hips 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.220
 [Music] 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.019
 when using such a striking pattern I have 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.270
 preferred not to like many complements 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.840
 and combine it with plain clothes for 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:16.880
 do not recharge it too much 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:19.340
 [Music] 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.250
 the leather the police in any garment 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.159
 Be short a skirt is an essential for 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.280
 autumn-winter and now it's hitting very 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.280
 strong 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.630
 you can combine it with bold colors 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.720
 to get a fun look 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.720
 [Music] 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950
 or maybe opt for more colors 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.310
 cold, such as the outbreak of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310
 volcanoes 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.730
 some contact about accessories in 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:02:11.190
 Silver never hurts 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:02:15.200
 [Music] 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.200
 today I also propose a night look 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.219
 where the animal skin details 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.590
 print or the volume play with 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:25.230
 Oversize garments help us out of 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:45.740
 the typical dresses the beatings 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:47.810
 [Music] 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.510
 another of the trends we see most 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.900
 this season is the military style or the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.060
 arm style and as I am not very 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.610
 Devotee, I'm a fan of the print of 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.230
 camouflage and all this you can use the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.410
 quintessential color of this 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.540
 autumn-winter green khaki this color 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.280
 it's very very easy to use with blacks and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.480
 neutral test and mix fabrics 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.069
 [Music] 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.910

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:37.150

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:38.950

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.170
 favorite trends regarding color 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.990
