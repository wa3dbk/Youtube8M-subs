holes in the front just a little bit

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.410 
holes in the front just a little bit
larger<00:01:39.890> than<00:01:39.920> they<00:01:40.130> really<00:01:40.369> need<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.549> be<00:01:40.790> the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
larger than they really need to be the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.730 
larger than they really need to be the
idea<00:01:41.659> with<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:41.960> I'm<00:01:42.229> going<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.380> install

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.740 
there's your remember in part two I made
myself<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.770> jigsaw<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.340> still<00:02:32.180> have<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.480> I

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
myself a jigsaw I still have that I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.690 
myself a jigsaw I still have that I
didn't<00:02:33.500> bother<00:02:33.620> taking<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.070> apart<00:02:34.310> because<00:02:34.460> I

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
didn't bother taking it apart because I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.240 
didn't bother taking it apart because I
knew<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:34.850> was<00:02:35.030> gonna<00:02:35.150> need<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.480> again<00:02:35.750> in<00:02:36.650> I

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
knew I was gonna need it again in I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.860 
knew I was gonna need it again in I
could<00:02:37.850> have<00:02:37.940> saved<00:02:38.090> two<00:02:38.300> by<00:02:38.450> one<00:02:38.480> during<00:02:38.720> that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
could have saved two by one during that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.350 
could have saved two by one during that
time<00:02:39.080> but<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:39.440> figured<00:02:39.800> I'd<00:02:40.000> just<00:02:41.000> go<00:02:41.180> with

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
time but I just figured I'd just go with

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.600 
time but I just figured I'd just go with
what<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.540> had<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.680> guess<00:02:43.070> I'll<00:02:43.220> get<00:02:43.310> stuck

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
what I had so I guess I'll get stuck

00:02:43.610 --> 00:03:03.400 
what I had so I guess I'll get stuck
into<00:02:43.760> cutting<00:02:44.210> about<00:02:44.480> now

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.110 

you<00:03:04.410> know<00:03:04.470> those<00:03:04.740> bets<00:03:05.010> cat<00:03:05.220> I've<00:03:05.430> still<00:03:05.970> need

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
a small update is better than no update

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.350 
a small update is better than no update
