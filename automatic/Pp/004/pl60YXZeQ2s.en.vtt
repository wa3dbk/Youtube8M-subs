clear<00:02:18.880> looking<00:02:19.300> what<00:02:19.480> right<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.020> when<00:02:20.170> you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
clear looking what right but when you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.370 
clear looking what right but when you
apply<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.980> turns<00:02:21.490> blue

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.740 

so<00:02:26.740> you<00:02:26.860> just<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.580> apply<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.850> thin<00:02:28.330> strip

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
so you just have to apply a thin strip

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.910 
so you just have to apply a thin strip
of<00:02:28.810> glue<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:31.480> want<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.110> see<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.890> is

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
of glue and I want you to see that it is

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.260 
of glue and I want you to see that it is
colored<00:02:33.430> blue<00:02:34.830> sea<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:37.030> what<00:02:37.150> you're

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
colored blue sea and then what you're

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.060 
colored blue sea and then what you're
going<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.540> do<00:02:37.660> next<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:38.140> course<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.860> course

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
going to do next of course is of course

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.270 
going to do next of course is of course
you<00:02:39.280> have<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.490> know<00:02:40.030> line<00:02:40.270> your<00:02:40.510> lash<00:02:40.780> line<00:02:41.320> you

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
you have to know line your lash line you

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.170 
you have to know line your lash line you
know<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.810> make<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.960> look<00:02:44.140> more<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.890> know<00:02:45.040> more

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
know to make it look more you know more

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.490 
know to make it look more you know more
proper<00:02:46.180> or<00:02:47.850> clean<00:02:48.850> looking<00:02:49.150> or<00:02:49.720> more<00:02:49.990> polished

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
proper or clean looking or more polished

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.620 
proper or clean looking or more polished
and<00:02:50.740> now<00:02:51.010> we're<00:02:51.250> going<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.520> go<00:02:51.910> ahead<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.360> put

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
and now we're going to go ahead and put

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
and now we're going to go ahead and put
it<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:55.360> just<00:02:55.570> have<00:02:55.720> ok<00:02:56.140> this<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
it on you just have ok this is the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.370 
it on you just have ok this is the
technique<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.910> look<00:02:58.180> down<00:02:58.450> so

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
technique you just have to look down so

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.110 
technique you just have to look down so
if<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.680> have<00:02:59.800> a<00:02:59.830> Merry<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.490> should<00:03:00.700> be<00:03:00.850> right

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
if you have a Merry it should be right

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.690 
if you have a Merry it should be right
above<00:03:01.540> right<00:03:02.200> down<00:03:02.410> here<00:03:02.680> okay<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.490> you<00:03:03.580> have

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
above right down here okay so you have

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:15.010 
above right down here okay so you have
to<00:03:03.850> look<00:03:04.000> down<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:05.080> have<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.560> apply<00:03:05.800> it

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.900 

there

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
there

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.170 
there
so<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.570> can<00:03:17.810> see<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.410> strip<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:18.980> glue<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
so you can see the strip of glue the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.570 
so you can see the strip of glue the
color<00:03:20.420> blue<00:03:20.750> ones<00:03:21.140> but<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:21.920> don't<00:03:22.190> have<00:03:22.340> to

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
color blue ones but you don't have to

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.120 
color blue ones but you don't have to
worry<00:03:22.820> because<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.390> dries<00:03:23.630> clear<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:24.080> that<00:03:24.740> is

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
worry because it dries clear so that is

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.200 
worry because it dries clear so that is
one<00:03:25.670> very<00:03:26.390> good<00:03:26.750> advantage<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.880> glue

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
one very good advantage of this glue

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.590 
one very good advantage of this glue
because<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.720> dries<00:03:29.990> clear<00:03:30.640> but<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.850> lash<00:03:32.060> grip

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
because it dries clear but the lash grip

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.800 
because it dries clear but the lash grip
that<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.810> used<00:03:33.260> before<00:03:33.850> if<00:03:34.850> your<00:03:35.120> eyes<00:03:35.210> start<00:03:35.570> so

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
that I used before if your eyes start so

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.860 
that I used before if your eyes start so
if<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.050> mess<00:03:36.350> up<00:03:36.560> just<00:03:36.980> one<00:03:37.880> tiny<00:03:38.180> bit<00:03:38.600> you

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
if you mess up just one tiny bit you

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.730 
if you mess up just one tiny bit you
mess<00:03:39.170> everything<00:03:39.680> up<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.780> now<00:03:41.780> prefer<00:03:42.140> using

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
mess everything up so I now prefer using

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.930 
mess everything up so I now prefer using
blues<00:03:43.310> adhesives<00:03:44.210> that<00:03:44.480> dries<00:03:45.290> clear<00:03:45.740> so<00:03:45.940> now

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
blues adhesives that dries clear so now

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.160 
blues adhesives that dries clear so now
let<00:03:47.120> us<00:03:47.150> move<00:03:47.270> on<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.170> other<00:03:48.350> eye<00:03:50.170> again

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
let us move on to the other eye again

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.590 
let us move on to the other eye again
apply<00:03:51.710> the<00:03:51.770> glue<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.590> here<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.600> you

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
apply the glue so here it is and you

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.740 
apply the glue so here it is and you
just<00:03:57.170> have<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.770> apply<00:03:58.310> it

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:18.069 

again<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.560> should<00:04:01.620> look<00:04:02.070> up<00:04:02.280> okay

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.600 

as<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.799> can<00:04:18.979> see<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.870> glue<00:04:21.139> is<00:04:21.319> all<00:04:21.560> no<00:04:22.129> messed

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
as you can see the glue is all no messed

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.450 
as you can see the glue is all no messed
up<00:04:22.849> right<00:04:23.090> there<00:04:23.300> but<00:04:23.680> look<00:04:24.680> at<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.159> it

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
up right there but look at this I it

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.820 
up right there but look at this I it
doesn't<00:04:26.030> have<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.780> doesn't<00:04:27.169> you<00:04:27.560> know<00:04:27.590> the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
doesn't have it doesn't you know the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.300 
doesn't have it doesn't you know the
glue<00:04:27.979> did<00:04:28.189> not<00:04:28.840> is<00:04:29.840> not<00:04:30.800> there<00:04:31.039> anymore

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
glue did not is not there anymore

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.480 
glue did not is not there anymore
because<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.849> dries<00:04:32.060> clear<00:04:32.360> guide<00:04:32.930> clear<00:04:33.490> you

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
because it dries clear guide clear you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.760 
because it dries clear guide clear you
just<00:04:34.729> have<00:04:34.879> to<00:04:36.400> play<00:04:37.400> splashes<00:04:38.180> as<00:04:38.539> close<00:04:39.409> to

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
just have to play splashes as close to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:48.580 
just have to play splashes as close to
your<00:04:40.129> lash<00:04:40.159> line<00:04:40.819> as<00:04:41.180> possible

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.900 

so<00:04:49.220> we<00:04:49.670> just<00:04:49.820> have<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.240> let<00:04:50.360> it<00:04:50.420> dry

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.480 

okay<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:54.880> that's<00:04:55.880> probably<00:04:56.330> how<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:56.690> apply<00:04:57.200> my

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
okay and that's probably how I apply my

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.970 
okay and that's probably how I apply my
false<00:04:58.490> lashes<00:04:58.760> so<00:04:59.150> I'm<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.720> little<00:04:59.960> another<00:05:00.560> tip

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
false lashes so I'm a little another tip

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.820 
false lashes so I'm a little another tip
is<00:05:01.190> you<00:05:02.120> have<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.570> line<00:05:02.780> your<00:05:03.020> upper<00:05:03.260> waterline

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
is you have to line your upper waterline

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.160 
is you have to line your upper waterline
so<00:05:04.550> that<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.970> would<00:05:05.660> make<00:05:05.840> your<00:05:05.960> eyes<00:05:06.140> look

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
so that it would make your eyes look

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.280 
so that it would make your eyes look
more<00:05:06.470> deep<00:05:06.890> set<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.580> that<00:05:08.180> lashes<00:05:08.840> would<00:05:09.080> look

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
more deep set and that lashes would look

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.440 
more deep set and that lashes would look
more<00:05:10.900> natural<00:05:11.900> because<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:13.880> don't<00:05:14.090> do<00:05:14.300> not

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
more natural because you don't do not

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.230 
more natural because you don't do not
see<00:05:14.750> where<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.290> lashes<00:05:15.650> begin<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.700> weird<00:05:16.910> and

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
see where the lashes begin and weird and

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.900 
see where the lashes begin and weird and
so<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:18.350> know<00:05:18.380> lining<00:05:18.860> your<00:05:18.950> eyes<00:05:19.130> is<00:05:19.340> really

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
so you know lining your eyes is really

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.200 
so you know lining your eyes is really
important<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:21.280> you<00:05:22.280> have<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.700> sign<00:05:23.000> your

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.140 
important and you have to sign your
upper<00:05:23.510> waterline<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.410> I<00:05:24.650> guess<00:05:24.980> that's<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.610> if

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
upper waterline so I guess that's it if

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.840 
upper waterline so I guess that's it if
