in this video we are looking at four
reasons<00:00:02.700> Vava<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> B<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.380> better<00:00:04.680> than

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
reasons Vava on a B is better than

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.030 
reasons Vava on a B is better than
motorola<00:00:05.460> moto<00:00:05.759> e<00:00:06.120> 2nd<00:00:06.690> generation<00:00:07.040> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
moto e 2nd generation is just 0.3

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.029 
moto e 2nd generation is just 0.3
megapixels<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.690> better<00:00:55.260> quality<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
megapixels so you get better quality you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
megapixels so you get better quality you
know<00:00:56.399> when<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.449> voice<00:00:57.690> charting<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.230> video

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
know when you do voice charting or video

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
know when you do voice charting or video
calling<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> 2<00:01:00.180> megapixel<00:01:00.780> while

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
calling because it is 2 megapixel while

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.640 
calling because it is 2 megapixel while
the<00:01:01.230> moto<00:01:01.770> e<00:01:01.890> has<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.670> 0.3<00:01:03.300> megapixel<00:01:03.899> this

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the moto e has just 0.3 megapixel this

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
the moto e has just 0.3 megapixel this
is<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> second<00:01:05.250> reason<00:01:05.369> why<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:06.180> honor<00:01:06.570> b<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
is the second reason why we honor b is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710 
is the second reason why we honor b is
better<00:01:07.530> than<00:01:07.770> motorola<00:01:08.340> moto<00:01:08.909> e<00:01:09.240> second

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
better than motorola moto e second

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
better than motorola moto e second
generations<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.130> will<00:01:11.340> look<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
generations so now we will look at the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.719 
generations so now we will look at the
third<00:01:12.240> reason<00:01:12.990> why<00:01:13.350> two<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.040> gonna<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
third reason why two are gonna be is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.370 
third reason why two are gonna be is
motor<00:01:14.939> better<00:01:15.240> than<00:01:15.420> Moto<00:01:15.659> e<00:01:15.930> 2nd<00:01:16.320> generation

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
motor better than Moto e 2nd generation

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.910 
motor better than Moto e 2nd generation
and<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.369> third<00:01:17.580> reason<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.930> has<00:01:18.990> LED

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and the third reason is that it has LED

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.420 
and the third reason is that it has LED
flash<00:01:20.340> yes<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.210> Huawei<00:01:21.570> honor<00:01:21.720> B<00:01:22.110> has<00:01:22.590> an<00:01:22.890> LED

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
flash yes the Huawei honor B has an LED

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.640 
flash yes the Huawei honor B has an LED
flash<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> more<00:01:24.689> widely<00:01:24.930> Motorola<00:01:25.470> MOTO

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
flash was the more widely Motorola MOTO

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.219 
flash was the more widely Motorola MOTO
he<00:01:26.220> does<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.970> LED<00:01:27.420> flash<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:27.840> all<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
he does not have LED flash at all in

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.160 
he does not have LED flash at all in
fact<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.310> Huawei<00:01:29.640> honor<00:01:29.820> B<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.420> drawn<00:01:30.810> LED

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
fact the Huawei honor B has drawn LED

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200 
fact the Huawei honor B has drawn LED
flash<00:01:31.409> while<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.280> Moto<00:01:32.490> e<00:01:32.610> 2nd<00:01:33.180> generation

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
flash while the Moto e 2nd generation

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.640 
flash while the Moto e 2nd generation
has<00:01:33.840> no<00:01:34.110> LED<00:01:35.070> flash<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.079> there

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
has no LED flash at all and then there

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.850 
has no LED flash at all and then there
is<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.130> reason<00:01:38.759> why<00:01:39.180> woven<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> P<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
is one more reason why woven on a P is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.030 
is one more reason why woven on a P is
better<00:01:41.189> than<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:42.140> Moto<00:01:43.140> e<00:01:43.500> 2nd<00:01:43.950> generation

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
better than the Moto e 2nd generation

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.480 
better than the Moto e 2nd generation
and<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.960> price<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.290> OVA<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> B

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and it is that the price of OVA on a B

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.090 
and it is that the price of OVA on a B
is<00:01:47.880> way<00:01:48.420> cheaper<00:01:48.450> than<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.860> price<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
is way cheaper than the price of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490 
is way cheaper than the price of
motorola<00:01:50.850> moto<00:01:51.119> e<00:01:51.450> 2nd<00:01:51.930> generation
