00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.940
 under water test seen by sonics pz 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.799
 and the comparison video with the htc bonn 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.360
 and the samsung galaxy s fell this one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.440
 videos but also super important and indeed 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.049
 it's about the preinstalled 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 protective film on the front and back 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.980
 the whole thing is called antique film and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 is there for it is then dropped that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 display dish as this hinders this anti 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.020
 schneider film that the companies to the room 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.890
 Jump around the us in the open display 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.930
 can hurt 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.699
 a good thing is the problem 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 is this handcuffs super 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.550
 prone to scratches 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.040
 I have two months now 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.899
 some scratches on it you can do it all 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.850
 so avoid him for the movie 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.480
 comes under the sr citizens have the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.850
 protection no longer 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.500
 or you get screen protector over 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.489
 the anti shader film, however, the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.680
 Scratch only on this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.789
 screen protectors of this film you can 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.410
 By the way , not at the moment 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.969
 to reorder that is who once 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.680
 ruined is a problem 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.750
 I do not hear a product of a German 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.309
 company produced in germany 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.260
 with that comes the problem 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.690
 do the world a favor share this 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 again clearly z have or throw 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 easy in experts 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.180
 thank you and let's go so we 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.920
 Now be the screen protector 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.360
 I have support from 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.170
 my girlfriend will pick it up now 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.210
 Friemel on it while you agree 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.409
 it is likely to hear and indeed it is one 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.750
 screen protector film 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.360
 which is crystal clear and invisible 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.050
 looks down to a third and now 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.770
 then sets lower edge 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.660
 14 times further mitspielt scope of delivery is 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.060
 Also a screen protector from Sony 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.010
 but it's just one each 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.500
 for the top and for the bottom 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.910
 Say if you lose them or if 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.890
 The then sometime too long from the display 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.140
 are broken and you start at the beginning 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.510
 you want to have product then you have to 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.500
 a set of tires like this one 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.790
 screen protector film 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:51.740
 you're doing really well after that 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.070
 finger off that one continues to move upwards 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.070
 go 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.880
 I believe that I have only betrayed 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.240
 times worked hand model has been true 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.460

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:11.270
 well well it just about that on 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:29.690
 every case pretty fast with the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:30.950
 finger the lighter so you want us 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.230
 can say is that we still serve 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.230
 can with the double protection on it now 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.230
 right now two screen protectors 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.790
 there is no problem on it you see it 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.890
 picture is not affected still 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.230
 a beautiful hd screen and man 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.310
 now just protects the protective film the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.020
 already preinstalled 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.790
 by meaningful thing the left 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.830
 screen protector is in the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.660
 description box and this video gives 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.220
 Of course there is Amazon to buy 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.220
 Also this video a thumbs up 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.800
 hello we are back again we have 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.140
 Of course the back side is forgotten 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.100
 to do so thus is complete again 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.480
 Now again the back please 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.340
 what I want to mention again 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.410
 before you the crass chooses you happy 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.030
 I have seen my display they are only 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.740
 on this worthy of protection before 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.630
 studied is not on the display 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.010
 So there should be no worries 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.630
 make that not the problem 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.970
 but as I said, they are there too 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.550
 not nice if then the protective film so 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.750
 my question is destroyed at you 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.200
 write for the comments and the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.150
 Video 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.530
 how do you like this solution from sony 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.910
 just pre-installed 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.890
 protective films on it 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.970
 the visitors spawning period scratch and 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.040
 service is no substitute 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.350
 my problem of the matter is that you 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.350
 just did not communicate that 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.930
 something to ben So my problem 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.120
 is just something in the communication 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.650
 to say that you have this foil 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.720
 make a protective film on it 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.120
 so that is protected when they are 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.740
 At least they should not do it 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.400
 substitute for the disposal provide the 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.560
 did not do it 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.900
 Well now you know how it works 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.900
 I decided to say thank you again for watching
