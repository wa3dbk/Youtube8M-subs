TSP<00:00:44.830> of<00:00:44.950> olive<00:00:45.010> oil<00:00:45.370> in<00:00:45.580> what<00:00:46.420> that<00:00:46.630> does<00:00:46.840> that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
TSP of olive oil in what that does that

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.110 
TSP of olive oil in what that does that
keeps<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.530> from<00:00:47.560> boiling<00:00:48.010> over<00:00:48.130> and<00:00:48.790> it<00:00:48.910> really

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
keeps it from boiling over and it really

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.010 
keeps it from boiling over and it really
does<00:00:49.360> work<00:00:50.040> all<00:00:51.040> right<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:52.900> on<00:00:53.050> huh

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
does work all right put it on huh

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.840 
does work all right put it on huh
and<00:00:56.020> then<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:58.030> leather<00:00:58.239> bowl<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.280> I'll<00:01:00.489> show

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
and then the leather bowl and I'll show

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.049 
and then the leather bowl and I'll show
you<00:01:00.910> when<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.180> cover<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.510> up<00:01:02.910> all<00:01:03.910> right<00:01:03.940> I

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
you when to cover it up all right I

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.490 
you when to cover it up all right I
should<00:01:04.360> add<00:01:04.510> at<00:01:04.690> this<00:01:04.780> first<00:01:05.080> there<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.379> a

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
should add at this first there is a

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.080 
should add at this first there is a
technique<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.160> this<00:01:07.050> for<00:01:08.050> perfect<00:01:08.680> rice<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
technique to this for perfect rice you

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.850 
technique to this for perfect rice you
go<00:01:10.240> ahead<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.510> put<00:01:10.630> your<00:01:10.659> five<00:01:11.020> cups<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.590> water

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
go ahead and put your five cups of water

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.399 
go ahead and put your five cups of water
and<00:01:12.490> your<00:01:12.730> pot<00:01:12.940> set<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.810> where<00:01:13.960> it's<00:01:14.110> going<00:01:14.320> to

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
and your pot set it where it's going to

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.510 
and your pot set it where it's going to
go<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.540> put<00:01:16.780> your<00:01:16.990> rice<00:01:17.230> into<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.070> you

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
go then you put your rice into it you

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.240 
go then you put your rice into it you
don't<00:01:18.550> stir<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.380> nothing<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.860> just<00:01:21.010> let<00:01:21.220> it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
don't stir it nothing you just let it

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.140 
don't stir it nothing you just let it
sit<00:01:21.370> there<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.710> technique<00:01:24.159> for<00:01:24.940> some

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
sit there that is the technique for some

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.050 
sit there that is the technique for some
reason<00:01:25.540> this<00:01:25.810> makes<00:01:26.200> perfect<00:01:26.500> rice<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.940> of

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
reason this makes perfect rice and of

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.810 
reason this makes perfect rice and of
course<00:01:28.270> that's<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.860> green<00:01:29.860> pepper<00:01:30.040> state<00:01:30.430> going

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
course that's a green pepper state going

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.750 
course that's a green pepper state going
mm-hmm<00:01:31.570> that's<00:01:31.930> just<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:33.250> take<00:01:33.400> a<00:01:33.430> state

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
mm-hmm that's just just take a state

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.870 
mm-hmm that's just just take a state
slice<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.720> in<00:01:34.810> slices<00:01:35.159> go<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.430> there<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.759> a

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
slice it in slices go it in there and a

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.209 
slice it in slices go it in there and a
little<00:01:37.210> olive<00:01:37.509> oil<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.840> brown<00:01:38.079> it<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:39.070> then

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
little olive oil and brown it and then

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.749

add soy sauce do not salt it at all

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.459 
add soy sauce do not salt it at all
because<00:01:43.030> soy<00:01:43.479> sauce<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:44.619> very<00:01:44.860> salty<00:01:46.469> one

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469

of course 3/4 teaspoons of ginger I can

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.350 
of course 3/4 teaspoons of ginger I can
see<00:02:13.810> how<00:02:13.900> that's<00:02:14.050> goal<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.680> see<00:02:15.460> that<00:02:15.730> that
