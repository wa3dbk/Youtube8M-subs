00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.010 

I<00:00:14.059> just<00:00:15.059> finished<00:00:15.240> edge<00:00:15.540> joining<00:00:15.809> this

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
I just finished edge joining this

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.560 
I just finished edge joining this
nice-looking<00:00:16.230> slab<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.980> cherry<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> tops

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
nice-looking slab of cherry for the tops

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.150 
nice-looking slab of cherry for the tops
of<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> sushi<00:00:19.140> plates<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:19.950> long<00:00:20.130> enough

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
of the sushi plates and it's long enough

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.040 
of the sushi plates and it's long enough
so<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> can<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.150> two<00:00:21.360> out<00:00:21.599> of<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.810> one

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
so that I can get two out of this one

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.560 
so that I can get two out of this one
slab<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> need<00:00:23.610> to<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.820> next<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.360> cut

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
slab so what I need to do next is cut

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:34.149 
slab so what I need to do next is cut
this<00:00:24.750> too<00:00:24.960> rough<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.170> at<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> table<00:00:25.890> saw

this board is nice and flat and to make
that<00:00:41.850> operation<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.420> little<00:00:42.719> easier<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.140> went

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that operation a little easier I went

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.630 
that operation a little easier I went
ahead<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.559> took<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.859> piece<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.039> chalk<00:00:44.399> and

the board that way I can see my progress
a<00:00:48.960> lot<00:00:49.079> easier<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:49.890> flattening<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.489> face

I'm going to back it up with a piece of

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.059 
I'm going to back it up with a piece of
scrap<00:02:08.720> wood<00:02:13.810> here's<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.900> little<00:02:15.080> tip<00:02:15.319> when<00:02:15.920> you

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
scrap wood here's a little tip when you

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.680 
scrap wood here's a little tip when you
do<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.310> opposite<00:02:16.700> wall<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.300> dovetail

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
do the opposite wall of the dovetail

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.539 
do the opposite wall of the dovetail
groove<00:02:17.720> it's<00:02:18.470> important<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.010> come<00:02:19.160> out<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> bit

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
groove it's important to come out a bit

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.369 
groove it's important to come out a bit
from<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.879> other<00:02:20.030> direction<00:02:20.239> than<00:02:21.080> we<00:02:21.170> made

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
from the other direction than we made

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.619 
from the other direction than we made
earlier<00:02:21.769> this<00:02:22.459> way<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.879> won't<00:02:23.060> end<00:02:23.239> up<00:02:23.330> climb

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
earlier this way we won't end up climb

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:37.680 
earlier this way we won't end up climb
cutting<00:02:24.049> on<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.500> dovetail<00:02:24.860> bit

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.640 

okay<00:02:38.690> now<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:38.990> I<00:02:39.020> finished<00:02:39.200> making<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
okay now that I finished making the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.080 
okay now that I finished making the
dovetailed<00:02:40.070> foot<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.460> show<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.820> how<00:02:40.940> this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
dovetailed foot I can show you how this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.750 
dovetailed foot I can show you how this
slides<00:02:41.390> together<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:42.560> ductile<00:02:43.190> foot<00:02:43.520> just

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
slides together the ductile foot just

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.790 
slides together the ductile foot just
slides<00:02:44.090> into<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> dovetail<00:02:45.200> groove<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.710> we

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
slides into the dovetail groove that we

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.820 
slides into the dovetail groove that we
created<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.580> now<00:02:47.480> all<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.720> need<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.200> now<00:02:48.410> is

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
created and now all I need to do now is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.690 
created and now all I need to do now is
cut<00:02:49.700> off<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:51.170> portion<00:02:51.710> of<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.250> piece<00:02:52.670> of

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
cut off this portion of the piece of

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.460 
cut off this portion of the piece of
wood<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.330> all<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.690> left<00:02:53.960> with<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.320> the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
wood so that all on left with is the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.440 
wood so that all on left with is the
dovetail<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.100> we'll<00:02:55.820> do<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.060> now<00:02:56.210> at<00:02:56.360> the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
dovetail and we'll do that now at the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:56.949 
dovetail and we'll do that now at the
table<00:02:56.570> saw

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.180 

now<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.230> feet<00:03:58.410> are<00:03:58.530> out<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.770> clamps<00:03:59.100> I
