00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.520
 and then personal - another epilogue video 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.830
 commented here who speaks is kimi 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 this time we start our series of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.859
 game goals 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.019
 talking a little there from the target point 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 game is nothing less than the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.210
 distribution of functions of each player 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.730
 in the group to optimize to make the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 missions then the staff is this every 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.629
 player will have a different function and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.690
 This is called holdings. 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.140
 so if you use the roller 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.280
 right way you will get everything 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 type of situation independent of having 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 several routes on the other team 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.610
 You'll be able to win them then. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 Why are you going to be more prepared? 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.379
 You will have weapons for various 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.910
 situations and a person who will be 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.810
 responsible for a particular 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.970
 situation is a specific task in the case 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.310
 from the point how he is the guy in charge 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.680
 to do the goal he has to have more 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.600
 Quick ranging from mobility that is one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.909
 shock in 1s mg 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.610
 which also goes there because it is a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:26.549
 weapon that gives you mobility you can 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:30.390
 play with her the occassions tom tom and holly 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.490
 Sg says these are excellent weapons 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.520
 for that kind of rowe is the guy who goes 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.650
 always making goals so it 's 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.170
 one thing we have to notice is 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.850
 that he's going to have to carry those 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.780
 equipment to make the goal more 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.240
 quick does not even propose to have this 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.240
 type of equipment because if you have 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.399
 The memo will be much harder. 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.310
 for your team and the coverage and so 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.740
 How can you miss a goal to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.330
 me the ideal in the group would be to have two 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.400
 points - for the simple reason that it 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.400
 as a child carry all the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.700
 possible equipment modifications 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.010
 then it will not have 40% reduction of 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.670
 time on all goals 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.070
 same person then two carrying 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.610
 three different equipments then you 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.910
 improve and then the time to do with 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.590
 objectives are vehicles would be 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.870
 vehicle that you can get more 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.300
 fast on target 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.040
 the vegas it can be a good request but 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.340
 He is very difficult to drive. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.980
 then there would be the ideal indian nico unb 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.140
 Chada because they are easy to drive 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.200
 you keep with the average speed 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.030
 constant so you do not stop to turn 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.890
 do not have these things you use one 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.290
 bit it brake but you go 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.660
 reach the target very fast 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.160
 to me what else matches this type 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.160
 of rolim for the modification of 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.260
 character is the asphalt surfer 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.540
 Are you going to stay on top of the car then? 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.540
 You will not have that time to leave the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.880
 car to make animation for later and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.590
 I do not like the car's popular goal already 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.870
 is still talking about 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.970
 blue mods you can use the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.010
 replanting itself a generic modification 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.230
 but you're going to lose your is in the mine and 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.600
 also its speed 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.790
 now another modification to five of the 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.120
 second slot is not just green 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.500
 we have the fragile one that will take 14% 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.980
 of chp but will not give you a dn chilique 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.209
 hvr then you will have a speed 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.730
 Shot the better you will run more 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.190
 fast and this will get you in the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.260
 goal faster or if you 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.000
 You want some more generic thing you 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.970
 have your own and in front of you 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.440
 recover chp faster 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.810
 This was personal the first video 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.880
 talking about roots then I hope to cover 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.480
 all rolls 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.760
 possible and in this series I'll try 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.850
 at the end of it, set up an ideal group 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.880
 then it would be what you would have 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.350
 advantage when doing a mission does not 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.350
 is it worth rui
