now<00:02:11.500> here's<00:02:12.099> my<00:02:12.520> other<00:02:13.270> tip<00:02:13.720> if<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.260> want<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
now here's my other tip if you want to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.750 
now here's my other tip if you want to
use<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.610> wet<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.660> wet<00:02:16.870> jet<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> have

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
use this as a wet and wet jet so I have

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.430 
use this as a wet and wet jet so I have
my<00:02:19.209> wet<00:02:19.720> Jed<00:02:19.989> um<00:02:21.510> liquid<00:02:22.510> back<00:02:22.840> here<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.080> can<00:02:23.319> be

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
my wet Jed um liquid back here I can be

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.729 
my wet Jed um liquid back here I can be
one<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.090> actually<00:02:25.450> reuse<00:02:26.380> this

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
one of this but I actually reuse this

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.309 
one of this but I actually reuse this
and<00:02:27.099> there<00:02:27.910> are<00:02:28.180> multiple<00:02:28.480> videos<00:02:28.959> out<00:02:29.140> there

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
and there are multiple videos out there

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.949 
and there are multiple videos out there
on<00:02:29.500> how<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:30.610> know<00:02:30.640> refill<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.510> yourself

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
on how to you know refill this yourself

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.870 
on how to you know refill this yourself
and<00:02:32.140> whatnot<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.590> that's<00:02:32.769> where<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.069> do<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.550> have

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
and whatnot and that's where I do I have

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.210 
and whatnot and that's where I do I have
my<00:02:34.090> own<00:02:34.470> all-purpose<00:02:35.470> solution<00:02:35.860> mixed<00:02:36.010> in

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
my own all-purpose solution mixed in

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.280 
my own all-purpose solution mixed in
here<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:37.120> say<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.390> want<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.780> use<00:02:37.900> whatever

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
here but say you want to use whatever

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.930 
here but say you want to use whatever
solution<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.370> don't<00:02:39.610> want<00:02:39.850> it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
solution is here and you don't want it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.420 
solution is here and you don't want it
that<00:02:39.970> you'll<00:02:40.239> eat<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.480> dry<00:02:40.989> rag<00:02:41.290> all<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.280> got

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
that you'll eat the dry rag all you got

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.910 
that you'll eat the dry rag all you got
to<00:02:42.549> do<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.030> if<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.780> look<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.380> front<00:02:44.560> of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
to do is if you look on the front of

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.520 
to do is if you look on the front of
your<00:02:45.400> wet<00:02:45.580> jet<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:46.480> will<00:02:46.660> see<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.049> there<00:02:47.260> are

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
your wet jet you will see that there are

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.240 
your wet jet you will see that there are
these<00:02:48.100> holes<00:02:48.400> on<00:02:48.760> either<00:02:49.000> side<00:02:49.360> where<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
these holes on either side where the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.520 
these holes on either side where the
water<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.880> solution<00:02:52.360> will<00:02:52.510> come<00:02:52.660> out<00:02:52.840> just

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
water the solution will come out just

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.280 
water the solution will come out just
make<00:02:53.739> sure<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.040> when<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.880> are<00:02:55.170> putting<00:02:56.170> your

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
rag down don't cover those holes and you

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.350 
rag down don't cover those holes and you
can<00:02:59.860> still<00:03:00.130> do<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> exact<00:03:00.670> same<00:03:00.849> thing<00:03:01.060> still

my kitchen my bathrooms in my little

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.960 
my kitchen my bathrooms in my little
tiny<00:03:31.000> entryway<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:33.130> costs<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.700> lot<00:03:33.910> of

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.150 
tiny entryway and it costs a lot of
money<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.540> constantly<00:03:34.989> using<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.500> pad<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.040> I

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
money to constantly using this pad and I

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.770 
money to constantly using this pad and I
use<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> different<00:03:36.760> pad<00:03:37.060> for<00:03:37.329> every<00:03:37.569> single

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
use a different pad for every single

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.500 
use a different pad for every single
room<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:39.100> means<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.639> I<00:03:39.700> am<00:03:39.790> using<00:03:40.120> four

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
room so that means that I am using four

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.140 
room so that means that I am using four
different<00:03:40.540> pads<00:03:40.989> every<00:03:41.440> single<00:03:41.889> day<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.400> that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
different pads every single day and that

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.660 
different pads every single day and that
can<00:03:43.420> be<00:03:43.750> really<00:03:44.200> really<00:03:44.380> expensive<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.430> have

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
can be really really expensive so I have

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.340 
can be really really expensive so I have
found<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.299> is<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.480> great<00:03:46.750> way<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:46.930> cut

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
found that this is a great way to cut

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.030 
found that this is a great way to cut
down<00:03:47.380> on<00:03:47.650> cost

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
down on cost

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.849 
down on cost
I<00:03:48.069> still<00:03:48.430> do<00:03:48.549> use<00:03:48.790> those<00:03:49.000> on<00:03:49.329> occasion<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.530> I

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
I still do use those on occasion but I

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.740 
I still do use those on occasion but I
like<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:51.910> nice<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.329> simple

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
like this it's a nice and simple

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.809 
like this it's a nice and simple
everybody<00:03:53.650> has<00:03:53.829> rise<00:03:54.040> if<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.430> don't<00:03:54.609> have

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
everybody has rise if you don't have

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.759 
everybody has rise if you don't have
rides<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.510> have<00:03:55.660> an<00:03:55.750> old<00:03:55.930> t-shirt<00:03:56.170> cut<00:03:56.680> up
