00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
and has a lot of right angles do you

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.180 
and has a lot of right angles do you
recommend<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:54.379> I<00:00:54.499> get<00:00:54.589> a<00:00:54.649> bigger<00:00:54.890> pump

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
recommend that I get a bigger pump

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.340 
recommend that I get a bigger pump
because<00:00:55.489> of<00:00:55.760> flow<00:00:56.149> lost<00:00:56.539> in<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.870> right<00:00:56.989> angles

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
because of flow lost in the right angles

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.319 
because of flow lost in the right angles
well<00:00:57.920> Simon<00:00:58.129> it<00:00:58.399> is<00:00:58.519> true<00:00:58.789> that<00:00:58.819> every<00:00:59.179> time

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
well Simon it is true that every time

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.090 
well Simon it is true that every time
you<00:00:59.449> have<00:00:59.479> a<00:00:59.569> 90-degree<00:01:00.139> turn<00:01:00.170> or<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.649> bend<00:01:00.949> in

you have a 90-degree turn or a bend in
the<00:01:01.159> piping<00:01:01.609> it<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.269> going<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.510> reduce<00:01:02.690> the

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
the piping it is going to reduce the

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.320 
the piping it is going to reduce the
flow<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.739> pump<00:01:03.949> when<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:04.909> comes<00:01:05.089> down<00:01:05.269> to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
flow of the pump when it comes down to

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.120 
flow of the pump when it comes down to
is<00:01:05.780> how<00:01:05.960> much<00:01:06.140> water<00:01:06.380> you're<00:01:06.619> actually

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
is how much water you're actually

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.469 
is how much water you're actually
putting<00:01:07.310> through<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.729> aquarium<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.270> through

the<00:01:08.600> overflow<00:01:09.020> box<00:01:09.340> something<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.460> keep<00:01:10.579> in

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
the overflow box something to keep in

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.580 
the overflow box something to keep in
mind<00:01:10.969> is<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.540> size<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.020> drains<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:12.469> your

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
mind is the size of the drains on your

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.410 
mind is the size of the drains on your
aquarium<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.189> how<00:01:13.579> much<00:01:13.729> water<00:01:14.000> flow<00:01:14.240> they

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
aquarium and how much water flow they

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.600 
aquarium and how much water flow they
can<00:01:14.600> handle<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.469> mag<00:01:15.740> 12<00:01:16.040> I<00:01:16.130> think<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.369> rated

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
can handle so mag 12 I think is rated

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.840 
can handle so mag 12 I think is rated

an<00:01:37.460> hour<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:39.229> can't<00:01:39.469> pump<00:01:39.680> water<00:01:39.829> in

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
an hour so you can't pump water in

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.410 
an hour so you can't pump water in
faster<00:01:40.460> than<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:40.609> can<00:01:40.729> drain<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.060> obviously

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
faster than you can drain it obviously

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.380 
faster than you can drain it obviously
that's<00:01:41.630> one<00:01:41.869> limit<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.289> consider<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.430> in<00:01:44.149> terms

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
that's one limit to consider so in terms

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.910 
that's one limit to consider so in terms
of<00:01:44.479> upgrading<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:44.990> pump<00:01:45.170> if<00:01:45.320> your<00:01:45.530> drain<00:01:45.710> can

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
of upgrading to pump if your drain can

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.859 
of upgrading to pump if your drain can
easily<00:01:46.280> hand<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.789> you<00:01:46.880> handle<00:01:47.539> it<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.780> you

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
easily hand it and you handle it and you

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.359 
easily hand it and you handle it and you
feel<00:01:48.049> like<00:01:48.079> there's<00:01:48.590> not<00:01:48.710> enough<00:01:48.770> flow<00:01:49.159> in<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
feel like there's not enough flow in the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.190 
feel like there's not enough flow in the
tank<00:01:49.579> then<00:01:49.789> definitely<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.240> can<00:01:50.329> upgrade<00:01:50.479> you

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
tank then definitely you can upgrade you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.050 
tank then definitely you can upgrade you
could<00:01:51.320> also<00:01:51.469> consider<00:01:51.799> adding<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.520> second

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
could also consider adding a second

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.840 
could also consider adding a second
return<00:01:53.329> pump<00:01:53.570> on<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.840> separate<00:01:54.619> return<00:01:54.950> line<00:01:55.189> so

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
return pump on a separate return line so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.700 
return pump on a separate return line so
this<00:01:55.969> way<00:01:56.119> if<00:01:56.240> your<00:01:56.390> main<00:01:56.780> pump<00:01:57.049> fails<00:01:57.350> you

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
this way if your main pump fails you

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.260 
this way if your main pump fails you
have<00:01:57.740> one<00:01:58.039> running<00:01:58.219> for<00:01:58.460> backup<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.999> keep<00:01:59.149> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
have one running for backup to keep the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.929 
have one running for backup to keep the

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
Jason asked he run an external pump

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.480 
Jason asked he run an external pump
vertically<00:02:04.789> well<00:02:05.890> honestly<00:02:06.890> Jason<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.460> don't

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
vertically well honestly Jason I don't

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.210 
vertically well honestly Jason I don't
know<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:08.119> wouldn't<00:02:08.420> recommend<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.229> know<00:02:09.950> that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
know I wouldn't recommend it I know that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.610 
know I wouldn't recommend it I know that
all<00:02:10.459> external<00:02:10.879> pumps<00:02:11.239> usually<00:02:11.840> are<00:02:11.959> flooded

all external pumps usually are flooded
suction<00:02:13.040> which<00:02:13.220> needs<00:02:13.489> to<00:02:13.580> means<00:02:14.120> they<00:02:14.239> need

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
suction which needs to means they need

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.410 
suction which needs to means they need
to<00:02:14.510> be<00:02:14.629> below<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
to be below the

to be below the
of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> sump<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> gravity<00:02:17.400> will<00:02:17.490> force

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
of the sump so the gravity will force

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.240 
of the sump so the gravity will force

water into the inlet of the pump if you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550 
water into the inlet of the pump if you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
really have no space and you need to do

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.839 
really have no space and you need to do
it<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.800> way<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:22.950> might<00:02:23.220> contact<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
it that way you might contact the

it that way you might contact the
manufacturer<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.450> see<00:02:24.720> what<00:02:24.840> they<00:02:24.930> say<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.440> in

there<00:03:13.620> any<00:03:13.769> way<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:13.980> prevent<00:03:14.310> calcium<00:03:15.030> buildup

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
there any way to prevent calcium buildup

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.380 
there any way to prevent calcium buildup
on<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.690> impeller<00:03:15.959> well<00:03:16.830> not<00:03:17.730> really<00:03:17.970> you're

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
on the impeller well not really you're

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.060 
on the impeller well not really you're
gonna<00:03:18.540> get<00:03:18.780> calcium<00:03:19.170> buildup<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.560> impellers

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
gonna get calcium buildup on impellers

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.160 
gonna get calcium buildup on impellers
of<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.280> pumps<00:03:20.549> over<00:03:20.760> time<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.930> take

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
of the pumps over time but you can take

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.750 
of the pumps over time but you can take
the<00:03:22.260> pump<00:03:22.470> apart<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.100> can<00:03:23.220> actually<00:03:23.370> soak

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the pump apart and you can actually soak

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.729 
the pump apart and you can actually soak
the<00:03:23.940> impeller<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.390> vinegar<00:03:24.810> that'll<00:03:25.440> help<00:03:25.560> to

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
the impeller in vinegar that'll help to

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.099 
the impeller in vinegar that'll help to
remove<00:03:26.010> any<00:03:26.329> deposits<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.450> calcium<00:03:27.600> buildup

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
remove any deposits of calcium buildup

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.750 
remove any deposits of calcium buildup
or<00:03:28.290> coral<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.650> algae<00:03:28.739> from<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> pumps

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
or coral and algae from the pumps

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.750 
or coral and algae from the pumps
impeller<00:03:30.290> now<00:03:31.290> Dan<00:03:31.500> asks<00:03:31.859> what<00:03:32.400> are<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.579> best

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
impeller now Dan asks what are the best

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.060 
impeller now Dan asks what are the best
ways<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.269> keeping<00:03:33.510> added<00:03:34.380> pump<00:03:34.590> heat<00:03:34.799> out<00:03:35.040> of

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
ways of keeping added pump heat out of

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.130 
ways of keeping added pump heat out of
your<00:03:35.280> aquarium<00:03:35.519> well<00:03:36.450> in<00:03:36.540> our<00:03:36.660> experience

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
your aquarium well in our experience

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.170 
your aquarium well in our experience
most<00:03:37.230> external<00:03:37.950> pumps<00:03:38.370> are<00:03:38.489> gonna<00:03:38.640> add<00:03:38.820> less

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
most external pumps are gonna add less

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.970 
most external pumps are gonna add less
heat<00:03:39.480> into<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.780> tank<00:03:40.109> than<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.410> submersible

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
heat into the tank than the submersible

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.410 
heat into the tank than the submersible
pump<00:03:41.190> because<00:03:41.730> summer<00:03:41.940> scible<00:03:42.180> pumps

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
pump because summer scible pumps

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.150 
pump because summer scible pumps
obviously<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> entire<00:03:43.290> pump<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.739> underwater

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
obviously the entire pump is underwater

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.860 
obviously the entire pump is underwater
and<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.609> only<00:03:44.760> way<00:03:44.940> for<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.209> heat<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.570> escape

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
and the only way for the heat to escape

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.660 
and the only way for the heat to escape
from<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.170> motor<00:03:46.350> is<00:03:46.590> back<00:03:46.950> into<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.489> water

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
from the motor is back into the water

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.330 
from the motor is back into the water
whereas<00:03:48.450> an<00:03:48.540> external<00:03:48.989> pump<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.650> not<00:03:49.950> under

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
whereas an external pump is not under

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.069 
whereas an external pump is not under
water<00:03:50.519> so<00:03:51.000> it's<00:03:51.150> usually<00:03:51.390> gonna<00:03:51.630> put<00:03:51.870> less

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
water so it's usually gonna put less

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.979 
water so it's usually gonna put less
heat<00:03:52.290> into<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.650> water<00:03:52.829> other<00:03:53.760> than<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.090> you

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
heat into the water other than that you

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.259 
heat into the water other than that you
obviously<00:03:55.620> just<00:03:55.650> need<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.430> run<00:03:56.549> cooling<00:03:57.030> fans

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
obviously just need to run cooling fans

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.020 
obviously just need to run cooling fans
and<00:03:57.799> possibly<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.859> chiller<00:03:59.069> on<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.340> aquarium

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
and possibly a chiller on the aquarium

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.210 
and possibly a chiller on the aquarium
now<00:04:00.630> Andrew<00:04:00.959> asks<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.500> use<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.890> return

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
now Andrew asks can I use to return

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.039 
now Andrew asks can I use to return
pumps<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.670> different<00:04:02.970> sizes<00:04:03.150> different

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
pumps of different sizes different

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.319 
pumps of different sizes different
gallons<00:04:04.440> per<00:04:04.590> hour<00:04:04.650> if<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.640> how<00:04:05.880> do<00:04:05.940> i<00:04:06.060> plumb

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
gallons per hour if so how do i plumb

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.819 
gallons per hour if so how do i plumb
them<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:06.750> they<00:04:06.870> aren't<00:04:07.019> pumping<00:04:07.380> against<00:04:07.739> each

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
them so they aren't pumping against each

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.610 
them so they aren't pumping against each
other<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.400> two<00:04:08.760> returns<00:04:09.120> well<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.200> if

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
other I have two returns well and you if

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.500 
other I have two returns well and you if
you<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:10.829> two<00:04:11.010> pumps<00:04:11.400> ideally<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.299> want<00:04:12.450> to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
you have two pumps ideally you want to

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.750 
you have two pumps ideally you want to
plumb<00:04:12.750> them<00:04:12.930> each<00:04:13.139> in<00:04:13.440> into<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> tank<00:04:14.519> via

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
plumb them each in into the tank via

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.580 
plumb them each in into the tank via
their<00:04:15.000> own<00:04:15.209> return<00:04:15.569> line<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.049> they<00:04:16.139> don't<00:04:16.320> risk

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
their own return line so they don't risk

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.680 
their own return line so they don't risk
fighting<00:04:17.039> each<00:04:17.190> other<00:04:17.340> if<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.180> really<00:04:18.510> have

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
fighting each other if you really have

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.300 
fighting each other if you really have
only<00:04:18.840> one<00:04:19.139> return<00:04:19.470> line<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> tank<00:04:20.100> you

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
only one return line in the tank you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.850 
only one return line in the tank you
don't<00:04:20.489> want<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.700> make<00:04:20.850> two<00:04:21.139> then<00:04:22.139> you<00:04:22.620> need<00:04:22.770> to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
don't want to make two then you need to

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.770 
don't want to make two then you need to
put<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.010> check<00:04:23.280> valve<00:04:23.310> on<00:04:23.669> each<00:04:23.880> pump<00:04:24.240> which

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
put a check valve on each pump which

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.719 
put a check valve on each pump which
will<00:04:24.810> prevent<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.349> water<00:04:25.530> from<00:04:25.710> pumping<00:04:26.550> down

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
will prevent the water from pumping down

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.999 
will prevent the water from pumping down
into<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.210> other<00:04:27.330> one<00:04:27.539> but<00:04:27.990> really<00:04:28.110> it's<00:04:28.349> not

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
into the other one but really it's not

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.679 
into the other one but really it's not
aliens<00:04:29.279> efficient<00:04:29.759> of<00:04:29.819> a<00:04:29.909> way<00:04:30.029> of<00:04:30.059> doing<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.539> so

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
aliens efficient of a way of doing it so

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.290 
aliens efficient of a way of doing it so
without<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.199> doubt<00:04:31.439> you're<00:04:31.710> best<00:04:32.009> off<00:04:32.249> to<00:04:32.610> send

without a doubt you're best off to send

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.329 
without a doubt you're best off to send
each<00:04:33.479> pump<00:04:33.809> into<00:04:34.379> the<00:04:34.409> aquarium<00:04:34.830> with<00:04:34.979> its<00:04:35.159> own

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:35.339 
each pump into the aquarium with its own

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:38.089 
each pump into the aquarium with its own
separate<00:04:35.969> return<00:04:36.300> line<00:04:36.479> well<00:04:37.469> guys<00:04:37.619> that's<00:04:37.919> it
