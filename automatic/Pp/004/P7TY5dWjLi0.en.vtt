00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.620
FLIPZ: In the beginning eight of the top B-Boys
in the world traveled to Los Angeles to prove

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.879
they have the technique, power and style to
be crowned the best all around B-Boy. But

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.000
only one will be champion of the Arena. This
is the road to the finals.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:53.780
FLIPZ: The quarter finals was an incredible
showcase of the skill and artistry of breaking.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.449
The judges were looking for the complete package,
flavor with technique, style with power and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.280
an understanding and respect of how breaking
culture is a part of their every move.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.530
ASIA ONE: This specific type of battle is
probably the the best platform you can have

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.310
for something like this, because in a lot
of other events the competitors are just,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.950
they're not well rounded, like they're
they're only strong in their dynamics or

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.289
they're only strong in in crew routines. And
I look for the most well rounded B-Boy or

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.649
B-Girl that aâ€¦has the most style and is
battling the hardest.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.649
ABSTRAK: I don't look just for the moves,
I look for the whole, the whole package. A

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.490
lot of other competitions that I've seen,
people have won over just flipping and doing

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.939
big moves and not overall style.
CRAZY LEGS: The level of competition is pretty

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.939
high. Without a doubt you can lose against
any one of the people that are in this competition

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.229
today.
FLIPZ: The quarter final battles were intense.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.429
In the end Gravity, El Nino, Floor Phantom
and Morris would move on to the semi finals.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.429
The semi finals proved why this dance was
so dynamic. Art, history and culture all reflected

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.800
in one form.
GRAVITY: B-Boying is just, it's just beyond

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.800
this ah this thing that people see. It's
it's beyond head spins and windmills and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.860
dancing.
FLOOR PHANTOM: Breaking in a sense is a synergy

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.280
of this extreme cataclysmic crash of artistic
expression.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.040
GRAVITY: When we break we truly don't just
move, we express freely beyond what people

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.240
can really understand.
EL NINO: It is not just a dance, it's a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.140
lifestyle, you know what I mean?
KID GLYDE: I like adding to the culture. You

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.520
know cause I think that's a responsibility
for every B-Boy is to you know leave their

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.340
mark, to make sure that you know you contribute
to the dance.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.610
FLOOR PHANTOM: To me the history is is very
very important. If you don't know where

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.290
you come from, you're not you're not gonna
know where you're going and you're not

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.580
gonna understand where you're gonna take
the movement.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.930
FLIPZ: Semi finals number one paired Morris
and Floor Phantom. It was an epic showdown

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.610
of old school skills versus new school dynamics.
In semi finals number two Gravity squared

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.190
off against El Nino. It was a battle that
left a lasting impression on the judges.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.730
ASIA ONE: That was probably the hypest battle
I've seen yet.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.280
CRAZY LEGS: Both of you brothers are beasts,
just straight up beasts.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.680
FLIPZ: In the end Morris and El Nino proved
to the judges that they have what it takes,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.080
fundamentals, dynamics and style. The stage
is set for the first ever final of the Arena.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.180
Morris or El Nino, who will be named best
all around B-Boy and champion of the Arena.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.030
MORRIS: You battle me, I'm coming for you.
EL NINO: Yo, Morris. I'm coming for you,

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.450
son. I'm coming for that W.
MORRIS: No more playing games. Whoever wins,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.019
it's gonna be a hard battle.
