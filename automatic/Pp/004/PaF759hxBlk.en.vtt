00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hello well this video is about how to

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.010 
hello well this video is about how to
attract<00:00:04.440> more<00:00:05.069> money<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:05.910> are<00:00:06.210> these<00:00:06.779> are

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
attract more money this are these are

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.230 
attract more money this are these are
three<00:00:07.440> different<00:00:08.189> little<00:00:08.670> things<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:09.030> I've

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
three different little things that I've

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.930 
three different little things that I've
learned<00:00:09.269> while<00:00:10.230> listening<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.130> Abrahamic

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
learned while listening to the Abrahamic

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.169 
learned while listening to the Abrahamic
CDs<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.920> I<00:00:13.920> wanted<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.429> share<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:14.880> you

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
CDs and I wanted to share that with you

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.960 
CDs and I wanted to share that with you
so<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:16.410> little<00:00:16.710> thing<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:17.670> is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
so one little thing that we can do is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000 
so one little thing that we can do is
they<00:00:18.390> were<00:00:18.480> explaining<00:00:18.869> how<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.350> could<00:00:19.710> carry

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
they were explaining how we could carry

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.759 
they were explaining how we could carry
a<00:00:20.430> hundred-dollar<00:00:21.090> bill<00:00:21.119> around<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.529> our

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
a hundred-dollar bill around in our

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.050 
a hundred-dollar bill around in our
wallet<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:24.410> just<00:00:25.410> leave<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.859> there<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.430> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
wallet and just leave it there and and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.300 
wallet and just leave it there and and
every<00:00:27.480> day<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:28.080> emotionally<00:00:28.859> spend

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
every day you know emotionally spend

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.930 
every day you know emotionally spend
those<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.699> hundred<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.510> hundred<00:00:30.570> dollars<00:00:31.940> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
those one hundred one hundred dollars so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.520 
those one hundred one hundred dollars so
maybe<00:00:33.270> by<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> end<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> day<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.230> know

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
maybe by the end of the day you know

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.110 
maybe by the end of the day you know
you're<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.890> spending<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.610> thousand

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
you're actually spending a thousand

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.560 
you're actually spending a thousand
dollars<00:00:36.570> ten<00:00:36.960> thousand<00:00:37.440> dollars<00:00:38.030> but<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.300> are

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
dollars ten thousand dollars but you are

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.720 
dollars ten thousand dollars but you are
instead<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.530> seeing<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.309> cannot

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
instead of seeing you know I cannot

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
instead of seeing you know I cannot
afford<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.690> answer<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.079> you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
afford this and I can answer that you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.130 
afford this and I can answer that you
start<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:45.739> just<00:00:46.739> becoming

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
start to really just becoming

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
start to really just becoming
vibrationally<00:00:49.190> aligned<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> fact<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
vibrationally aligned with the fact that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.220 
vibrationally aligned with the fact that
yes<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.320> spend<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.840> buy<00:00:55.170> this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
yes you can spend that you can buy this

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.639 
yes you can spend that you can buy this
and<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.550> brings<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and so it brings more so that's one of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
and so it brings more so that's one of
their<00:00:58.920> thing<00:00:59.160> hundred-dollar<00:00:59.640> bill<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> then

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
their thing hundred-dollar bill and then

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.479 
their thing hundred-dollar bill and then
the<00:01:00.329> second<00:01:00.719> thing<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:01.530> said<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the second thing they said is to have a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.710 
the second thing they said is to have a
checkbook<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.860> just<00:01:04.860> every<00:01:05.670> day<00:01:05.850> put<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
checkbook and just every day put a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.500 
checkbook and just every day put a
thousand-dollar<00:01:07.380> virtual<00:01:08.340> dollars<00:01:08.670> inside

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
thousand-dollar virtual dollars inside

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.310 
thousand-dollar virtual dollars inside
that<00:01:09.720> account<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.689> actually<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that account so actually not on the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.230 
that account so actually not on the
first<00:01:13.530> day<00:01:13.860> two<00:01:14.369> thousand<00:01:14.729> dollars<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
first day two thousand dollars on the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810 
first day two thousand dollars on the
second<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.750> 2000<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> goes<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.369> one

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
second it's 2000 so it goes like one

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.260 
second it's 2000 so it goes like one
thousand<00:01:18.240> dollar<00:01:18.450> increments<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> then

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
thousand dollar increments so and then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
thousand dollar increments so and then
you<00:01:21.420> spin<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.740> spend<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.340> amount<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you spin it so you spend that amount of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.230 
you spin it so you spend that amount of
money<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.659> also<00:01:24.930> helps<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.240> raise

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
money and that also helps you to raise

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.039 
money and that also helps you to raise
your<00:01:27.350> vibrational<00:01:29.150> level<00:01:30.150> around<00:01:30.509> money<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
your vibrational level around money and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.800 
your vibrational level around money and
then<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.920> favorite<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.750> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
then my favorite that I'm going to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.330 
then my favorite that I'm going to
definitely<00:01:34.049> apply<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
definitely apply it's one of the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
definitely apply it's one of the
practice<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.030> my<00:01:36.210> take<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.439> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
practice on my take I'm not just for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
practice on my take I'm not just for
money<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.240> things<00:01:39.360> he

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
money but for a lot of other things he

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
money but for a lot of other things he
said<00:01:40.409> they<00:01:40.530> say<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.159> important<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
said they say it was very important to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
said they say it was very important to
not<00:01:42.570> very<00:01:42.840> important<00:01:43.350> shouldn't<00:01:43.619> make<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
not very important shouldn't make it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.870 
not very important shouldn't make it
that<00:01:44.070> serious<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.549> um<00:01:45.390> what<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
that serious but um what you do is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
that serious but um what you do is
vibrate<00:01:48.320> like<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:49.710> money<00:01:50.100> for

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
vibrate like think about money for

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.600 
vibrate like think about money for
example<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.259> really<00:01:52.259> feel<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.520> know

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
example and really feel it as you know

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
example and really feel it as you know
abundance<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.360> there

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
abundance is there

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
abundance is there
and<00:01:56.159> you're<00:01:56.340> living<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.600> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
and you're living it and you just so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.740 
and you're living it and you just so
okay<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:58.469> vibrating<00:01:58.680> at<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.250> level

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
okay so you're vibrating at that level

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.249 
okay so you're vibrating at that level
for<00:02:00.750> 17<00:02:01.590> seconds<00:02:02.100> 17<00:02:02.700> seconds<00:02:03.090> right<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.990> least

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
for 17 seconds 17 seconds right at least

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.449 
for 17 seconds 17 seconds right at least
and<00:02:05.000> what<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.869> would<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:08.250> can

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
and what you do is it you would you can

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.309 
and what you do is it you would you can
do<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.849> how<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> interpreted<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.899> least<00:02:10.110> is

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
do this how I interpreted at least is
