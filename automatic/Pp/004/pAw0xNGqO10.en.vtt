 35 years he owns a grocery 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.739
 in the heart of london 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.270

 Italian is called parma ham 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 of wine 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.809

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.089
 good fat because it's sweet must be 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.210
 sliced ​​this way and you can 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:07.820
 eat figs with melon 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.820
 any kind of sweet fruit is fine 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.400
 great once i start not 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.100
 is the bresaola and beef 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.789

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.909
 valtellina 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.490
 elena is completely different from the pig 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.850
 because there is no trace of fat but 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 however a consistency 11 is required 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.469
 slice it finely 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.659
 in this way you can eat alone 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.350
 or you can put on 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.869
 parmesan flakes 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.100

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.090

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.610
 need nothing else 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.470
