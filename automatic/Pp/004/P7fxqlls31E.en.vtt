color<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.750> show<00:01:30.960> through<00:01:31.520> this<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:32.700> ensure

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
color to show through this will ensure

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.910 
color to show through this will ensure
that<00:01:33.270> once<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.659> crackle<00:01:34.170> our<00:01:34.290> piece<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that once we crackle our piece with the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
that once we crackle our piece with the
second<00:01:35.310> coat<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> paint<00:01:35.610> we'll<00:01:36.329> still<00:01:36.600> see

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
second coat of paint we'll still see

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:46.160 
second coat of paint we'll still see
some<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> one

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.749 

so<00:01:47.170> as<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.829> see<00:01:47.979> we<00:01:48.189> completed<00:01:48.520> our<00:01:48.700> first

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
so as you can see we completed our first

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.929 
so as you can see we completed our first
coat<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.240> vintage<00:01:49.750> on<00:01:49.990> our<00:01:50.289> table<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.189> it's

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
coat of vintage on our table and it's

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.789 
coat of vintage on our table and it's
only<00:01:52.090> about<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.420> half<00:01:52.630> hour<00:01:52.869> later<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.590> it's

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
only about a half hour later and it's

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.850 
only about a half hour later and it's
already<00:01:54.130> dry<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.610> touch<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.649> next

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
already dry to the touch so the next

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.359 
already dry to the touch so the next
step<00:01:57.189> is<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.909> lightly<00:01:58.329> apply<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.920> cargo

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
step is to lightly apply the cargo

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.999 
step is to lightly apply the cargo
medium<00:02:01.950> over<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.069> entire<00:02:03.429> table<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.860> don't

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
medium over the entire table you don't

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.540 
medium over the entire table you don't
really<00:02:06.250> need<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.520> real<00:02:06.759> heavy<00:02:07.060> coat<00:02:07.299> of<00:02:07.450> s<00:02:08.550> just

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
really need a real heavy coat of s just

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:27.479 
really need a real heavy coat of s just
enough<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.360> kind<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.890> lightly<00:02:11.890> coat<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.310> it's

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
enough to kind of lightly coat so it's

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.070 
enough to kind of lightly coat so it's
been<00:02:27.640> about<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.880> half<00:02:28.060> hour<00:02:28.299> since<00:02:28.780> we<00:02:28.989> applied

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
been about a half hour since we applied

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.920 
been about a half hour since we applied
the<00:02:29.560> crackle<00:02:30.099> finish<00:02:30.220> over<00:02:30.700> our<00:02:30.849> table<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.750> it

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
the crackle finish over our table and it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.390 
the crackle finish over our table and it
looks<00:02:32.079> like<00:02:32.260> it's<00:02:32.410> pretty<00:02:32.560> much<00:02:32.799> dry<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
looks like it's pretty much dry to the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.050 
looks like it's pretty much dry to the
touch<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.290> mentioned<00:02:35.769> for<00:02:36.430> my<00:02:36.579> top<00:02:36.819> coat

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
touch so as I mentioned for my top coat

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.940 
touch so as I mentioned for my top coat
I<00:02:37.090> chose<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.720> color<00:02:37.930> refreshing<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.739> just

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
I chose the color refreshing I just

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.470 
I chose the color refreshing I just
thought<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.160> was<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.280> nice<00:02:39.519> contrast<00:02:40.090> with<00:02:40.450> that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
thought it was a nice contrast with that

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.370 
thought it was a nice contrast with that
pale<00:02:41.200> vintage<00:02:41.799> blue<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.840> weight<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.290> our

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
pale vintage blue so the weight of our

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.599 
pale vintage blue so the weight of our
top<00:02:44.709> coat<00:02:45.069> depends<00:02:45.850> on<00:02:46.030> how<00:02:46.630> thick<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.739> large

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
top coat depends on how thick and large

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.559 
top coat depends on how thick and large
we<00:02:49.150> want<00:02:49.420> our<00:02:49.540> cracks<00:02:50.109> to<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.609> so<00:02:51.609> I<00:02:51.940> want<00:02:52.510> to

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
through and you get a peek at what that

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.860 
through and you get a peek at what that
dry<00:03:59.410> brushing<00:03:59.950> did<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.460> addition<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:01.210> the

crackle effect definitely makes this

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.170 
crackle effect definitely makes this
look<00:04:05.320> like<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.530> period<00:04:06.070> piece<00:04:06.100> that's<00:04:07.000> been
