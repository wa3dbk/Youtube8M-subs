00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
hi hi erm here one of the problems that

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.269 
hi hi erm here one of the problems that
my<00:00:15.770> buddies<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:16.279> I<00:00:16.369> have<00:00:16.640> is<00:00:16.960> what<00:00:17.960> to<00:00:18.110> do<00:00:18.290> with

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
my buddies and I have is what to do with

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.390 
my buddies and I have is what to do with
the<00:00:19.550> butane<00:00:20.210> tanks<00:00:20.779> after<00:00:21.770> we're<00:00:22.189> done<00:00:22.340> with

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
the butane tanks after we're done with

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.300 
the butane tanks after we're done with
them<00:00:22.730> around<00:00:23.599> here<00:00:24.110> we<00:00:24.230> have<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.560> pay<00:00:24.770> somebody

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
them around here we have to pay somebody

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.910 
them around here we have to pay somebody
to<00:00:25.400> take<00:00:26.119> these<00:00:26.390> we<00:00:26.630> can't<00:00:26.900> just<00:00:27.140> recycle<00:00:27.770> them

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
to take these we can't just recycle them

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.480 
to take these we can't just recycle them
or<00:00:28.070> throw<00:00:28.279> them<00:00:28.340> in<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.550> trash<00:00:30.010> but<00:00:31.010> I<00:00:31.250> found

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
or throw them in the trash but I found

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.570 
or throw them in the trash but I found
something<00:00:32.500> over<00:00:33.500> at<00:00:33.620> Cabela's<00:00:34.129> that<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.309> think

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
something over at Cabela's that I think

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.229 
something over at Cabela's that I think
might<00:00:34.760> solve<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:36.080> called<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.500> crunch<00:00:36.890> it

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
might solve that it's called a crunch it

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.110 
might solve that it's called a crunch it
butane<00:00:38.239> canister<00:00:38.900> recycling<00:00:39.680> tool<00:00:40.000> put<00:00:41.000> out

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
butane canister recycling tool put out

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.500 
butane canister recycling tool put out
by<00:00:41.330> Jetboil<00:00:41.900> I<00:00:42.140> guess<00:00:42.940> it's<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:44.000> little<00:00:44.270> tool

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
by Jetboil I guess it's a little tool

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.920 
by Jetboil I guess it's a little tool
that<00:00:45.280> is<00:00:46.280> supposed<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.820> punch<00:00:47.120> holes<00:00:47.390> in<00:00:47.780> the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
that is supposed to punch holes in the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.760 
that is supposed to punch holes in the
can<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:49.040> that<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.280> can<00:00:49.460> recycle<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:50.710> recycle<00:00:51.710> a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
can so that you can recycle it recycle a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.540 
can so that you can recycle it recycle a
can<00:00:51.980> rather<00:00:52.309> just<00:00:53.000> like<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.329> recycle<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
can rather just like you recycle the

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.819 
can rather just like you recycle the
canister<00:00:55.550> just<00:00:55.579> like<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.059> would<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.239> can<00:00:56.829> so

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
canister just like you would a can so

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.310 
canister just like you would a can so
now<00:00:57.950> what<00:00:58.250> I'm<00:00:58.399> doing<00:00:58.730> now<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.289> might<00:01:00.289> be

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
now what I'm doing now is might be

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.110 
now what I'm doing now is might be
considered<00:01:00.950> dangerous<00:01:01.100> by<00:01:01.399> some<00:01:01.760> people

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
considered dangerous by some people

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.359 
considered dangerous by some people
don't<00:01:02.420> do<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:02.809> indoors<00:01:03.320> I've<00:01:04.009> made<00:01:04.339> sure

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
don't do this indoors I've made sure

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.900 
don't do this indoors I've made sure
that<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:04.910> thing<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.270> empty<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.729> like<00:01:07.729> I've

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
that this thing is empty and like I've

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.330 
that this thing is empty and like I've
said<00:01:07.940> before<00:01:08.240> I'm<00:01:08.690> an<00:01:08.840> idiot<00:01:09.200> but<00:01:09.950> I'm<00:01:10.009> doing

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
said before I'm an idiot but I'm doing

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.210 
said before I'm an idiot but I'm doing
it<00:01:10.490> inside<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.240> that<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.660> can<00:01:12.500> get<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.710> good<00:01:12.950> video

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
it inside so that I can get a good video

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.490 
it inside so that I can get a good video
of<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:14.590> but<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.680> make<00:01:15.860> sure<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:16.400> empty

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
of it but you make sure that it's empty

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.990 
of it but you make sure that it's empty
just<00:01:18.500> by<00:01:18.650> opening<00:01:19.010> up<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.310> port<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.790> seeing

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
just by opening up the port and seeing

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.940 
just by opening up the port and seeing
if<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.180> can<00:01:20.330> light<00:01:20.510> it<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.810> listen<00:01:21.260> there

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
if we can light it and listen there

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.359 
if we can light it and listen there
wasn't<00:01:22.220> anything<00:01:22.400> left<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:23.000> here<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:25.250> is

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
wasn't anything left in here this is

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.940 
wasn't anything left in here this is
just<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.820> little<00:01:26.450> tool<00:01:26.689> has<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:26.990> threaded<00:01:27.710> on

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
just a little tool has a threaded on

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.910 
just a little tool has a threaded on
part<00:01:28.310> here<00:01:29.049> hopefully<00:01:30.049> this<00:01:30.170> little<00:01:30.320> focus

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
part here hopefully this little focus

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.929 
part here hopefully this little focus
and<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:32.890> sharp<00:01:33.890> looks<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.310> church<00:01:34.610> key

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
and a sharp looks like a church key

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.870 
and a sharp looks like a church key
almost<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.740> what<00:01:36.890> you're<00:01:37.040> supposed<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.460> do<00:01:37.670> is

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
almost so what you're supposed to do is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.760 
almost so what you're supposed to do is
just<00:01:38.799> thread<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.979> tool<00:01:40.189> onto<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.909> canister

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
just thread the tool onto the canister

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.120 
just thread the tool onto the canister
and<00:01:43.360> listen<00:01:44.360> there's<00:01:45.079> a<00:01:45.200> hole<00:01:45.380> on<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.650> side<00:01:45.770> of

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
and listen there's a hole on the side of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.120 
and listen there's a hole on the side of
this<00:01:46.250> threaded<00:01:46.759> part<00:01:47.110> that<00:01:48.110> if<00:01:48.590> there's<00:01:48.920> any

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
this threaded part that if there's any

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.460 
this threaded part that if there's any
fuel<00:01:49.790> left<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:50.270> here

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.969 

nope<00:01:58.470> nothing<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:01.320> should<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> hissed

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
nope nothing it should have hissed

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
see it here there's a little hole on the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.230 
see it here there's a little hole on the
side<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.909> threaded<00:02:06.450> part<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
side of this threaded part so what you

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.470 
side of this threaded part so what you
do<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.660> thread<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
do is just thread that on like that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.580 
do is just thread that on like that
and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.810> says<00:02:13.820> push<00:02:14.820> down<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.590> so

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
and then it just says push down on it so

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.850 
and then it just says push down on it so
let's<00:02:16.800> see<00:02:16.950> what<00:02:17.100> happens<00:02:19.010> cool<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.709> it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
let's see what happens cool so it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.740 
let's see what happens cool so it
punched<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:23.640> hole<00:02:24.860> fairly<00:02:25.860> easily

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
punched the little hole fairly easily

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.280 
punched the little hole fairly easily
just<00:02:27.750> turn<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.170> little<00:02:28.200> bit<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:30.020> press<00:02:31.020> on

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
just turn it a little bit and press on

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.810 
just turn it a little bit and press on
it<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.650> punches<00:02:34.890> holes<00:02:35.220> into<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
it and it punches holes into the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.890 
it and it punches holes into the
canister<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.380> anybody<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:38.010> see<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.900> it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
canister so that anybody can see that it

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.790
