and yeah a very broad range actually day
today<00:01:16.079> for<00:01:16.880> instance<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.360> project<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
today for instance one project that I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.560 
today for instance one project that I
was<00:01:19.200> working<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> sort<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.399> almost<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
was working on this is sort of almost a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
was working on this is sort of almost a
scope<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.079> got<00:01:22.229> given<00:01:22.469> this<00:01:22.649> is<00:01:22.799> came<00:01:23.310> out

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
scope that we got given this is came out

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.600 
scope that we got given this is came out
at<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.640> inside<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.299> pressure<00:01:24.840> vessel<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
at the inside of a pressure vessel and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.560 
at the inside of a pressure vessel and
and<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.840> needed<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.469> replaced<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:30.000> we

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and it needed to be replaced and so we

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.099 
and it needed to be replaced and so we
had<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> find<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> old<00:01:31.289> old<00:01:31.860> drawings<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
had to find the old old drawings and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.550 
had to find the old old drawings and
build<00:01:34.109> a<00:01:34.200> new<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.950> guess<00:01:35.189> also<00:01:36.000> from

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
build a new one and I guess also from

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.770 
build a new one and I guess also from
some<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.859> hints<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.119> fatigue<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
some of the hints of the fatigue and the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.160 
some of the hints of the fatigue and the
net<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.289> this<00:01:40.530> part<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> could<00:01:41.670> work<00:01:41.850> out

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
net on this part here you could work out

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.300 
net on this part here you could work out
why<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.229> fell<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> first<00:01:44.039> place<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
why it fell in the first place and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.419 
why it fell in the first place and
therefore<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> new<00:01:46.219> structure<00:01:47.219> we

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
therefore with the new structure we

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.249 
therefore with the new structure we
built<00:01:47.670> were<00:01:47.820> made<00:01:48.030> sure<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.600> address<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:49.229> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
built were made sure to address some of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.959 
built were made sure to address some of
these<00:01:49.439> issues<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.070> hopefully<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.820> new

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
these issues so that hopefully the new

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.870 
these issues so that hopefully the new
one<00:01:51.090> will<00:01:51.240> last<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.719> lot<00:01:52.170> longer

wanted a Ferrari otherwise you might get

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.040 
wanted a Ferrari otherwise you might get
bored<00:03:08.840> i'll<00:03:10.090> tell<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.510> first<00:03:11.630> one<00:03:11.840> i<00:03:11.870> was

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
bored i'll tell you the first one i was

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.050 
bored i'll tell you the first one i was
i'm<00:03:12.260> working<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.830> involving<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.819> little

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
i'm working on is involving this little

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.380 
i'm working on is involving this little
thing<00:03:14.209> which<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.100> grundfos<00:03:16.100> pump<00:03:16.239> which<00:03:17.239> is

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
thing which is a grundfos pump which is

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.270 
thing which is a grundfos pump which is
going<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.660> replace<00:03:18.940> those<00:03:20.140> bigger<00:03:21.220> sort<00:03:22.220> of

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
going to replace those bigger sort of

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.080 
going to replace those bigger sort of
motors<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:23.470> only<00:03:24.470> work<00:03:25.130> by<00:03:25.340> fixed<00:03:25.670> speed<00:03:25.850> and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
motors that only work by fixed speed and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.979 
motors that only work by fixed speed and
what<00:03:26.870> happens<00:03:27.260> here<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.220> digital

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
what happens here is this is a digital

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.160 
what happens here is this is a digital
pump<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:31.430> see<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.209> size<00:03:32.450> convention<00:03:33.050> is

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
pump and see the size convention is

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.960 
pump and see the size convention is
quite<00:03:33.650> good<00:03:33.739> as<00:03:33.860> well<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.430> what<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.790> does<00:03:34.819> is

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
quite good as well and what it does is

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.370 
quite good as well and what it does is
you<00:03:35.180> can<00:03:35.330> control<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.560> amount<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:36.920> dosing<00:03:37.700> of

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
you can control the amount of dosing of

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.130 
you can control the amount of dosing of
chemicals<00:03:39.380> into<00:03:39.650> our<00:03:39.680> water<00:03:39.980> instead<00:03:40.970> of

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
chemicals into our water instead of

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.180 
chemicals into our water instead of
instead<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.200> having<00:03:42.380> accessed<00:03:42.739> at<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.920> constant

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
instead of having accessed at a constant

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.190 
instead of having accessed at a constant
rate<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.670> can<00:03:43.700> you<00:03:44.450> can<00:03:44.600> always<00:03:44.900> look<00:03:45.050> at<00:03:45.140> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
rate you can you can always look at the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.870 
rate you can you can always look at the
amount<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.590> water<00:03:45.800> that's<00:03:46.160> coming<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.670> and

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
amount of water that's coming in and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.740 
amount of water that's coming in and
dose<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.989> accordingly<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:49.540> it's<00:03:50.540> very

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
dose it accordingly and it's very

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.690 
dose it accordingly and it's very
accurate<00:03:50.900> as<00:03:51.170> well

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700

plants or looking at improving things

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.330 
plants or looking at improving things
like<00:04:07.510> can<00:04:07.900> we<00:04:08.050> reduce<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.860> amount<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.160> energy

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
like can we reduce the amount of energy

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.330 
like can we reduce the amount of energy
it<00:04:09.580> takes<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.060> make<00:04:10.480> our<00:04:10.660> products<00:04:11.020> or<00:04:11.500> can<00:04:12.190> we

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
it takes to make our products or can we

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.790 
it takes to make our products or can we
make<00:04:12.550> it<00:04:12.580> more<00:04:12.730> environmentally<00:04:13.690> friendly

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
make it more environmentally friendly

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.220 
make it more environmentally friendly
can<00:04:14.800> we<00:04:14.920> reduce<00:04:15.100> our<00:04:15.430> chemical<00:04:15.850> uses<00:04:16.750> so<00:04:17.110> we

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
can we reduce our chemical uses so we

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.830 
can we reduce our chemical uses so we
can<00:04:17.350> make<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.650> product<00:04:17.950> cheaper<00:04:18.190> or<00:04:18.820> can<00:04:19.720> we

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
can make the product cheaper or can we

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.350 
can make the product cheaper or can we
increase<00:04:20.200> capacity<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:21.040> make<00:04:21.400> more<00:04:21.640> pulp<00:04:21.940> and

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
increase capacity and make more pulp and

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.750 
increase capacity and make more pulp and
one<00:04:23.320> of<00:04:23.440> our<00:04:23.530> chemical<00:04:23.950> plants<00:04:24.280> we<00:04:24.430> currently

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
one of our chemical plants we currently

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.670 
one of our chemical plants we currently
have<00:04:24.940> an<00:04:25.090> excess<00:04:25.450> of<00:04:25.630> hydrogen<00:04:26.110> gas<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:26.650> is

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
have an excess of hydrogen gas that is

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.280 
have an excess of hydrogen gas that is
produced<00:04:26.890> in<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.460> plant<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.540> one<00:04:29.050> of<00:04:29.170> my

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
produced in the plant and so one of my

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.530 
produced in the plant and so one of my
projects<00:04:29.740> has<00:04:29.890> been<00:04:30.040> looking<00:04:30.370> into

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
projects has been looking into

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.430 
projects has been looking into
alternative<00:04:31.540> ways<00:04:31.690> we<00:04:31.900> could<00:04:32.020> use<00:04:32.230> that

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
alternative ways we could use that

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.830 
alternative ways we could use that
hydrogen<00:04:32.940> currently<00:04:33.940> it's<00:04:34.120> just<00:04:34.360> vented<00:04:34.720> to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
hydrogen currently it's just vented to

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.990 
hydrogen currently it's just vented to
atmosphere<00:04:34.870> but<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:36.100> energy<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.910> we

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
atmosphere but that's energy that we

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.270 
atmosphere but that's energy that we
could<00:04:37.120> use<00:04:37.150> elsewhere<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:38.230> I've<00:04:38.470> been<00:04:39.010> looking

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
could use elsewhere so I've been looking

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.800 
could use elsewhere so I've been looking
into<00:04:39.430> whether<00:04:39.640> we<00:04:40.000> confirm<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:40.750> a

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
into whether we confirm that and a

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.350 
into whether we confirm that and a
boiler<00:04:41.170> and<00:04:41.350> use<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.190> for<00:04:42.400> heat<00:04:42.820> energy<00:04:43.090> to

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
boiler and use it for heat energy to

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.740 
boiler and use it for heat energy to
create<00:04:43.510> steam<00:04:43.960> or<00:04:44.560> other<00:04:45.070> possible<00:04:45.670> uses<00:04:46.060> like

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
create steam or other possible uses like

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.290 
create steam or other possible uses like
maybe<00:04:47.020> we<00:04:47.260> can<00:04:47.380> make<00:04:47.530> another<00:04:47.950> product<00:04:48.730> using

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
maybe we can make another product using

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.050 
maybe we can make another product using
hydrogen

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.730 

one<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.780> things<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:53.200> like<00:04:53.380> best<00:04:53.560> about

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
one of the things that I like best about

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.190 
one of the things that I like best about
can<00:04:54.220> leaf<00:04:54.370> is<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.880> for<00:04:55.510> me<00:04:55.630> there<00:04:55.810> is<00:04:55.960> no

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
can leaf is it for me there is no

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.650 
can leaf is it for me there is no
typical<00:04:56.410> day<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:57.100> could<00:04:57.940> have<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.419> best

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
typical day I could have the best

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.180 
typical day I could have the best
intentions<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:59.290> be<00:04:59.410> working<00:04:59.710> on<00:04:59.800> one<00:04:59.980> of<00:05:00.010> my

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
intentions to be working on one of my

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.640 
intentions to be working on one of my
projects<00:05:00.639> one<00:05:00.850> day<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.419> come<00:05:01.600> into<00:05:01.720> work<00:05:01.960> go

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
projects one day and I come into work go

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.290 
projects one day and I come into work go
to<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.889> morning<00:05:03.130> meeting<00:05:03.160> find<00:05:03.940> out<00:05:04.120> that

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
to the morning meeting find out that

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.909 
to the morning meeting find out that
there's<00:05:04.450> been<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.630> problem<00:05:04.750> overnight<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:05.590> all

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
there's been a problem overnight and all

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.159 
there's been a problem overnight and all
of<00:05:06.040> a<00:05:06.100> sudden<00:05:06.400> that's<00:05:06.940> at<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.389> day<00:05:07.750> completely

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
of a sudden that's at the day completely

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.170 
of a sudden that's at the day completely
changes<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:09.340> could<00:05:09.490> be<00:05:09.580> looking<00:05:09.880> into

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
changes and I could be looking into

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.180 
changes and I could be looking into
something<00:05:10.840> completely<00:05:10.990> different<00:05:11.470> looking

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
something completely different looking

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.590 
something completely different looking
into<00:05:12.400> an<00:05:12.490> area<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:12.790> I<00:05:12.940> don't<00:05:13.210> know<00:05:13.360> much

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
into an area that I don't know much

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.550 
into an area that I don't know much
about<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:14.139> from<00:05:14.980> then<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.520> have<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.790> learn

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
about and from then you have to learn

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.980 
about and from then you have to learn
what's<00:05:17.560> going<00:05:17.919> on<00:05:18.040> in<00:05:18.190> there<00:05:18.370> what<00:05:18.840> how<00:05:19.840> it
