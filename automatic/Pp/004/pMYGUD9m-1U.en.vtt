00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.300
 very good to all welcome once 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.700
 more to my channel welcome today as you see 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.250
 to fifa 15 and is that I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.020
 that you have not yet seen a tutorial that 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.060
 for what I'm seeing on the internet 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.730
 youtube not the truth that nobody has 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.230
 done and I think for the people who 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.510
 they like spectacular goals over 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.260
 everything is missing is going to take a lot 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.390
 profit we bring as 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.070
 make a foul a foul shot with 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.320
 exterior effect 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.500
 it's better not to confuse it as it happened to 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.450
 the occasional youtuber with throwing a 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.360
 interior effect outside the barrier 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.780
 well for that we 're going to go to game 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.670
 ability 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 to take a look and we'll go to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.110
 faults is worth the final challenge that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.110
 We have several types of launches 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.670
 from far away with barrier and others we are going to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.949
 try here well when choosing 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.360
 player it is important to see the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.640
 characteristics that it has in this case 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.170
 I choose beÃ±at is a player who 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.899
 used multimission to pull 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.380
 faults you see that it has average 80 costs 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.479
 practically discard and yes that is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 true that has some extras to throw 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.830
 very good faults in this case 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.440
 we should focus on the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.240
 power and in the effect that has a 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.820
 very good power but good effect 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.080
 is to be a pitcher of fouls then 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.479
 It's normal but it's useful 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.460
 perfectly fine we go there and we have 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.420
 have to consider one thing and it's the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.000
 following 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.650
 this shot has a very big relationship 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.230
 between the power that we are going to give and 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.810
 the effect is to say more power 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.750
 greater effect is going to be good so 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.670
 both also at a greater distance to the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.670
 goal more effect will carry the ball 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.460
 very important to place 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.100
 the ball we 're not going to call the angle that 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.759
 we are going to give it by making a straight line 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.040
 between the ball and the player's shoulder 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.080
 further away well in this case as 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.140
 our skillful players let us 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.899
 place watching the left side of the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.610
 barrier well once the line is done 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.130
 between the ball and the shoulder we have to 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.530
 move a little more to the left 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.150
 Once this is done, what are we going to do? 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.769
 do is press the l1 or lb because the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.980
 blow has to be done with the instep 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.080
 many people will say good if we give it to 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.209
 with a normal shot we will give you a lot 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.250
 more effect normally in this case not 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.560
 because because normal shooting is done with 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.630
 the inside of the foot if you can do 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.060
 a shot with exterior effect hitting the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.190
 inside of the foot is impossible so 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.440
 we give you both the one or lb 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.830
 and now is where the combination would come 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.510
 difficult it is important to follow it like this 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.210
 because if it is not very irregular the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.570
 result well while we keep this 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:01.220
 pressed button we have to hit the button 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:04.840
 of shooting approximately three stripes and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.760
 just after the button 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.860
 the arrow to which we want to direct the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.310
 ball in this case as the player is 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.870
 right-handed we are going to hit for the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.920
 left of the barrier therefore the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.920
 arrow has to go to the right 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.230
 well up here the tutorial guys already 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.780
 you see what 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.810
 is a very simple tutorial but that gives 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.019
 an incredible effect gives an aspect the 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.819
 true that very spectacular at the time of 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.370
 throw faults and well I hope that I have 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.110
