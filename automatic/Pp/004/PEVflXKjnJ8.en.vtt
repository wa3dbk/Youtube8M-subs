we're<00:00:36.270> playing<00:00:36.510> l5<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:37.469> by<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> way<00:00:38.030> this<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
we're playing l5 here by the way this is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.840 
we're playing l5 here by the way this is
a<00:00:39.210> full<00:00:39.420> ring<00:00:39.600> table<00:00:40.250> but<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.399> wish<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.760> we're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
a full ring table but I wish that we're

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.920 
a full ring table but I wish that we're
playing<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> little<00:00:42.149> bit<00:00:42.360> short-handed

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
playing a little bit short-handed

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.139 
playing a little bit short-handed
there's<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:44.190> seven<00:00:44.520> people<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> table

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
there's what seven people at the table

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.750 
there's what seven people at the table
so<00:00:45.270> there's<00:00:45.420> two<00:00:45.570> empty<00:00:45.719> seats<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.460> obviously

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so there's two empty seats but obviously

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.950 
so there's two empty seats but obviously
we<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> premium<00:00:48.210> man<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.750> really

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
we have a premium man so it really

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
we have a premium man so it really
doesn't<00:00:49.170> make<00:00:49.260> any<00:00:49.469> difference<00:00:49.850> whichever

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
doesn't make any difference whichever

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 
doesn't make any difference whichever
game<00:00:51.120> or<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.170> how<00:00:52.379> many<00:00:52.500> people<00:00:52.680> are<00:00:52.770> at

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
game or you know how many people are at

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.240 
game or you know how many people are at
the<00:00:52.890> table

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the table

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.540 
the table
we're<00:00:53.760> obviously<00:00:54.239> raising<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:55.550> isolating

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
we're obviously raising it up isolating

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
we're obviously raising it up isolating
the<00:00:56.789> fish<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> great<00:00:58.140> hand

now of course you know if you watch any

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.520 
now of course you know if you watch any
of<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:28.979> videos<00:01:29.720> anything<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> put<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
of my videos anything that I put out you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980 
of my videos anything that I put out you
know<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> advocate<00:01:32.180> making<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> big<00:01:33.420> bet<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.840> in

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
know I advocate making a big bet here in

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.719 
know I advocate making a big bet here in
general<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> should<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
general I actually think it should be a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.719 
general I actually think it should be a
little<00:01:36.119> bit<00:01:36.240> more<00:01:36.450> than<00:01:36.570> us<00:01:36.720> should<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.110> maybe

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
little bit more than us should be maybe

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.950 
little bit more than us should be maybe
sixty<00:01:38.729> five<00:01:38.909> cents<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.329> something<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
sixty five cents or something like that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.039 
sixty five cents or something like that
typically<00:01:40.439> about<00:01:40.470> 75<00:01:41.280> percent<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:41.960> 80<00:01:42.960> percent

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
typically about 75 percent or 80 percent

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.130 
typically about 75 percent or 80 percent
of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> pot<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.310> I'd<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.990> bet

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of the pot is what I'd like to to bet

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.630 
of the pot is what I'd like to to bet
here<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.439> least<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> couple<00:01:47.250> drawers

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
here at least there are a couple drawers

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
here at least there are a couple drawers
out<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.100> there's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
out here so I think that there's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
out here so I think that there's
definitely<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.479> hands<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> call

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
definitely some hands that they can call

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
definitely some hands that they can call
with<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:53.820> course<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.270> players<00:01:54.540> like

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
with and of course with players like

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.149 
with and of course with players like
this<00:01:55.020> they're<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.530> probably

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
this they're going to be probably

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.230 
this they're going to be probably
playing<00:01:56.670> any<00:01:57.000> ace<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:58.219> it<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.430> allows<00:01:59.549> us<00:01:59.729> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
playing any ace so it just allows us and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.399 
playing any ace so it just allows us and
and<00:02:00.390> they're<00:02:00.509> gonna<00:02:00.600> call<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.899> whole<00:02:01.140> way<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
and they're gonna call the whole way of

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.170 
and they're gonna call the whole way of
course<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.189> allows<00:02:02.399> us<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
course with it so it allows us to to

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.929 
course with it so it allows us to to
just<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> money<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:04.310> quicker<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.610> stack

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
just get the money in quicker and stack

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.719 
just get the money in quicker and stack
them<00:02:06.180> when<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.659> ace<00:02:06.840> deuce<00:02:07.140> ace<00:02:07.560> 3<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> 7

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
them when they have ace deuce ace 3 a 7

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369 
them when they have ace deuce ace 3 a 7
X<00:02:09.390> cetera<00:02:09.869> et<00:02:09.929> cetera

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
X cetera et cetera

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.559 
X cetera et cetera
so

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
so

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.190 
so
we<00:02:13.500> do<00:02:13.650> get<00:02:13.769> Colts<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:15.180> we<00:02:15.420> go<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.659> turn<00:02:15.989> and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
we do get Colts and we go to a turn and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.380 
we do get Colts and we go to a turn and
we<00:02:16.349> get<00:02:16.590> what<00:02:17.220> seems<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.700> be<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.819> fairly

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
we get what seems to be a fairly

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.210 
we get what seems to be a fairly
harmless<00:02:18.870> ten<00:02:19.409> of<00:02:19.530> diamonds<00:02:19.709> doesn't

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
harmless ten of diamonds doesn't

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.539 
harmless ten of diamonds doesn't
completes<00:02:21.560> well<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.650> actually<00:02:22.769> does<00:02:23.099> complete

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
completes well it actually does complete

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.069 
completes well it actually does complete
a<00:02:23.579> straight<00:02:24.000> draw<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.450> should<00:02:24.689> be<00:02:24.780> noted

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
a straight draw that should be noted

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.589 
a straight draw that should be noted
with<00:02:25.500> 87<00:02:26.159> there<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.610> other<00:02:27.060> than<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
with 87 there but other than that and it

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.660 
with 87 there but other than that and it
doesn't<00:02:27.780> complete<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.200> flush<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:29.459> know<00:02:29.549> we

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
doesn't complete the flush you know we

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.089 
doesn't complete the flush you know we
should<00:02:29.879> still<00:02:30.269> be<00:02:30.390> ahead<00:02:30.530> versus<00:02:31.530> most<00:02:31.709> aces

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
should still be ahead versus most aces

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.830 
should still be ahead versus most aces
of<00:02:32.250> course<00:02:32.459> unless<00:02:32.730> he<00:02:32.909> has<00:02:33.030> chased<00:02:33.420> him<00:02:34.579> so<00:02:35.840> he

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
of course unless he has chased him so he

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.930 
of course unless he has chased him so he
does<00:02:37.019> check<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.440> us<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.890> we<00:02:38.489> go<00:02:38.640> ahead<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
does check to us and we go ahead and

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.140

always<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.530> nuts

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
always the nuts

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.430 
always the nuts
Willy<00:03:30.900> do<00:03:31.199> with<00:03:31.530> ace<00:03:31.680> Queen<00:03:31.949> ace<00:03:32.540> Jack<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:34.049> mean

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
Willy do with ace Queen ace Jack I mean

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.189 
Willy do with ace Queen ace Jack I mean
I<00:03:34.829> think<00:03:34.889> it's<00:03:35.879> pretty<00:03:36.239> rare<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.720> mean<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.049> think

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
I think it's pretty rare I mean I think

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.080 
I think it's pretty rare I mean I think
that<00:03:37.440> he's<00:03:37.650> probably<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:38.459> gonna<00:03:38.519> call<00:03:38.879> with

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that he's probably just gonna call with

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.379 
that he's probably just gonna call with
those<00:03:39.299> hands<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:40.019> think<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:41.180> basically<00:03:42.180> the

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
those hands I think that basically the

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.960 
those hands I think that basically the
overwhelming<00:03:43.379> majority<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.980> his<00:03:44.280> range<00:03:44.579> here

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
overwhelming majority of his range here

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.150 
overwhelming majority of his range here
is<00:03:45.120> something<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.989> beats<00:03:46.260> us<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:46.680> now<00:03:46.799> it's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
is something that beats us so now it's

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.770 
is something that beats us so now it's
difficult<00:03:47.609> of<00:03:47.730> course<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.030> understand<00:03:48.419> what

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
difficult of course to understand what

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.309 
difficult of course to understand what
he<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.049> have<00:03:49.290> here<00:03:50.629> but<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.810> know<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:51.959> mean<00:03:52.260> a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
he was sandbagging something earlier

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.979 
he was sandbagging something earlier
like<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.150> set<00:04:00.599> or<00:04:00.930> even<00:04:01.440> an<00:04:01.530> 89<00:04:01.919> or<00:04:01.949> an<00:04:02.159> 86<00:04:02.579> I<00:04:02.989> know

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.629 
like a set or even an 89 or an 86 I know
it's<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.319> very<00:04:04.500> difficult<00:04:04.709> spot<00:04:05.159> we<00:04:05.459> also

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
it's a very difficult spot we also

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.059 
it's a very difficult spot we also
started<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.900> effective<00:04:07.319> stacks<00:04:07.530> before<00:04:07.949> the

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
started the effective stacks before the

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.469 
started the effective stacks before the
hand<00:04:08.250> were<00:04:08.400> also<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.699> little<00:04:08.819> bit<00:04:08.970> short<00:04:09.299> he

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
hand were also a little bit short he

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.360 
hand were also a little bit short he
started<00:04:09.780> with<00:04:09.900> 80<00:04:10.139> big<00:04:10.409> blinds<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.010> it's<00:04:11.190> that

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
started with 80 big blinds so it's that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.009 
started with 80 big blinds so it's that
makes<00:04:11.579> it<00:04:11.699> a<00:04:11.790> little<00:04:12.150> bit<00:04:12.389> harder<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.720> get<00:04:12.900> away

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019
