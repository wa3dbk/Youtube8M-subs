things that have great calcium in it and
you<00:04:13.040> can<00:04:13.129> get<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.430> on<00:04:13.819> a<00:04:13.879> plant-based<00:04:14.299> diet<00:04:14.480> but

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
you can get it on a plant-based diet but

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.990 
you can get it on a plant-based diet but
the<00:04:15.590> number<00:04:15.889> here's<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.310> thing<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.669> thing

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
the number here's the thing the thing

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.189 
the number here's the thing the thing
that<00:04:17.269> people<00:04:17.389> are<00:04:17.570> so<00:04:17.660> concerned<00:04:18.049> with

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
that people are so concerned with

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.069 
that people are so concerned with
they're<00:04:18.380> like<00:04:18.410> well<00:04:18.949> I'm<00:04:19.519> gonna<00:04:19.729> my<00:04:20.030> bones<00:04:20.539> and

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
they're like well I'm gonna my bones and

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.050 
they're like well I'm gonna my bones and
you<00:04:21.560> know<00:04:21.650> my<00:04:21.769> human<00:04:22.009> being<00:04:22.250> anemic<00:04:22.580> calcium

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
you know my human being anemic calcium

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.990 
you know my human being anemic calcium
well<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:24.110> think<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.740> reason<00:04:25.160> why<00:04:25.400> that's<00:04:25.820> such

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
well I think the reason why that's such

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.089 
well I think the reason why that's such
a<00:04:26.060> big<00:04:26.270> deal<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.690> us<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:27.080> Inter<00:04:27.259> I<00:04:27.650> know<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:28.009> was

a big deal to us and Inter I know it was

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.420 
a big deal to us and Inter I know it was
a<00:04:28.130> big<00:04:28.340> deal<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.669> me<00:04:28.849> was<00:04:29.240> because<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.650> meat

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
a big deal to me was because of the meat

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.460 
a big deal to me was because of the meat
and<00:04:31.580> dairy<00:04:31.630> Association<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:32.870> all<00:04:33.080> these

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
that the countries with the highest rate

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.529 
that the countries with the highest rate
of<00:04:43.460> dairy<00:04:43.940> consumption<00:04:44.479> also<00:04:46.300> happen<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.389> be

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
of dairy consumption also happen to be

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.420 
of dairy consumption also happen to be
the<00:04:47.780> countries<00:04:48.169> with<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.530> highest<00:04:48.560> rate<00:04:49.250> of

the countries with the highest rate of

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.629 
the countries with the highest rate of
osteoporosis<00:04:50.169> hmm<00:04:51.229> no<00:04:51.889> wonder<00:04:52.190> why<00:04:52.280> that<00:04:52.430> is

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
osteoporosis hmm no wonder why that is

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.870 
osteoporosis hmm no wonder why that is
well<00:04:53.270> remember<00:04:53.599> we<00:04:53.720> talked<00:04:53.960> about<00:04:54.050> how<00:04:54.259> on<00:04:54.880> a

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
well remember we talked about how on a

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.330 
well remember we talked about how on a
meat-based<00:04:56.599> diet<00:04:57.020> or<00:04:57.349> animal<00:04:57.680> protein<00:04:58.070> based

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
meat-based diet or animal protein based

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.650 
meat-based diet or animal protein based
diet<00:04:58.639> how<00:04:59.419> the<00:05:00.289> excess<00:05:00.919> protein<00:05:01.220> causes<00:05:02.180> your

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
diet how the excess protein causes your

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.370 
diet how the excess protein causes your
body<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.229> leach<00:05:04.210> calcium<00:05:05.210> from<00:05:05.840> its<00:05:05.960> bones<00:05:06.169> I

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
body to leach calcium from its bones I

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.120 
body to leach calcium from its bones I
don't<00:05:06.530> know<00:05:06.590> if<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:06.740> mentioned<00:05:07.070> that

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
don't know if I mentioned that

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.770 
don't know if I mentioned that
completely<00:05:07.699> but<00:05:07.910> it<00:05:08.000> does<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:08.389> leeches

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
completely but it does it leeches

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.110 
completely but it does it leeches
calcium<00:05:09.020> from<00:05:09.380> your<00:05:09.470> bones<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:10.039> you<00:05:10.310> get<00:05:10.820> tons

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
calcium from your bones so you get tons

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.620 
calcium from your bones so you get tons
of<00:05:11.270> calcium<00:05:11.810> from<00:05:11.990> milk<00:05:12.430> but<00:05:13.430> because<00:05:14.330> it<00:05:14.449> has

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
of calcium from milk but because it has

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.390 
of calcium from milk but because it has
all<00:05:14.780> this<00:05:14.900> animal<00:05:15.229> protein<00:05:15.590> in<00:05:15.710> it<00:05:15.830> your<00:05:16.280> body

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
all this animal protein in it your body

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.870 
all this animal protein in it your body
says<00:05:16.729> in<00:05:17.570> order<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:18.020> balance<00:05:18.289> out<00:05:18.770> all<00:05:19.159> this

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
says in order to balance out all this

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.210 
says in order to balance out all this
excess<00:05:20.630> protein<00:05:21.199> in<00:05:21.349> the<00:05:21.440> acidic<00:05:21.889> affect

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
excess protein in the acidic affect

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.120 
excess protein in the acidic affect
effects<00:05:22.729> of<00:05:23.000> of<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.419> in<00:05:23.539> your<00:05:23.599> body<00:05:23.659> it<00:05:24.130> leeches

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
effects of of it in your body it leeches

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.879

calcium<00:05:25.310> from<00:05:25.669> your<00:05:25.789> bones<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:27.139> here<00:05:27.740> we

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
calcium from your bones and so here we

are on a plant-based protein where we

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.279 
are on a plant-based protein where we
may<00:05:30.590> not<00:05:30.710> be<00:05:30.770> getting<00:05:31.009> as<00:05:31.280> much<00:05:32.030> calcium<00:05:32.419> from
