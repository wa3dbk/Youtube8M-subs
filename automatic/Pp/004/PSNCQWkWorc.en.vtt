hey guys in this video we're gonna be

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.169 
hey guys in this video we're gonna be
doing<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.680> speed<00:00:02.070> test<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.520> benchmark

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
doing a speed test and benchmark

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.619 
doing a speed test and benchmark

iPhone 5s both of these phones have

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.180 
iPhone 5s both of these phones have
really<00:00:09.179> great<00:00:09.450> specs<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.320> 5s<00:00:10.679> has<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.889> dual

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
really great specs the 5s has a dual

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
quad core CPU inside of it so they have

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.279

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
test we're currently running and I was

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.170 
test we're currently running and I was
pretty<00:00:49.410> surprised<00:00:49.890> by<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.489> LG<00:00:50.879> g2

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
pretty surprised by this the LG g2

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.750 
pretty surprised by this the LG g2
actually<00:00:51.809> pulled<00:00:52.079> ahead<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> iPhone<00:00:53.250> 5s

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
actually pulled ahead of the iPhone 5s

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.139 
actually pulled ahead of the iPhone 5s
by<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.840> 400<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.520> bad<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:57.000> all

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
by about 400 or so so not bad at all

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.349 
by about 400 or so so not bad at all
with<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> LG<00:00:58.289> g2<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.520> impressed<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.059> wasn't

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
with the LG g2 I was impressed I wasn't

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.610 
with the LG g2 I was impressed I wasn't
expecting<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.469> actually

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
expecting that at all I was actually

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.200 
expecting that at all I was actually
thinking<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.039> 5s<00:01:02.520> would<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.789> more<00:01:03.000> powerful

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
thinking the 5s would be more powerful

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.630 
thinking the 5s would be more powerful
but<00:01:04.080> right<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.589> stands<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> iPhone<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
but right now it stands the iPhone is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.730 
but right now it stands the iPhone is
