00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
and then the metal clasp here and you
just<00:01:30.750> kind<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.960> connect<00:01:31.259> those<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.430> it's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
just kind of connect those and then it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
four zero to one year I think it's a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640 
four zero to one year I think it's a
really<00:01:36.240> cute<00:01:36.360> color<00:01:36.689> too<00:01:36.960> especially<00:01:37.170> for

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
really know like I don't know I just I

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.969 
really know like I don't know I just I
just<00:05:15.660> never<00:05:15.990> made<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.320> jump<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.590> do<00:05:16.830> it

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
just never made the jump to do it

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.020 
just never made the jump to do it
because<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.190> don't<00:05:17.340> really<00:05:17.430> have<00:05:17.520> any<00:05:17.729> local

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
because I don't really have any local

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.940 
because I don't really have any local
stores<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.450> had<00:05:18.630> them<00:05:18.870> after<00:05:19.530> seeing<00:05:19.770> this

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
stores that had them after seeing this

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.380 
stores that had them after seeing this
one<00:05:20.160> though<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.490> definitely<00:05:20.910> want<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.090> get<00:05:21.210> some

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
one though I definitely want to get some

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.360 
one though I definitely want to get some
more<00:05:21.510> because<00:05:21.810> once<00:05:22.169> Landon<00:05:22.590> starts<00:05:22.830> TV<00:05:23.070> I

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
more because once Landon starts TV I

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.400 
more because once Landon starts TV I
think<00:05:23.460> these<00:05:23.700> are<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.940> way<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.120> go<00:05:24.350> just<00:05:25.350> the

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
think these are the way to go just the

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.680 
think these are the way to go just the
fact<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:25.740> they're<00:05:26.010> like<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.580> nice<00:05:26.910> natural

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
fact that they're like a nice natural

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.540 
fact that they're like a nice natural
teething<00:05:27.960> thing<00:05:28.289> rather<00:05:28.470> than<00:05:28.680> plastic<00:05:28.979> I

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
teething thing rather than plastic I

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.279 
teething thing rather than plastic I
just<00:05:29.880> think<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.180> wood<00:05:30.390> is<00:05:30.539> the<00:05:30.660> way<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.840> go<00:05:31.050> so

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
just think the wood is the way to go so

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.260 
just think the wood is the way to go so
anyways<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.250> wish<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.760> had<00:05:32.940> that<00:05:33.090> like
