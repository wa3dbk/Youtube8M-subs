and<00:02:23.810> I'll<00:02:23.900> show<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.260> works<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.010> a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and I'll show you that works in just a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.650 
and I'll show you that works in just a
second<00:02:26.980> what<00:02:27.980> I've<00:02:28.130> done<00:02:28.370> here<00:02:28.790> now<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.330> I've

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
second what I've done here now is I've

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.680 
second what I've done here now is I've
added<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.110> large<00:02:31.030> float<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.299> just<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.660> that

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
added a large float to it just so that

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.039 
added a large float to it just so that
you<00:02:32.930> can<00:02:33.110> see<00:02:33.670> how<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.819> works<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.450> basically

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049
