a lot of them coming out lately uh there

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.080 
a lot of them coming out lately uh there
was<00:00:34.030> two<00:00:34.570> in<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.870> past<00:00:35.050> couple<00:00:35.380> weeks<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.800> think

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
was two in the past couple weeks I think
this<00:00:37.090> one's<00:00:37.270> probably<00:00:37.420> my<00:00:37.570> favorite<00:00:37.960> actually

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
this one's probably my favorite actually

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.530 
this one's probably my favorite actually
because<00:00:39.160> it<00:00:39.550> kind<00:00:39.730> of<00:00:39.790> looks<00:00:39.940> like<00:00:39.970> a<00:00:40.120> Lycan

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540
