versatility<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.870> full<00:00:50.079> ninety<00:00:50.350> came<00:00:50.559> about

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
versatility the full ninety came about

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.380 
versatility the full ninety came about
because<00:00:51.040> customers<00:00:51.640> were<00:00:51.760> asking<00:00:51.850> us<00:00:52.180> for<00:00:52.210> a

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
because customers were asking us for a

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.020 
because customers were asking us for a
smaller<00:00:52.719> bar<00:00:53.020> crusher<00:00:53.320> so<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.370> thought<00:00:54.579> what

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
smaller bar crusher so we thought what

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.610 
smaller bar crusher so we thought what
can<00:00:55.149> we<00:00:55.239> build<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.690> retains<00:00:56.110> all<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.440> key

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
can we build that retains all the key

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.229 
can we build that retains all the key
features<00:00:57.040> of<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.219> bigger<00:00:57.399> bar<00:00:57.610> crusher<00:00:57.910> range

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
features of the bigger bar crusher range

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.060 
features of the bigger bar crusher range
but<00:00:58.750> gives<00:00:58.930> us<00:00:59.020> a<00:00:59.140> smaller<00:00:59.500> boat<00:00:59.770> with<00:01:00.010> a

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
but gives us a smaller boat with a

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.709 
but gives us a smaller boat with a
smaller<00:01:00.340> horsepower<00:01:00.910> for<00:01:01.360> this<00:01:01.480> type<00:01:01.690> of

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
smaller horsepower for this type of

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.109 
smaller horsepower for this type of
boating<00:01:02.079> so<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.800> 490<00:01:03.340> has<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.550> water<00:01:03.730> ballast

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
boating so the 490 has the water ballast

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.639 
boating so the 490 has the water ballast
system<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.720> our<00:01:04.839> blades<00:01:05.080> your<00:01:05.199> boats<00:01:05.410> have

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
system that our blades your boats have

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.620 
system that our blades your boats have
which<00:01:06.190> gives<00:01:06.399> you<00:01:06.460> great<00:01:06.670> stability<00:01:06.910> at<00:01:07.270> rest

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
which gives you great stability at rest

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.440 
which gives you great stability at rest
it<00:01:08.170> also<00:01:08.320> has<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.710> Gentoo<00:01:09.130> hull<00:01:09.340> shape<00:01:09.640> for

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
it also has the Gentoo hull shape for

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.120 
it also has the Gentoo hull shape for
earlier<00:01:10.720> planing<00:01:11.200> better<00:01:11.470> economy<00:01:11.920> through

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
earlier planing better economy through

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.999 
earlier planing better economy through
