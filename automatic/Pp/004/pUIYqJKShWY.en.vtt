00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
a pit refloat it and texture you can see

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.800 
a pit refloat it and texture you can see
where<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.920> primer<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.449> all<00:00:24.600> been

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
where the the primer is it's all been

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.120 
where the the primer is it's all been
textured<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.500> can't<00:00:25.769> tell<00:00:26.010> the

textured and you can't tell the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
textured and you can't tell the
difference<00:00:26.160> you'll<00:00:26.640> reason<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
difference you'll reason you see the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.880 
difference you'll reason you see the
difference<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.869> because<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.830> said

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
difference here is because like I said

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
difference here is because like I said
this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> primer<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.420> ready

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
this is the primer and now it's ready

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.139 
this is the primer and now it's ready
for<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:31.080> paint<00:00:31.859> job<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
for a paint job so you think it's the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.220 
for a paint job so you think it's the
one<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> paint<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> whole<00:00:33.630> ceilings<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
one to paint the whole ceilings but the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.170 
one to paint the whole ceilings but the
texture<00:00:34.500> looks<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.010> good<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
texture looks really really good now of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.660 
texture looks really really good now of
course<00:00:36.420> while<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.440> let<00:00:37.980> myself<00:00:38.100> get

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
course while I'm here I let myself get

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
course while I'm here I let myself get

called<00:00:47.190> Monterey<00:00:47.579> drag<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
called Monterey drag now what is

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.010

Monterey drag Monterey drag is a type of
texture<00:00:52.500> that's<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.270> kind<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> hybrid

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
texture that's kind of kind of a hybrid

between<00:00:55.170> skip<00:00:56.129> trowel<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.789> knock<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.750> just

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
between skip trowel and knock down just

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.099 
between skip trowel and knock down just
think<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:58.920> coarse<00:00:59.370> knock<00:01:00.180> down<00:01:00.480> like

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
think of a really coarse knock down like

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.540 
think of a really coarse knock down like
this<00:01:01.260> block<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.160> were<00:01:02.340> knocked

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
this block right here this were knocked

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.039 
this block right here this were knocked
down<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> consider<00:01:03.420> mistake<00:01:03.750> gonna<00:01:03.960> have

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
down if you consider mistake gonna have

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.100 
down if you consider mistake gonna have
to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.229> redone<00:01:05.479> on<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.720> little<00:01:06.900> portion

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
to be redone on this little portion

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.810 
to be redone on this little portion
right<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.710> there's<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> skip<00:01:08.369> trowel<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
right in here there's a skip trowel and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.920 
right in here there's a skip trowel and
it'd<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.060> considered<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> mistake<00:01:09.720> because

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it'd be considered a mistake because

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
it'd be considered a mistake because
they<00:01:10.200> need<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.500> smoothly<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.040> so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
they need to be smoothly down so

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
they need to be smoothly down so
monitoring<00:01:12.630> drag<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.500> reason<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
monitoring drag for this reason is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950 
monitoring drag for this reason is
considered<00:01:14.340> kind<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> cross<00:01:14.939> between<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
considered kind of a cross between the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
considered kind of a cross between the
two<00:01:16.200> what's<00:01:16.979> nice<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.189> Monterey<00:01:17.759> drag

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
two what's nice about Monterey drag

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
two what's nice about Monterey drag
because<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.540> lends<00:01:18.810> itself<00:01:19.170> well<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
because it really lends itself well to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
because it really lends itself well to
faux<00:01:20.580> painting<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.990> reason<00:01:22.259> I'm<00:01:22.350> showing<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
faux painting the reason I'm showing you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.380 
faux painting the reason I'm showing you
these<00:01:22.979> walls<00:01:23.250> heaters<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:23.759> these<00:01:24.150> walls

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
these walls heaters because these walls

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.950 
these walls heaters because these walls
were<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.020> dark<00:01:25.470> beige<00:01:25.950> before<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
were kind of a dark beige before so it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
were kind of a dark beige before so it
gives<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:28.500> good<00:01:28.619> contrast<00:01:29.070> against

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
gives you a really good contrast against

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.990 
gives you a really good contrast against
the<00:01:29.759> white<00:01:30.150> texture<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> across<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> room

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the white texture now across the room

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
the white texture now across the room
here<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> mirror<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.590> used<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.009> be

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
here on the mirror this used to be

here on the mirror this used to be
wallpaper<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.500> court<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:37.799> took<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.040> down

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
wallpaper the court would took it down

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.690
