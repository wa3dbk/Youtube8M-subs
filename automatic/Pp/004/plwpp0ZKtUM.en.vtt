00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
time trying to find a match for me so I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.050 
time trying to find a match for me so I
was<00:02:01.710> actually<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.100> black<00:02:02.399> ops<00:02:02.610> 1

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
was actually on black ops 1

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.359 
was actually on black ops 1
but<00:02:03.570> yeah<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.100> those<00:02:05.189> things

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
but yeah it's that's one of those things

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.690 
but yeah it's that's one of those things
where<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> tried<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:07.069> match<00:02:08.069> going<00:02:08.489> but

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
where I tried to get a match going but

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.940 
where I tried to get a match going but
it<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.420> didn't<00:02:09.929> work<00:02:10.050> out<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.470> yeah

like<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> series<00:04:02.430> starting<00:04:02.940> from<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.300> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
like a series starting from like the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.780 
like a series starting from like the
world<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.110> war<00:04:04.290> going<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:04.800> to<00:04:04.920> black<00:04:05.130> ops<00:04:05.340> 2

I think that'd be kind of fun just for
me<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.730> don't<00:04:08.880> know<00:04:09.030> we'll<00:04:09.270> see<00:04:09.300> if<00:04:09.510> Cody<00:04:09.750> is

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
me but I don't know we'll see if Cody is

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.860 
me but I don't know we'll see if Cody is
too<00:04:10.500> busy<00:04:10.680> see<00:04:11.670> if<00:04:11.760> he<00:04:11.880> wants<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.180> join<00:04:12.570> in<00:04:12.720> on

too busy see if he wants to join in on

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.720 
too busy see if he wants to join in on
the<00:04:12.959> live<00:04:13.110> comms<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:13.739> not<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:14.160> maybe<00:04:14.340> I'll<00:04:14.519> just

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
the live comms if not I maybe I'll just

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.349 
the live comms if not I maybe I'll just
do<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.000> solo<00:04:15.950> which<00:04:16.950> if<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.549> do<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.820> solo<00:04:18.060> they're

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
do it solo which if I do it solo they're

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.659 
do it solo which if I do it solo they're
gonna<00:04:18.480> be<00:04:18.660> pretty<00:04:18.870> long<00:04:19.109> because<00:04:19.590> if<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.489> get<00:04:20.640> a

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
gonna be pretty long because if I get a

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.330 
gonna be pretty long because if I get a
little<00:04:20.820> practicing<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.660> can<00:04:22.380> remember<00:04:22.620> most<00:04:23.010> of

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
little practicing I can remember most of

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.000 
little practicing I can remember most of
the<00:04:23.780> black<00:04:24.780> hour<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.080> guess<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.890> could<00:04:25.979> say

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
the black hour I guess you could say

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.350 
the black hour I guess you could say
world<00:04:26.340> art<00:04:26.490> war<00:04:26.640> 2

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360

black<00:04:27.479> ops<00:04:27.719> I<00:04:28.139> can<00:04:28.530> remember<00:04:28.650> most<00:04:28.949> of<00:04:29.039> the

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
black ops I can remember most of the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
with a little practice I can definitely

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.140 
with a little practice I can definitely
get<00:04:33.090> them<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:33.360> there<00:04:33.509> but<00:04:34.259> I<00:04:34.699> don't<00:04:35.699> know<00:04:35.819> we'll
