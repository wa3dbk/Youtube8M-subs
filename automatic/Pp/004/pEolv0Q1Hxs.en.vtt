00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.090
 so we are in low swallow north brabant 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.980
 on the banks of the Dutch deep 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.270
 today there is a large project here 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.460
 mirror carp project to happen 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.020
 lower rivers so all large mirror 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.349
 ready project of the netherlands between that 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.349
 promises something 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.489
 esprit down there 4 so a mirror can 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.230
 project largest project in the Netherlands 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.760
 in area 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.620
 there arose from a fanatic 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.110
 group of monkeys fishes and catch them last 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.290
 10 years of dramatic decline 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.010
 more than for seven hours for a carp 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.769
 to catch 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.720
 to more than 24 hours yes the variation 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.010
 was also gone because they need them 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.650
 actually only wanted to march 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.690
 carp carp what a carp wanted 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.710
 fish that wants variety that I want 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.470
 mirror carps 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.250
 row carp leather carp as life came 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.590
 and we will continue with this project 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.270
 bring about 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.950
 boys don't like that mirror carp project 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.260
 those that stand or fall with the bet and 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.210
 the help of volunteers are boys 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.280
 of cheese and carp sport fishing 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.180
 the netherlands is the national 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.920
 representative of carp fishing 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.350
 to give you an idea 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.270
 this project has six locations alone 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.430
 and there are already more than 150 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.290
 volunteers ready to help with it 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.180
 but also by measuring and the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.860
 photographing those muscle quarters 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.390
 but the money there a lot because 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.009
 they find projects everywhere in the netherlands 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.899
 so are everywhere in the Netherlands 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.409
 who volunteered the cheese and saw 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.409
 also important 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.350
 john versluis carp volunteer 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.579
 sportvisserij nederland the cheese and but 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.259
 I have been told that you are also one 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.609
 of the promoters am of this 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.180
 project you can do more about that 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.840
 to tell 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.090
 Yes that's right 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.890
 yes as a fisherman in this area say it 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.659
 idea that the catch really declined and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.090
 that also mainly very scaly carp 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.530
 and then wanted to do something about summer 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.539
 go a bit for a question you have that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.329
 also and from there a plan has emerged 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.149
 say we have presented to 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.920
 southwest Netherlands and Rijkswaterstaat 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.480
 where you said about well this is what 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.890
 we see the current situation that goes 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.840
 not to say good and we want that on 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.160
 improve this way and actually 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.010
 we just want to advance the scout 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.930
 and then mainly mirror carp 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.299
 and after the mountain positive answer 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.980
 and so say the second year 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.739
 but we put this here on it 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.180
 off, and I also see that the 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.019
 fish being photographed are still alive 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.299
 a reason 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.099
 yes, because mirror carps and good recognition 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.079
 whatever we want with this project is 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.879
 that we caught the fish as the back 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.500
 be that we can recognize them and 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.920
 see if they have grown and that kind 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.450
 Affairs 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.239
 so we are all number one 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.400
 number they are put on the photo 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.400
 you see that happen there and as soon as you 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.660
 then a mirror carp catches back then 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.489
 you can report it back and then we can 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.720
 check whether the fish are doing well 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.489
 and whether they were actually caught 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.200
 become those carp that came mirror 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.459
 see the bull in the bathtub not coming 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.799
 from the neighborhood that come from 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.510
 fish farms in Belgium and France 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.109
 are very large complex and become the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.540
 caps from very small to large enough 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.799
 grown one and a half kilos and after one 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.480
 drive of a few hours on the highway 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.750
 they get so this case 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.750
 new house 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.170
 why French mirror carps on which this 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.669
 specific carp , they become larger 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.620
 they become beautiful otherwise they become 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.209
 species firstly much larger and for 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.889
 sport fishing sport fishing of their loved 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.599
 is a large map view beautiful carp 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.099
 nice yes we like the ride through everyone 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.630
 a-team a big whopper on the picture 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.120
 but in this type 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.650
 fish was with just deliver is a fish 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.120
 that grows fast 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.989
 yes but it is also a very strong breed 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.359
 has a very high 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.160
 survival rate what ultimately 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.160
 results and openly very large 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.560
 we are now continuing with this project 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.150
 this is the second result in a series 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.470
 from 5 so there or every three years 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.090
 expulsion and doing 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.620
 the monitoring ' you will be further arrested 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.470
 a treasure is turning on with those monitors 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.060
 information information about how 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.590
 this file is going to be fantastic 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.480
 we are really convinced of that and the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.580
 chances to catch a mirror carp 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.640
 is also enlarged to the 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.870
 target 30 to 35% 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.560
 yes you have that fall back later y 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:24.720
 take my last card is nice 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.720
 project and they can go catch
