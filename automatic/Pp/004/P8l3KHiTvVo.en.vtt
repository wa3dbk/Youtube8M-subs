00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.360
 that people trust me as a player and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.340

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.870
 the eco soccer on Friday were nicolini

 with juan pablo on Sunday contreras with 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.100
 zavala and acosta but the day more 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.930
 required was the Saturday that was Augustine 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.520
 gutiérrez with alfonso what does it mean for 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.620
 you that the people love you so much 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.900
 It was a nice invitation, he told himself. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 very nice place there were many many 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.550
 proposals that had the truth because 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.190
 you are very very good very interesting and 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.730
 nothing more nothing more that I enjoyed very much 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.370
 and the truth 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.770
 racing made a very good opening but very 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.530
 bad closure what analysis do you do now 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.790
 the whole championship opening and closing 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.130
 well as saying I think it was a great 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.950
 opening with good score of all the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.710
 world a champion score and in the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.240
 closure we did not have many 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.920
 irregularities that we could never 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.050
 take the least get to three 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.140
 wins in a row or a tie that 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.370
 good the tie the last one was account 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.870
 just against peñarol but well I think 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.880
 that things were done good things not 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.220
 so good we had good results not 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.990
 so much so that we're going to go to the point of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.610
 goals to classify the American injury 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.340
 but I think that following this path 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.020
 I think he will be objective and assess how 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.640
 it was the moment after leaving 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.600
 Peñarol finished the match the estuary 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.430
 low heads if the truth a waist 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.190
 very big because having stayed by 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.410
 knocked out that was the goal that 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.630
 we had was a bitterness and a sadness 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.460
 very big but good we know that the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.840
 group will be fine for what it is 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.720
 come we are going to work very well and 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.510
 we hope to classify it to that cup the year 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.459
 you're talking a little about the subject of 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.650
 explain the cup next year they look 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.570
 with the strength to achieve it yes yes 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.510
 Of course if the group is well 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.220
 very united was always working at 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.930
 maximum in each day and well we are 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.420
 we are confident is the goal be 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.550
 true 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.260
 gave you confidence to be the 9th holder 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.819
 always despite the fact that others will arrive 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.010
 other front players to get to 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.989
 this closing 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.409
 I think I was gaining confidence from 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.599
 the beginning of 2014 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.290
 I feel that I have grown thanks to my 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.120
 comrades not to mention but I won a 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.700
 respect I think it's a good respect 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.810
 cute that motivates me every time 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.110
 that I'm going to enter the court to leave 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.150
 all for division between the arrival 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.799

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.110

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.210
 my classmates who were trying to be 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.550
 always the best possible for in my case 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.860
 leave me facing the goal or a situation 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.350
 of goal but the confidence has spoken with 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.180

 in the parties if it contracts I understood myself 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.020
 I very well felt that I was like a technician 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.520
 I had inside the court because 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.000
