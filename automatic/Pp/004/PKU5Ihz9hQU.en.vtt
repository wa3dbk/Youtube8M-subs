 slow stirring it often so it does not

 milk and the broth in the sofrito we have 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.590
 to do it little by little and without ceasing 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.750
 stir to obtain a homogeneous mass 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.100
 we let the dough simmer 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.410
 Mixing often so it does not stick 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.690
 when the dough is removed 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.690
 from the pan we remove the container 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.750
 of the fire and add 75 grams of cheese 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.270
 gorgonzola we remove to incorporate it to 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.550
 the dough the gorgonzola is a cheese 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.740
 italian table creamy pasta and 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.990
 unctuous made with whole milk

 in two sweet and spicy varieties its use 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.460
 it is usual in various dishes of the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.920
 Italian cuisine if not available 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.330
 from him we can use any kind of 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.870
 blue cheese 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.870
 d 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.989
 yes 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.370
 we painted a tray with butter 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.129
 dump the dough of the croquettes inside 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.739
 and we cover it with plastic film of form 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.010
 that is adhered to the mass so it does not 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.379
 will harden the outer layer 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.519
 we let cool the dough about 12 hours 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.519
 so that it takes body 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.230
 we make balls of 40 grams of dough 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.780
 We went through flour egg whisk and bread 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.850
 grated 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.010
 the sand will help absorb moisture 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.260
 of the dough and it will make the egg and the bread 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.080
 grated stick better with what 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.459
 will improve the quality of the batter 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.340
 we finished giving the croquette 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.830
 we believe them just before serving with 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.520
 oil hot enough so it does not 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.520
 open the batter 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.390
 we drain them on an absorbent paper 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.390
 before bringing them to the table 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.959
 and ready to eat
