appre Soleil hair mist I gotta be honest
I'm<00:04:39.789> really<00:04:39.849> confused<00:04:40.509> about<00:04:40.720> this<00:04:40.990> product

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
I'm really confused about this product

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.490 
I'm really confused about this product
it<00:04:41.919> says<00:04:42.160> pre<00:04:42.490> Soleil<00:04:42.970> which<00:04:43.569> is<00:04:43.780> Sun<00:04:44.169> in

it says pre Soleil which is Sun in

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.620 
it says pre Soleil which is Sun in
French<00:04:44.919> so<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.639> thought<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.030> maybe<00:04:46.360> it<00:04:46.509> was

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
French so I thought that maybe it was

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.749 
French so I thought that maybe it was
going<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.930> be<00:04:47.020> an<00:04:47.110> SPF<00:04:47.740> protectant<00:04:48.460> for<00:04:48.639> your

going to be an SPF protectant for your
hair<00:04:49.000> which<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:49.449> cool<00:04:49.720> idea<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.319> know<00:04:50.380> there's

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
hair which is a cool idea I know there's

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.110
