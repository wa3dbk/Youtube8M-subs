00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
Morgan I'm 1310 60-yard 12 year old

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.860 
Morgan I'm 1310 60-yard 12 year old
Morgan<00:04:52.879> you're<00:04:53.879> going<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.090> suggestion<00:04:54.750> to

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
Morgan you're going to suggestion to

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.529 
Morgan you're going to suggestion to
improve<00:04:55.379> side<00:04:55.710> over<00:04:56.039> yeah<00:04:56.669> I<00:04:56.699> think<00:04:56.969> that<00:04:57.509> a

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
improve side over yeah I think that a

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.480 
improve side over yeah I think that a
way<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:57.960> make<00:04:58.259> a<00:04:58.289> better<00:04:58.650> could<00:04:58.949> be<00:04:58.979> if<00:04:59.280> you

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
way to make a better could be if you

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.279 
way to make a better could be if you
make<00:04:59.849> it<00:04:59.879> a<00:05:00.090> scratchy<00:05:00.419> card<00:05:00.870> or<00:05:01.020> something

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
make it a scratchy card or something

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.730 
make it a scratchy card or something
like<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:02.190> then<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.300> take<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.750> boxes<00:05:04.349> or

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
like that and then you take the boxes or

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.999 
like that and then you take the boxes or
you<00:05:05.069> think<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.370> children<00:05:05.580> are<00:05:06.500> okay<00:05:07.500> okay<00:05:07.949> so

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
you think the children are okay okay so

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.580 
you think the children are okay okay so
it's<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.250> scratchy<00:05:08.639> here<00:05:09.120> but<00:05:09.389> Susie<00:05:09.810> so<00:05:10.319> so

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
Morgan I'm as confused about yours I was

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.339 
Morgan I'm as confused about yours I was
about<00:05:14.009> my<00:05:14.219> ultimatum<00:05:14.870> Morgan<00:05:15.870> let's<00:05:16.259> just

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
about my ultimatum Morgan let's just

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.320 
about my ultimatum Morgan let's just
your<00:05:16.650> computer<00:05:17.250> let's<00:05:17.610> just<00:05:17.759> trying<00:05:18.210> to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
your computer let's just trying to

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.270 
your computer let's just trying to
figure<00:05:18.569> it<00:05:18.690> out<00:05:18.870> on<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.110> online<00:05:19.469> form<00:05:19.889> first

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.640 
figure it out on the online form first
which<00:05:20.849> is<00:05:21.210> highly<00:05:21.690> flawed<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.259> then<00:05:22.469> we'll

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
which is highly flawed and then we'll

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.790
