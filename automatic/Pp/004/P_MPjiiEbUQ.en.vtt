00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
problems with the engine that we had to

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.380 
problems with the engine that we had to
take<00:00:16.590> care<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.310> had<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.610> couple<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> bent

valves<00:00:18.869> from<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> last<00:00:19.920> events<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.460> had<00:00:20.640> to

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
valves from the last events we had to

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.470 
valves from the last events we had to
get<00:00:20.849> those<00:00:21.000> straightened<00:00:21.450> out<00:00:21.540> and<00:00:23.090> I<00:00:24.090> also

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
to get them to work okay and we've made

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.250 
to get them to work okay and we've made
a<00:00:34.050> new<00:00:34.290> water<00:00:35.010> expansion<00:00:35.640> tank<00:00:36.050> over<00:00:37.050> here

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
a new water expansion tank over here

a new water expansion tank over here
give<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.280> try<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.720> also<00:00:39.870> put<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.380> a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.690 

you<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.480> we<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.660> a<00:01:10.340> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.550> of<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you see we got a little bit of a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.690 
you see we got a little bit of a
shellacking<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.720> from<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> cones<00:01:13.340> on<00:01:14.340> this

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
shellacking there from the cones on this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.920 
shellacking there from the cones on this
side<00:01:14.910> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> car<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:20.730> also<00:01:21.540> over<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
side of the car and also over here a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.970 
side of the car and also over here a
little<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:23.990> along<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> door<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:27.980> but

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
little bit and along the door here but

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.010 
little bit and along the door here but
that's<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.370> way<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.490> goes<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.850> across<00:01:33.020> we're

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that's the way it goes not across we're

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.770 
that's the way it goes not across we're
going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.230> be<00:01:34.290> installing<00:01:34.620> that<00:01:34.800> slicks<00:01:35.160> again

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
going to be installing that slicks again

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.220 
going to be installing that slicks again
once<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.850> get<00:01:38.850> them<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.150> charged<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:39.930> air

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
once we get them all charged up with air

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.400 
once we get them all charged up with air
and<00:01:41.390> we're<00:01:42.390> gonna<00:01:42.510> be<00:01:42.660> changing<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.200> front

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
and we're gonna be changing the front

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.160 
and we're gonna be changing the front
leaf<00:01:43.620> spring<00:01:44.010> again<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.370> looks<00:01:44.550> like<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:45.140> saw<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
leaf spring again it looks like I saw a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
leaf spring again it looks like I saw a
slow-motion<00:01:46.800> video<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.280> car<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.820> had

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
slow-motion video of the car and we had

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
slow-motion video of the car and we had
one<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> rear<00:01:48.750> tires<00:01:49.080> up<00:01:49.410> off<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.740> ground

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
one of the rear tires up off the ground

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.040 
one of the rear tires up off the ground
so<00:01:50.430> looks<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.660> little<00:01:51.840> bit<00:01:51.930> more

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
so looks like we need a little bit more

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
so looks like we need a little bit more
pressure<00:01:52.260> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> front<00:01:52.830> end<00:01:57.890> haven't<00:01:58.890> really

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
pressure in the front end haven't really

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
pressure in the front end haven't really
done<00:01:59.250> anything<00:01:59.460> special<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.420> inside<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
done anything special to the inside of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.590 
done anything special to the inside of
the<00:02:00.930> car<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.940> except<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:02.970> take<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
windshield one of these days this is the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.340 
windshield one of these days this is the
fuel<00:02:27.989> cell<00:02:28.290> we've<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.800> installed<00:02:30.320> we<00:02:31.320> have

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
fuel cell we've got it installed we have

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.350 
fuel cell we've got it installed we have
some<00:02:31.709> holes<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> battery<00:02:32.610> cover<00:02:32.850> here<00:02:33.120> so

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
some holes in the battery cover here so

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.360 
some holes in the battery cover here so
we<00:02:33.480> can<00:02:33.570> get<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:33.840> bit<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.080> air<00:02:34.370> moving

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
we can get a little bit of air moving

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.710 
we can get a little bit of air moving
through<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.530> radiator<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.709> out<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:39.510> back

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
through the radiator and out the back

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.830 
through the radiator and out the back
side<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.140> car<00:02:40.489> we<00:02:41.489> found<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.910> even<00:02:42.510> right

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
side of the car we found that even right

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.259 
side of the car we found that even right
now<00:02:43.050> if<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:44.190> put<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.170> hood<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.560> lay<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.860> down

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
now if we put the hood just lay it down

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.180 
now if we put the hood just lay it down
that<00:02:48.269> at<00:02:48.540> about<00:02:48.780> 50<00:02:49.290> miles<00:02:49.470> an<00:02:49.650> hour<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.010> hoods

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that at about 50 miles an hour the hoods

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.060 
that at about 50 miles an hour the hoods
actually<00:02:50.610> starts<00:02:50.880> opening<00:02:51.060> up<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> car<00:02:52.070> so

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
actually starts opening up on the car so

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.509 
actually starts opening up on the car so
we've<00:02:53.220> got<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.430> work<00:02:53.519> on<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.730> aerodynamic

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
we've got to work on that aerodynamic

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.210 
we've got to work on that aerodynamic
bit<00:02:56.519> for<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> little<00:02:57.390> bit<00:02:57.720> more<00:03:00.500> anyway<00:03:01.500> more<00:03:02.160> to

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
bit for a little bit more anyway more to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:11.630 
bit for a little bit more anyway more to
come

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.700
