let's go back here so let's see if this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.550 
let's go back here so let's see if this
works<00:02:06.960> also<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.680> video<00:02:08.160> mode<00:02:09.080> okay<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.470> we

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
works also in video mode okay so when we

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.580 
works also in video mode okay so when we
go<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.280> video<00:02:11.459> mode<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:12.000> doesn't<00:02:12.209> see

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
go to video mode it doesn't see

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.119 
go to video mode it doesn't see
to<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.239> option<00:02:14.629> over<00:02:15.050> here<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:15.980> can

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
to have that option over here so you can

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.630 
to have that option over here so you can
have<00:02:16.280> different<00:02:16.459> various<00:02:16.970> filters<00:02:17.390> too<00:02:18.319> bad

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
have different various filters too bad

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.009 
have different various filters too bad
and<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:19.819> go<00:02:20.000> back<00:02:20.239> here<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.720> normal

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
and you just go back here to the normal

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.619 
and you just go back here to the normal
one<00:02:21.200> before<00:02:22.129> jump<00:02:22.400> onto<00:02:22.640> video<00:02:23.120> here<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.480> also

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
one before jump onto video here you also

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.270 
one before jump onto video here you also
have<00:02:23.780> an<00:02:23.840> HDR<00:02:24.379> mode<00:02:24.769> here<00:02:25.450> which<00:02:26.980> some<00:02:27.980> people

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
have an HDR mode here which some people

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520 
have an HDR mode here which some people
saying<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.879> did<00:02:29.150> do<00:02:29.840> take<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.140> little<00:02:30.410> bit

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
saying that it did do take a little bit

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.830 
saying that it did do take a little bit
of<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.739> better<00:02:30.920> picture<00:02:31.190> but<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.390> did<00:02:32.569> take

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
of a better picture but that it did take

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.530 
of a better picture but that it did take
a<00:02:33.049> few<00:02:33.530> extra<00:02:33.920> seconds<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.819> take<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.030> picture

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
a few extra seconds to take the picture

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.300 
a few extra seconds to take the picture
so<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.900> course<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.830> can<00:02:36.950> tell<00:02:37.099> me<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
so of course you can tell me the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.009 
so of course you can tell me the
conversation<00:02:37.700> down<00:02:37.790> below<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.330> do<00:02:38.599> see<00:02:38.900> in

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
conversation down below if you do see in

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.009 
conversation down below if you do see in
a<00:02:39.110> difference<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.879> would<00:02:40.879> really<00:02:41.150> say<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.780> I

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
a difference I would really say that I

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.470 
a difference I would really say that I
see<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> massive<00:02:43.099> difference<00:02:43.250> between<00:02:43.790> HDR

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
see a massive difference between HDR

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.360 
see a massive difference between HDR
mode<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.989> taking<00:02:45.349> pictures<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.099> normal

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
mode of taking pictures and the normal

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.460 
mode of taking pictures and the normal
mode<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:47.690> also<00:02:47.720> have<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.049> cool<00:02:48.230> kind<00:02:48.440> of

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
mode you also have this cool kind of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.020 
mode you also have this cool kind of
blur<00:02:48.650> effect<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.099> course<00:02:49.340> when<00:02:49.519> you<00:02:49.640> change

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
blur effect of course when you change

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.960 
blur effect of course when you change
mode<00:02:50.510> here<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:52.099> do<00:02:52.160> believe<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.549> we<00:02:52.849> do

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
mode here and I do believe that we do

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.910 
mode here and I do believe that we do
have<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.180> square<00:02:53.420> mode<00:02:53.599> here<00:02:53.930> which<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.829> do

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
have a square mode here which I do

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.410 
have a square mode here which I do
believe<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.060> for<00:02:57.459> Instagram<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.790> Instagram

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
believe it is for Instagram so Instagram

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.229 
believe it is for Instagram so Instagram
usually<00:02:59.840> have<00:03:00.049> pictures<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.849> in<00:03:02.120> a

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
usually have pictures that is in a

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.809 
usually have pictures that is in a
square<00:03:02.660> mode<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.349> it<00:03:03.890> should<00:03:04.280> be<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.640> when

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
square mode so it should be like when

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.699 
square mode so it should be like when
take<00:03:05.000> pictures<00:03:05.410> wait

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
take pictures wait

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.009 
take pictures wait
this<00:03:07.129> is<00:03:07.519> square<00:03:07.790> mode<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.810> upload

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
this is square mode that you can upload

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.670 
this is square mode that you can upload
a<00:03:09.170> picture<00:03:09.310> fully<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:11.120> Instagram<00:03:11.569> but<00:03:12.440> I'm<00:03:12.560> not

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
a picture fully to Instagram but I'm not

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.300 
a picture fully to Instagram but I'm not
100%<00:03:13.250> sure<00:03:13.489> on<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:14.349> also<00:03:15.349> that<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.129> see

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
100% sure on that also that you can see

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.000 
100% sure on that also that you can see
here<00:03:16.639> that<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.480> filter<00:03:18.139> mode<00:03:18.319> also<00:03:18.620> works

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
here that the filter mode also works

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.210 
here that the filter mode also works
there<00:03:19.280> on<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.639> square<00:03:19.910> mode<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.799> then<00:03:21.799> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
there on the square mode and then the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.759 
there on the square mode and then the
panorama<00:03:22.790> mode<00:03:22.819> here<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.359> course<00:03:23.600> which<00:03:24.470> is

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
panorama mode here of course which is

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.590 
panorama mode here of course which is
probably<00:03:25.280> one<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.609> better<00:03:25.819> panoramas

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
probably one of the better panoramas

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.839 
probably one of the better panoramas
that's<00:03:27.079> web<00:03:27.410> one<00:03:27.620> phone<00:03:27.889> so<00:03:28.400> if<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.579> want<00:03:28.760> to

take a shot here of see here you just

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.400 
take a shot here of see here you just
drag<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:37.400> follow<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.849> instructions

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
drag it just follow the instructions

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.259 
drag it just follow the instructions
what<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:39.530> like<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.000> stop<00:03:41.269> there<00:03:43.269> and

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
then you can drag across if you have

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.339 
then you can drag across if you have

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
something big that you want to take a

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.039 
something big that you want to take a
picture<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.299> of<00:03:50.299> course<00:03:50.359> you<00:03:50.750> have<00:03:50.870> to

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
picture of and of course you have to

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.839 
picture of and of course you have to
make<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.380> stable<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:52.069> didn't<00:03:52.310> see<00:03:52.459> that<00:03:52.489> I

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
make it stable you didn't see that I

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.819 
make it stable you didn't see that I
didn't<00:03:53.389> make<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.569> stable<00:03:53.989> over<00:03:54.319> here<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:54.739> the

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
didn't make it stable over here so the

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.159 
didn't make it stable over here so the
picture<00:03:55.190> looks<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.790> little<00:03:56.239> bit<00:03:56.450> weird<00:03:56.870> here<00:03:57.109> a

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
picture looks a little bit weird here a

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.650 
picture looks a little bit weird here a
little<00:03:57.349> bit<00:03:57.500> choppy<00:03:57.859> on<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.220> sides<00:03:58.480> but<00:03:59.480> that

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
little bit choppy on the sides but that

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.140 
little bit choppy on the sides but that
does<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.079> course<00:04:00.109> is<00:04:00.319> because<00:04:00.799> I'm<00:04:01.069> behind<00:04:01.849> a

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
does of course is because I'm behind a

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.110 
does of course is because I'm behind a
camera<00:04:02.389> when<00:04:03.230> I'm<00:04:03.590> doing<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.400> video<00:04:04.579> and

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
camera when I'm doing this video and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.870 
camera when I'm doing this video and

annoying and then of course we do have a
video<00:04:51.950> mode<00:04:52.310> here<00:04:52.640> when<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.210> go<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.390> right

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
side here or to left side you can also

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.850 
side here or to left side you can also
see<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.360> kinda<00:04:56.570> nice<00:04:56.780> up<00:04:57.080> here<00:04:57.170> that's

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
see that it kinda nice up here that's

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.320 
see that it kinda nice up here that's
like<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.070> thing<00:04:58.340> that<00:04:58.370> will<00:04:58.670> fade<00:04:59.150> effect<00:05:01.330> or

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
transparent I mean so of course you can

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.820 
transparent I mean so of course you can
record<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.480> normal<00:05:05.840> video<00:05:06.020> here<00:05:06.380> let's<00:05:06.560> see<00:05:06.740> if

we can tap to focus yes you can let's

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.990 
we can tap to focus yes you can let's
see<00:05:09.260> how<00:05:09.320> close<00:05:09.530> we<00:05:09.650> can<00:05:09.950> get<00:05:10.130> we<00:05:10.760> can<00:05:10.790> get

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
see how close we can get we can get

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.240 
see how close we can get we can get
actually<00:05:11.420> can<00:05:11.660> get<00:05:12.110> very<00:05:12.440> very<00:05:12.560> close<00:05:12.920> here

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
actually can get very very close here

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.030 
actually can get very very close here
and<00:05:13.430> still<00:05:13.970> get<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.300> good<00:05:15.050> good<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.440> good<00:05:15.740> amount

and still get a good good a good amount
of<00:05:16.130> focus<00:05:16.400> here<00:05:16.790> on<00:05:17.470> my<00:05:18.470> galaxy<00:05:19.190> s4<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.720> can

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
of focus here on my galaxy s4 you can

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.410 
of focus here on my galaxy s4 you can
also<00:05:21.020> see<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.380> time<00:05:21.680> up<00:05:22.040> there<00:05:22.370> how<00:05:23.120> far<00:05:23.360> along

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
also see the time up there how far along

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.230 
also see the time up there how far along
we<00:05:23.750> have<00:05:24.020> been<00:05:24.170> recording<00:05:24.680> for<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.910> can<00:05:26.090> also

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
and then you can just continue so quite

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.780 
and then you can just continue so quite
nice<00:05:35.990> over<00:05:36.290> there<00:05:36.410> let's<00:05:37.040> also<00:05:37.160> see<00:05:37.400> if<00:05:37.520> we<00:05:37.640> can

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
nice over there let's also see if we can

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.720 
nice over there let's also see if we can
change<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.180> front-facing<00:05:38.450> camera<00:05:39.050> and<00:05:39.730> make

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
change the front-facing camera and make

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.909 
change the front-facing camera and make
a<00:05:40.760> recording<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.600> of<00:05:41.840> course<00:05:42.110> we<00:05:42.320> can<00:05:42.530> do<00:05:42.740> that

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
a recording and of course we can do that

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.260 
a recording and of course we can do that
as<00:05:43.130> well<00:05:43.340> so<00:05:44.090> that's<00:05:44.570> quite<00:05:44.960> nice<00:05:45.820> so<00:05:46.820> let's

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
as well so that's quite nice so let's

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.920 
as well so that's quite nice so let's
just<00:05:47.419> go<00:05:47.600> back<00:05:47.630> here<00:05:48.700> so<00:05:49.700> this<00:05:50.030> is<00:05:50.240> very<00:05:50.690> quick

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
just go back here so this is very quick

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.590 
just go back here so this is very quick
look<00:05:51.140> here<00:05:51.169> at<00:05:51.410> the<00:05:51.710> app<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:52.220> do<00:05:53.120> not<00:05:53.390> say<00:05:53.570> that

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
look here at the app I do not say that

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.900 
look here at the app I do not say that
it's<00:05:53.900> a<00:05:53.960> little<00:05:54.169> bit<00:05:54.260> slow<00:05:54.590> here<00:05:54.919> at<00:05:55.100> launching

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
it's a little bit slow here at launching

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.930 
it's a little bit slow here at launching
up<00:05:56.260> or<00:05:57.260> mean<00:05:57.530> not<00:05:57.770> super<00:05:58.220> slow<00:05:58.460> at<00:05:58.610> launching

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
up or mean not super slow at launching

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.970 
up or mean not super slow at launching
up<00:05:59.060> but<00:05:59.960> they<00:06:00.050> can<00:06:00.169> probably<00:06:00.410> improve<00:06:00.680> that

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
up but they can probably improve that

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.030 
up but they can probably improve that
speed<00:06:01.280> a<00:06:01.310> little<00:06:01.430> bit<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:02.530> overall<00:06:03.530> quite<00:06:03.890> um

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
speed a little bit and overall quite um
