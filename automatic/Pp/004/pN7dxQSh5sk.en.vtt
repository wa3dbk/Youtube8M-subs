happening here is all these cloths are
going<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:47.549> running<00:03:47.790> into<00:03:48.060> this<00:03:48.180> vortex<00:03:48.450> as

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
going to be running into this vortex as

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.110 
going to be running into this vortex as
you<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:48.989> see<00:03:49.169> Oh<00:03:49.349> going<00:03:50.310> good<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.639> then<00:03:51.030> I'm

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
you can see Oh going good and then I'm

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.089 
you can see Oh going good and then I'm
going<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.299> be<00:03:51.389> running<00:03:51.569> all<00:03:51.870> my<00:03:52.349> archons<00:03:52.919> in

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
going to be running all my archons in

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.199 
going to be running all my archons in
all<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> did<00:03:53.519> leave<00:03:53.639> some<00:03:53.819> behind<00:03:53.880> now

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
all that I did leave some behind now

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.479 
all that I did leave some behind now
that<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.419> realize<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.220> these<00:03:56.220> are<00:03:56.280> going<00:03:56.430> to

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
that I realize it and these are going to

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.220 
that I realize it and these are going to
all<00:03:56.579> be<00:03:56.609> going<00:03:56.849> in<00:03:57.060> now<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.450> hopefully<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
all be going in now and hopefully the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.270 
all be going in now and hopefully the
splash<00:03:58.530> damage<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.919> kill<00:03:59.069> everything

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
splash damage to kill everything

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.860 
splash damage to kill everything
although<00:03:59.609> what<00:03:59.849> we<00:03:59.970> thought<00:04:00.120> was<00:04:00.359> if<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:00.720> did

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
although what we thought was if we did

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.659 
although what we thought was if we did
colossi<00:04:01.319> on<00:04:01.410> icons<00:04:01.829> probably<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.459> splash

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
colossi on icons probably the splash

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.089 
colossi on icons probably the splash
damage<00:04:02.849> which<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.209> kill<00:04:03.419> everything<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.099> but

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
damage which is kill everything and but

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.940 
damage which is kill everything and but
it<00:04:05.280> seems<00:04:05.579> like<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.540> archons<00:04:07.200> do<00:04:07.500> clean<00:04:07.829> that

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
it seems like the archons do clean that

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.670 
it seems like the archons do clean that
up<00:04:07.980> very<00:04:08.549> well<00:04:08.639> so<00:04:09.389> I've<00:04:10.049> got<00:04:10.230> another<00:04:10.470> one

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
up very well so I've got another one

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.099 
up very well so I've got another one
because<00:04:11.609> we<00:04:12.000> thought<00:04:12.150> lost<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.810> was<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.959> bit

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
because we thought lost I was a bit

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.120 
because we thought lost I was a bit
strange<00:04:13.200> maybe<00:04:13.590> we<00:04:13.709> should<00:04:13.859> do<00:04:13.950> something

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
strange maybe we should do something

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.530 
strange maybe we should do something
different<00:04:14.639> so<00:04:14.760> let's<00:04:14.910> see<00:04:15.000> what<00:04:15.120> happens<00:04:15.389> in<00:04:15.480> a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
different so let's see what happens in a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.500 
different so let's see what happens in a
second<00:04:15.919> okay<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.609> was<00:04:17.789> our<00:04:17.880> second<00:04:18.299> test

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
second okay so this was our second test

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.319 
second okay so this was our second test
what<00:04:18.780> we<00:04:18.870> want<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.139> see<00:04:19.289> is<00:04:19.530> we<00:04:19.709> want<00:04:19.890> see<00:04:20.130> if

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
what we want to see is we want see if

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.730 
what we want to see is we want see if
zealots<00:04:21.329> would<00:04:21.539> fare<00:04:21.810> any<00:04:21.930> better<00:04:22.049> against

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
zealots would fare any better against

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.160 
zealots would fare any better against
the<00:04:22.890> Archon<00:04:23.310> death<00:04:23.700> toilet<00:04:24.240> bollocks

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
the Archon death toilet bollocks

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.650 
the Archon death toilet bollocks
thing<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:25.800> let's<00:04:25.980> see<00:04:26.130> what<00:04:26.220> happens<00:04:26.660> coming

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
thing so let's see what happens coming

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.110 
thing so let's see what happens coming
in<00:04:27.840> hopefully<00:04:28.230> I'm<00:04:28.320> gonna<00:04:28.440> throw<00:04:28.620> vortex

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
in hopefully I'm gonna throw vortex

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.240 
in hopefully I'm gonna throw vortex
anytime<00:04:30.120> soon<00:04:30.690> there's<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.470> vortex<00:04:32.010> all

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
anytime soon there's the vortex all

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.560 
anytime soon there's the vortex all
these<00:04:32.430> zealots<00:04:32.670> are<00:04:32.910> going<00:04:33.090> into<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.330> vortex

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
these zealots are going into the vortex

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.110 
these zealots are going into the vortex
and<00:04:33.990> here<00:04:34.260> come<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.410> archons<00:04:35.120> ploughing

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
and here come the archons ploughing

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.180 
and here come the archons ploughing
themselves<00:04:36.780> into<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.080> past<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.650> starcraft

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
themselves into the past of starcraft

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.580 
themselves into the past of starcraft
one<00:04:38.430> because<00:04:38.970> that's<00:04:39.300> where<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.690> vortex

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
one because that's where the vortex

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.580 
one because that's where the vortex
obviously<00:04:41.010> leads<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.320> hopefully<00:04:43.320> let's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
obviously leads to so hopefully let's

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.220 
obviously leads to so hopefully let's
see<00:04:43.740> what<00:04:43.860> happens<00:04:44.160> here<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:45.170> imagine<00:04:46.170> nothing

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
see what happens here I imagine nothing

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.490 
see what happens here I imagine nothing
quite<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.560> bit<00:04:49.280> okay<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.550> was<00:04:50.640> awesome<00:04:51.360> oh<00:04:51.600> my

imagined<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.950> archons<00:05:35.340> will<00:05:35.520> do<00:05:35.700> okay<00:05:36.090> with

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
imagined the archons will do okay with

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.390 
imagined the archons will do okay with
those<00:05:36.450> shields<00:05:36.780> and<00:05:37.320> we'll<00:05:37.860> have<00:05:38.010> a<00:05:38.070> look<00:05:38.220> what

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
those shields and we'll have a look what

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.540 
those shields and we'll have a look what
happens<00:05:38.790> anyway<00:05:39.030> here<00:05:39.420> we<00:05:39.450> go<00:05:40.010> gooey<00:05:41.010> mortals

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550
