00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
then back and the end of this bottom of
the<00:01:31.829> Z<00:01:32.040> stabilizes<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> picture<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the Z stabilizes the picture so it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.440 
the Z stabilizes the picture so it
doesn't<00:01:33.869> lean<00:01:34.350> forward<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:36.150> here

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
doesn't lean forward and then right here
