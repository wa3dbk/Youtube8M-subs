00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
this is IBR system I just want to show

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.780 
this is IBR system I just want to show
you<00:02:14.019> where<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:14.860> located<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.430> these<00:02:15.580> machines

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
you where it's located on these machines

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.040 
you where it's located on these machines
if<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.569> actually<00:02:16.690> take<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.019> look<00:02:17.260> down<00:02:17.409> here

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.990 

that's<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.650> very<00:02:21.860> good<00:02:22.070> view<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.400> what<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.670> IVR

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
that's a very good view of what the IVR

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.540 
that's a very good view of what the IVR
system<00:02:23.450> actually<00:02:23.810> looks<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.350> hands-on<00:02:24.860> so

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
system actually looks like hands-on so

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.150 
system actually looks like hands-on so
it's<00:02:25.730> not<00:02:26.240> exactly<00:02:27.020> as<00:02:27.230> easy<00:02:27.470> as<00:02:27.680> most<00:02:27.950> would

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
it's not exactly as easy as most would

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.210 
it's not exactly as easy as most would
think<00:02:28.720> its<00:02:29.720> actual<00:02:30.020> motor<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.590> controls<00:02:31.040> it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
think its actual motor that controls it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.130 
think its actual motor that controls it
and<00:02:31.340> anytime<00:02:32.210> you<00:02:32.420> start<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.750> machine<00:02:32.840> it's
