00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
that which is kind of a shame because I

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.690 
that which is kind of a shame because I
think<00:02:38.410> it'll<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.800> really<00:02:38.830> nice<00:02:39.160> like<00:02:39.460> if<00:02:39.580> you

think it'll be really nice like if you

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.660 
think it'll be really nice like if you
could<00:02:39.820> get<00:02:39.970> every<00:02:40.330> episode<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.810> every<00:02:41.230> season

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
could get every episode of every season

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.850 
could get every episode of every season
of<00:02:42.670> every<00:02:43.060> show<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.110> would<00:02:44.230> definitely<00:02:44.350> be

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
of every show and it would definitely be

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.750 
of every show and it would definitely be
worth<00:02:45.340> more<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:46.120> me<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:47.220> was<00:02:48.220> looking<00:02:48.550> at<00:02:48.640> other
