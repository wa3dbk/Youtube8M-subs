00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.010
 flambÃ© bananas 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.090
 the ingredients are bananas rum juice 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.800
 orange cinnamon butter and sugar 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.189
 we peel the bananas and cut them 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.189
 half 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.900
 we can cut the transverse or 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.870
 longitudinally we heat the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.059
 butter in a pan only melts 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.200
 we add the bananas and cook until 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.200
 that catch a little color 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.730
 at that time we add the sugar 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.120
 after two or three minutes we add the rum 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.120
 and we learn it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.440
 once the alcohol has been consumed 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.440
 we add the orange juice 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.439
 we cook for a few minutes until 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.439
 the thick syrup 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.320
 we put the bananas on a plate we 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.369
 we water with the syrup and sprinkle 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.369
