00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
guy but that being said I really think

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.950 
guy but that being said I really think
they<00:01:37.560> could<00:01:37.770> look<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.009> anything<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:39.509> reason

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
they could look like anything the reason

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
they could look like anything the reason
people<00:01:40.110> bought<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.159> Jordan<00:01:41.939> was

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
people bought them is because Jordan was

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.819 
people bought them is because Jordan was
a<00:01:42.119> huge<00:01:42.479> player<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.369> nostalgia<00:01:45.210> uh

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
a huge player and then that nostalgia uh

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.170 
a huge player and then that nostalgia uh
when<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:47.130> people<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.610> back<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.030> those

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
when you know people think back to those

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.020 
when you know people think back to those
days<00:01:48.240> led<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.560> Jordan<00:01:49.950> Brand<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.610> retro

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
days led to Jordan Brand you know retro

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.660 
days led to Jordan Brand you know retro
in<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> shoes<00:01:51.619> which<00:01:52.619> led<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.340> newer

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
in the shoes which led to a newer

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
in the shoes which led to a newer
generation<00:01:54.240> being<00:01:54.450> into<00:01:54.689> them<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.079> really

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
generation being into them I really

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.170 
generation being into them I really
don't<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.460> much<00:01:56.759> about<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
don't think it's as much about the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.789 
don't think it's as much about the
design<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.950> um<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> hype<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.170> Jordan

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
design as it is um the hype that Jordan

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.600 
design as it is um the hype that Jordan
created<00:02:02.100> around<00:02:02.340> them<00:02:02.610> now<00:02:04.159> do<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
created around them now do I think it

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.800 
created around them now do I think it
could<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.850> been<00:02:05.939> an<00:02:06.090> absolutely<00:02:06.570> hideous

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
could have been an absolutely hideous

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.790 
could have been an absolutely hideous
shoe<00:02:08.390> in<00:02:09.390> back<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> day<00:02:10.200> yes<00:02:10.910> yes<00:02:11.989> but<00:02:12.989> I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
shoe in back in the day yes yes but I

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.020 
shoe in back in the day yes yes but I
don't<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.280> if<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.490> was<00:02:14.580> an<00:02:14.700> absolutely

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
don't think if it was an absolutely

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.730 
don't think if it was an absolutely
