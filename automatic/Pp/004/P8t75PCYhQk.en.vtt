this is a system it is not a specific
game<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.670> went<00:01:19.420> on<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.630> internet<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.020> search

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
game I went on the internet and search

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
game I went on the internet and search
because<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.070> rules<00:01:21.280> came<00:01:21.550> in<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.960> in<00:01:23.800> German

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460

and I found a set that was translated by

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.070 
and I found a set that was translated by
or<00:01:28.180> put<00:01:28.990> together<00:01:29.260> by<00:01:29.500> Ward<00:01:29.800> batty<00:01:30.160> I<00:01:30.310> believe

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
or put together by Ward batty I believe

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.950 
or put together by Ward batty I believe
and<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.830> this<00:01:33.130> he<00:01:33.910> came<00:01:34.120> up<00:01:34.330> he<00:01:34.660> had<00:01:34.780> they<00:01:34.930> had

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
game does not have 50 games in it looks

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.760 
game does not have 50 games in it looks
like<00:01:42.010> it<00:01:42.130> only<00:01:42.250> has<00:01:42.490> three<00:01:43.390> four<00:01:43.630> five<00:01:44.050> in<00:01:44.500> it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
all revolve around this board now you

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.490 
all revolve around this board now you
have<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.120> admit<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.750> itself<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.320> pretty

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
have to admit that this itself is pretty

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.850 
have to admit that this itself is pretty
cool<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:51.610> comes<00:01:52.330> right<00:01:52.510> out<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> box<00:01:52.900> has<00:01:53.830> a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
cool it comes right out of the box has a

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.890 
cool it comes right out of the box has a
tray<00:01:54.250> for<00:01:54.850> each<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:55.210> colors<00:01:55.390> it's<00:01:55.720> very

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
tray for each of the colors it's very

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.010 
tray for each of the colors it's very
simple<00:01:56.200> here<00:01:57.040> you<00:01:57.670> know<00:01:57.760> you<00:01:57.850> can<00:01:58.150> throw<00:01:58.780> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
simple here you know you can throw the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.990 
simple here you know you can throw the
thing<00:01:59.260> in<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.530> Dyson<00:02:00.250> landed<00:02:00.550> oh<00:02:00.730> that's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
thing in the Dyson landed oh that's

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.240 
thing in the Dyson landed oh that's
actually<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.540> pretty<00:02:01.930> fun<00:02:02.440> game<00:02:02.470> right<00:02:02.950> then<00:02:03.130> an

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
actually a pretty fun game right then an

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.700 
actually a pretty fun game right then an
air<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.370> itself<00:02:03.900> okay<00:02:04.900> I'm<00:02:05.080> not<00:02:05.260> very<00:02:05.410> good<00:02:05.530> at

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
air of itself okay I'm not very good at

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.950 
air of itself okay I'm not very good at
it<00:02:05.830> but<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.550> know<00:02:06.580> that's<00:02:06.850> that's<00:02:07.570> what<00:02:07.840> you

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
it but you know that's that's what you

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.210 
it but you know that's that's what you
have<00:02:08.170> here<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.649> as<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.280> add<00:02:09.760> more<00:02:09.790> diceless

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
have here and as you add more diceless

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.410 
have here and as you add more diceless
you're<00:02:12.220> going<00:02:12.460> to<00:02:12.610> essentially<00:02:13.090> build<00:02:13.330> a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
you're going to essentially build a

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.229 
you're going to essentially build a
pyramid<00:02:13.720> with<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:15.010> dice<00:02:15.220> which<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> pretty

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
pyramid with the dice which is a pretty

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.970 
pyramid with the dice which is a pretty
neat<00:02:17.010> visual<00:02:18.010> effect<00:02:18.370> enough<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.820> itself<00:02:19.150> now

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
neat visual effect enough of itself now

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.530 
neat visual effect enough of itself now
there's<00:02:20.980> different<00:02:21.100> kinds<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.970> dice<00:02:22.209> games

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
there's different kinds of dice games

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.720 
there's different kinds of dice games
some<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.380> them<00:02:23.440> involve<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.070> starting<00:02:24.610> out

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
that's what it is and just like ice

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.280 
that's what it is and just like ice
house<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.260> just<00:04:26.740> like<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:28.480> piece<00:04:28.720> pack<00:04:28.990> set

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
ever seen that has pieces there is no

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.580 
ever seen that has pieces there is no
single<00:04:34.360> game<00:04:34.600> that's<00:04:34.840> compelling<00:04:35.230> although

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
single game that's compelling although

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.970 
single game that's compelling although
ice<00:04:35.800> house<00:04:36.040> probably<00:04:36.430> comes<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:36.910> closest<00:04:37.270> with

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
ice house probably comes a closest with

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.420 
ice house probably comes a closest with
zendo<00:04:38.980> but<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:40.300> know<00:04:40.450> but<00:04:41.050> still<00:04:41.290> it's<00:04:42.130> a<00:04:42.280> lot

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
zendo but you know but still it's a lot

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.350 
zendo but you know but still it's a lot
of<00:04:42.550> dice<00:04:43.440> unlike<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.470> lot<00:04:44.560> of<00:04:44.710> dice<00:04:44.950> so<00:04:45.790> it's<00:04:46.240> up

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
of dice unlike a lot of dice so it's up

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.520 
of dice unlike a lot of dice so it's up
to<00:04:46.390> you<00:04:46.600> if<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:46.840> find<00:04:47.140> that<00:04:47.200> interesting

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
just a sturdy pyramid so it doesn't

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.380 
just a sturdy pyramid so it doesn't
really<00:05:17.680> bode<00:05:18.190> well<00:05:18.220> for<00:05:18.550> dexterity<00:05:19.000> well

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
really bode well for dexterity well

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.110
