00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.760
 hello welcome saun like in the video 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.670
 today we are going to teach how to leave your 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.639
 virus-free computer viruses and 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.920
 Trojans are one of the most 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.689
 great things we can have when it comes to 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.899
 use our computer in a way 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.360
 everyday and for that reason it is necessary to make a 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.509
 periodic maintenance to maintain 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.640
 our free and secure computer in this 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.220
 way we will avoid possible thefts of 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.390
 data access to our files or 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.870
 any other problem that may 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.760
 derive from these these attacks for 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.480
 we are going to use three 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.930
 tools which are free and 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.720
 that we hope you can be served in the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.010
 first case what we would do would be 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.010
 eliminate what is the biggest part or 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.350
 possible to find viruses thanks to 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.840
 our own antivirus the antivirus 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.790
 usually bring a 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.970
 an analysis option either because 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.520
 we use the abbot updated that in addition to 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.040
 a very up-to-date database every day of 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.200
 fact is usually updated with the new 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.200
 the new possible threats that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.010
 appear then as analysis in this 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.350
 full case we could start this 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.450
 first search where surely 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.800
 we will find a high percentage of 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.890
 all possible files 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.540
 infected could have been delayed 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.180
 quite a while since he does a search 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.030
 very intensive by all the files of the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.430
 system and well this would be the first 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.259
 step that sure will give you a great 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.420
 cleaning and as he commented in this case 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.470
 of the antivirus is free since the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.350
 version 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.450
 the friday version of avast you can 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.180
 also use with an antivirus of 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.560
 payment and in fact good as the basis of 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.649
 data will also be very up to date 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.630
 but good with abbas he assured that also 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.180
 get what it is you need 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.920
 once we have the antivirus passed from 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.710
 full form what we are going to use 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.039
 are specialized programs in the 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.170
 search for spyware that are prototypes 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.819
 of viruses 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 also commonly called some like 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.560
 Trojans we are going to use one 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.239
 called superantispyware too 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.990
 you will find this for free 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.300
 internet program 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.760
 and you can also update the base of 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.650
 data in this case it must be you who 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.690
 do not do it since the program is 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.720
 will notify but will not be updated 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.660
 automatic as abbas in this case as 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.970
 I saw design of day now and good in this 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.940
 suppose we already have it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.580
 updated and with this simple option 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.230
 to examine your computer will start to 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.180
 start a search for all 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.250
 records the memory and files of the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.710
 computer and you will surely find 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.140
 also some that have even had 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.970
 You can skip it and as I told you 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.200
 they are computers there are programs 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.850
 specialized in anti spam spywares in 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.120
 Sometimes you will find that it gives you 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.770
 positive steps since any crack or 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.500
 suspicious program that you can have 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.220
 when it will detect as a tablet normally 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.450
 because they have files with serious or 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.180
 although good in the database of this 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.319
 program because it is detected as 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.569
 such 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.389
 and once we have passed both the 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.549
 antivirus like superantispyware us 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.709
 we like to move to the last program that 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.430
 he is also specialized in this type 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.769
 search for Trojans and any 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.859
 program that has this way 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.859
 then we will use that the so-called 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.670
 see you around here spybot search and 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.940
 destroy this program is also like 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.030
 commented free and has a base of 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.430
 very powerful data and a very search 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.850
 deep and you will find us also 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.640
 some that can happen to us 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.050
 as you see that different options but 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.060
 good the grass interests us xeral 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.740
 adapt as I tell you the basis of 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.680
 data is very important to have it up to date 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.720
 since for many programs that we pass 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.000
 If it is not up to date and the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.340
 viruses are not detected they will go through 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.010
 high since you have to keep in mind that 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.810
 all viruses are updated 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.940
 people who are dedicated to creating them and 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.950
 promote them online and then there are 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.030
 to be always wide then 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.820
 simply the haiti group 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.770
 later with a scan system 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.660
 would start what is the search and then 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.120
 xavi to a final list with everything 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.720
 we have found 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.150
 He also recommended this to look at that 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.790
 there is no false positive since you can 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.340
 find that you delete the entire list of 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.160
 some program that uses a file 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.060
 strange or stop working then 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.270
 good we see that with these three steps 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.260
 antivirus 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.570
 superantispyware and spies boot sure 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.160
 from our computer free of viruses and 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.350
 remember to do it in a way 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.830
 periodically and always with the programs 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.830
 updated
