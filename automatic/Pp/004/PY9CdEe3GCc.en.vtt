00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.640 
rather stuff when I had to go to the gym
and<00:02:26.150> then<00:02:26.210> it's<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.810> take<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.380> out<00:02:27.440> go<00:02:27.590> to

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
and then it's like I take it out go to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.230 
and then it's like I take it out go to
the<00:02:27.800> gym<00:02:27.920> then<00:02:28.100> my<00:02:28.220> hair<00:02:28.370> gets<00:02:28.490> wet<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.820> out<00:02:28.940> so

the gym then my hair gets wet it out so

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.120 
the gym then my hair gets wet it out so
it's<00:02:29.780> kind<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:29.990> hard<00:02:30.050> for<00:02:30.260> me<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.530> do<00:02:30.650> styles

it's kind of hard for me to do styles

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.550 
it's kind of hard for me to do styles
when<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> have<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.670> weave<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.360> unless<00:02:33.140> i'm<00:02:33.320> going

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
when I have a weave in unless i'm going

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.310 
when I have a weave in unless i'm going
out<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:34.550> do<00:02:35.090> overnight<00:02:35.600> styles<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.140> just

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
out to do overnight styles it just

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.750 
out to do overnight styles it just
doesn't<00:02:36.650> really<00:02:36.770> work<00:02:37.040> because<00:02:37.280> i<00:02:37.460> have<00:02:37.640> to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
doesn't really work because i have to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.340 
doesn't really work because i have to
get<00:02:37.850> up<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.060> go<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.300> gym<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.780> i'm<00:02:39.260> not
