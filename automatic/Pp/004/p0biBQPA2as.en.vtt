00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 welcome to ideas for crafts 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 today we are going to make a lighthouse with glasses 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.809
 disposable the list of materials the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.059
 can find at the end of the video to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.910
 make the lighthouse let's take the glass 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.039
 disposable and if you like to have an idea 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.070
 more or less where are you going to paint the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.160
 stripes can do it with a pencil 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.230
 before painting it we must draw all the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.220
 circumference of the glass on the side 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.590
 where it is taken on a construction paper and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.200
 we are going to cut it this is going to be the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.620
 roof and now we can already paint the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.829
 strips of the lighthouse and we can paint 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 also a door now let's take 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.800
 the disposable plate and we're going to paint it 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.350
 with green tempera paint so that 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.770
 be the grass after we can do it 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.770
 a brown part that is the sand and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.100
 finally the blue part that is going to be the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.800
 sea now we take the paper circle 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.559
 construction that we had cut and what 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.829
 we doubled in four parts 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.689
 in this way after we are going to cut him 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:16.110
 one side with scissors and once 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.950
 we cut out we put rubber to one of the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.600
 four parts and we put it together so that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.600
 is formed as a roof 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.590
 then let's take the paper roll 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.470
 empty hygienic and we're going to cut it in 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.020
 three parties now we take the paper 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.260
 yellow construction and let's cut 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.230
 a strip with measures more or less than 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.130
 two centimeters wide by 12 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:49.610
 centimeters long let's draw a 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.550
 line horizontally and then we go to 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.550
 trace several vertical lines 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.230
 we put rubber and we will paste 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.470
 around the paper roll this is going to 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.020
 be our focus or our light 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.710
 then we 're going to hit it on the roof 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.770
 so let's put rubber all over the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.590
 circumference of the paper roll very 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.700
 important is to put it on the side where it does not 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.220
 has yellow construction paper 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.590
 finally let's hit the lighthouse I'll 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.170
 I put a little tape to reinforce it 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.230
 but you can simply put the rubber 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.770
 in the whole circumference and it sticks 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.550
 on the disposable plate we assure you 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.870
 and so we have our lighthouse and after 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.150
 from there you can use your 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.150
 imagination and make various designs
