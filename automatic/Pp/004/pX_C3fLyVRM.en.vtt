physicians<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.990> future<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.740> will<00:02:18.950> be<00:02:19.100> a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
physicians of the future this will be a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.420 
physicians of the future this will be a
satellite<00:02:20.150> branch<00:02:20.600> for<00:02:21.290> Ohio<00:02:21.530> University<00:02:21.740> and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
satellite branch for Ohio University and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.780 
satellite branch for Ohio University and
the<00:02:22.970> students<00:02:23.960> will<00:02:24.530> actually<00:02:24.920> rotate<00:02:25.550> here

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
the students will actually rotate here

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.660 
the students will actually rotate here
at<00:02:25.940> southpoint<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.690> then<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:28.310> will<00:02:28.460> build

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
at southpoint and then we will build

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.030 
at southpoint and then we will build
them<00:02:28.850> into<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.450> Cleveland<00:02:29.900> Clinic<00:02:30.050> much<00:02:30.860> with

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
bring to healthcare the need is is to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.190 
bring to healthcare the need is is to
try<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.620> look<00:03:51.920> towards<00:03:52.520> you<00:03:53.420> know<00:03:53.510> taking<00:03:53.870> care

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
try to look towards you know taking care

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.910 
try to look towards you know taking care
of<00:03:54.230> patients<00:03:54.470> with<00:03:55.010> prevention<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.930> making

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
of patients with prevention and making

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.670 
of patients with prevention and making
sure<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:58.100> we're<00:03:58.460> exquisite<00:03:59.180> about<00:03:59.720> trying

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
sure that we're exquisite about trying

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.580 
sure that we're exquisite about trying
to<00:04:00.830> prevent<00:04:01.190> illness<00:04:01.640> or<00:04:02.230> take<00:04:03.230> care<00:04:03.440> of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
to prevent illness or take care of

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.750 
to prevent illness or take care of
chronic<00:04:03.980> illness<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.520> a<00:04:04.910> more<00:04:05.240> efficient<00:04:05.990> way

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
chronic illness in a more efficient way

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.880 
chronic illness in a more efficient way
so<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:07.790> think<00:04:07.940> that's<00:04:08.240> that's<00:04:08.630> really<00:04:08.890> our

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
so I think that's that's really our

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.280 
so I think that's that's really our
sweet<00:04:10.250> spot
