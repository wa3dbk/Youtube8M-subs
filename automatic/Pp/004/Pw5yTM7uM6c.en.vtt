today<00:00:00.810> I'm<00:00:00.930> here<00:00:01.110> scientists<00:00:01.560> will<00:00:01.920> be

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
today I'm here scientists will be

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.010 
today I'm here scientists will be
starting<00:00:02.370> our<00:00:02.460> secondary<00:00:02.939> fermentation<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.840> a

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
starting our secondary fermentation of a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:20.269 
starting our secondary fermentation of a
Bavarian<00:00:04.620> hefeweizen<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.160> our

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
Bavarian hefeweizen so here we have our

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.509 
Bavarian hefeweizen so here we have our
f<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.609> oxen<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.869> fermented<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.830> seven<00:00:23.369> days

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
f of oxen it's fermented for seven days

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.120 
f of oxen it's fermented for seven days
and<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.600> fermentation<00:00:25.230> slowed<00:00:25.590> down<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and the fermentation slowed down to the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.170 
and the fermentation slowed down to the
point<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.699> move<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> into<00:00:27.029> our

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
point that we can move it into our

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.620 
point that we can move it into our
secondary<00:00:27.810> fermenter<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.970> co2<00:00:30.269> that's

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
secondary fermenter so the co2 that's

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
secondary fermenter so the co2 that's
released<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.109> fermentation<00:00:31.380> has<00:00:32.070> slowed<00:00:32.279> down

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
released by fermentation has slowed down

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.580 
released by fermentation has slowed down
to<00:00:32.489> about<00:00:32.790> two<00:00:33.059> minutes<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.440> ahead

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to about two minutes so we can go ahead

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
to about two minutes so we can go ahead
and<00:00:34.980> move<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.670> patch<00:00:35.910> into<00:00:36.149> our<00:00:36.300> secondary

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
and move this patch into our secondary

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.049 
and move this patch into our secondary
fermenter<00:00:37.280> now<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.340> reason<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
fermenter now the reason we're going to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.700 
fermenter now the reason we're going to

our batch from our primary fermenter to
our<00:01:12.540> secondary<00:01:13.020> fermenter<00:01:14.060> get<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> batch

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
our secondary fermenter get the batch

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
our secondary fermenter get the batch
into<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> nice<00:01:16.049> clean<00:01:16.439> vessel<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.549> do

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
into a nice clean vessel so we can do

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
into a nice clean vessel so we can do
secondary<00:01:18.270> fermentation<00:01:18.540> which<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.409> another

secondary fermentation which is another

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.859 
secondary fermentation which is another
week<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.270> allowing<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> yeast<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.840> ferment

week of allowing the yeast to ferment
our<00:01:22.320> beer<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:23.509> 2p<00:01:24.509> siphon<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.140> allow<00:01:25.409> us<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
our beer this 2p siphon will allow us to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.030 
our beer this 2p siphon will allow us to
get<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> nice<00:01:26.909> strong<00:01:27.360> airtight<00:01:28.049> flow<00:01:28.470> from<00:01:28.890> our

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
get a nice strong airtight flow from our

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.770 
get a nice strong airtight flow from our
primary<00:01:29.310> fermenter<00:01:29.759> into<00:01:30.030> our<00:01:30.360> secondary

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
primary fermenter into our secondary

primary fermenter into our secondary
fermenter<00:01:32.329> ok<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.900> ahead<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
fermenter ok so we can go ahead and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
fermenter ok so we can go ahead and
insert<00:01:35.159> our<00:01:35.400> siphon<00:01:36.000> into<00:01:36.420> our<00:01:36.540> primary

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
insert our siphon into our primary

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.650 
insert our siphon into our primary
furniture<00:01:40.310> get<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> few<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:42.380> plunges

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.120 

okay<00:01:48.660> there<00:01:49.080> we<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.320> we've<00:01:49.590> started<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
okay there we have we've started the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.890 
okay there we have we've started the
flow<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:51.030> let<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.300> size<00:01:51.510> of<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.750> match

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
flow will let the size of the match

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.230 
flow will let the size of the match
taste<00:01:52.410> of<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.560> 10<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> 15<00:01:53.220> minutes<00:01:53.400> so<00:01:54.060> here

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
taste of all 10 to 15 minutes so here

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.380 
taste of all 10 to 15 minutes so here
you<00:01:54.330> can<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.690> our<00:01:54.990> secondary<00:01:55.920> fermenter<00:01:56.520> it's

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you can see our secondary fermenter it's

let<00:02:28.659> it<00:02:28.750> ferment<00:02:29.140> for<00:02:29.319> another<00:02:29.530> seven<00:02:29.860> days

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
let it ferment for another seven days

let it ferment for another seven days
here<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.849> see<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.030> sentiment<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.870> we

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
here you can see the sentiment that we

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.259 
here you can see the sentiment that we
left<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.500> our<00:02:32.590> primary<00:02:32.860> fermenter<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:34.180> I

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
left in our primary fermenter so if I

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.180 
left in our primary fermenter so if I
turn<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.599> sideways<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.260> see<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:35.860> pretty

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
turn it sideways you can see it's pretty

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.839 
turn it sideways you can see it's pretty
thick<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.099> proteins<00:02:39.579> and<00:02:39.790> other

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
particles that existed in our beer that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.530 
particles that existed in our beer that
we've<00:02:41.799> separated<00:02:42.040> away<00:02:42.459> from<00:02:42.819> her<00:02:42.909> back<00:02:43.120> here

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
we've separated away from her back here

you<00:02:43.659> can<00:02:43.810> see<00:02:43.989> we've<00:02:44.170> put<00:02:44.379> our<00:02:44.500> secondary

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
you can see we've put our secondary

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.220 
you can see we've put our secondary
