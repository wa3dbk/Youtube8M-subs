this black color which also has shimmers

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.990 
this black color which also has shimmers
in<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.540> but<00:00:39.079> you<00:00:39.410> can<00:00:39.800> just<00:00:40.010> use<00:00:40.130> a<00:00:40.550> simple

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
in it but you can just use a simple

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.729 
in it but you can just use a simple
matte-black<00:00:41.180> nail<00:00:41.840> polish<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.200> doesn't

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
matte-black nail polish that doesn't

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.450 
matte-black nail polish that doesn't
matter<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.700> these<00:00:43.880> just<00:00:44.270> roll<00:00:44.660> off<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.460> this

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
matter so these just roll off and this

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.009 
matter so these just roll off and this
is<00:00:46.520> just<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.970> connector<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.480> connect<00:00:47.780> both

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
is just a connector to connect both

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.660 
is just a connector to connect both
colors<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:51.260> they<00:00:51.410> come<00:00:51.590> with<00:00:51.620> two<00:00:51.980> applicators

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
colors so they come with two applicators

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.380 
colors so they come with two applicators
and<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.359> first<00:00:53.629> one<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.530> pen<00:00:55.010> form<00:00:55.429> so<00:00:56.359> that

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
and the first one is a pen form so that

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.189 
and the first one is a pen form so that
you<00:00:56.660> get<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.230> precise<00:00:57.800> tip<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:59.120> also<00:00:59.300> has<00:00:59.809> a

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
you get a precise tip and it also has a

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.279 
you get a precise tip and it also has a
brush<00:01:00.949> form<00:01:01.280> like<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.629> for<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.050> black

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
brush form like this so for the black

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.950 
brush form like this so for the black
color<00:01:03.530> you'll<00:01:03.769> be<00:01:03.920> needing<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.610> precise<00:01:05.600> tip

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
we're basically going to create like a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.770 
we're basically going to create like a
pattern<00:01:54.170> over<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.190> gold<00:01:55.640> color<00:01:55.910> that

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
pattern over the gold color that

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.250 
pattern over the gold color that
resembles<00:01:57.770> tiger<00:01:58.640> stripes<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.810> they<00:02:00.080> don't

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
resembles tiger stripes so they don't

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.250 
resembles tiger stripes so they don't
have<00:02:00.410> to<00:02:00.530> be<00:02:00.620> even<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:02.479> they<00:02:02.750> don't<00:02:02.930> have<00:02:03.110> to

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
have to be even and they don't have to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.160 
have to be even and they don't have to
be<00:02:03.380> very<00:02:03.620> neat<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:05.150> start<00:02:05.420> from<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.720> sides<00:02:05.990> of

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
be very neat so start from the sides of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.070 
be very neat so start from the sides of
the<00:02:06.320> nail<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.740> just<00:02:07.010> sort<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.550> make<00:02:08.080> lines

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
the nail and just sort of make lines

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:28.110 
the nail and just sort of make lines
that<00:02:09.590> change<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.840> thickness

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.830 

and<00:02:29.489> do<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.610> same<00:02:30.640> thing<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.360> rest<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
and do the same thing to the rest of the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:03:00.620 
and do the same thing to the rest of the
nails

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:13.280 

you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.280 

so<00:03:14.290> now<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.500> we<00:03:14.709> finished<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> pattern

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
so now that we finished the pattern

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.330 
so now that we finished the pattern
we're<00:03:17.290> just<00:03:17.410> going<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.650> go<00:03:17.740> over<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.069> with<00:03:18.220> our

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
we're just going to go over it with our

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:30.840 
we're just going to go over it with our
top<00:03:18.640> coat

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.910
