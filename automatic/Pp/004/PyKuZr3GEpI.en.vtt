00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.940
Hello, I'm very glad to know
you haven't given up on me, yet.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.800
A lot of people have asked me to draw a smile
with teeth, and my advice is, don't.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.800
If you can avoid it, do so.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:22.139
Drawings and paintings with smiles with teeth,
usually look unnatural and stiff.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.040
In my opinion, it's a better idea to draw a smile
which is light and with no teeth.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.460
However, apparently, a lot of people need to do so
because of commissions, etc...

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180
Therefore, I decided to make this video,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.240
showing you some tips which I hope,
may be helpful to you.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.780
For this I'll do a portrait of supermodel Miranda Kerr.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.020
Holding the pencil from the back and with loose strokes,
I do the outline of the face.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.280
I do it by paying attention to the angles,
that is the slant of the lines.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.520
I lightly indicate where the eyes and mouth will go
and then refine the form.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.680
Sketch the ear and hair.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.840
I do an eye and brow.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.920
They don't need to be perfect right now,
I'm just setting the size and location.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.200
I erase the lines that I don't need anymore.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
I do the nose with light shadows.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.740
I fix the ear that should be lower and the mouth.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.120
I pretty much move all over the place, as you can see.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.360
The mouth seems crooked, I'll erase it and redo it
according to the tilt of the head.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.140
Using the graphite powder
from when I sharpen the lead,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.100
I charge the brush and do the shadows.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.140
In the same way, I work
with a smaller brush for the detail.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.300
With a soft lead a 6B, I do the darker area of the hair.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.740
And with a 2B, the dark areas of the face.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.960
While doing the shadows
I also do the texture of the hair.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.600
With a harder lead, an H, I do the lighter shadows.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.460
I pass the brush to smudge the graphite
and give a light tone.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.120
Now I work on detail.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.960
I draw the teeth very lightly,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.740
much lighter than what they actually are in reality

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.680
and what they look like in pictures.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.280
Similarly, the shadows created by the smile,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.460
that go from the side of the nose
to the sides of the mouth,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.300
I do them a lot softer and lighter than the real thing.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.380
I correct the eye because Miranda has them
very characteristic, sort of pointed and long.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.160
I erase the mouth once more
because it didn't convince me fully.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.760
Here we go again.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.020
I redo the teeth lightly and then
I brush them to smudge them,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.020
so that the smile doesn't look hard and fake.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.360
With a kneaded eraser, I pull lights.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.960
The complete list of materials
is in the description of the video.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.920
You see this by clicking
the "Show More" tab right under it.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.380
Let's do some nice lashes.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.320
I fixed her forehead line
and continue darkening some shadows.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.860
The outline of the iris is normally darker.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.500
I'll use again the powder and brush
for more shadows.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.400
This gives a nice volume to the hair.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I also use it on the skin.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.760
With the eraser I pull lights, with the brush I smudge

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.120
and with the pencil, I keep doing details.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.860
The shadow under the chin is important
to push the head forward.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.140
One last light on the shoulder and it is ready .

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.540
