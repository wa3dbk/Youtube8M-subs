00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 functions 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.980
 let's scan a vehicle 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.240
 caravan great power 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.370
 is there 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.370
 a great caravan model 98 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.090
 this vehicle is beyond not 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:51.650
 turn on 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.920
 let's see what the diagnosis is 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.710
 and we are with the scanner taking out the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.260
 parameters 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 here what marks us is that the advance 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.610
 of spark is at zero 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.630
 so we do not have no spark 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.230
 and we mark the code d 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.900
 the code fails 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.000
 which has been the 0 23 20 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.330
 which refers to the circuit 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.720
 ignition preference what comes 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.820
 being the engine turn in this case 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.360
 has been the sap clan in which 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.600
 responsible for 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.330
 to send the signal when the motor turns 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 the court sends the signal to the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.720
 computer 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.600
 and there is the coil and the sd relay for 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 make the cut once the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.890
 cut that we produce the spark 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.240
 and to produce him 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.240
 the ignition of the engine 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.800
 to little 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.890
 in this case we have 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.210
 and the king 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.130
 he is the one in charge of not 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.250
 let the current pass 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.980
 for those who are being side 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.340
 the coil 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.239
 how 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.220
 communication this is being 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.620
 communication when one of them 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.540
 the vehicle interrupts its communication 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.540
 can not can not turn it on 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.010
 let's look below where we already have 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.010
 the crankshaft sensor 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.720
 which is what gives us the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.440
 the spark in this case we already have it 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.650
 taken away 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.460
 we want the extender the tribune 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.600
 the failure of this sensor 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.460
 that a whole policy has 33 cables 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.920
 that is being the signs of earth 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.330
 the current one 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.130
 and we can see 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.140
 this green 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.530
 is completely drawn from inside 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.319
 So here we have the flaw that 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.319
 we already dial the turn signal code 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.990
 currents and there are but if there is no sign of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.140
 spin practically nothing 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.550
 and this is the fault that this 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.670
 this vehicle 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:46.220
 it is a very fault 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:49.400
 very simple with this type of equipment and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.190
 when we know how it works how it is 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.580
 communicating the vehicle inside between 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.580
 what it is 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.710
 the computer the coil and the sensor of the 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.330
 crankshaft the sensor of the camps since it is 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.330
 the one that moves the camshafts 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.450
 here we have the other sensor 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.640
 This is the sensor of the 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.400
 camps that also has the same 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.340
 communication 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.419
 when this is not the communication is missing 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.240
 the spark is interrupted the current and 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.370
 we do not have anymore we do not have an earthquake 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.009
 when there is no communication in any 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.300
 of these four systems is never going to 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.300
 turn on the vehicle 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.710
 what will we do we will 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.400
 connect this sensor buy another sensor 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.770
 with towel 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.410
 the pure connection is by the harness 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.520
 we put it again and we put 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.520
 operate the vehicle 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.370
 because we already connect everything and we connect 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.710
 the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.130
 the sensor of the field and we already connected 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.260
 out there the signal the signal that goes to the 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.560
 computer the turn signal was what 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.970
 We were failing and we are not going to 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.970
 start it to see what 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.680
 with that rectification I remain 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.010
 because here we have the vehicle already 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:03.800
 perfectly functioning only the 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:07.190
 failure out there was the signal 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.320
 Sometimes we can measure with a multimeter 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:14.129
 or a detector 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.649
 of current a led because I took 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.760
 we can measure the current of the 

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:22.780
 land but a signal as the measure 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.660
 that's why it's important that we have the 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.120
 scanner 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.610
 because that very specific scanner there 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.009
 us 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.780
 it tells us exactly if it is missing stones 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.569
 and he lacks current or if he lacks 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.759
 some signal 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.500
 it's all here we meet in the car 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.560
 northern clinic 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.680
 there are specialists already we already have several 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.600
 Grace 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.690
 apparently the stool that has a 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.690
 little bit more electromechanical failures
