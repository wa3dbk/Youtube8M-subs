00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
simplified version of that main little

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.490 
simplified version of that main little
repeating<00:01:21.420> lick<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.930> goes<00:01:22.140> through<00:01:22.410> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
repeating lick that goes through the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.800 
repeating lick that goes through the
song<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.790> C<00:01:24.980> to<00:01:25.980> F<00:01:26.240> now<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.720> do

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
song so here we go C to F now you can do

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.770 
song so here we go C to F now you can do
two<00:01:28.050> things<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.500> F<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.980> can<00:01:29.130> hammer<00:01:29.370> on

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
two things on the F you can hammer on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.220 
two things on the F you can hammer on
both<00:01:30.780> strings<00:01:31.440> onto<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> D<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.270> G<00:01:33.690> so<00:01:34.080> it's

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
both strings onto the D and G so it's

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.020 
both strings onto the D and G so it's
going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.440> be<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.950> second<00:01:35.550> fret<00:01:35.760> and<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> 3rd

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
going to be the second fret and the 3rd

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.710 
going to be the second fret and the 3rd
fret<00:01:36.450> or<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.160> hammer<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.450> 1i

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
fret or you can just hammer them the 1i

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.370 
fret or you can just hammer them the 1i
I<00:01:40.620> think<00:01:41.370> it's<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.760> just<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:43.020> but

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
I think it's the just the one right but

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
I think it's the just the one right but
if<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.560> makes<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.830> either<00:01:43.980> hammer<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.880> both<00:01:45.060> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
if it makes it either hammer on both I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.720 
if it makes it either hammer on both I
like<00:01:46.260> just<00:01:46.470> doing<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:46.800> G<00:01:47.010> hammer<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.640> it'd

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
like just doing the G hammer on so it'd

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.910 
like just doing the G hammer on so it'd
be<00:01:47.760> an<00:01:47.910> open<00:01:48.300> G<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:49.050> then<00:01:49.500> you're<00:01:49.590> basically

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
be an open G and then you're basically

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.970 
be an open G and then you're basically
hammering<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.540> second<00:01:52.050> fret<00:01:52.410> I'm

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
hammering on to the second fret I'm

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.190 
hammering on to the second fret I'm
playing<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.550> a<00:01:53.640> traditional<00:01:54.120> F<00:01:54.300> chord<00:01:54.600> so

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
playing just a traditional F chord so

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.420 
playing just a traditional F chord so
we're<00:01:55.320> gonna<00:01:55.410> go

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.110 

so<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> went<00:01:59.670> down

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.980 

you

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:17.590 

so<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.230> down<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.240> then<00:02:09.869> mute<00:02:10.290> down<00:02:10.770> up

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.990 

right

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.920 

and<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.120> I'm<00:02:25.210> going<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.390> come<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.660> F

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
and then I'm going to come to that F

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:38.229 
and then I'm going to come to that F
chord

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.959 

slipping<00:02:38.870> your<00:02:39.079> hammer<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.920> down<00:02:40.219> and<00:02:40.549> then

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
slipping your hammer on a down and then

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:46.170 
slipping your hammer on a down and then
down<00:02:41.239> down

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.699 

again

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:30.300 

so<00:02:53.370> altogether<00:02:53.549> we<00:02:53.909> got

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.980 

and<00:03:30.550> that's<00:03:31.000> basically<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.720> whole

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
and that's basically the whole

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.460 
and that's basically the whole
progression<00:03:32.950> now<00:03:33.580> there<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.940> like<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.320> kind<00:03:35.320> of

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
progression now there is like a kind of

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.380 
progression now there is like a kind of
a<00:03:35.620> coracii<00:03:36.250> bridgie<00:03:36.700> part<00:03:36.970> where<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.180> has<00:03:37.360> a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
a coracii bridgie part where it has a

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.810 
a coracii bridgie part where it has a
pause<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.860> know<00:03:38.890> when<00:03:39.220> you're<00:03:39.340> doing<00:03:39.520> the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
pause you know when you're doing the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.440 
pause you know when you're doing the

and then we're gonna catch it again on

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.850 
and then we're gonna catch it again on
an<00:04:11.410> upstart<00:04:11.770> so<00:04:11.950> it's<00:04:12.070> gonna<00:04:12.160> be<00:04:13.470> C<00:04:14.470> we<00:04:14.680> got

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
of the a so we got and then I do both of

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.480 
of the a so we got and then I do both of
those<00:04:39.220> on<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> Down<00:04:39.790> stroke<00:04:41.130> but<00:04:42.130> I'm<00:04:42.280> going<00:04:42.430> to

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
those on a Down stroke but I'm going to

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
those on a Down stroke but I'm going to
come<00:04:42.760> back<00:04:42.940> up<00:04:43.180> on<00:04:43.600> that<00:04:43.750> third<00:04:44.080> fret<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.770> a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
come back up on that third fret of the a

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.980 
come back up on that third fret of the a
upstroke<00:04:46.510> so<00:04:46.690> we<00:04:46.780> got<00:04:51.120> same<00:04:52.120> thing<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.690> next

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
upstroke so we got same thing the next

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.780 
upstroke so we got same thing the next
two<00:04:53.140> notes<00:04:53.380> which<00:04:53.620> is<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.919> fifth<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.550> the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
two notes which is the fifth in the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.000 
two notes which is the fifth in the
third<00:04:55.180> fret<00:04:55.600> on<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.840> E<00:04:56.020> are<00:04:56.500> both<00:04:56.800> down

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
third fret on the E are both down

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.989 
third fret on the E are both down
strokes

00:04:58.989 --> 00:04:58.999 
strokes

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.699 
strokes
and<00:04:59.269> then<00:04:59.449> I<00:04:59.509> do<00:04:59.569> that<00:04:59.809> upstroke<00:05:00.319> thing<00:05:00.499> again

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:00.709 
and then I do that upstroke thing again

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:03.159 
and then I do that upstroke thing again
so<00:05:00.889> it's<00:05:01.009> a<00:05:01.099> pattern<00:05:01.549> that<00:05:01.579> just<00:05:01.969> goes<00:05:02.659> over

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
so it's a pattern that just goes over

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.419 
so it's a pattern that just goes over
the<00:05:03.379> different<00:05:03.799> notes<00:05:04.039> that<00:05:04.129> we're<00:05:04.279> going<00:05:04.369> to

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:04.429 
the different notes that we're going to

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:11.010 
the different notes that we're going to
do

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.900 

we're<00:05:11.530> going<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.710> go<00:05:11.800> back<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.750> fifth<00:05:13.750> fret<00:05:14.110> e

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
we're going to go back to fifth fret e

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.840 
we're going to go back to fifth fret e
third<00:05:15.910> fret<00:05:16.300> a<00:05:16.480> so<00:05:16.930> altogether<00:05:17.350> we<00:05:17.560> got<00:05:17.850> and

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
third fret a so altogether we got and

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.370 
third fret a so altogether we got and
then<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.760> then<00:05:22.950> and<00:05:23.950> then<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:26.080> then<00:05:26.260> we're

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
then and then and then and then we're

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.500 
then and then and then and then we're
just<00:05:26.410> going<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.680> apply<00:05:27.070> that<00:05:27.270> strum<00:05:28.270> or

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
just going to apply that strum or

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:45.690 
just going to apply that strum or
