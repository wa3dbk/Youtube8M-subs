00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.729 

yellow<00:00:59.180> tag<00:00:59.480> me<00:00:59.809> he's<00:00:59.989> flying<00:01:00.199> through<00:01:00.680> the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.420 

I<00:01:12.259> move<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.380> finger<00:01:13.680> leather<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> middle

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.529 
I move the finger leather in the middle
I<00:01:15.560> think<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:17.670> thing<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:17.939> getting<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:18.509> big

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
I think this thing is getting so big

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.100 
I think this thing is getting so big
it's<00:01:19.020> blocking<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.590> light<00:01:20.420> for<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> plate

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it's blocking the light for the plate

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.669 
it's blocking the light for the plate
coral<00:01:23.719> as<00:01:24.719> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.380> starting<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
coral as you can see it's starting to

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:26.990 
coral as you can see it's starting to
get<00:01:25.770> white<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.219> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.429> on<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.579> side<00:01:26.970> I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
get white there on the on the side I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.899 
get white there on the on the side I
think<00:01:27.360> there's<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.110> lack<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.289> light

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
think there's because of lack of light

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.039 
think there's because of lack of light
because<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.119> thing<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:30.659> big<00:01:30.899> it's

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
because of this thing see how big it's

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.770 
because of this thing see how big it's
getting<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.729> mean<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.149> this<00:01:33.390> side<00:01:33.630> was

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
getting I mean it was like this side was

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
getting I mean it was like this side was
half<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.679> piece<00:01:34.890> when<00:01:35.819> I<00:01:35.880> first

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
half of this little piece when I first

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
half of this little piece when I first
got<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:39.740> 10<00:01:40.740> times<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.759> more

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.609 
same with this Xena we all know about
that<00:01:44.069> look<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:45.140> almost<00:01:46.140> touching<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
that look it is almost touching the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.010 
that look it is almost touching the
