00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
notes and Frank's music was very dense

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.200 
notes and Frank's music was very dense
so<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.220> beautiful<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.820> even<00:01:06.060> just

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
so it was more beautiful to even just
look<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.380> black<00:01:07.590> page<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.189> very

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
look at and the black page was a very

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.130 
look at and the black page was a very
special<00:01:08.820> piece<00:01:09.000> because<00:01:09.799> it<00:01:10.799> had<00:01:10.979> rhythmic

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
special piece because it had rhythmic

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.289

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
just the rhythmic complexity but that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.850 
just the rhythmic complexity but that
doesn't<00:01:41.520> make<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:41.880> piece<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.210> music<00:01:42.860> what
