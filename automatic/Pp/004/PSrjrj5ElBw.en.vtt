looks<00:02:10.709> exactly<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.370> same<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
looks exactly the same as it

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.229

they have a slight flip to them um and

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.770 
they have a slight flip to them um and
and<00:03:15.599> it's<00:03:15.840> hard<00:03:16.139> to<00:03:16.199> see<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:18.359> wig<00:03:18.540> isn't

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780

though I think it's got just the right

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.879 
though I think it's got just the right
amount<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.669> Sheen

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889

like<00:04:35.539> underneath

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.630 

like<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:47.730> said<00:04:48.170> angie<00:04:49.170> has<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.590> monofilament<00:04:50.160> top

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
like I said angie has a monofilament top

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.910 
like I said angie has a monofilament top
so<00:04:51.480> I<00:04:51.510> definitely<00:04:51.930> recommend<00:04:52.320> wearing<00:04:52.620> with

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
so I definitely recommend wearing with

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.680 
so I definitely recommend wearing with
wood<00:04:53.280> cap<00:04:53.460> underneath<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:54.090> because

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
wood cap underneath it because

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.870 
wood cap underneath it because
monofilament<00:04:55.170> can<00:04:55.410> be<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.500> little<00:04:55.650> Scratchy

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
monofilament can be a little Scratchy

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.270 
monofilament can be a little Scratchy
but<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.240> wig<00:04:57.420> cap<00:04:57.450> will<00:04:58.200> keep<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:59.220> from

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
but the wig cap will keep that from

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.500 
but the wig cap will keep that from
bothering<00:05:00.180> you

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
it has a comfort grip at the top to keep

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.800
