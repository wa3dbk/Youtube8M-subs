00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.040
 Hello it is broadcasting this show pilot 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.400
 Engri games and at the microphone I'm pretty 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.369
 simplest shock went today on 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.189
 ring game real boxing since done 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.830
 it is not in Russia, that word is not real 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.310
 connects and not with real boys not with 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.439
 something like this game is called 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 real boxing and basically about him in it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.309
 it comes 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.640
 and although I am not a fan of not boxing 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.380
 like sports not fighting games oh yes 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 the sequence will start over a 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.910
 first we see that the game is made on 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.340
 anrial engine in principle there is no 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.070
 no wonder because on this engine 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.230
 already that only did however 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.570
 it was already the engine itself promises us 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.789
 quality graphics quality 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 confirmed and a good initial 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.379
 screensaver in which two men mutuzat 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.960
 each other and for some reason often 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.809
 splash screen bloody squirting 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.439
 getting into the menu we as we can see 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.900
 menu let's go for a walk on it 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.840
 settings and besides the obvious tabs 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.390
 type of volume settings and profile reset 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.759
 there is a rather interesting tab in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.189
 first this is an online store where you can 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.040
 exchange your real money for 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.770
 game currency in the second is the settings 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.170
 controls either you and los fingers on 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.170
 screen or control your boxer 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.240
 waving his own hands and beating 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.700
 air since i'm too lazy to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.369
 get out of the chair and check the motion 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.320
 management about him can not say much 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.990
 but they say that often this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.479
 useless piece of meat on the screen is not 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.759
 accurately copies your professional 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.509
 boxing movements second kind 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.030
 of management 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.369
 This svaypy and pokes on the screen here 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.829
 find fault like no bee blocks 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.990
 Dodge and different types of people as no shock 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.930
 difficult to learn learn easy 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.770
 you just have to get a hand and a couple 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.900
 physiognomy so well that we still have 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.390
 gym 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.460
 a hundred times five rounds you can pump 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.980
 different skills of your boxer 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.530
 it was quite unexpected for me 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.080
 but extremely pleasant discovery always 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.270
 loved rpb items sorry five times 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.230
 rounds cannot be fought with swords or 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.230
 kill the dragon 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.360
 That would be real boxing though 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.640
 maybe I have some kind of distorted 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.250
 boxing performance 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.990
 the game is generally amazingly multifaceted 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.300
 for example if you are a little girl 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.190
 who likes to comb pony and 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.550
 dress up the dolls next to the gym 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.440
 the hall is a dressing room here 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.110
 wear colorful underpants and 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.840
 repaint gloves and even do 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.690
 tattoos but some very thieves 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.150
 cowards and tattoos cost the money I wanted 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.430
 say something sarcastic but remembered 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.370
 that in real life cowards are 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.790
 real money ok let's assume that 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.070
 panties suit us it's time to fight mode 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.260
 the battlefield doesnâ€™t have a revolution you 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.120
 here we have single battles where you can 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.250
 choose an opponent with weaker 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.470
 characteristics and hang it lyuley 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.810
 there is a career mode which is presented 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.090
 three championships at the end of each 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.850
 which you get the belt and open 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.950
 the next step is what I personally 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.920
 I consider the main fighting games 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.900
 This multiplayer Well, who would play in mortal 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.310
 kombat if it were impossible 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.370
 hack to death 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.920
 yes no one so that multiplayer taxis 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.230
 maybe if I understood boxing 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.660
 or at least in anything I had 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.709
 what to say about the combat technique or 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.260
 something else 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.330
 but since I only know how to sit for 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.510
 monitor add to the above 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.700
 I have nothing to honestly tried to find in the game 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.160
 disadvantages because always dirty 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.950
 nicer but not found the only one 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.320
 a disadvantage for me is the genre itself like me 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.620
 already said i don't like no boxing 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.220
 fighting games but this is purely subjective 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.320
 opinion 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.750
 today it's all subscribe 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.780
