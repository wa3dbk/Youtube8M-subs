00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.460 
keep it on there for about 20 minutes or
so<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.820> then<00:05:33.880> rinse<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.510> away<00:05:34.630> with<00:05:34.930> warm

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
so and then rinse it away with warm

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.560 
so and then rinse it away with warm
water<00:05:35.740> I<00:05:36.130> think<00:05:36.520> it's<00:05:36.640> a<00:05:36.700> great<00:05:36.880> mask<00:05:37.270> if

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
water I think it's a great mask if

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.330 
water I think it's a great mask if
you're<00:05:37.750> going<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.530> use<00:05:38.680> it<00:05:38.830> right<00:05:38.950> before<00:05:39.130> a

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
you're going to use it right before a

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.920 
you're going to use it right before a
big<00:05:39.400> event<00:05:39.640> because<00:05:40.180> it'll<00:05:40.360> keep<00:05:40.480> your<00:05:40.660> pores

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
big event because it'll keep your pores

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.070 
big event because it'll keep your pores
closed<00:05:41.440> or<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:41.860> lot<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.520> smaller<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.240> therefore

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
closed or a lot of smaller and therefore

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.659 
closed or a lot of smaller and therefore
you're<00:05:44.500> not<00:05:44.530> going<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.830> see<00:05:44.950> as<00:05:45.040> much<00:05:45.220> of<00:05:45.400> you

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
you're not going to see as much of you

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.909 
you're not going to see as much of you
know<00:05:45.700> an<00:05:45.880> oil<00:05:46.180> slick<00:05:46.419> across<00:05:46.870> your<00:05:47.050> face<00:05:47.200> okay

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
know an oil slick across your face okay

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.260 
know an oil slick across your face okay
so<00:05:47.979> remember<00:05:48.250> I<00:05:48.490> talked<00:05:48.760> about<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:49.000> yolk

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
so remember I talked about the yolk

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.360 
so remember I talked about the yolk
that's<00:05:49.540> in<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:49.810> other<00:05:50.080> bowl<00:05:50.320> right<00:05:50.560> there<00:05:50.800> so

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
that's in the other bowl right there so

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.550 
that's in the other bowl right there so
that<00:05:51.550> is<00:05:51.729> another<00:05:52.120> great<00:05:52.630> mess<00:05:52.870> that<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.380> can

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
that is another great mess that you can

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.950 
that is another great mess that you can
do<00:05:53.650> so<00:05:53.890> you<00:05:53.979> like<00:05:54.250> to<00:05:54.669> in<00:05:54.970> one<00:05:55.240> egg<00:05:55.419> that's<00:05:55.630> like

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
do so you like to in one egg that's like

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.260 
do so you like to in one egg that's like
such<00:05:56.169> a<00:05:56.229> good<00:05:56.500> deal<00:05:56.740> so<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.460> yolk<00:05:57.669> is<00:05:57.850> really

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
such a good deal so the yolk is really

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.520 
such a good deal so the yolk is really
really<00:05:58.419> high<00:05:58.660> in<00:05:58.810> protein<00:05:59.229> and<00:05:59.260> that

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
really high in protein and that

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.650 
really high in protein and that
contributes<00:06:00.250> a<00:06:00.400> ton<00:06:00.669> of<00:06:00.700> great<00:06:01.030> things<00:06:01.330> to

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660
