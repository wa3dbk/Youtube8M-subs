 let's see the color in this collection 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.610
 Africa of national geographic we can 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.420
 define as a greenish coffee or a coffee 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.970
 rust is a color that is visible to the eye 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.729
 pretty pretty good here we are 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.839
 seeing one of its sides of height has 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.839
 20 centimeters 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.150
 here we are seeing it from the part 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.200
 later the width of this backpack is 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.110
 17 centimeters 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.660
 the bottom of this backpack is 17 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.060
 centimeters also access to this 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.010
 backpack we get it releasing two 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.130
 belts that are in the part of 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.560
 in front of releasing them we have 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.950
 access as we can see this is the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 engraving of the African collection of 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.170
 national geographic 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.330
 once the two belts are released 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.000
 we can see that there are two 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.320
 closes one of them will give us access 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.320
 to a small bag 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.729
 in which we will store accessories 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.220
 has space for pens some card 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.350
 of memory or what we need to store 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.119
 here 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.369
 the other closure will give us access to 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.130
 main space where we will save 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.939
 our photographic equipment let's see with 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.970
 movement 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.299
 we just run and here we are 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.790
 seeing the inside of our backpack is 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.000
 high enough to load with few 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.460
 things our camera and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.770
 some costumes because not only do you have to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.680
 remove the protections and we give ourselves a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.229
 approximate idea of ​​the size of space 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.150
 with which this backpack counts as 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.720
 we always want to give you an idea of ​​the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.709
 capacity of this backpack again the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.800
 40 d camera with a 17 85 lens 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:27.730
 millimeters and a flash 430 x 2 ghana 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.230
 let's keep it and see how ready it has 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.750
 saved the equipment that we saw 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.790
 I want to show you how it was 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.340
 we see that without problem our 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.310
 body and our flash I will remove the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.630
 camera 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.910
 and that's how we can see I do not go inside 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.090
 extended I had it this way 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.790
 double since I do not fully occupy 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.940
 extended is important to indicate that 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.209
 I just think that if we have a 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.209
 Larger flash like the 580 would not fit 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.410
 we can appreciate this backpack has 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.950
 a strap to wear on your shoulder or a 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.050
 handle to carry it in the hand 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.209
