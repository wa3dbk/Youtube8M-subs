00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.760
 a lot of where to learn a lot of thanks to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.760

 the program that I liked the most and 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.380
 will visit to the area the one that most 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 intimidates and as it imposes on me it is eduardo 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.020
 videgaray then it truly was 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.380
 as a challenge for me to go to the things that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.380
 speaks 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.500
 with a lot of pressure if you listen to the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.019
 competition but I'm enjoying it 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.350
 more than is something that never had 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.500
 lived I think it has forced me to know 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.780
 my virtues and my defects 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.420
 really what I can do and to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.430
 the best what are some faults that 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.650
 detected on the page 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.109
 the product that will take me the most 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.019
 experience no matter what happens are the 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.670
 friendships and people so interesting that 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.579
 I have met on the road not of course 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.370
 that tanja is already two women apart 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.889
 of gorgeous indies and more super 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.989
 talented people is definitely required 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.639
 of many pants to be in this 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.159
 medium and to do what we do for 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.439
 to be there to the slope always up 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.060
 ready for what is coming I take two 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.000
 great friends I think that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.290
 it's difficult in the situation where we 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.900
 we found a friendship 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.219
 in competition I appreciate them very much we are 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.560
 living a truth process that 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.540
 quite difficult as everything and against 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.189
 everyone here we are and we are 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.170
 clinging to this contest that so far 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.170
