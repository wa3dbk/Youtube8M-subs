00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
economic scorecards have come in about

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.920 
economic scorecards have come in about
what<00:00:23.020> games<00:00:23.320> do<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:23.920> do<00:00:23.980> not<00:00:24.090> make<00:00:25.090> money<00:00:25.779> in

which which are the best to be doing
honestly<00:00:28.000> it's<00:00:28.930> so<00:00:29.230> hard<00:00:29.470> to<00:00:29.500> predict<00:00:29.919> I<00:00:30.040> mean

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
honestly it's so hard to predict I mean

honestly it's so hard to predict I mean
no<00:00:30.310> one<00:00:30.340> would<00:00:30.520> predicts<00:00:30.939> that<00:00:31.090> that<00:00:32.079> the

IP<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.370> moving<00:01:03.670> into<00:01:03.820> this<00:01:04.059> next<00:01:04.839> phase<00:01:05.080> this

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
IP and moving into this next phase this

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.470 
IP and moving into this next phase this
next<00:01:05.770> generation<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.310> consoles<00:01:06.640> we're<00:01:07.210> having

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
next generation of consoles we're having

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.850 
next generation of consoles we're having
to<00:01:07.570> think<00:01:07.750> outside<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:08.020> box<00:01:08.260> we're<00:01:08.470> having<00:01:08.740> to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
to think outside the box we're having to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.010 
to think outside the box we're having to
look<00:01:09.010> at<00:01:09.190> how<00:01:09.340> we<00:01:09.400> set<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.300> foundation<00:01:10.510> of<00:01:10.930> a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
look at how we set the foundation of a

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.840 
look at how we set the foundation of a
structure<00:01:11.380> for<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.590> next<00:01:11.830> ten<00:01:12.010> years<00:01:12.040> it's

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
structure for the next ten years it's

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.850 
structure for the next ten years it's
it's<00:01:13.090> funny<00:01:13.270> because<00:01:13.450> every<00:01:13.840> few<00:01:14.140> years<00:01:14.409> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
it's funny because every few years the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.230 
it's funny because every few years the
industry<00:01:15.220> really<00:01:15.400> kind<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.670> reinvents<00:01:16.150> itself

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
industry really kind of reinvents itself

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.960 
industry really kind of reinvents itself
whether<00:01:17.110> that's<00:01:17.439> we<00:01:18.189> figure<00:01:18.579> out<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.729> new<00:01:18.939> way

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
whether that's we figure out a new way

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.200 
whether that's we figure out a new way
to<00:01:19.799> give<00:01:20.799> that<00:01:20.950> experience<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.490> players<00:01:21.729> or

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
to give that experience to players or

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.580 
to give that experience to players or
there's<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.509> new<00:01:22.630> piece<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:22.840> hardware<00:01:22.960> out

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
there's a new piece of hardware out

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.889 
there's a new piece of hardware out
there<00:01:23.829> some<00:01:24.189> new<00:01:24.369> technology<00:01:24.759> some<00:01:25.720> new

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
there some new technology some new

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.630 
there some new technology some new
interface<00:01:26.439> there's<00:01:27.070> always<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.460> new
