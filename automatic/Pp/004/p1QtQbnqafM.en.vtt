stability of both hands on the racket

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.060 
stability of both hands on the racket
but<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.119> relaxation<00:01:42.780> component<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> end

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
but that relaxation component at the end

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.490 
but that relaxation component at the end
so<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.060> want<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.689> ahead<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.110> try<00:01:46.470> that
