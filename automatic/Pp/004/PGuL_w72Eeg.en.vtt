in handy he's not a bad place it's a
little<00:00:55.020> bit<00:00:55.110> small<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.530> centre-back<00:00:55.920> but

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
little bit small for a centre-back but

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.920 
little bit small for a centre-back but
now<00:00:56.190> he's<00:00:56.520> decent<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.270> that's<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> team

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930

how<00:02:58.769> long<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.070> actually<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.489> keep<00:02:59.850> that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
how long we can actually I keep that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.330 
how long we can actually I keep that
going<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.440> I'm<00:03:01.500> surprised<00:03:01.920> because<00:03:02.100> he

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
going for and I'm surprised because he

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.710 
going for and I'm surprised because he
had<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> solid<00:03:02.730> team<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.180> he<00:03:03.239> was<00:03:03.360> just<00:03:03.390> pacing

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
had a solid team but he was just pacing

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.509 
had a solid team but he was just pacing
it<00:03:03.959> down<00:03:04.079> alive<00:03:04.290> anyway<00:03:04.650> what<00:03:05.130> does<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.340> mean

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
it down alive anyway what does that mean

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.640 
it down alive anyway what does that mean
one<00:03:06.000> pack<00:03:06.239> let's<00:03:06.570> go<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.780> open<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.470> let's

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
one pack let's go and open it so let's

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.229 
one pack let's go and open it so let's
open<00:03:07.829> up<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.370> pack<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.910> win<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.090> I

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
open up that pack for the win and I

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.610 
open up that pack for the win and I
wonder<00:03:09.510> how<00:03:09.630> long<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:10.049> actually<00:03:10.320> keep<00:03:10.470> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
wonder how long can actually keep the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.960 
wonder how long can actually keep the
street<00:03:10.829> going<00:03:10.950> without<00:03:11.130> losing<00:03:11.610> because<00:03:11.790> we

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
street going without losing because we

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.520 
street going without losing because we
we<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.510> trace<00:03:12.750> out<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.900> team's<00:03:13.140> quite<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> bit

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
we do trace out the team's quite a bit

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.810 
we do trace out the team's quite a bit
but<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.829> first<00:03:14.010> back<00:03:14.130> yet<00:03:14.370> Philipp<00:03:14.670> Lahm

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
but in the first back yet Philipp Lahm

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.759 
but in the first back yet Philipp Lahm
that's<00:03:15.180> pretty<00:03:15.420> nice<00:03:15.630> actually<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:16.380> can<00:03:16.560> bring
