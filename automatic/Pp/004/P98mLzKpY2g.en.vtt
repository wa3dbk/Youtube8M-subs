it's<00:00:55.920> pretty<00:00:56.129> dark<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.760> did<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> review<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.420> this

it's pretty dark I did a review on this
as<00:00:57.870> well<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.280> more<00:00:59.730> fond<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.239> this

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
as well but I'm more fond of this

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.039 
as well but I'm more fond of this
because<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> softer<00:01:01.680> look<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.789> does

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
because it's a softer look and it does

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
because it's a softer look and it does
give<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> springy<00:01:04.769> feel<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
give more of a springy feel to it and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.990 
give more of a springy feel to it and
it's<00:01:06.150> summertime<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> try<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.250> overdo
