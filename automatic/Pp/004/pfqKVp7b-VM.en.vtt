sweet<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> Cleveland<00:01:23.460> Cavaliers<00:01:23.670> they<00:01:24.240> have

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
sweet a Cleveland Cavaliers they have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.500 
sweet a Cleveland Cavaliers they have
LeBron<00:01:25.830> James<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.340> course<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> Kyrie<00:01:27.090> Irving

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
LeBron James of course and Kyrie Irving

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.390 
LeBron James of course and Kyrie Irving
I<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.810> Kyrie<00:01:27.990> Irving<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.620> playing<00:01:28.890> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I think Kyrie Irving will be playing it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.610 
I think Kyrie Irving will be playing it
looks<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.730> he<00:01:29.850> won't<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.120> sitting<00:01:30.330> out<00:01:30.620> you

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
looks like he won't be sitting out you

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.020 
looks like he won't be sitting out you
know<00:01:31.740> sitting<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.790> looks<00:01:32.880> like

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
know sitting out at all it looks like

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.310 
know sitting out at all it looks like
he'll<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.330> playing<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> rest<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
he'll be playing for the rest of the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.030 
he'll be playing for the rest of the
playoff<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:37.260> need<00:01:37.440> Kyrie<00:01:37.770> Irving

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
playoff and they need Kyrie Irving

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.500 
playoff and they need Kyrie Irving
because<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.430> he<00:01:38.580> doesn't<00:01:39.150> play<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
because if he doesn't play for the

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.720 
because if he doesn't play for the
series<00:01:39.870> so<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.140> i<00:01:40.230> I'd<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:41.040> straight<00:01:41.310> ahead<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
series so I i I'd go straight ahead and

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.700 
series so I i I'd go straight ahead and
choose<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.090> Atlanta<00:01:42.390> Hawks<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.470> I'm

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
choose the Atlanta Hawks right now I'm

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
choose the Atlanta Hawks right now I'm
thinking<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.340> 5050<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.300> think<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.720> fight

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
thinking like 5050 I think this fight

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.070 
thinking like 5050 I think this fight
this<00:01:46.170> game<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.250> series<00:01:47.490> will<00:01:48.300> most<00:01:48.660> likely<00:01:48.870> go

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
this game the series will most likely go

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.460 
this game the series will most likely go
the<00:01:49.140> distance<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.190> go<00:01:50.750> seven<00:01:51.750> seven

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the distance it will go seven seven

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.610 
the distance it will go seven seven
games<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.150> six<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.690> it's<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:54.990> six<00:01:55.260> game

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
the Hawks man I mean they don't really

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.780 
the Hawks man I mean they don't really
have<00:02:04.380> any<00:02:04.530> superstars<00:02:05.010> but<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.520> play<00:02:05.760> very

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
beat the cleveland cavaliers i think

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.160 
beat the cleveland cavaliers i think
they<00:02:14.280> beat<00:02:14.489> them<00:02:14.670> more<00:02:14.940> times<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
they beat them more times in the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.780 
they beat them more times in the
regular-season<00:02:16.860> right<00:02:17.280> i<00:02:17.340> think<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.640> beat

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
regular-season right i think the beat

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.309 
regular-season right i think the beat
them<00:02:17.909> like<00:02:18.060> four<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.629> think<00:02:18.989> three<00:02:19.200> two

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
them like four to one I think three two

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.449 
them like four to one I think three two
one<00:02:19.499> or<00:02:19.650> something<00:02:19.859> like<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.219> don't
