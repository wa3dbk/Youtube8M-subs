settings and just going to make them
exactly<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.579> 100<00:00:39.120> frames<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.809> i'm<00:00:40.110> going

exactly to 100 frames because i'm going
to<00:00:40.320> pre<00:00:40.469> compose<00:00:40.770> them<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.540> select<00:00:42.719> all

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to pre compose them now just select all

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.139 
see that white line it's just very
annoying<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.130> we're<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> set<00:02:02.909> this

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
annoying so we're just going to set this

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.110 
annoying so we're just going to set this
brightness<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> negative<00:02:04.219> 35

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
brightness to a negative 35

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.300 
brightness to a negative 35
you<00:02:07.050> can<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.560> white<00:02:07.740> lines<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.100> getting

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you can see the white lines are getting

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.760 
you can see the white lines are getting
away<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:09.720> don't<00:02:09.840> want<00:02:09.960> to<00:02:10.050> set<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.290> contrast

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
away you don't want to set the contrast

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.610 
away you don't want to set the contrast
too<00:02:10.979> low<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.480> it'll<00:02:12.480> eat<00:02:13.020> at<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.380> power

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
too low because it'll eat at the power

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.000 
too low because it'll eat at the power
lines<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:15.200> we'll<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.350> bring<00:02:16.470> them<00:02:16.650> back<00:02:16.770> in

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
lines so we'll just bring them back in

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.230 
lines so we'll just bring them back in
just<00:02:17.370> set<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.000> negative<00:02:18.330> 50<00:02:18.800> and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
just set that out of the negative 50 and

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.550 
just set that out of the negative 50 and
you<00:02:21.240> just<00:02:21.540> want<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.810> keep<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.110> changing<00:02:22.380> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you just want to keep on changing the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.490 
you just want to keep on changing the
values<00:02:23.010> as<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:24.300> keep<00:02:24.510> adding<00:02:24.690> effects<00:02:25.140> and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
values as you keep adding effects and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.160 
values as you keep adding effects and
what<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.790> know<00:02:26.940> try<00:02:27.570> keep<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.900> on

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
what not to you know try keep that on

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.080 
what not to you know try keep that on
the<00:02:28.200> control<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.970> decided<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.640> put<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.850> in

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the control so I decided to put that in

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.840 
the control so I decided to put that in
this<00:02:33.300> part<00:02:33.630> because<00:02:34.250> for<00:02:35.250> me<00:02:35.370> was<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.580> very

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
this part because for me was a very

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.200 
this part because for me was a very
important<00:02:36.390> element<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:38.570> this<00:02:39.570> tutorial

a trapcode plugin you can do anything
with<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.590> background<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:58.980> can<00:02:59.100> put<00:02:59.280> your<00:02:59.370> own

there with the after effects settings
you<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.330> see<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> masking<00:03:10.530> still

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
you can see here the masking still

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.070 
you can see here the masking still
needed<00:03:11.760> some<00:03:11.970> help<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.270> what<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.690> can<00:03:12.840> do<00:03:12.959> is

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
needed some help so what you can do is

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.870 
needed some help so what you can do is
just<00:03:13.110> double-click<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.950> pre<00:03:14.220> composition

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
just double-click the pre composition

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.300 
just double-click the pre composition
that<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:15.180> made<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.680> that'll<00:03:16.680> open<00:03:16.830> up<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that we made and that'll open up the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.060 
that we made and that'll open up the
original<00:03:17.700> clips<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.180> we<00:03:18.330> had<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:19.709> we<00:03:19.860> had

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
original clips that we had that we had

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.530 
original clips that we had that we had
worked<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.459> first<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.390> guess

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
worked on first so this is I guess

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.560 
worked on first so this is I guess
called<00:03:24.930> nesting<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.620> after<00:03:26.220> effects<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:27.330> just

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
called nesting and after effects it just

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.260 
called nesting and after effects it just
increases<00:03:27.810> your<00:03:28.170> productivity<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:29.270> your

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
increases your productivity and your

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.800 
increases your productivity and your
work<00:03:30.450> time<00:03:32.150> makes<00:03:33.150> things<00:03:33.300> go<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.840> lot<00:03:34.080> faster

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.070 

so<00:03:37.620> here<00:03:38.310> I'll<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.640> fix<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.180> couple<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.840> points

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
so here I'll just fix a couple of points

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.860 
so here I'll just fix a couple of points
with<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> masking<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.390> just<00:03:42.390> until<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.660> feel

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
with the masking and just until you feel

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.660 
with the masking and just until you feel
comfortable<00:03:42.900> with<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:44.160> can<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.310> switch

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
comfortable with it you can just switch

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.970 
comfortable with it you can just switch
back<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.270> forth<00:03:45.630> through<00:03:46.170> different

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
back and forth through different

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.339 
back and forth through different
compositions<00:03:47.580> but<00:03:47.849> I<00:03:48.209> also<00:03:48.810> wanted<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> show

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
compositions but I also wanted to show

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.100 
compositions but I also wanted to show
that<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:53.330> guess<00:03:54.330> that's<00:03:54.569> it<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:54.870> this

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
that and I guess that's it for this

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.640 
that and I guess that's it for this
tutorial<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:56.700> hope<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.720> guys<00:03:57.900> enjoyed<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.470> I

tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it I
hope<00:03:59.400> it's<00:03:59.790> useful<00:04:00.110> once<00:04:01.110> again<00:04:01.380> I'll<00:04:01.500> say

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
hope it's useful once again I'll say

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.150 
hope it's useful once again I'll say
this<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.190> just<00:04:02.430> for<00:04:02.580> console<00:04:03.650> game<00:04:04.650> play<00:04:06.590> on<00:04:07.590> PC

this is just for console game play on PC
it's<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:09.120> lot<00:04:09.900> easier<00:04:10.110> but<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.769> guess<00:04:11.010> this

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
it's just a lot easier but I guess this

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.410
