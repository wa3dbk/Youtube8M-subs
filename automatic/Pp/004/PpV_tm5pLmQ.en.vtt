00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.290
 to aristÃ³teles the art of the body is 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.119
 understands what the soul feels 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.670
 manifests in some way in the body 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.130
 also considered the soul as 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.110
 movement generator so if 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.110
 something has movement also has something 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.340
 Saint Augustine considered that man is 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.280
 tricked with respect to your system 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.050
 thanks to this doubt later he could 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.540
 confirm its existence 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.070
 I read that when he hesitated he thinks and when 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.710
 I think there is 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.129
 then when there were no more doubts you could 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.600
 know yourself and therefore to march 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.370
 This love can not be fooled 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.850
 considered as the existence of god 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.850
 in man 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.440
 saint tomÃ¡s affirmed that the sacks 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.020
 volunteers are only in being 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.210
 human these voluntary acts are based 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.310
 in the use of reason the cause for the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.360
 what is done and the consequences that 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.360
 this action will generate 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.820
 discarded started home of all affirms 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.100
 that the senses deceive us and that's why 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.140
 leave aside all that is corporeal 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.140
 everything you are used to know 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.159
 thanks to the act of doubting to think the 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.109
 ability to learn things by 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.299
 means of discarding intellect 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.770
 confirm its existence by defining itself 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.770
 itself as something thinking 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.680
 to confirm the existence of them 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.600
 Discards is based on the following 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.820
 destruction cause this one 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.130
 consider the effect of some cause something 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.010
 bigger and perfect that its cause is 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.470
 god origin of the concepts terms 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.720
 as an omnipotent timeless infinity 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.690
 they have to have an origin that origin is 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.580
 god last and the out god not 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.740
 I would need to doubt about what 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.840
 they exist but as it is not like that, you discard 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.560
 affirms that there is a being superior to him is 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.560
 of beings god 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.190
 while looking for the cause of their mistakes 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.930
 I'll leave aside goodbye because 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.849
 who is a benevolent being and then 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.640
 discover that the will of similarity 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.230
 that we have with God and also discover 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.300
 that is being bigger than your 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.120
 intellect the responsible one who commits 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.250
 mistakes those errors are when you 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.610
 judge something or make a decision be good 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.610
 human
