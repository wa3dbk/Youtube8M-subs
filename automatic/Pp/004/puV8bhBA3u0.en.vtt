so we'll just click on Tom online go to
this<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> recording

about<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.549> recording<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.810> know

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
about this recording so that we know

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
about this recording so that we know
what<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:58.799> the<00:02:01.729> idea<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
what it was all about the idea of that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.690 
what it was all about the idea of that
is<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.350> find<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.040> easier<00:02:05.460> with

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
is so that we can find it easier with

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.520 
is so that we can find it easier with
the<00:02:05.820> search<00:02:06.090> later<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.229> that's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the search later so there you go that's

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.050 
the search later so there you go that's
how<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.760> bit<00:02:12.000> done<00:02:12.209> now

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
how is you can get that bit done now

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.190 
how is you can get that bit done now
we<00:02:13.120> might<00:02:13.300> want<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> do<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.810> might<00:02:13.959> want<00:02:14.140> to
