00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.600
 i 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.060
 hello talks to you broncos welcome to me 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.700
 channel as you can see 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.130
 I finally got the plane who me 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.190
 allowed because before I could not 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.520
 allowed to visualize the modifications 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.380
 what he did to the plane because before 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.410
 only the signal modification but 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.930
 when I told the game that the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.850
 will update because I would not let you and this one 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.970
 I finally gave it up and my biggest surprise was 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.310
 that I could go to battle with the 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.050
 plane as modified I put him 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.870
 simply the flag of my country one in 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.270
 each gala and the squad logo with the 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.110
 squad name to one of the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.710
 sides on each side 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.730
 my idea of personalization is to give you 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.340
 an own identity to an airplane that is 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.780
 What I do when I fly an airplane 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.970
 I want to feel identified as if 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.140
 I want to see my country I want to see me picture 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.300
 I do not want to see any amount of 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.160
 things that whoever I want on the plane not 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.570
 be and especially because you are 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.440
 customizations I'm just going to 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.610
 see me and not only am I going to see it 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.350
 I'm just going to see it even in my 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 plane if there is another plane that is equal 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.180
 I do not sometimes go personalization 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.090
 in the other common aircraft 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.310
 This is the hat but is 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.260
 simply the customization that goes to 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.780
 leave only in my obvious and it's my 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.390
 taste and my preference with that not 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.050
 annoying nobody leaves only in my 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.300
 I only see video because a lot 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.770
 people this is criticizing that but 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.950
 good is good 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.849
 especially now here when I get into 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.180
 the cockpit of the plane and I look at the sides 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.180
 videos 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.050
 also for example the identity of my 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.700
 country with all the problems that is 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.730
 happening now it moves me 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.640
 I do not put him him 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.709
 what airplanes normally have 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.659
 the Venezuelan air force because with 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.000
 so many political problems that there are not 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.860
 wants to involve armed force in 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.200
 this simply place the flag my 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.810
 country by its own identification with the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.780
 country but and in my picture nothing else nothing 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.310
 I want to involve no air force 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.870
 or anything like that there is no way 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.879
 understood that as you put on an airplane 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.319
 German the symbol of the flag in my 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.340
 plane that I am playing at this moment 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.450
 without making any kind of illusions 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.590
 policies 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.010
 here some a few passes to the favor 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.549
 pillerÃ­a de paz I crash to hallucinate 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.549
 but 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.269
 I quite like this of the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.909
 personalization can not imagine if this is 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.650
 practically a differential of the 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.829
 tanks that placed a texture and he 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.150
 the subject of personalization placed the 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.709
 that I was where he wins not here you can 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.360
 put everything where you want 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.510
 want to imagine is the possibility are 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.819
 infinite the amount of textures of 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.680
 things we can do on the plane are 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.340
 infinite or 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.689
 this is amazing what can be done 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.549
 with the planes arrived I imagine there will be 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.730
 graphic designers people whatever 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.500
 people with a lot of originality will make 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.010
 textures and a personalization is 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.010
 amazing 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.990
 I will try in the future to happen 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.200
 some ideas and I will place them of my 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.200
 planes 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.670
 and I'll put my videos to see how 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.319
 But is that 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.359
 I can not imagine the 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.790
 there are so original people out there in 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.329
 internet that we will see many things 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.329
 funny 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.360
 the way the images are of 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.360
 images of 1024 x 1024 occupy 16 mb 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.520
 each image 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.520
 they are long gea images 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.309
 I must emphasize that I 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.529
 I used an editor at the beginning 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:38.539
 photograph that I do not know why not when 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.089
 I recorded the photographs again on 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.600
 game they did not accept me 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:44.940
 I do not know why 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.070
 but it makes them perfect when 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.120
 I recorded with photoshop have to learn to 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.610
 use photoshop 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.330
 too complicated but good if that 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.509
 is the one that will be used 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.509
 and 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.570
 each plane has its different kind of 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.970
 customization in this case this plane 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.680
 has three customizations have what 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.120
 which is the structure as such of the plane 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.700
 which was the one I used to place 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.760
 this also has a template that 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.900
 equal to it but as a kind 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.360
 olive green and with one with a few 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.070
 reliefs and other areas those areas that 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.150
 they are like pieces so it seems that 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.510
 were loose that's also why 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.290
 separated 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.810
 Well I hope you have been useful 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.260
 video 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.680
 it's here when I crash we see it in 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.129
 the heavens and in the land of wharton 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.759
 there 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.759
 and later 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.040
 i 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.909
 fifth
