00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
are big that sebum gets clogged in there

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.600 
are big that sebum gets clogged in there
and<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.360> as<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:55.590> sebum<00:02:55.920> builds<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.460> makes

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
and then as the sebum builds up it makes

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.120 
and then as the sebum builds up it makes
a<00:02:56.760> Whitehead<00:02:57.120> right<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:58.470> if<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.920> have

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130

a Whitehead right and so if you have
large<00:02:59.490> pores<00:02:59.820> you<00:03:00.810> often<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.650> clogged<00:03:02.160> pores

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
large pores you often have clogged pores

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.120 
large pores you often have clogged pores
that's<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:03.870> genetic<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.470> that's<00:03:04.650> that's<00:03:04.890> why

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
that's just genetic so that's that's why

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.690 
that's just genetic so that's that's why
my<00:03:05.310> face<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:06.120> know<00:03:06.240> has<00:03:06.960> acne<00:03:07.430> now<00:03:08.430> what

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
my face is you know has acne now what

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.000 
my face is you know has acne now what
accutane<00:03:09.150> does<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.900> because<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.620> drying

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
accutane does is because it's drying

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.320 
accutane does is because it's drying
your<00:03:11.220> body<00:03:11.430> out<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:12.180> actually<00:03:14.330> decreasing

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
your body out it's actually decreasing

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.040 
your body out it's actually decreasing
the<00:03:15.480> size<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:16.170> those<00:03:16.740> pores<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.030> decrease<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
the size of those pores and decrease the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.870 
the size of those pores and decrease the
amount<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.350> sebum<00:03:19.770> that<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.040> be<00:03:20.160> produced<00:03:20.550> and

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
amount of sebum that can be produced and

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.490 
amount of sebum that can be produced and
that<00:03:21.420> happens<00:03:21.810> because<00:03:21.990> your<00:03:22.230> body<00:03:22.410> is

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
that happens because your body is

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.199 
that happens because your body is
getting<00:03:22.740> so<00:03:23.010> dried<00:03:23.280> out<00:03:23.430> from<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.700> vitamin<00:03:23.940> A

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
getting so dried out from the vitamin A

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.400 
getting so dried out from the vitamin A
now<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:25.350> problem<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.070> drying<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.850> that

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
now a problem with of drying out is that

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.720 
now a problem with of drying out is that
especially<00:03:28.410> for<00:03:28.740> bodybuilders<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.640> it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
especially for bodybuilders is that it

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.640 
especially for bodybuilders is that it
dries<00:03:29.970> out<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.540> synovial<00:03:31.080> fluid<00:03:31.110> in<00:03:31.620> your

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.550 
you know just even like a normal red
head<00:04:39.639> or<00:04:39.850> white<00:04:40.450> head<00:04:40.630> whenever<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:41.050> touch<00:04:41.320> it

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
head or white head whenever you touch it

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.710 
head or white head whenever you touch it
it<00:04:42.310> hurts<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.700> lot<00:04:42.820> more<00:04:43.030> like<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.270> or<00:04:43.510> if<00:04:43.630> you

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
it hurts a lot more like it or if you

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.000 
it hurts a lot more like it or if you
try<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:43.960> like<00:04:44.110> pick<00:04:44.320> out<00:04:44.470> or<00:04:44.590> something

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
try to like pick out or something

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.820 
try to like pick out or something
brushes<00:04:45.340> against<00:04:45.730> it<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.270> really<00:04:46.930> hurts

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
brushes against it it really hurts

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.440 
brushes against it it really hurts
so<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.430> guess<00:04:48.669> it<00:04:48.820> just<00:04:49.000> makes<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.300> more

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
so I guess it just makes you more

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.300 
so I guess it just makes you more
sensitive<00:04:49.630> which<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.290> also<00:04:50.590> not<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.070> big

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
sensitive which is also not a big

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.850 
sensitive which is also not a big
problem<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.330> me<00:04:52.450> as<00:04:52.630> far<00:04:53.050> as<00:04:53.110> my<00:04:53.290> dosing<00:04:53.710> goes

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
problem to me as far as my dosing goes

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.159 
problem to me as far as my dosing goes
I'll<00:04:54.100> be<00:04:54.220> taking<00:04:54.550> 40<00:04:55.030> milligrams<00:04:55.600> for<00:04:56.050> the

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
I'll be taking 40 milligrams for the

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.770 
I'll be taking 40 milligrams for the
next<00:04:56.620> two<00:04:57.460> months<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:57.910> believe<00:04:58.180> then<00:04:58.390> I<00:04:58.450> go<00:04:58.600> in

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
next two months I believe then I go in

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.780 
next two months I believe then I go in

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
and they reassess and they decide

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.460 
and they reassess and they decide
