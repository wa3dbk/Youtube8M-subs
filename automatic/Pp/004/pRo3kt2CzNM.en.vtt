00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
game I can't do this by myself this is a

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.749

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
community effort and a big effort on

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.580 
community effort and a big effort on
jagex<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.330> try<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> follow<00:00:12.780> through<00:00:13.080> it's<00:00:13.500> a

jagex to try to follow through it's a
lot<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.889> pressure<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.219> their<00:00:14.460> shoulders<00:00:14.849> so

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
lot of pressure on their shoulders so

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.640 
lot of pressure on their shoulders so
you<00:00:15.120> have<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.540> give<00:00:15.660> them<00:00:15.690> some<00:00:15.990> time<00:00:16.170> even<00:00:16.560> if

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
you think a year's enough time it's not

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.630 
you think a year's enough time it's not
the<00:00:18.840> amount<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.140> man<00:00:19.800> hours<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.310> labor<00:00:20.490> it

so when we can't free trade when we

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.949 
so when we can't free trade when we
can't<00:02:41.069> PK<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.640> way<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.060> used<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.569> we<00:02:42.629> can't

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
can't PK the way we used to and we can't

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
stake party hats we want it the most so

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.210 
stake party hats we want it the most so
of<00:02:45.390> course<00:02:45.599> we<00:02:45.900> rioted<00:02:46.319> for<00:02:46.560> three<00:02:46.739> years<00:02:46.980> but

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
of course we rioted for three years but

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.680 
of course we rioted for three years but
we<00:02:47.310> didn't<00:02:47.549> really<00:02:47.730> realize<00:02:48.090> what<00:02:48.480> was<00:02:48.599> going

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
we didn't really realize what was going

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.140 
we didn't really realize what was going
on<00:02:49.019> jagex<00:02:49.590> had<00:02:49.920> actually<00:02:50.370> fixed<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.819> games<00:02:51.000> I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
on jagex had actually fixed the games I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.339 
on jagex had actually fixed the games I
guess<00:02:51.329> I've<00:02:51.510> actually<00:02:51.630> made<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.019> game<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:52.290> a

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
guess I've actually made the game but a

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.600 
guess I've actually made the game but a
lot<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.620> people<00:02:52.709> are<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.130> disagree<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
lot of people are going to disagree and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.030 
lot of people are going to disagree and
argue<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.209> give<00:02:54.810> valid<00:02:55.319> points<00:02:55.709> but<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.920> have

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
argue and give valid points but you have

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.619 
argue and give valid points but you have
to<00:02:56.160> think<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.670> way<00:02:56.730> right<00:02:57.120> now<00:02:57.329> the

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
to think of it this way right now the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.960 
to think of it this way right now the
way<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.900> game<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.980> unstable<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.730> will

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
way the game is it's so unstable it will

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.030 
way the game is it's so unstable it will
not<00:03:00.150> work<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.599> cannot<00:03:00.870> continue<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.650> way<00:03:01.829> so

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040

subtle<00:03:04.379> changes<00:03:04.860> or<00:03:05.489> even<00:03:05.700> some<00:03:05.879> drastic<00:03:06.090> ones

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450

it and take some initiative and when we
start<00:03:14.819> doing<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.150> jagex<00:03:15.569> does<00:03:15.780> because<00:03:16.079> you

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
start doing that jagex does because you

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.140 
start doing that jagex does because you
saw<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:16.799> we<00:03:16.859> wanted<00:03:17.250> P<00:03:17.430> came<00:03:17.670> back<00:03:17.880> they
