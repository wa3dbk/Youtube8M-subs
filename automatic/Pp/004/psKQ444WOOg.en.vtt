here you never really want to use your
blink<00:00:46.770> offensively<00:00:47.670> unless<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.390> know<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
blink offensively unless you know that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it's going to be a guaranteed kill

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.959 
it's going to be a guaranteed kill
because<00:00:51.559> Asriel's<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.949> major<00:00:53.430> advantage

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
because Asriel's really major advantage

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
because Asriel's really major advantage
is<00:00:54.180> his<00:00:54.480> range<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.989> once<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.289> throw<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
is his range and once you throw that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
is his range and once you throw that
away<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.789> become<00:00:57.059> considerably<00:00:57.510> less

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
away you become considerably less

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.529 
away you become considerably less

that<00:01:47.520> dragon<00:01:47.970> does<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.420> take<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> down

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that dragon does not take you down

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.340 
that dragon does not take you down
because<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.899> you're<00:01:51.899> not<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> survive

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
because then you're not going to survive

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.639 
because then you're not going to survive
and<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:52.799> gonna<00:01:53.009> die<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.670> gonna<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.939> good

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
and you're gonna die not gonna be good

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.740

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
flash there was really bad so I had to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.949 
flash there was really bad so I had to
use<00:02:19.170> my<00:02:19.260> summoner<00:02:19.739> spell<00:02:19.920> flash<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:21.180> actually

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
use my summoner spell flash to actually

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.380 
use my summoner spell flash to actually
escape<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> now<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.340> want<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.030> use<00:02:24.150> your

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
escape that now you want to use your

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.750 
escape that now you want to use your
attack<00:02:25.200> speed<00:02:25.500> speed<00:02:25.860> up<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.130> cool<00:02:26.280> down<00:02:26.310> when

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
attack speed speed up and cool down when

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.100

you're<00:02:26.880> attacking<00:02:27.270> towers<00:02:27.599> with<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:27.900> team

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
you're attacking towers with your team

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.380 
you're attacking towers with your team
just<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.830> optimize<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.459> dps<00:02:29.790> get<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> tower

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
just to optimize that dps get the tower

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.430 
just to optimize that dps get the tower
down<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> bit<00:02:30.930> faster<00:02:32.330> that's<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.630> think<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.319> that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
down a bit faster that's I think of that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.500 
down a bit faster that's I think of that
ability<00:02:34.769> more<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.190> supportability<00:02:36.030> west<00:02:36.390> of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
ability more as a supportability west of

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.710 
ability more as a supportability west of
a<00:02:36.569> nuke<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.080> try<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.680> use<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.010> defensively<00:02:38.880> well

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
a nuke I try to use it defensively well

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.420 
a nuke I try to use it defensively well
not<00:02:39.870> defensively<00:02:40.290> but<00:02:40.470> more<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:40.920> support

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
not defensively but more in support

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.089 
not defensively but more in support
state<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.880> mind<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.180> my<00:02:42.300> team<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.099> here

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
state of mind with my team and here

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.640 
state of mind with my team and here
gragas<00:02:44.610> uses<00:02:45.269> he's<00:02:45.810> used<00:02:46.019> all<00:02:46.170> his<00:02:46.350> spells

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650

gragas uses he's used all his spells
already<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.160> I'm<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.489> know<00:02:47.700> he<00:02:48.030> doesn't<00:02:48.239> have

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
already so I'm I know he doesn't have

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.229 
already so I'm I know he doesn't have
anything<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.890> kill<00:02:50.100> me<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> that's

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
anything to kill me so then I that's

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.729 
anything to kill me so then I that's
when<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.600> use<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.840> offensive<00:02:52.410> blink

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
when you can use that offensive blink

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.699 
when you can use that offensive blink
and<00:02:53.569> close<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.720> distance<00:02:54.870> take<00:02:55.440> them<00:02:55.560> down

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
and close the distance take them down

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.640 
and close the distance take them down
now<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.580> actually<00:02:56.970> let<00:02:57.510> Greg<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.140> engage<00:02:58.410> me

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
our cho'gath I don't think this was the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.150 
our cho'gath I don't think this was the
smartest<00:03:27.870> move<00:03:28.049> but<00:03:28.290> he<00:03:28.350> decides<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.769> run<00:03:28.980> into

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
smartest move but he decides to run into

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.259 
smartest move but he decides to run into
the<00:03:29.250> turret<00:03:29.430> like<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> crazy<00:03:30.000> ass<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:32.040> I

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
the turret like a crazy ass and so I

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.470 
the turret like a crazy ass and so I
then<00:03:33.269> realized<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.170> an<00:03:34.290> easy<00:03:34.350> chase<00:03:34.709> down

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
then realized this is an easy chase down

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.300 
then realized this is an easy chase down

to make sure a tip for your ultimate you

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.229 
to make sure a tip for your ultimate you
want<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.289> make<00:04:16.470> sure<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:17.100> are<00:04:17.280> wait<00:04:18.060> till

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
he's in a straight away or you can kind

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.770 
he's in a straight away or you can kind

of predict where he's running so i

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.540

that
well<00:04:27.630> that's<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.930> only<00:04:28.110> way<00:04:28.200> he's<00:04:28.320> going<00:04:28.440> to

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
well that's the only way he's going to

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.220 
well that's the only way he's going to
run<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.950> it's<00:04:29.100> an<00:04:29.160> easy<00:04:29.310> shot<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:31.050> was<00:04:31.200> a
