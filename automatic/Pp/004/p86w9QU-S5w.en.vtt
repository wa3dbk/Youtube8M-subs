00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hi dear viewers on the link old ray 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.170
 and since the last video I advised 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.389
 you move from flyer to big 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.280
 cities then let's see how is it 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.170
 implement though I think even with 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.590
 moving from one big city to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.410
 other 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.310
 this video will help you seemingly change 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.230
 living place 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.150
 This is not a simple matter, but it's not that difficult. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.400
 as it seems at first glance 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.900
 many people are just afraid of change 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.939
 more if you have to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.580
 move your ass for a few 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.170
 hundreds and maybe thousands of kilometers i 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
 moving you have two great 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.270
 Option one is the easiest if you 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 you finish school soon you have good 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.469
 grades and have a desire to continue to learn 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.079
 you can safely go to college 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.270
 another city on a budget place to you 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.250
 will provide the hostel and the coming 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.309
 four years if you don't fly out 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.890
 institute the issue is resolved also your 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.289
 learning hostel and others can 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.300
 pay you parents but the second 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.730
 option slightly more complicated slightly 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.489
 risky but much more interesting 1 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.100
 option for real adventurers 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.659
 move on their own and not here 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.000
 saying that it is very scary 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.070
 risky and generally better about this even 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.130
 it is not necessary to think exactly how to think 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.990
 if you live in a flyerbat like me on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.939
 really not much needed for 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.369
 to leave and settle on 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.710
 another place first is starting 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.049
 capital it depends on which city 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.909
 are you driving if this city is peter or 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.229
 Moscow you will need something about 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.549
 40 75 thousand rubles from where to get them 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.799
 earn money sell all superfluous 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.350
 things and take money from the homeless 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.750
 they'll drink them anyway so you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.759
 need more plus now there is internet and if 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 you are not completely stupid quite plodding 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.780
 man can you learn to make websites 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.509
 or design or something else and then 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.700
 go freelance second you need 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.220
 a ticket with this is all just now have a lot 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.990
 sites with air tickets ticket offices so 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.719
 further as a last resort you can 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.939
 suffer and ride the train so will 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.770
 cheaper although almost certain that in many 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.619
 the ground of the maps is present very much 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.990
 of a series of year-old rf, then of course 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.119
 causes its inconvenience in third 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.459
 temporary residence at first 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.420
 time it may be your good old and 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.670
 not very friend 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.459
 distant relative aunt galya or 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.989
 familiar petya if there are none 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.050
 trouble the first couple of weeks you can 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.360
 it is important to stay in the hostel right after 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.819
 arrival start looking for a removable 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.709
 apartment or room depending on how much u 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.900
 you do not trust much money 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.910
 someone when looking for an apartment prepay 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.440
 it is advisable not to pay at all because 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.900
 I know many cases when 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.180
 prepay such as paid and like 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.340
 they did n’t move into the apartment or didn’t 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.470
 existed at all in general be 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.989
 careful how to stay flat 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.300
 be sure to look for work or go on 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.790
 work on the Internet if you are a freelancer 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.530
 importantly do not sit still work in 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.600
 a big city is easier to find 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.030
 I personally have to search for Malomalskaya 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.400
 vacancies left no more than half an hour 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.980
 By the way, you can move not only 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.230
 alone but with like-minded friend or 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.150
 girlfriend so you will be much easier and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.190
 much less financial 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.500
 the cost of renting an apartment 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.640
 let it be not so boring if you 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.040
 understand what I mean 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.620
 a couple more tips for last 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.239
 purchased food products and other 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.940
 better in big stores that 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.430
 are not in the city center there prices 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.920
 cheaper there are many promotional items 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.560
 too expensive purchases at first not too 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.900
 do better the first couple of months by 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.549
 save on this probably finish with 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.260
 you were old like
