samurai<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:34.590> interesting<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.039> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
samurai now what was interesting is that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.679 
samurai now what was interesting is that
people<00:01:35.579> were<00:01:35.640> saying<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.030> windup<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> lot

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
people were saying that windup is a lot

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.919 
people were saying that windup is a lot
like<00:01:36.840> six<00:01:37.079> samurai<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.670> guess<00:01:39.539> in<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.899> sense

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
like six samurai so I guess in a sense

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.660 
like six samurai so I guess in a sense
it<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.500> interesting<00:01:40.770> match<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.520> see

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it was a really interesting match to see

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.249 
it was a really interesting match to see
who<00:01:41.700> could<00:01:41.969> get<00:01:42.179> their<00:01:42.359> cards<00:01:42.570> off<00:01:42.750> first<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
who could get their cards off first and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.380 
who could get their cards off first and
clearly<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.890> six<00:01:44.100> samurai<00:01:44.369> player<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.969> so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
clearly the six samurai player one so

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.550 
clearly the six samurai player one so

see another deck beside wind up win

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.439 
see another deck beside wind up win
however<00:06:08.369> I<00:06:08.579> still<00:06:08.819> think<00:06:08.999> wind<00:06:09.179> up<00:06:09.269> with<00:06:09.389> a

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
however I still think wind up with a

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.359 
however I still think wind up with a
better<00:06:09.539> deck<00:06:09.809> just<00:06:10.409> for<00:06:10.529> the<00:06:10.589> fact<00:06:10.739> that<00:06:10.919> they

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:11.369 
better deck just for the fact that they

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:14.149 
better deck just for the fact that they
are<00:06:11.399> a<00:06:11.610> lot<00:06:11.909> more<00:06:12.529> based<00:06:13.529> around<00:06:13.709> making<00:06:14.009> a

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
are a lot more based around making a

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:15.559 
are a lot more based around making a
turn<00:06:14.309> one<00:06:14.459> shock<00:06:14.699> master<00:06:14.909> but<00:06:15.209> I<00:06:15.239> can<00:06:15.419> see

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
turn one shock master but I can see

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:16.639 
turn one shock master but I can see
where<00:06:15.719> this<00:06:15.809> debt<00:06:16.050> can<00:06:16.199> do<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.379> exact<00:06:16.619> same

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:16.649 
where this debt can do the exact same

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:18.499 
where this debt can do the exact same
thing<00:06:17.129> so<00:06:17.369> I<00:06:17.399> still<00:06:17.759> think<00:06:18.029> samurais<00:06:18.389> an

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
thing so I still think samurais an

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:19.939 
thing so I still think samurais an
amazing<00:06:18.899> back<00:06:19.050> this<00:06:19.199> is<00:06:19.349> just<00:06:19.499> an<00:06:19.559> interesting

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
amazing back this is just an interesting

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.739 
amazing back this is just an interesting
build<00:06:20.159> this<00:06:20.999> is<00:06:21.179> probably<00:06:21.329> one<00:06:21.509> of<00:06:21.539> the<00:06:21.659> first

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:21.749 
build this is probably one of the first

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:23.659 
build this is probably one of the first
build<00:06:22.019> will<00:06:22.169> see<00:06:22.319> this<00:06:22.439> format<00:06:22.860> so<00:06:23.159> the<00:06:23.549> reason

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
build will see this format so the reason

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:24.709 
build will see this format so the reason
why<00:06:23.819> I<00:06:23.879> think<00:06:24.059> he<00:06:24.119> won<00:06:24.269> like<00:06:24.389> a<00:06:24.479> lot<00:06:24.569> of<00:06:24.629> people

I think that this was an interesting
build<00:07:11.039> and<00:07:11.249> I<00:07:11.309> feel<00:07:11.610> that<00:07:11.849> this<00:07:11.999> will<00:07:12.180> be<00:07:12.210> one

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 
build and I feel that this will be one

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.269 
build and I feel that this will be one
of<00:07:12.599> the<00:07:12.689> builds<00:07:13.080> that<00:07:13.199> people<00:07:13.469> will<00:07:13.619> run<00:07:13.919> and

would actually be considered a stack or
a<00:07:46.860> cheater<00:07:47.099> but<00:07:47.309> regardless<00:07:47.729> I<00:07:48.029> think<00:07:48.059> this

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330 
a cheater but regardless I think this

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.149 
a cheater but regardless I think this
was<00:07:48.509> a<00:07:48.539> pretty<00:07:48.719> will<00:07:48.959> belt<00:07:49.229> deck<00:07:49.559> it's<00:07:49.889> a

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159 
was a pretty will belt deck it's a

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:51.949 
was a pretty will belt deck it's a
little<00:07:50.729> late<00:07:50.909> to<00:07:51.270> me<00:07:51.360> it<00:07:51.449> looks<00:07:51.599> a<00:07:51.659> little<00:07:51.809> odd

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:51.959 
little late to me it looks a little odd

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.420 
little late to me it looks a little odd
but<00:07:52.020> maybe<00:07:52.319> that's<00:07:52.529> because<00:07:52.680> I've<00:07:52.919> ran<00:07:53.129> Sam's

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.430 
but maybe that's because I've ran Sam's

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.889 
but maybe that's because I've ran Sam's
differently<00:07:53.909> but<00:07:54.300> I<00:07:54.360> think<00:07:54.509> aside<00:07:54.719> from<00:07:54.809> that

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:54.899 
differently but I think aside from that

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:57.170 
differently but I think aside from that
um<00:07:55.289> it<00:07:55.770> did<00:07:56.069> its<00:07:56.219> job<00:07:56.249> so<00:07:56.759> we'll<00:07:56.969> see<00:07:57.089> what

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 
um it did its job so we'll see what

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.209 
um it did its job so we'll see what
happens<00:07:57.240> up<00:07:57.539> the<00:07:57.629> next<00:07:57.930> iyes<00:07:58.439> result<00:07:58.770> which<00:07:59.099> i

00:07:59.209 --> 00:07:59.219 
happens up the next iyes result which i

00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:00.829 
happens up the next iyes result which i
believe<00:07:59.279> is<00:07:59.610> Rhode<00:07:59.999> Island<00:08:00.419> so<00:08:00.569> that's<00:08:00.749> all<00:08:00.809> I

00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:00.839 
believe is Rhode Island so that's all I

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:01.850 
believe is Rhode Island so that's all I
