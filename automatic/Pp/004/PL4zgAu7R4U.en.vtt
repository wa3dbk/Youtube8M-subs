00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
branch we simply come in periodically

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.570 
branch we simply come in periodically
about<00:02:50.810> twice<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> month<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:52.190> we<00:02:52.250> simply

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
about twice a month and we simply

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.870 
about twice a month and we simply
continue<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.959> take<00:02:54.230> off<00:02:54.470> any<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.459> these<00:02:55.580> little

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
continue to take off any of these little

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.289 
continue to take off any of these little
sprouts<00:02:56.209> get<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.350> see<00:02:57.620> here<00:02:58.190> up<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.880> down<00:02:59.090> the

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
sprouts get you see here up and down the

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.780 
sprouts get you see here up and down the
cane<00:02:59.570> like<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.140> see<00:03:00.350> right<00:03:00.620> here<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.430> simply

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
cane like you see right here we simply

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.759 
cane like you see right here we simply
take<00:03:02.000> those<00:03:02.269> out<00:03:02.510> because<00:03:03.170> we're<00:03:03.410> simply

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
take those out because we're simply

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.520 
take those out because we're simply
channeling<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> energy<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.630> plant<00:03:06.049> into

channeling the energy of this plant into

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.979 
channeling the energy of this plant into
developing<00:03:07.430> these<00:03:07.579> branches<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.600> want<00:03:08.810> to

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
developing these branches you want to

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.530 
developing these branches you want to
branches<00:03:09.470> on<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.769> top<00:03:09.950> wire<00:03:10.190> two<00:03:10.850> branches<00:03:11.299> on

branches on the top wire two branches on
the<00:03:11.900> bottom<00:03:12.170> wire<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.950> can<00:03:13.130> see<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.430> two

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
the bottom wire and you can see the two

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.880 
the bottom wire and you can see the two
branches<00:03:14.030> here<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.870> other<00:03:15.079> thing<00:03:15.350> we<00:03:15.500> do<00:03:15.680> is

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
branches here the other thing we do is

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.270 
branches here the other thing we do is
this<00:03:16.070> bridge<00:03:16.459> develops

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
this bridge develops

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.390 
this bridge develops
from<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.850> plant<00:03:18.240> we<00:03:18.990> let<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.380> we're<00:03:19.590> all<00:03:19.770> way

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
from this plant we let it we're all way

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
from this plant we let it we're all way
past<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:22.140> adjacent<00:03:22.830> plant<00:03:23.100> next<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.760> then

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
past the adjacent plant next to it then

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.290 
past the adjacent plant next to it then
we<00:03:24.660> cut<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.050> back<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.680> within<00:03:26.460> about<00:03:26.580> six

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
we cut it back to within about six

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.350 
we cut it back to within about six
inches<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.410> cane<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.760> second<00:03:30.150> plant

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
inches of the cane of the second plant

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.960 
inches of the cane of the second plant
it's<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.110> like<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.740> shoot<00:03:32.280> here

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
it's just like this little shoot here

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.750 
it's just like this little shoot here
here's<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.020> here's<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.380> end<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.370> it's

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
here's the here's the end of it and it's

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.900 
here's the here's the end of it and it's
now<00:03:36.030> almost<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.440> as<00:03:38.130> soon<00:03:38.370> as<00:03:38.430> he<00:03:38.580> gets<00:03:38.820> to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
now almost to here as soon as he gets to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.140 
now almost to here as soon as he gets to
here<00:03:39.330> will<00:03:39.780> cut<00:03:40.110> this<00:03:40.470> branch<00:03:40.980> back<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.940> right

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
here will cut this branch back to right

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.960 
here will cut this branch back to right
here<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:43.290> we've<00:03:43.560> developed<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:44.220> double<00:03:44.610> feeding

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
here so we've developed a double feeding

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.330 
here so we've developed a double feeding
system<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.900> space<00:03:46.200> between<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.890> plants

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
system in the space between the plants

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.670 
system in the space between the plants
and<00:03:48.060> these<00:03:48.240> plants<00:03:48.300> happen<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.140> be<00:03:49.260> three<00:03:49.530> feet

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
and these plants happen to be three feet

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.150 
and these plants happen to be three feet
apart

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
apart

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.070 
apart
that's<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.060> original<00:03:51.239> plant<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.989> we

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
that's the original plant that we

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.949 
that's the original plant that we
started<00:03:52.470> with<00:03:53.150> commonly<00:03:54.150> now<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:54.510> put<00:03:54.930> our

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
started with commonly now we put our

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.780 
started with commonly now we put our
plants<00:03:55.500> four<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:55.860> half<00:03:55.920> feet<00:03:56.190> apart<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.700> a

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
plants four and a half feet apart in a

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.370 
plants four and a half feet apart in a
row<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.180> we<00:03:57.209> space<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.840> little<00:03:57.989> bit<00:03:58.140> further

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
row so we space it a little bit further

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.520 
row so we space it a little bit further
apart<00:03:58.640> but<00:03:59.640> beauty<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.989> it's<00:04:01.440> a

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530

matter of coming in rubbing out the
little<00:04:04.200> undesirable<00:04:05.010> shoots<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.000> try<00:04:06.209> to

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
little undesirable shoots that try to

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.590 
little undesirable shoots that try to

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
develop to train those branches and we

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.620 
develop to train those branches and we
do<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:10.020> this<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.650> done<00:04:10.830> quite<00:04:11.160> nicely<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.970> have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
do this this is done quite nicely I have

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.850 
do this this is done quite nicely I have
found

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
found

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.420 
found
a<00:04:14.240> chemical<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:16.290> may<00:04:16.470> give<00:04:16.680> us<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.950> hand<00:04:17.220> on

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
a chemical it may give us a hand on

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.520 
a chemical it may give us a hand on
suppressing<00:04:17.850> these<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:18.600> they<00:04:18.750> don't<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.410> to

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
suppressing these so they don't have to

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.160 
suppressing these so they don't have to
do<00:04:19.680> as<00:04:19.859> much<00:04:20.100> by<00:04:20.280> hand<00:04:20.579> but<00:04:21.359> right<00:04:21.570> now<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:21.840> do

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
do as much by hand but right now we do

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.650 
do as much by hand but right now we do
it<00:04:22.290> by<00:04:22.440> hand<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.040> we<00:04:23.490> do<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:23.970> like<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.150> say<00:04:24.420> about

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
it by hand and we do it like I say about

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.090 
it by hand and we do it like I say about
twice<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:24.990> month<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:26.190> come<00:04:27.120> October<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:28.500> Utah

twice a month and come October this Utah
system<00:04:29.730> will<00:04:30.000> be<00:04:30.150> covered<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:31.530> wire<00:04:31.770> will<00:04:32.070> be

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
system will be covered the wire will be

system will be covered the wire will be
covered<00:04:32.550> with<00:04:32.580> developing<00:04:33.270> shoots<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:34.590> as

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
covered with developing shoots and as

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.600 
covered with developing shoots and as
these<00:04:35.520> branches<00:04:36.180> move<00:04:36.810> closer<00:04:37.380> together<00:04:37.830> here

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
these branches move closer together here

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.630 
these branches move closer together here
and<00:04:38.730> passing<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:39.720> cut<00:04:40.080> them<00:04:40.200> back<00:04:40.640> we

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
and passing and we cut them back we

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.220 
and passing and we cut them back we
simply<00:04:42.060> allow<00:04:42.180> them<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.630> develop<00:04:42.840> side

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
simply allow them to develop side

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.680 
simply allow them to develop side
branches<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:44.250> then<00:04:44.610> we<00:04:44.760> trim<00:04:45.120> those<00:04:45.390> in

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
branches and then we trim those in

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.830 
branches and then we trim those in
October<00:04:46.290> to<00:04:47.070> about<00:04:47.310> 8<00:04:47.490> inches<00:04:47.700> as<00:04:48.030> they<00:04:48.630> come

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
October to about 8 inches as they come

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.650 
October to about 8 inches as they come
out<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:50.700> makes<00:04:50.940> all<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.330> difference<00:04:51.419> in

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
out and it makes all the difference in

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.070 
out and it makes all the difference in
the<00:04:51.720> world<00:04:52.010> come<00:04:53.010> next<00:04:53.280> May<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.760> June<00:04:54.080> the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
the world come next May and June the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.110 
the world come next May and June the
beautiful<00:04:55.590> side<00:04:55.830> branches<00:04:56.310> here<00:04:56.610> will<00:04:56.910> allow

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
beautiful side branches here will allow

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.210 
beautiful side branches here will allow
the<00:04:57.180> fruiting<00:04:57.660> system<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.260> just<00:04:58.500> more<00:04:59.070> or<00:04:59.100> less

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
the fruiting system to just more or less

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.670 
the fruiting system to just more or less
cascade<00:04:59.970> over<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.840> you<00:05:00.960> can<00:05:01.140> harvest<00:05:01.410> the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
cascade over and you can harvest the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.900 
cascade over and you can harvest the
fruit<00:05:01.950> with<00:05:02.610> an<00:05:02.760> easy<00:05:02.970> easy<00:05:03.390> system<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.490> just

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
fruit with an easy easy system so I just

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.700 
fruit with an easy easy system so I just
wanted<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.270> show<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.480> at<00:05:06.810> what<00:05:07.020> stage<00:05:07.410> we're

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
wanted to show you at what stage we're

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.520 
wanted to show you at what stage we're
at<00:05:07.890> today<00:05:08.060> this<00:05:09.060> is<00:05:09.240> late<00:05:09.450> August<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:10.169> can<00:05:10.350> see

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
at today this is late August you can see

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.409 
at today this is late August you can see
how<00:05:10.710> these<00:05:10.860> plants<00:05:11.190> they<00:05:11.370> developed<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.060> by

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
how these plants they developed and by

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.210 
how these plants they developed and by
the<00:05:12.480> end<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.900> growing<00:05:13.050> season<00:05:13.200> we'll<00:05:14.010> have

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
the end of the growing season we'll have

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.159 
the end of the growing season we'll have
a<00:05:14.250> beautiful<00:05:14.460> fruiting<00:05:15.060> system<00:05:15.450> here<00:05:15.690> that

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
a beautiful fruiting system here that

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.960 
a beautiful fruiting system here that
each<00:05:16.350> one<00:05:16.620> will<00:05:16.800> produce<00:05:16.950> on<00:05:17.370> average<00:05:17.610> about

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
each one will produce on average about

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.230 
each one will produce on average about
10<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.390> 15<00:05:18.810> pounds<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.919> that's<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.280> lot<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.640> fine

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
10 to 15 pounds and that's a lot of fine

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.590 
10 to 15 pounds and that's a lot of fine
blackberries<00:05:21.930> for<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.169> home<00:05:22.290> gardener
