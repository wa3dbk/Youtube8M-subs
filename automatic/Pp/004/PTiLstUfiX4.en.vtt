two here on a disk drive from there you
can<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:51.960> lift<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:56.250> display<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.180> all

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
can just lift up the the display and all

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.530 
can just lift up the the display and all
the<00:01:57.450> buttons

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
the buttons

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.460 
the buttons
out<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.990> the<00:02:00.030> disk<00:02:01.030> drive<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.780> then<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.200> have

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
out of the disk drive and then you have

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.100 
out of the disk drive and then you have
access<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.550> tops<00:02:03.760> of<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.000> keys<00:02:06.930> next<00:02:07.930> step

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
access to the tops of the keys next step

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.380 
access to the tops of the keys next step
is<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:10.110> enable<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.380> keys<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:12.360> freely<00:02:13.360> move

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
is to enable the keys to freely move

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.270 
is to enable the keys to freely move
forward<00:02:14.110> take<00:02:14.530> them<00:02:14.710> off<00:02:14.800> need<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.160> move

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
forward take them off need to move

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.060 
forward take them off need to move
forward<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.540> what<00:02:16.720> needs<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.960> be<00:02:17.080> done<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.680> to

looks like about three of them and once
those<00:02:31.900> are<00:02:32.310> taken<00:02:33.310> off<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.790> really<00:02:34.420> frees<00:02:34.660> this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
those are taken off it really frees this

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.890 
those are taken off it really frees this
up<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.230> pick<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.890> keys<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.810> to

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
up you can pick up the keys we have to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.600 
up you can pick up the keys we have to
do<00:02:37.990> then<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.560> unscrew<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:39.100> screw<00:02:39.160> back

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
do then is to unscrew this screw back

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.220 
do then is to unscrew this screw back
here<00:02:40.060> by<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> power<00:02:41.650> button<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.900> then

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
here by the power button and and then

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.310 
here by the power button and and then
also<00:02:44.380> on<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.800> other<00:02:44.890> side<00:02:45.930> there's<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.110> same

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
also on the other side there's the same

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.290 
also on the other side there's the same
thing<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.800> I've<00:02:48.340> already<00:02:48.520> taking<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.880> screw

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
thing so I've already taking the screw

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.340 
thing so I've already taking the screw
off<00:02:49.590> once<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.740> screw<00:02:50.980> comes<00:02:51.220> off<00:02:52.350> you're

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
off once that screw comes off you're

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.720 
off once that screw comes off you're
going<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:55.390> be<00:02:55.540> able<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.780> take<00:02:56.020> this<00:02:56.200> up<00:02:56.350> by

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
going to you be able to take this up by

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.540 
going to you be able to take this up by
pulling<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:58.860> back<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.110> back<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.310> pops

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
pulling it back up and back and it pops

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.740 
pulling it back up and back and it pops
off<00:03:03.760> like<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.170> can<00:03:05.380> see<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:06.750> grabs

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
off like that you can see that it grabs

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.620 
off like that you can see that it grabs
the<00:03:07.930> underside<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.830> front<00:03:09.610> edge<00:03:09.790> and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
the underside of the front edge and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.390 
the underside of the front edge and
that's<00:03:10.870> how<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.110> clips<00:03:11.380> on<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.890> now<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.070> need<00:03:15.310> to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
that's how it clips on so now I need to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.300 
that's how it clips on so now I need to
walk<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.760> keyboard<00:03:16.150> back<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.480> provide<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
walk the keyboard back to provide the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
walk the keyboard back to provide the
clearance<00:03:18.310> since<00:03:18.550> you<00:03:18.760> just<00:03:18.970> push<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.209> right

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
clearance since you just push it right

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.290 
clearance since you just push it right
back<00:03:19.450> up<00:03:19.900> against<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.400> brackets<00:03:21.850> back<00:03:22.060> there

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
back up against the brackets back there

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.930 
back up against the brackets back there
and<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.600> provides<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.400> gap<00:03:24.400> where<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.730> keys

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
and that provides a gap where the keys

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.740 
and that provides a gap where the keys
can<00:03:25.120> move<00:03:25.269> forward<00:03:25.750> for<00:03:25.959> removal<00:03:27.150> okay<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.209> I

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
can move forward for removal okay so I

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.050 
can move forward for removal okay so I
hate<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.739> problem<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.100> had<00:03:30.280> was<00:03:30.400> sticking<00:03:30.700> keys

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
hate the problem I had was sticking keys

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.550 
hate the problem I had was sticking keys
they<00:03:31.330> were<00:03:31.420> moving<00:03:31.690> together<00:03:31.900> with<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.320> key

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
they were moving together with the key

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.699 
they were moving together with the key
adjacent<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:35.019> can<00:03:35.170> see<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:35.500> I

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
adjacent to it so you can see that I

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.080 
adjacent to it so you can see that I
pulled<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.190> few<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.430> these<00:03:36.489> keys<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.790> I'll<00:03:36.970> get

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
pulled a few of these keys and I'll get

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.949 
pulled a few of these keys and I'll get
to<00:03:37.209> how<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.390> do<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.570> be

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
to how to do that be

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.330 
to how to do that be
but<00:03:38.080> obviously<00:03:38.230> had<00:03:38.590> some<00:03:38.800> build<00:03:39.010> up<00:03:39.100> looks

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
but obviously had some build up looks

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.280 
but obviously had some build up looks
like<00:03:39.430> some<00:03:40.180> sort<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.390> candy<00:03:40.810> or<00:03:40.900> something<00:03:41.140> I

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
like some sort of candy or something I

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.870 
like some sort of candy or something I
don't<00:03:41.410> know<00:03:41.500> how<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> kid<00:03:41.860> eats<00:03:41.980> candy<00:03:42.700> while

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
don't know how a kid eats candy while

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.509 
don't know how a kid eats candy while
playing<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.269> piano<00:03:43.450> but<00:03:44.070> must<00:03:45.070> be<00:03:45.250> one<00:03:45.430> of

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
playing the piano but must be one of

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.770 
playing the piano but must be one of
they're<00:03:45.640> not<00:03:45.670> playing<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.300> piano

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
they're not playing the piano

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.770 
they're not playing the piano
hopefully<00:03:48.120> anyways<00:03:49.120> getting<00:03:49.269> down<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
hopefully anyways getting down to the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.070 
hopefully anyways getting down to the
keys<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.380> they're<00:03:51.160> moving<00:03:51.400> together<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.239> the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
keys and they're moving together so the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.070 
keys and they're moving together so the
way<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.410> these<00:03:53.590> are<00:03:53.980> removed<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:57.930> just<00:03:58.930> take

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
way that these are removed is just take

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.550 
way that these are removed is just take
a<00:03:59.110> regular<00:03:59.320> butter<00:03:59.739> knife<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.380> see

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
a regular butter knife and you can see

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.310 
a regular butter knife and you can see
there's<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:02.860> little<00:04:03.570> arrow<00:04:04.570> at<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.930> top<00:04:05.170> of

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
there's a little arrow at the top of

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.349 
there's a little arrow at the top of
each<00:04:05.470> key<00:04:05.739> you're<00:04:06.489> just<00:04:06.700> going<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.030> press<00:04:07.329> that

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
each key you're just going to press that

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.280 
each key you're just going to press that
down<00:04:07.540> it's<00:04:07.989> going<00:04:08.109> to<00:04:08.170> push<00:04:08.410> in<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.620> spring<00:04:08.950> and

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
down it's going to push in a spring and

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.199 
down it's going to push in a spring and
enables<00:04:11.159> you<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.280> push<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.519> forward<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.060> then

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
enables you to push it forward and then

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.970 
enables you to push it forward and then
you<00:04:12.330> just<00:04:12.540> rock<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:12.959> out<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.440> front<00:04:13.739> part

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
you just rock it out of the front part

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.409 
you just rock it out of the front part
and<00:04:14.480> that's<00:04:15.480> that's<00:04:15.930> about<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.949> my

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
and that's that's about it so I have my

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.870 
and that's that's about it so I have my
my<00:04:18.979> work<00:04:19.979> cut<00:04:20.190> out<00:04:20.250> for<00:04:20.310> me<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:20.609> terms<00:04:20.699> of

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
my work cut out for me in terms of

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.700 
my work cut out for me in terms of
cleaning<00:04:21.090> these<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.600> don't<00:04:21.840> see<00:04:22.530> anything

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
cleaning these but I don't see anything

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.850 
cleaning these but I don't see anything
broken<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.940> those<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.510> I've<00:04:24.590> cleaned<00:04:25.590> up

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
broken and of those that I've cleaned up

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.100 
broken and of those that I've cleaned up
there<00:04:26.400> they're<00:04:26.760> working<00:04:27.090> back<00:04:27.330> how<00:04:27.960> they

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
there they're working back how they

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.170 
there they're working back how they
should<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.910> looks<00:04:29.910> better<00:04:30.330> than<00:04:30.449> I<00:04:30.510> thought

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
should so looks better than I thought

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.990 
should so looks better than I thought
so<00:04:33.180> in<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.660> course<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.669> pulling<00:04:35.669> and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
so in the course of pulling and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.170 
so in the course of pulling and
replacing<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.930> keys<00:04:37.199> I<00:04:38.040> found<00:04:38.669> that<00:04:38.820> that

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
replacing the keys I found that that

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.540 
replacing the keys I found that that
there's<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.750> way<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:39.900> can<00:04:40.290> put<00:04:41.010> them<00:04:41.160> back<00:04:41.280> in

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
there's a way you can put them back in

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.860 
there's a way you can put them back in
that<00:04:41.580> looks<00:04:41.910> like<00:04:42.090> they're<00:04:42.270> actually<00:04:42.600> placed

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
that looks like they're actually placed

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.140 
that looks like they're actually placed
right<00:04:43.169> but<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.650> but<00:04:43.830> there<00:04:43.979> really<00:04:44.100> aren't<00:04:44.400> so

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
right but it but there really aren't so

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150 
right but it but there really aren't so
if<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.229> look<00:04:46.350> at<00:04:46.470> some<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.680> these<00:04:46.770> I'm

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
if you look at some of these I'm

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.920 
if you look at some of these I'm
wiggling<00:04:47.400> back<00:04:47.699> you<00:04:48.000> know<00:04:48.060> end-to-end<00:04:48.449> and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
wiggling back you know end-to-end and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.870 
wiggling back you know end-to-end and
they're<00:04:49.289> not<00:04:49.440> moving<00:04:49.680> but<00:04:50.340> this<00:04:50.520> one<00:04:50.699> I<00:04:50.729> can

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
they're not moving but this one I can

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.060 
they're not moving but this one I can
shimmy<00:04:51.240> around<00:04:51.510> a<00:04:51.600> little<00:04:51.660> bit<00:04:51.900> otherwise<00:04:52.710> it

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
shimmy around a little bit otherwise it

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.070 
shimmy around a little bit otherwise it
plays<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.639> looks<00:04:53.850> like<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.090> plays<00:04:54.270> okay<00:04:54.630> but

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
plays it looks like it plays okay but

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.430 
plays it looks like it plays okay but
the<00:04:55.229> but<00:04:55.590> it's<00:04:55.770> actually<00:04:56.070> wobbling<00:04:56.550> loosely

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
the but it's actually wobbling loosely

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.000 
the but it's actually wobbling loosely
and<00:04:58.440> so<00:04:59.750> you<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:00.900> just<00:05:01.020> pop<00:05:01.199> down<00:05:01.229> back<00:05:01.770> out

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
and so you can just pop down back out

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.409 
and so you can just pop down back out
and<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.460> want<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.699> do<00:05:02.820> when<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:03.060> place<00:05:03.270> these

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
and you want to do when you place these

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.439 
and you want to do when you place these
back<00:05:03.660> in<00:05:03.930> make<00:05:04.770> sure<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.430> have<00:05:05.729> pressure

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
back in make sure you you have pressure

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.779 
back in make sure you you have pressure
toward<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.020> back<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:08.160> then<00:05:08.340> push<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.760> down

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
toward the back and then push it down

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.290 
toward the back and then push it down
that<00:05:09.690> way<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.199> stays<00:05:10.470> nice<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.830> tight<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.970> so

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
that way it stays nice and tight and so

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.830 
that way it stays nice and tight and so
on<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.990> black<00:05:13.919> keys<00:05:14.190> just<00:05:14.940> pop<00:05:15.210> out<00:05:15.389> just<00:05:15.660> pull

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
on the black keys just pop out just pull

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.409 
on the black keys just pop out just pull
them<00:05:15.960> toward<00:05:16.229> you<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.590> then<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.729> same<00:05:18.150> thing

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
them toward you and then the same thing

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.300 
them toward you and then the same thing
when<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:18.780> go<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:18.930> put<00:05:19.080> them<00:05:19.139> in<00:05:19.289> and<00:05:19.860> apply

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
when you go to put them in and apply

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.990 
when you go to put them in and apply
some<00:05:20.520> pressure<00:05:20.639> that<00:05:21.060> way<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.510> then<00:05:23.000> make

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
some pressure that way and then make

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.330 
some pressure that way and then make
sure<00:05:24.030> they're<00:05:24.530> they're<00:05:25.530> in<00:05:25.650> and<00:05:25.800> not<00:05:25.919> popping

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
sure they're they're in and not popping

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.980 
sure they're they're in and not popping
out<00:05:26.460> that<00:05:27.120> make<00:05:27.300> really<00:05:27.510> big<00:05:27.630> difference<00:05:27.900> I

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
out that make really big difference I

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.600 
out that make really big difference I
found<00:05:28.139> that<00:05:28.260> I'd<00:05:28.380> done<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.889> went<00:05:29.340> through<00:05:29.520> and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
found that I'd done I went through and

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.490 
found that I'd done I went through and
clean<00:05:29.760> all<00:05:29.880> these<00:05:30.030> keys<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.599> went<00:05:31.169> back<00:05:31.349> and

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
clean all these keys and went back and

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.750 
clean all these keys and went back and
found<00:05:31.740> that<00:05:31.889> several<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.310> them<00:05:32.400> were<00:05:32.520> still

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
found that several of them were still

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.190 
found that several of them were still
loose<00:05:32.970> but<00:05:33.180> look<00:05:33.360> like<00:05:33.510> they<00:05:33.630> are<00:05:33.660> right<00:05:33.930> so<00:05:34.169> I

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
loose but look like they are right so I

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.420 
loose but look like they are right so I
would<00:05:34.470> have<00:05:34.560> required<00:05:34.830> me<00:05:35.039> to<00:05:35.070> undo

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
would have required me to undo

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.820 
would have required me to undo
everything<00:05:35.580> once<00:05:36.169> we<00:05:37.169> got<00:05:37.289> the<00:05:37.440> farther<00:05:37.680> down

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
everything once we got the farther down

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.610 
everything once we got the farther down
the<00:05:37.919> road<00:05:38.630> okay<00:05:39.630> so<00:05:39.870> I<00:05:40.050> went<00:05:40.289> through<00:05:40.500> and

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
the road okay so I went through and

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.670 
the road okay so I went through and
cleaned<00:05:40.830> up<00:05:40.889> all<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.190> keys<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:42.380> made<00:05:43.380> sure

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
cleaned up all the keys and made sure

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.670 
cleaned up all the keys and made sure
all<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.889> action<00:05:44.660> was<00:05:46.820> was<00:05:47.820> working<00:05:48.000> right<00:05:48.680> now

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
all the action was was working right now

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.940 
all the action was was working right now
there's<00:05:49.889> one<00:05:50.039> more<00:05:50.190> thing<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:52.020> I'd<00:05:52.710> like<00:05:52.889> to

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950

out<00:05:55.680> some<00:05:55.889> of<00:05:56.010> these<00:05:56.099> keys<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:57.410> it's<00:05:58.410> what<00:05:58.650> can

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
out some of these keys and it's what can

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.650 
out some of these keys and it's what can
happen<00:05:59.010> with<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.400> springs<00:05:59.820> underneath<00:06:00.330> the

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
happen with the springs underneath the

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.510 
happen with the springs underneath the
keys<00:06:02.450> so<00:06:03.450> if<00:06:03.539> I<00:06:03.630> puff<00:06:03.840> this<00:06:03.990> one<00:06:04.229> out<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:04.680> can

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
keys so if I puff this one out you can

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.810 
keys so if I puff this one out you can
see<00:06:05.700> these<00:06:05.880> little<00:06:06.030> Springs<00:06:06.479> down<00:06:06.750> here<00:06:07.820> these

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
see these little Springs down here these

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.270 
see these little Springs down here these
guys<00:06:09.060> down<00:06:09.330> here<00:06:09.599> what<00:06:10.380> can<00:06:10.740> happen<00:06:10.919> in<00:06:11.190> the

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
guys down here what can happen in the

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.820 
guys down here what can happen in the
course<00:06:11.550> of<00:06:11.729> jostling<00:06:12.690> the<00:06:12.720> key<00:06:13.020> around<00:06:13.289> is

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
course of jostling the key around is

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.589 
course of jostling the key around is
that<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.160> spring<00:06:14.610> if<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.120> can<00:06:15.210> get<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:15.389> closed

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
that the spring if you can get it closed

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.100 
that the spring if you can get it closed
up<00:06:15.630> down<00:06:15.930> there<00:06:16.139> the<00:06:16.889> spring<00:06:17.280> is<00:06:17.430> sitting<00:06:18.110> it's

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
up down there the spring is sitting it's

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.719 
up down there the spring is sitting it's
sitting<00:06:19.409> like<00:06:19.560> this<00:06:19.590> on<00:06:20.039> top<00:06:20.250> of<00:06:20.310> it<00:06:20.460> it<00:06:20.610> will

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
sitting like this on top of it it will

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.149 
sitting like this on top of it it will
never<00:06:20.880> sit<00:06:21.390> the<00:06:22.050> key<00:06:22.289> will<00:06:22.469> never<00:06:22.680> get<00:06:22.950> down

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
never sit the key will never get down

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.499 
never sit the key will never get down
into<00:06:23.400> place<00:06:23.729> and<00:06:23.940> be<00:06:24.000> tight

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
into place and be tight

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.540 
into place and be tight
the<00:06:24.659> weight<00:06:24.840> needs<00:06:25.050> to<00:06:25.229> be<00:06:25.379> if<00:06:26.009> your<00:06:26.189> spring<00:06:26.430> is

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
the weight needs to be if your spring is

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.700 
the weight needs to be if your spring is
sitting<00:06:26.789> on<00:06:26.909> top<00:06:27.180> this<00:06:27.389> way<00:06:27.599> so<00:06:28.319> we<00:06:28.439> have<00:06:28.469> to<00:06:28.590> do

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
sitting on top this way so we have to do

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.980 
sitting on top this way so we have to do
is<00:06:28.800> push<00:06:29.009> it<00:06:29.039> back<00:06:29.340> in<00:06:29.610> you'll<00:06:30.389> start<00:06:30.659> to<00:06:30.749> bend

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
is push it back in you'll start to bend
