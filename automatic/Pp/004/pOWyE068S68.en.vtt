00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 even the jury then black 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.800

 the prize for September 2012 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.930
 to the Lazio football player Klose for the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.120
 behavior held during the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.300
 match naples lazio of 26 September 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.309
 last after making a goal with 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.010
 a strike not seen by the referees 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.230
 the Lazio striker in front of the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.899
 requests opponents confessed 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.520
 the irregularity of his gesture inducing 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.030
 the race director to cancel the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.860
 mark the sincerity of the player in the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.539
 acknowledging his foul was 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.180
 appreciated by the jury that has 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.309
 compared the behavior of klose e 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.129
 that of very great champions like 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.409
 maradona and henri than in the past in 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.299
 similar situations and equally if not 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.479
 even more clamorous they refused to 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.130
 admit to having cheated the components 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.860
 of the jury representatives of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.509
 Florentine and his sponsor mazda have 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.850
 remembered a famous goal scored in 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.700
 overt position offside 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.700
 just from klose in an eighth finals 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.560
 of champions league 2009 2010 that brought 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 to the elimination of the purple team from 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.100
 part of the bayern monk but have 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 considered to adhere to the decision 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.509
 collective appreciating the value of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.400
 gesture of the player today at Lazio 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.220
 deserves recognition as an act of 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.119
 significant fair play well this is the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.460
 motivation 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.360
 we want to add before hearing 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.540
 a Florentine and our sponsor 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.220
 mazda technician we entered this 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.590
 fair play award since December 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.170
 last year we reward the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.080
 coach to the referee who 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.990
 in the field he became the protagonist of a 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.149
 particularly significant gesture e 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.280
 I must say that of all the winners 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.170
 let's say that of mirÃ² 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.850
 perhaps it was the most important for 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.830
 what then influenced the result 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.590
 of the match because it is generally there 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.900
 limits to granting opponents a 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.600
 corner kick a lineout but 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.080
 in short, a goal is difficult and difficult 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.120
 to be seen 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.410
 I must also say with all sincerity a 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.090
 aimed at our supporters in Florence 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.760
 Florentine our fans still do 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.800
 remember the goal with bayern's goal with 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.930
 bayern offside for which someone has 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.640
 said but how to reward and klose 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.519
 who is our opponent 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.220
 we would like to say instead of fair 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.200
 the fans of the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.450
 Florentine have only prayed me about 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.260
 show you a red card for that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.810
 gesture with the bayern and therefore that remains 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.670
 for what happened two years ago 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.440
 although we all know very well that 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.840
 then the responsibility of the referee is not 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.310
 that you could see but they say you have to 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.930
 show him this red card 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.450
 for what happened against the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.100
 bayern is however immediately after the card 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.110
 purple that the symbol of fair play for 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.120
 what you did with naples and di 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.700
 which I think everyone is not in football 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.230
 Italian grateful thank you so much 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.860
 here we are here, congratulations 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.750
 congratulations you still remember that 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.090
 offside goal 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.040
 yes but for me it is difficult because they look 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.219
 only referees and I thought 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.549
 normal goal after on TV definitely seen 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.650
 out of the game it went like this instead 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.569
 the other day in Naples 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.430
 you have suffered when the opponents are 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.969
 come to say it is true it is touched 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.819
 everything went immediately to say yes it is true 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:53.510
 if it is not immediately because there is no space 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.720
 for dress I can't come to me because 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.629
 there are so many players around and 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.560
 later for me a normal right because 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:06.470
 also watching lots of kids kick 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.760
 because this is also a lot of them 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.379
 important thanks thanks thanks to cable 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.530
 for two years ago but congratulations for 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.530
 now thanks thanks thanks
