00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.190 

okay<00:00:07.600> I've<00:00:07.770> connected<00:00:09.420> four<00:00:10.420> of<00:00:10.809> these

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
okay I've connected four of these

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.570 
okay I've connected four of these
switches<00:00:11.799> and<00:00:12.040> the<00:00:13.030> snap<00:00:13.299> relays<00:00:14.100> and<00:00:15.100> this<00:00:15.430> is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
switches and the snap relays and this is

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.990 
switches and the snap relays and this is
how<00:00:15.699> I<00:00:15.760> do<00:00:15.879> it<00:00:16.150> I<00:00:16.410> will<00:00:17.410> put<00:00:17.740> I'm<00:00:18.580> going<00:00:18.789> to<00:00:18.850> have

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
how I do it I will put I'm going to have

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.650 
how I do it I will put I'm going to have
a<00:00:19.029> total<00:00:19.510> of<00:00:19.570> eight

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.159 

but<00:00:23.259> these<00:00:23.439> atlas<00:00:24.269> over<00:00:25.269> the<00:00:25.419> table<00:00:25.840> switch

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
but these atlas over the table switch

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.200 
but these atlas over the table switch
machines<00:00:26.589> and<00:00:27.419> eight<00:00:28.419> relays<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.550> again<00:00:31.000> just

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
machines and eight relays and again just

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.990 
machines and eight relays and again just
to<00:00:31.419> cover<00:00:31.630> because<00:00:32.559> these<00:00:33.010> are<00:00:33.250> not<00:00:33.370> tortoises

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
to cover because these are not tortoises

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.270 
to cover because these are not tortoises
with<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.329> built-in<00:00:35.040> double<00:00:36.040> pole<00:00:36.250> double

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
with the built-in double pole double

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.840 
with the built-in double pole double
throw<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:38.170> need<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.140> Atlas<00:00:42.870> relates

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
throw you need one of the Atlas relates

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.139 
throw you need one of the Atlas relates
with<00:00:45.850> each<00:00:46.210> one<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:50.500> Atlas<00:00:51.149> switch

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
with each one of the Atlas switch

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.920 
with each one of the Atlas switch
machines<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.800> it's<00:00:53.979> one<00:00:54.220> relay<00:00:54.640> per<00:00:55.000> switch

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
machines so it's one relay per switch

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.749 
machines so it's one relay per switch
machine<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.519> see<00:00:58.059> there<00:00:59.100> the<00:01:00.100> twisted

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
the Reds here and as you can see I found

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.580 
the Reds here and as you can see I found
all<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.870> common<00:01:51.290> positions<00:01:52.210> with<00:01:53.210> a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
from each of the snap relays will go

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.990 
from each of the snap relays will go

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
into one of these terminals and to test

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.740 
into one of these terminals and to test
it<00:02:08.179> out<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:11.000> black<00:02:11.300> wire<00:02:13.750> connected

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
it out I have this black wire connected

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.990 
it out I have this black wire connected
to<00:02:14.959> one<00:02:15.740> lead<00:02:16.100> Oh<00:02:17.709> a

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.570 

DC<00:02:22.870> transformer<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.550> run<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.720> out<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
DC transformer and run in and out of the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:37.710 
DC transformer and run in and out of the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.950 

is<00:02:38.110> what<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.560> use<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:40.000> touch<00:02:40.300> either<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:41.200> red<00:02:42.960> or

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
is what I use to touch either the red or

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.780 
is what I use to touch either the red or
the<00:02:43.990> black<00:02:44.410> as<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:45.370> see<00:02:45.490> you<00:02:45.640> can

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the black as you can see you can

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.580 
the black as you can see you can
probably<00:02:46.030> hear<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.600> switch<00:02:46.840> machine<00:02:47.050> change

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
probably hear the switch machine change

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:06.390 
probably hear the switch machine change
as<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.730> touch<00:02:49.000> each<00:02:49.330> one

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.259 

I<00:03:06.430> touched<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.450> green<00:03:08.640> turtle<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:11.200> relay

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
I touched the green turtle the relay

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.869 
I touched the green turtle the relay
moves<00:03:13.500> along<00:03:14.500> with<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.069> switch<00:03:15.340> machine<00:03:15.730> on

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
moves along with the switch machine on

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.220 
moves along with the switch machine on
top<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.190> clear<00:03:18.489> route<00:03:18.700> when<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.480> touch<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
top to the clear route when I touch the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.550 
top to the clear route when I touch the
red<00:03:20.440> terminal<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:22.269> moves<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:22.959> diverging

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
red terminal it moves to the diverging

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.680 
red terminal it moves to the diverging
route<00:03:24.660> that's<00:03:25.660> basically<00:03:26.230> how<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.560> hookup

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
route that's basically how the hookup

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.640 
route that's basically how the hookup
works<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:32.530> not<00:03:32.739> too<00:03:33.549> hard<00:03:33.790> just<00:03:34.500> take<00:03:35.500> your

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
works it's not too hard just take your

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
works it's not too hard just take your
time<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:35.890> do<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.280> right

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
time and do it right

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.440 
time and do it right
one<00:03:37.090> thing<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.450> will<00:03:37.629> have<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:39.450> test

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
one thing you will have to do is test

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.789 
one thing you will have to do is test
the<00:03:40.599> Frog<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.410> make<00:03:42.370> sure<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
the Frog to make sure that you have the

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.080 
the Frog to make sure that you have the
polarity<00:03:45.750> correct<00:03:47.220> or<00:03:48.220> else<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.790> will

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
polarity correct or else you will

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.229 
polarity correct or else you will
