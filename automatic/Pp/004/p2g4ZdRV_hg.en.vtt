00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.259
 Hello as you can see I have the dress on 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.180
 what I have you in the third part 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.429
 research and I have 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.080
 already written in the video that that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.150
 would like to admit dress in any case 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.630
 because it is too long for me it works 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.570
 go back over your knees and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.920
 here on the collar I am not so 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 and I 'm just making out of this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.019
 dress in coal stop also make in 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.359
 this style again as it is now 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.949
 but I also want something else 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.809
 shorter than talk not as a dress 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.840
 and make a few rivets on it 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.790
 you can either do it like that by 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.770
 this dress just pulls us on 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.440
 and then marked with the pen, the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.469
 want to have short or you're looking for you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.780
 just not that if you like it 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.520
 of cut or of length and lays 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.649
 then just click on it and mark that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.079
 and then of course you need one 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.879
 sharpening and like me 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.649
 already said I would like one more 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.449
 do it and you need it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 then with pliers and as I said this 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.619
 I rent and take now just times 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 maybe you also have a few 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.580
 parts that have been spiced up a bit 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.770
 as this video definitely helpful 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.430
 I wish you a lot of fun for you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.430
 while watching 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.660
 so that now the finished dress or 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.850
 languedoc one always call that too 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.040
 I would like to have it here through the leagues 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.330
 Rangemacht to the students on white 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.900
 not if we recognize that so well now 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.690
 can and back is still longer 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.150
 as the front but it is not so 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.100
 Crisp difference or I would like 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.700
 a lot of fun imitating what 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.560
 to me 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.880
 Of course you can still sew the seams 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.760
 but I just have time now 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.860
 that then probably rises and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.570
 my studios delphi about that with the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.340
 I also chain you in mine 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.920
 Hall part 3 has shown you have become 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.970
 together with this dress and then 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.800
 I'll be a bit too 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.540
 change must spice up 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.310
 maybe you will switch back again 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.030
 One really really pleased 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.030
