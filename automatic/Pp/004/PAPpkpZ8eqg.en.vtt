recommend playing some momentum and like

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.580 
recommend playing some momentum and like
how<00:01:06.729> it<00:01:06.880> works<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.299> that<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.570> just<00:01:08.080> have<00:01:08.320> a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
how it works is that you just have a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.130 
how it works is that you just have a
bunch<00:01:08.890> of<00:01:09.070> enemies<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.970> team<00:01:10.330> players<00:01:10.659> just

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
bunch of enemies and team players just

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.260 
bunch of enemies and team players just
rushing<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.070> flag<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.700> trying<00:01:12.939> to<00:01:13.030> cap<00:01:13.240> it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
rushing to the flag and trying to cap it

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.210 
rushing to the flag and trying to cap it
until<00:01:13.780> they<00:01:13.869> cap<00:01:14.080> all<00:01:14.320> of<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.560> flags<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.130> it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
until they cap all of the flags and it

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.310 
until they cap all of the flags and it
just<00:01:15.549> can<00:01:15.729> go<00:01:15.850> back<00:01:16.120> and<00:01:16.150> forth<00:01:16.630> for<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:16.990> very

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
just can go back and forth for a very

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.170
