00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.930
 a little forgive if there is something a bit 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.849
 cut is that I'm giving the button l os 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.210
 I will explain how to pass the pokemon 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.750
 I explain you need a room or the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.720
 original game if you think of pokemon 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 green the first pokemon there was yes and 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.710
 it has to be the Japanese version I think 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.870
 that there may be an English version 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.400
 I do not know but it has to be the version 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.400
 Japanese since we 're going to take advantage 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.330
 a clichÃ© a bus that has the game 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.970
 and well now you are going to see for it you 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.790
 we have completed as normal we have 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.580
 to go back fierros grove there you are 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.330
 son green 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.330
 well that's blah blah blah 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.880
 well he takes us to his laboratory to do 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 Pedophile things or whatever he does 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:23.689
 there and there we go up there is he 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.689
 the rival lord 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.610
 and good that we have to choose the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.140
 Pokemon 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.000
 I'm going to break a spear in favor of 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 South vulva because no one take again 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.550
 blue I do not know why when the game is 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 much easier with him and also as 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.010
 is a toad with one hand whatever in the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.410
 back the sic leaves at dawn very 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.410
 good blah blah blah blah come internet 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.020
 look and small the opponent that I'm going to 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.020
 win with a vulva schÃ¼rrer 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.509
 Well, fight 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.090
 is about to see one of the fights of 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:09.049
 most spectacular gameplay of this life 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.049
 scratched tackling tackles scratching 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.850
 He said 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.110
 not so 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.210
 It is important if you have set the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.260
 host principle the position of the pce 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.550
 it is very essential to do it worth and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.330
 You can not use it here even if we're 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.020
 point of losing you are going to win equal 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.020
 in rooster 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.530
 and well, nothing happens, it does not happen, it does not happen 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.530
 nothing 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.659
 we have to go get the object 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.659
 now it has a green city 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.410
 at the stops 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.550
 I feel that this is so slow 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.400
 I preferred to leave it at a normal speed 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.940
 so you can see what I'm going to what 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.790
 will happen now in a moment 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.790
 We enter to look for the store and enter 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.070
 It's worth here it tells us so I had told myself 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.070
 what would you come 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.280
 to see now you are going to see you have to enter the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.439
 menu items is given must be done 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.439
 very fast you have to give it to select when 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.349
 you select that object and leave at the same time 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:39.730
 you give to be ex menu salts already 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.730
 you will see what can be done with that 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.990
 we come back and on this lawn we have to look 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.990
 a fight there is 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.500
 well the peak appears and a puncture 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.440
 computing 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.330
 we are going to pokemon and we change very 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.340
 fast and we went out he explained what he has 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.590
 past 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.950
 what I have done has been that if you 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.599
 you keep a pokemon change when saving 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.310
 the change of that object you can change 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.080
 your pokemon through a slot where you do not 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.970
 there's nothing that causes them superior game if 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.540
 you see the teacher although he was there and at 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.540
 enter this house 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.350
 ah 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.380
 do not 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.010
 teacher the teleportation and now that not 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.010
 I know what will happen now 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.819
 do not 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:36.349
 We came through here come what the fuck 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.629
 is putting there that will be putting 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:42.789
 there that you think you will be putting now 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.789
 you are going to see it in 321 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.310
 and I'm already a league champion 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.310
 pokemon three minutes 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.630
 work the description is to leave a little 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.460
 the description of what I just did 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.710
 because it 's a bit quick to do not do it 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.990
 can do slowly and if I do 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.700
 could slowly slow down but not 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.810
 I can comment on the case for that as 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.030
 as I told you to make the change 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.710
 of object but not doing it you keep a 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.390
 change is a click that is only the 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.900
 first version of the game that then what 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.820
 then fixed in the invented combat 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.590
 that change that you have saved allows you 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.380
 change your first pokemon with your second 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.750
 but there is not a second pokemon then 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.000
 what it causes is a failure the game that 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.860
 believes that many things are failures that there are 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.960
 things that do not exist and then you can 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.520
 go through sites until you reach 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.540
 final as you have seen the room of the 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.540
 fame of the league pokemon 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.540

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.820

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.700

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.790
