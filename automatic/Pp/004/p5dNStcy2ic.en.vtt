00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the dungeons for good enough and we can

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.330 
the dungeons for good enough and we can
just<00:00:26.279> take<00:00:26.580> what's<00:00:26.820> ours<00:00:27.199> or<00:00:28.250> technically<00:00:29.250> I

chain<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.810> keep<00:02:08.989> making<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> smaller<00:02:10.069> each

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
chain to keep making it a smaller each

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.250 
chain to keep making it a smaller each
time<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.360> then<00:02:14.480> once<00:02:14.629> it<00:02:14.750> gets<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.080> point

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
time and then once it gets to this point

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.240 
time and then once it gets to this point
it's<00:02:15.410> gonna<00:02:15.500> start<00:02:15.709> shooting<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.040> many

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
it's gonna start shooting out many

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.890 
it's gonna start shooting out many
freezers<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.000> basically<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.510> have<00:02:17.690> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
freezers and you basically just have to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.140 
freezers and you basically just have to
get<00:02:18.049> lucky<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.620> know<00:02:18.950> hope<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.459> catch<00:02:20.060> a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
get lucky and you know hope you catch a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.220 
get lucky and you know hope you catch a
gap<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.599> them

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
gap in them

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.030 
gap in them
all<00:02:22.099> right<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:23.840> want<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.170> make<00:02:24.799> sure

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
all right you really want to make sure

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.610 
all right you really want to make sure
that<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.370> time<00:02:25.670> where<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.360> actually<00:02:27.290> hit<00:02:27.470> it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
that you time where you actually hit it

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.500 
that you time where you actually hit it
at<00:02:27.739> with<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> ball<00:02:28.190> chain<00:02:28.549> because<00:02:29.239> if<00:02:29.390> you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
at with the ball chain because if you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.210 
at with the ball chain because if you
swing<00:02:29.810> while<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:30.410> like<00:02:30.560> really<00:02:30.860> far<00:02:31.069> away

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
swing while it's like really far away

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.800 
swing while it's like really far away
from<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.700> especially<00:02:31.819> once<00:02:32.299> it<00:02:32.390> gets<00:02:32.540> smaller

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
from you especially once it gets smaller

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.270 
from you especially once it gets smaller
you'll<00:02:33.049> just<00:02:33.230> miss<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.799> leave<00:02:33.920> yourself

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
you'll just miss and leave yourself

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.860 
you'll just miss and leave yourself
pretty<00:02:34.519> much<00:02:34.640> wide<00:02:34.879> open<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.629> get<00:02:35.780> hit<00:02:35.989> so

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
pretty much wide open to get hit so

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.819 
pretty much wide open to get hit so
that's<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.019> first<00:02:39.260> form<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:44.359> she<00:02:45.319> gets<00:02:45.680> all

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
that's the first form and she gets all

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.870 
that's the first form and she gets all

can get two if you're lucky which I

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680 
can get two if you're lucky which I
actually<00:03:09.829> was<00:03:10.160> there<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:11.120> gonna<00:03:11.209> go<00:03:11.419> all

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
actually was there it's gonna go all

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.360 
actually was there it's gonna go all
around<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.019> in<00:03:12.139> a<00:03:12.200> circle<00:03:12.620> then<00:03:12.859> go<00:03:13.160> through

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
around you in a circle then go through

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.069 
around you in a circle then go through
the<00:03:13.489> gap<00:03:13.639> you<00:03:13.700> created<00:03:14.299> by<00:03:14.389> this<00:03:14.450> drawing<00:03:14.840> one

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
the gap you created by this drawing one

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.199 
the gap you created by this drawing one
if<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.130> don't<00:03:16.310> destroy<00:03:16.459> one<00:03:16.849> you're<00:03:17.030> pretty

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
if you don't destroy one you're pretty

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.879 
if you don't destroy one you're pretty
much<00:03:17.329> boxed<00:03:17.810> in<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.169> you're<00:03:18.319> basically

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
much boxed in and you're basically

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.789 
much boxed in and you're basically
forced<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.489> take<00:03:19.639> a<00:03:19.669> hit<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:21.019> that's<00:03:21.530> really

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
forced to take a hit so that's really

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.490 
forced to take a hit so that's really
just<00:03:22.099> how<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.280> deal<00:03:22.519> with<00:03:22.549> this<00:03:22.819> boss<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:24.319> can

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
just how you deal with this boss it can

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.110 
just how you deal with this boss it can
be<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> little<00:03:24.980> bit<00:03:25.099> tricky<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.489> actually<00:03:25.609> turn

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
be a little bit tricky to actually turn

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.180 
be a little bit tricky to actually turn
around

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
around

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.460 
around
and<00:03:27.280> hit<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.000> last<00:03:28.180> one<00:03:28.390> with<00:03:29.050> your<00:03:29.230> ball<00:03:29.440> and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and hit the last one with your ball and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.430 
and hit the last one with your ball and
chain<00:03:30.300> because<00:03:31.300> you<00:03:31.510> know<00:03:31.600> like<00:03:31.900> when<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.200> saw

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
chain because you know like when you saw

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.870 
chain because you know like when you saw
when<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.680> did<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.010> first<00:03:33.190> time<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.460> didn't<00:03:33.760> even

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
when I did the first time I didn't even

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.880 
when I did the first time I didn't even
turn<00:03:34.090> around<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.360> look<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:34.780> hit<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.530> and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
turn around to look I just hit back and

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.200 
turn around to look I just hit back and
then<00:03:36.010> hit<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.250> ball<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.520> chain<00:03:36.550> but<00:03:36.880> you

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
then hit the ball and chain but you

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.280 
then hit the ball and chain but you
pretty<00:03:37.390> much<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:37.540> have<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.810> hope<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.170> get

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
pretty much just have to hope you get

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.830 
pretty much just have to hope you get
lucky<00:03:41.460> there<00:03:42.460> we<00:03:42.520> go<00:03:42.700> got<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.240> one<00:03:43.360> pretty

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
lucky there we go got that one pretty

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.150 
lucky there we go got that one pretty
much<00:03:43.990> all<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.260> really<00:03:44.410> need<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.680> hit<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:44.920> one

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
much all you really need to hit this one

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.310 
much all you really need to hit this one
you<00:03:45.310> can<00:03:45.460> see<00:03:45.640> in<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.850> reflection<00:03:46.270> where<00:03:47.170> the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
you can see in the reflection where the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.250 
you can see in the reflection where the
gap<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.530> it's<00:03:48.220> over<00:03:48.340> here<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:48.790> time<00:03:49.170> then<00:03:50.170> we

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
gap is it's over here this time then we

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.240 
gap is it's over here this time then we
just<00:03:50.410> hit<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.710> main<00:03:50.890> thing<00:03:51.160> with

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
just hit the main thing with

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.090 
just hit the main thing with
ball-and-chain<00:03:51.520> one<00:03:52.000> more<00:03:52.150> time<00:03:52.710> after<00:03:53.710> this

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
ball-and-chain one more time after this

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.950 
ball-and-chain one more time after this
one<00:03:54.730> more<00:03:54.880> time<00:03:55.030> after<00:03:55.330> this<00:03:55.450> deployment<00:03:57.960> and

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
one more time after this deployment and

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.840 
one more time after this deployment and

pretty<00:04:03.220> cool<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:04.570> got<00:04:04.660> like<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> hint<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.260> an

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
pretty cool it's got like a hint of an

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.110 
pretty cool it's got like a hint of an
organ<00:04:05.830> in<00:04:06.070> it

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120

how<00:04:10.629> cool<00:04:10.840> actually<00:04:11.200> didn't<00:04:11.379> get<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.620> that

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
how cool actually didn't get to that

time<00:04:13.650> all<00:04:14.650> right<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.860> gap<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.159> over<00:04:15.400> here<00:04:15.670> so

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
time all right the gap is over here so

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.460

let's<00:04:16.180> make<00:04:16.329> our<00:04:16.419> way<00:04:16.479> through<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:17.139> just<00:04:17.169> one

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
let's make our way through and just one

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.009 
let's make our way through and just one
more<00:04:17.620> hit<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:17.859> take<00:04:18.130> care<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.989> I

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
more hit and take care of this so I

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.719

managed<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.470> finish<00:04:20.799> both<00:04:21.040> phases<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.609> this

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
managed to finish both phases of this

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.730

she's a fun character so thankfully
she's<00:04:38.629> just<00:04:38.900> laying<00:04:39.139> there<00:04:39.440> we<00:04:39.590> didn't

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
she's just laying there we didn't

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.499 
she's just laying there we didn't
actually<00:04:39.979> cause<00:04:40.370> any<00:04:40.610> permanent<00:04:40.849> damage

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
actually cause any permanent damage

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.790 
actually cause any permanent damage
and<00:04:41.599> now<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.229> mirror<00:04:42.560> shard<00:04:43.210> makes<00:04:44.210> itself

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
and now the mirror shard makes itself

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.600 
and now the mirror shard makes itself
apparent<00:04:45.800> here<00:04:46.569> makes<00:04:47.569> itself<00:04:47.960> apparent<00:04:48.610> that

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
apparent here makes itself apparent that

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.760 
apparent here makes itself apparent that
whatever<00:04:50.000> we<00:04:50.659> can<00:04:50.810> see<00:04:51.050> it<00:04:51.199> now<00:04:51.349> it's<00:04:51.590> right

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
whatever we can see it now it's right

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.719 
whatever we can see it now it's right
there<00:04:52.009> so<00:04:52.430> we<00:04:52.520> get<00:04:52.699> it<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:54.250> well<00:04:55.250> we<00:04:55.430> have<00:04:55.550> two

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
there so we get it and well we have two

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.100 
there so we get it and well we have two
mirrors<00:04:55.909> charts<00:04:56.300> now<00:04:56.449> because<00:04:56.840> we<00:04:56.960> already

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
mirrors charts now because we already

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.659 
mirrors charts now because we already
had<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.590> first<00:04:57.620> one<00:04:57.889> that<00:04:58.129> was<00:04:58.250> there<00:04:58.490> so

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
had the first one that was there so

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.210 
had the first one that was there so
that's<00:04:59.180> why<00:04:59.300> we<00:04:59.449> have<00:04:59.569> to<00:04:59.750> or<00:04:59.990> not<00:05:00.110> just<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.620> so

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
that's why we have to or not just one so

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:08.080 
that's why we have to or not just one so
two<00:05:01.310> more<00:05:01.550> left<00:05:06.310> still<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.340> feel<00:05:07.580> bad<00:05:07.789> about<00:05:07.909> the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
two more left still I feel bad about the

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.149 
two more left still I feel bad about the
way<00:05:08.120> we<00:05:08.330> treated<00:05:08.569> that<00:05:08.690> girl<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:09.860> think<00:05:10.009> the

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
way we treated that girl to think the

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:11.379 
way we treated that girl to think the
mirror<00:05:10.370> of<00:05:10.430> Twilight<00:05:10.580> has<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.120> power<00:05:11.300> to

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
mirror of Twilight has the power to

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.020 
mirror of Twilight has the power to
change<00:05:11.719> people<00:05:12.050> like<00:05:12.229> that<00:05:12.409> this<00:05:13.400> world<00:05:13.669> all
