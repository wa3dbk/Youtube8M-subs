collect<00:00:20.750> in<00:00:21.050> the<00:00:21.170> desert<00:00:22.420> the<00:00:23.420> desert<00:00:23.570> it's

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
collect in the desert the desert it's

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.170 
collect in the desert the desert it's
quite<00:00:24.110> relaxing<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.920> be<00:00:25.100> in<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:25.520> to<00:00:25.640> be<00:00:25.880> part

quite relaxing to be in and to be part

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.310 
quite relaxing to be in and to be part
of<00:00:26.530> because<00:00:27.530> it's<00:00:27.740> very<00:00:28.130> quiet<00:00:28.520> environment

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
of because it's very quiet environment

the<00:00:30.320> desert<00:00:30.530> doesn't<00:00:30.770> have<00:00:31.010> chaos<00:00:31.750> it's<00:00:32.750> a

the desert doesn't have chaos it's a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.660 
the desert doesn't have chaos it's a
very<00:00:33.079> still<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.530> environment<00:00:34.340> which<00:00:34.460> I<00:00:34.610> do

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
very still and environment which I do

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.700 
very still and environment which I do
like<00:00:35.059> I<00:00:35.860> only<00:00:36.860> collect<00:00:37.160> with<00:00:37.400> its<00:00:37.610> long<00:00:38.120> dead

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
like I only collect with its long dead

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.060 
like I only collect with its long dead
it's<00:00:39.710> actually<00:00:40.040> quite<00:00:40.130> difficult<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:40.730> find

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070

the wood from the desert is very dense

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.260 
the wood from the desert is very dense

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
because to survive in the climate it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.590 
because to survive in the climate it
grows<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:47.690> fibrous<00:00:48.320> is<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:48.650> intense<00:00:49.600> nice

really boring timeless design is often
the<00:01:06.079> simplest<00:01:06.409> design<00:01:06.890> where<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.520> form

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
the simplest design where the form

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.200 
the simplest design where the form
follows<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.420> function<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:09.880> tried<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.909> make

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210

and<00:01:24.319> elements<00:01:24.859> that<00:01:24.950> are<00:01:25.009> needed<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:26.289> me<00:01:27.289> I

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
and elements that are needed to me I

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.279 
and elements that are needed to me I
find<00:01:27.829> good<00:01:28.100> design<00:01:28.399> often<00:01:28.969> in<00:01:29.240> touch<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.079> feel

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
find good design often in touch and feel

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.609 
find good design often in touch and feel
in<00:01:30.499> my<00:01:30.619> fingers<00:01:31.840> because<00:01:32.840> person<00:01:33.529> was

in my fingers because person was
