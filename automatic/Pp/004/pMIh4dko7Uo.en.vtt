00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.449
 maximum quality set to 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.970
 Basically, on such a tablet, sin plays 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.510
 on some other because it's worth this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.160
 a lot of money and so he 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.680
 should show mega cool result 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.680
 and I hope that it will be so 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.899
 add a little sound look at 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.890
 if the brakes are not brakes and all 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.890
 rest 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:59.430
 Now let's get some nitro to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.430
 there further get ahead 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.820
 it is good that he avoided opponents I 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 not an opponent, but rather a car otlichnenko 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.910
 excellent excellent student than the palace I 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.030
 I wore all of them and now strive 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.680
 forward though there will try to catch me up 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.090

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.619
 on street so 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.460
 don't let anyone go round playing 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.759

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.210
