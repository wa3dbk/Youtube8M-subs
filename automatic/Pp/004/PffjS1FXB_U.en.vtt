of<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:57.000> fall<00:00:57.180> down<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:57.960> one

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
of it will fall down there will be one

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.660 
of it will fall down there will be one
remaining<00:00:58.530> block<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> bottom<00:00:59.370> because<00:00:59.579> you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
remaining block and bottom because you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
remaining block and bottom because you
did<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.879> chop<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> very<00:01:00.570> bottom<00:01:00.899> so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
did not chop it from the very bottom so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
did not chop it from the very bottom so
you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.980> take<00:01:02.100> down<00:01:02.250> some<00:01:02.550> pretty<00:01:02.789> big<00:01:03.000> trees

you shouldn't have any mods in here or
any<00:04:21.900> other<00:04:22.169> files<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:22.950> could<00:04:23.159> go<00:04:23.250> ahead
