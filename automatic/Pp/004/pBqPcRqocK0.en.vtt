00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:04.130
 I did it on TV today. 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.640
 is an exclusive interview with the precedent of Corintians and also 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.759
 references 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.659
 it is evident how it is to run a club the size of the corinthians presidency 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.560
 It's a dream I had as a boy to pleasure. 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470
 the cheer that less work give 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.210
 by the contract you helped most 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.009
 some transits are externally the club internally in the club 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 that the city program 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.450
 seven of the last decades each one owns the piece 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.269
 So break it down as we break it's a good pain. 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.339
 but unfortunately it was necessary to look 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.300
 How did you join the club? 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.890
 let's go inside your science done in the last 4 5 years right? 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.630
 and with 17 points the Italian for being attended 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.660
 the most political part of the club if you monitor singers help in categories 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.850
 help me 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.250
 in Olympic sports 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.930
 and I was faithful in politics 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.540
 and I ended up taking 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.220
 director of the base 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.200
 general manager of customer base by football stress testing director of 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.170
 soccer 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.180
 and then 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.600
 this is the last case you can have at the club. 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.540
 and today what corinhtians means to you 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.310
 not today not collectively what was 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.830
 a reason to live also the corinthians is a passion 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.440
 uncontrollable 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.050
 here we compare even with the family what is a crime is more 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.150
 unfortunately it is this passion is not only my view of all Corinthians 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.300
 I think it has neither more nor less and we are the ones we follow 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.460
 He really cared that what 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.630
 good and bad 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.220
 already had the paulista bad actions of 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.330
 the car seems to be the most inter 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.270
 while the woman leaves a little aside but charging 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.960
 there is no change then 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.420
 in that final said 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.790
 who embraces the antecedent club does not address their unprecedented problem 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.380
 To tell you the truth, it could be a bit more current - a little more current year 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.370
 sad 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.840
 bit more hurt and disappointed more 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.060
 Try to make is finishing a date at the end of the year can do the best to 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.220
 we all corintian 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.110
 what was his greatest achievement as a warm-club precedent over whose 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.140
 status that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.019
 I was one of those who helped to make the status committee 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.969
 doctor of ozone of the commission all rigor nor the personnel all side 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.449
 county 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.859
 reinforcement of the club what I like to everything that has no election that is the most 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.889
 of Brazilian football 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.189
 that there is no more 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.229
 indicated in elections 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.629
 then there is counselor in tce milk peluso quoted this I think it was a 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.519
 good relationship I did and a frustration 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.879
 the construction was the route soon to the team 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.389
 in the seven games photo ap apitaço in the division 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.449
 maybe famous of the river did not lose son neymar 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.889
 mess up hands so I guess it's a pain I had in my life and how 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.889
 The precedent feels a moment that you will never forget 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.059
 the streets that would be a posthumous record requested curitibana 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.309
 a sad one a happier disappointed 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.689
 I think all purchasing managers in 2020 only whom would you like 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.219
 see play at the wheel 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.959
 I 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.589
 I think I film achievement for me weight and look was ronaldo I think 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.219
 that is one thing and dreamed 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.809
 for any human being on the face of the earth 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.689
 I do not play 2 years and 5 months in Corinthians 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.780
 obviously he was not 20 but he did his role very well 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.619
 that was transposed combined with me and it was fulfilled 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.679
 I think it's an organization I did with the new port player 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.189
 anyone who comes can come in this fight and union 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.969
 which most of them did not already know 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:29.029
 look I died dubious is very debatable each one has his idol right? 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.839
 so I guess as a player who went through the works was fabiano 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:33.899
 ronaldo 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:35.349
 Socrates 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.189
 now my idol grandson 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.849
 now a series for the mount period 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.489
 with a punch from another 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.760
 I think the referee each one has his idol 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.280
 I think every player has political importance of the musp plus others less 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:52.180
 but my idol is the grandson now let's talk a little 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.240
 besides the Brazilian championship is to be champion this year but if the occurrences 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.870
 have to improve so he takes the contagious title already s soccer is 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.849
 difficult against Brazil and we may have more difficult the harder 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:03.469
 of the world 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.659
 what you can not is lose the focus try constantly connected only that will have to 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.029
 winning games will have bruises cards 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.549
 I've seen a lot of things going on because he's going with the title fight with 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.439
 Flemish, and do you miss the menezes? 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.579
 at Saturday lunch I think everyone who sees with the best 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.779
 seventy félix 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.139
 I think he was an important politician and it was very important for him. 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.620
 he has another phase I hope he is happy but the corintians 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.800
 because these soldiers the fans of his 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.040
 skill that worked well for the club and the professionals go wrapped in vain 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.039
 and come back 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.240
