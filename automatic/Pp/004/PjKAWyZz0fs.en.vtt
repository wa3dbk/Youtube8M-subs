 and you have to pass kids there are 19 holes 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.060
 I bring a videotutorial of how 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.510
 download and install devil 2 those from 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.610
 destruction for good pc for the only thing 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.070
 what is 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.760
 and play online we can also play 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.730
 on-line 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.680
 I'll explain at the end of the good tutorial 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.140
 first we come to google and we put 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.380
 bliss boy game we give the first one that 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.380
 comes out 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.300
 good is the box the page this one takes a 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.280
 little in charge because it's loaded with 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 many elements and it takes a bit 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.930
 well we have to give him role-playing 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.930
 they have not gone to publicity of the drawers 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.670
 and hell here was in the second 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.260
 which we hope will load 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.960
 with advertising 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.039
 well here we already have talk of oslo 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.070
 here we have some images if not 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.000
 you know very well what is something then here 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.000
 what do you have that is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.900
 It's an old game and I do not know if it 's from 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.299
 2001 over there we go is quite old and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.770
 for your time it will be pretty good for 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.320
 download it we must here where it puts 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.119
 download and here we have the kinematics 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.590
 I recommend that you download 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.140
 also because the cinematic ones by 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.759
 defect are in English and good 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.300
 downloading this we have them in 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.510
 Spanish 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.659
 Well, we have been there to download the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.049
 advertising with everything 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.469
 we give it and well here, many people 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:03.509

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.069
 and they put us please wait two 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.689

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.180
 and you see and it brings us to 46 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.340
 Well this is where we should stay and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.069
 download we close public

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.110
 that is extension but I doubt it very much 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.180

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.609

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.950
 we give it to you later and with the cinematics 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:47.069
 Exactly the same, I have downloaded it 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.189
 here we would have the executable of the 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.159
 game and here the cinematics good 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.690
 we would start by executing the run 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:59.000
 setup of the devil 2 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.210
 and we installed it 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.160
 I have installed here and now for 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.550
 kinematics we have to open the file 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.950
 rar 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.420
 and these two files we copy to the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.420
 folder where devil 2 has been installed 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.319
 here I have to because I have here like this 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.410
 how good this has no more 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.290
 good now 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.150
 already with this it should be 100% installed 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.210
 now for the theme of playing online 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.660
 we have to download in the machi 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.910
 aviation arts where to download it we are going to 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.010
 to play 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.450
 I have 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.200
 the history 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.200
 yes no 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.930
 in a meeting 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.790
 I find it good, well, good, good, 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.760
 way 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.969
 we put in google to march and here what 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.969
 we have 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.640
 2.10 374 and this page 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.180
 we give you there in the corner to download 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.180
 the latest version 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.920
 once downloaded without downloads 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.280
 same where is the setup of the march 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.460
 in this one 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.690
 here the march we execute and what 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.600
 we install and well we have this 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.830
 and good and here once these if not 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.990
 you know how to use a male what you have to 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.050
 to do is create a network or join some 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.039
 that has created a friend of yours 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.509
 and once the network is done and all 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.300
 the people you are going to play with 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:45.330
 online within this network because I already 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.620
 unique is 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:53.800
 Sorry , you can only go to the game 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.360
 and put the ip address if you are the 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.150
 host or exit above your 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.639
 name or if the host is not 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:06.180
 you then there is next to the name of the 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:09.750
 host is the one of that is the ip 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.539
 and we're going to have a good time 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.710
 here in dialogues we have to give 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.350
 Multiplayer options tcp / ip match 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.520
 and now if we are the host as I have already 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.340
 said before we're going to direct 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.370
 matches and we've already selected the character 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.670
 and we enter and select the character 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.420
 and we accept it and that's it 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.880
 If we are and are invited, we have to 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.030
 give a game and here we have to put 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.720
 the ip address of the network host 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.700
 of amac if we look at the ip of a march and 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.530
 of course do not go to look at the ip of your 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.340
 internet or something does not have to be the ip 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.919
 from a machi 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.529
 and it is already done once because 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.919
 we can play online 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:56.419
 It's not very easy so I do not expect anything 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.159
 you liked the tutorial and if you have 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.759
 Any doubt you ask me in the 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.859
 comments 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.859
 like until the next kids
