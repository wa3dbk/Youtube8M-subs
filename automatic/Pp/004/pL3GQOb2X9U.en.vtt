00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.460 
now of course most forward is going to

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.230 
now of course most forward is going to
be<00:00:09.480> pitch<00:00:10.480> down<00:00:10.780> or<00:00:11.050> dive<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.759> elevators

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
be pitch down or dive so the elevators

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.880 
be pitch down or dive so the elevators
will<00:00:13.450> do<00:00:13.870> that<00:00:14.190> most<00:00:15.190> back<00:00:16.710> will<00:00:17.710> be<00:00:17.860> the

prefer<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.770> do<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.750> hold<00:02:38.750> down<00:02:38.960> my<00:02:38.990> e<00:02:39.170> key

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
prefer to do it is I hold down my e key

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.010 
prefer to do it is I hold down my e key
which<00:02:40.250> I've<00:02:40.430> configured<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.940> disengage<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
which I've configured to disengage the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.920 
which I've configured to disengage the
mouse<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:43.280> now<00:02:43.460> I<00:02:43.490> can<00:02:43.940> move<00:02:44.060> my<00:02:44.360> mouse<00:02:44.900> my

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
mouse so now I can move my mouse my

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.080 
mouse so now I can move my mouse my
mouse<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.740> pull<00:02:45.920> around<00:02:46.010> as<00:02:46.490> much<00:02:46.610> as<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.820> want

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
mouse to pull around as much as I want

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.420 
mouse to pull around as much as I want
and<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.680> it's<00:02:48.680> as<00:02:48.890> though<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.190> joists<00:02:49.400> that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
and it it's as though the joists that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.240 
and it it's as though the joists that
stick<00:02:50.120> were<00:02:50.270> disconnected<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.110> then<00:02:51.830> hold<00:02:52.160> it

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
stick were disconnected and then hold it

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.010 
stick were disconnected and then hold it
while<00:02:52.430> still<00:02:52.700> holding<00:02:52.850> down<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.300> e<00:02:53.330> key<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.870> hit

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
while still holding down the e key I hit

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.130 
while still holding down the e key I hit
my<00:02:54.170> W<00:02:54.500> key<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.340> mouse<00:02:55.610> look<00:02:55.820> without

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
my W key and now I mouse look without

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.320 
my W key and now I mouse look without
flying<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.320> plane<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.890> could<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:59.060> course

this<00:02:59.570> is<00:02:59.750> what<00:03:00.650> I'll<00:03:00.740> be<00:03:00.890> doing<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.190> flight<00:03:01.400> is

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
this is what I'll be doing in flight is

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.430 
this is what I'll be doing in flight is
all<00:03:01.730> fly<00:03:02.210> in<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.360> straight<00:03:02.570> line<00:03:02.600> or<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.080> gentle

to<00:03:07.310> know<00:03:07.400> where<00:03:07.610> I'm<00:03:07.730> going<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.240> plane<00:03:08.450> is

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
to know where I'm going the plane is

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.050 
to know where I'm going the plane is
under<00:03:09.110> control<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.710> I<00:03:10.430> do<00:03:10.490> a<00:03:10.610> quick<00:03:10.880> mouse

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
under control and I do a quick mouse

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.030 
under control and I do a quick mouse
look<00:03:11.300> around<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.900> then<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.410> hit<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.590> W<00:03:12.860> key

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
look around and then I hit the W key

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.100 
look around and then I hit the W key
back<00:03:13.250> again<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:15.070> re-engage<00:03:16.070> my<00:03:16.460> controls<00:03:17.210> so

back again to re-engage my controls so
now<00:03:18.260> let's<00:03:18.470> take<00:03:18.710> off<00:03:18.950> engines<00:03:19.910> running<00:03:20.120> I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
now let's take off engines running I

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.150 
now let's take off engines running I
have<00:03:21.440> my<00:03:21.940> throttle

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
have my throttle

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.210 
have my throttle

now<00:05:12.330> let's<00:05:12.599> try<00:05:12.809> a<00:05:12.900> loop<00:05:13.139> just<00:05:13.169> for<00:05:13.620> fun

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
now let's try a loop just for fun

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.469 
now let's try a loop just for fun
here<00:05:16.249> we<00:05:16.339> go

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479

back<00:05:21.080> of<00:05:21.289> course

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.900 

that's<00:05:26.680> not<00:05:26.889> a<00:05:26.919> loop<00:05:27.129> that's

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.140 

zoom<00:05:33.510> out

zoom out
that's<00:05:35.720> where<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.050> find<00:05:36.260> where<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.740> buddies
