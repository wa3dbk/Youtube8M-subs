00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.640 

so<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.710> Mako<00:00:13.710> 620<00:00:14.610> well<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.450> an<00:00:16.350> ADK

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
so this is the Mako 620 well as an ADK

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.000 
so this is the Mako 620 well as an ADK
import<00:00:17.990> so<00:00:19.820> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:20.970> see<00:00:21.890> you're<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> little

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
import so you can see you're a little

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.630 
import so you can see you're a little
tour<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.580> does<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.710> few<00:00:25.710> minor<00:00:25.980> things

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.590 

see<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.730> has<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.140> stabilized<00:00:31.140> thing

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
see it has this stabilized thing

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.229 
see it has this stabilized thing
everything<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> has<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:35.219> looks<00:00:36.149> like

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
everything it has is that looks like

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.459 
everything it has is that looks like
okay<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.410> think<00:00:37.620> that's<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.340> catching<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:41.420> rad

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
okay I think that's for catching the rad

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.690 
okay I think that's for catching the rad
lower<00:00:43.469> flow<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> side<00:00:49.200> here

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
lower flow you see on the side here

00:00:49.700 --> 00:01:01.369 
lower flow you see on the side here
kicker<00:00:52.789> gas<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:58.520> yeah<00:00:59.520> about<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.660> well

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
kicker gas so the yeah about this well

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.020 
kicker gas so the yeah about this well
I'm<00:01:01.500> gonna<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.859> doing<00:01:02.190> though<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.850> evening

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I'm gonna be doing though is to evening

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.729 
I'm gonna be doing though is to evening
over<00:01:03.480> these<00:01:03.629> graphics<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.290> gonna<00:01:04.409> take<00:01:04.559> off

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
over these graphics I'm gonna take off

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.020 
over these graphics I'm gonna take off
these<00:01:04.920> graphics<00:01:05.369> here

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
these graphics here

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.350 
these graphics here
TK<00:01:06.869> graphics<00:01:07.320> they're<00:01:07.560> gonna<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.799> gone<00:01:08.360> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
TK graphics they're gonna be gone this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.740 
TK graphics they're gonna be gone this
seat<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:10.200> gonna<00:01:10.350> change<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> seat

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
seat I'm gonna change it to that seat

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
seat I'm gonna change it to that seat
I'm<00:01:12.750> probably<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.110> different<00:01:13.350> color<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.650> this

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I'm probably a different color for this

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.550 
I'm probably a different color for this
one<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.159> basically<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> graphics<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
one this is basically the graphics and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.330 
one this is basically the graphics and
there's<00:01:19.560> custom<00:01:19.950> graphics<00:01:23.240> yeah<00:01:24.530> that's<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
there's custom graphics yeah that's this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.499 
there's custom graphics yeah that's this
bike<00:01:26.610> over<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.119> what's<00:01:27.299> actually

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
bike over here is what's actually

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.929 
bike over here is what's actually
supposed<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.470> look<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:29.400> opposed<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> I

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
supposed to look like as opposed to I

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.170 
supposed to look like as opposed to I
just<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.170> picked<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.280> off<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.939> check

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
just like so I picked this off so check

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.440 
just like so I picked this off so check
it<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.280> that's<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.549> spark<00:01:35.939> arrestor

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
it out and that's not a spark arrestor

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.710 
it out and that's not a spark arrestor
so<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:40.460> need<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> put<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> spark<00:01:42.060> arrestor<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
so I need to put a spark arrestor on it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.170 
so I need to put a spark arrestor on it
and<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.380> want<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> check<00:01:43.799> out<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.250> ignition

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and I want to check out the ignition

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.260 
and I want to check out the ignition
let's<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> deal<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.270> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
let's see what the deal is with that I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.090 
let's see what the deal is with that I
do<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:49.939> brand<00:01:50.939> new

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
do have brand new

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.080 
do have brand new
this<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.400> pretty<00:01:53.610> fun<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.260> for<00:01:55.470> CR<00:01:55.830> 500

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:09.550 

essentially<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.150> same<00:02:00.300> thing<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.440> there

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
essentially the same thing it was there

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:19.070 
essentially the same thing it was there
now<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> ignition<00:02:11.400> show<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:19.050> I

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
now for the ignition show you that so I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530 
now for the ignition show you that so I
caught<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.620> see<00:02:20.310> what<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.210> deal<00:02:21.360> with

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
caught up see what was the deal with

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.110 
caught up see what was the deal with
this<00:02:21.630> thing<00:02:21.980> as<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.100> can<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.640> PBL

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
this thing as you can see it it's PBL

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.210 
this thing as you can see it it's PBL
and<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:25.350> says<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> 10<00:02:26.820> 67<00:02:28.010> mm

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
and it says it is a 10 67 mm

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.130 
and it says it is a 10 67 mm
now<00:02:29.400> 1067<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.120> special<00:02:33.660> application

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
now 1067 it's a special application

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.370 
now 1067 it's a special application
apparently<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.730> means<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.420> requires<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.930> Zabel

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
apparently it means it requires a Zabel

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.680 
apparently it means it requires a Zabel
CDI<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.310> special<00:02:40.430> coil<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.330> regular

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
CDI and a special coil not the regular

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.520 
CDI and a special coil not the regular
coil<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.980> actually<00:02:44.459> only<00:02:44.640> 40<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.530> 50

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
coil and this is actually only 40 to 50

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.640 
coil and this is actually only 40 to 50
windings<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:48.150> not<00:02:48.390> 5000<00:02:49.230> which<00:02:49.470> is

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
windings it's not 5000 which is

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.830 
windings it's not 5000 which is
typically<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> bikes<00:02:51.450> which<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.720> what<00:02:51.810> I

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
typically on the bikes which is what I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.960 
typically on the bikes which is what I
was<00:02:51.900> surprised<00:02:52.260> about<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:53.840> hopefully<00:02:54.840> it's

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
was surprised about but hopefully it's

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.520 
was surprised about but hopefully it's
we'll<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.180> about<00:02:57.269> starting<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.900> I'll<00:02:58.350> show

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
we'll see about starting it I'll show

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.170 
we'll see about starting it I'll show
you<00:02:58.620> something<00:02:58.800> else<00:02:58.950> over<00:02:59.160> here<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.150> I

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
you something else over here so I

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.180 
you something else over here so I
actually<00:03:00.360> do<00:03:00.690> have<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:04.320> is<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:07.190> 1097

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
actually do have this here is a 1097

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.759 
actually do have this here is a 1097
which<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.610> 5000<00:03:09.269> windings<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.380> stator

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
which is 5000 windings and this stator

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.240 
which is 5000 windings and this stator
is<00:03:11.100> what<00:03:11.310> goes<00:03:11.550> on<00:03:11.989> say<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.019> may<00:03:13.260> go<00:03:13.410> 500<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.130> at

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
is what goes on say I may go 500 like at

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.520 
is what goes on say I may go 500 like at
99<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.730> up<00:03:15.090> make<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.330> 500<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.739> then<00:03:16.890> here<00:03:17.190> a

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
99 and up make a 500 and then here a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.390 
99 and up make a 500 and then here a
different<00:03:19.530> state<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:19.920> one<00:03:20.040> has<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> fly

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
different state of this one has a fly

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:35.990 
different state of this one has a fly
ball<00:03:20.610> this<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:25.250> MGB<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:35.400> apparently

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
ball this is a MGB so and so apparently

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.390 
ball this is a MGB so and so apparently
the<00:03:36.090> PBL<00:03:36.570> one<00:03:36.810> needs<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.170> different<00:03:37.320> one<00:03:37.650> for

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the PBL one needs a different one for

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.930 
the PBL one needs a different one for
for<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:44.400> anyhow

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.550 

what<00:03:47.940> I'm<00:03:48.000> going<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.180> do<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:51.380> gonna<00:03:52.380> put

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
what I'm going to do here is gonna put

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.430 
what I'm going to do here is gonna put
the<00:03:52.710> exhaust<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.310> everything<00:03:53.580> back<00:03:53.700> on<00:03:54.440> and

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
the exhaust and everything back on and

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.320 
the exhaust and everything back on and
put<00:03:55.740> that<00:03:55.860> back<00:03:56.040> on<00:03:56.220> cuz<00:03:56.460> I'm<00:03:56.550> going<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.820> stay

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
put that back on cuz I'm going to stay

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.810 
put that back on cuz I'm going to stay
there<00:03:57.360> make<00:03:57.690> sure<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.900> was<00:03:57.990> correct<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.670> it

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
there make sure it was correct and it

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.610 
there make sure it was correct and it
seems<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.360> special<00:04:00.750> application<00:04:01.530> I

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
seems like it is special application I

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.990 
seems like it is special application I
had<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:01.770> chicken<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.190> here<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.370> said<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.580> CDI<00:04:02.850> and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
had a chicken to here I said the CDI and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.880 
had a chicken to here I said the CDI and
everything<00:04:03.300> but<00:04:03.450> you're<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.470> thing<00:04:04.740> it's

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
everything but you're a thing it's

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.470 
everything but you're a thing it's
worried<00:04:05.580> about<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.850> bike<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.750> um<00:04:08.330> as<00:04:09.330> you

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
worried about the bike is that um as you

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.880 
worried about the bike is that um as you
can<00:04:09.540> see<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:14.070> is<00:04:14.250> set<00:04:14.490> up<00:04:14.670> differently

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
can see that this is set up differently

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.790 
can see that this is set up differently
it's<00:04:16.890> set<00:04:17.160> up<00:04:17.280> more<00:04:17.489> like<00:04:17.700> my<00:04:17.910> 86<00:04:18.420> so<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.560> top

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
it's set up more like my 86 so the top

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.280 
it's set up more like my 86 so the top
goes<00:04:20.460> into<00:04:20.790> both<00:04:20.940> radiators<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.170> both

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
goes into both radiators and the both

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.270 
goes into both radiators and the both
raters<00:04:22.740> drain<00:04:22.980> down<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.310> here<00:04:24.410> so<00:04:25.410> I'm<00:04:26.100> gonna

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
raters drain down to here so I'm gonna

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.500 
raters drain down to here so I'm gonna
change<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.700> over<00:04:27.060> because<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:27.750> my<00:04:27.870> 86<00:04:29.030> men<00:04:30.030> 86

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
change that over because in my 86 men 86

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.090 
change that over because in my 86 men 86
tends<00:04:30.750> overheat<00:04:31.200> easier<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.650> my<00:04:31.770> other<00:04:31.890> bikes

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
tends overheat easier to my other bikes

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.190 
tends overheat easier to my other bikes
because<00:04:32.310> of<00:04:32.580> that

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
because of that

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.320 
because of that
and<00:04:34.200> in<00:04:34.320> fact<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.590> even<00:04:34.650> got<00:04:34.980> new<00:04:35.580> radiators<00:04:36.240> a

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
and in fact I even got new radiators a

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.050 
and in fact I even got new radiators a
changeover<00:04:36.780> my<00:04:37.020> 86<00:04:37.700> so<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.140> see<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.640> have<00:04:41.640> a

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
changeover my 86 so you can see I have a

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.620 
changeover my 86 so you can see I have a
bunch<00:04:42.390> of<00:04:42.480> radiators<00:04:43.020> here<00:04:44.270> I'm<00:04:45.270> gonna<00:04:45.390> change

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
bunch of radiators here I'm gonna change

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.900 
bunch of radiators here I'm gonna change
you<00:04:45.720> for<00:04:45.840> my<00:04:45.930> 86<00:04:46.730> so<00:04:49.010> for<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.100> new<00:04:50.220> ones<00:04:50.460> what

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
you for my 86 so for the new ones what

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.340 
you for my 86 so for the new ones what
they<00:04:51.030> do<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:53.430> top<00:04:54.000> drains<00:04:54.630> over<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.170> the

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
they do is the top drains over to the

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.800 
they do is the top drains over to the
top<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.700> bottom<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.600> right

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
top of the to the bottom of the right

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.990 
top of the to the bottom of the right
and<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.590> top<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.010> right<00:04:59.190> goes<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.820> top

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
and the top of the right goes to the top

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.120 
and the top of the right goes to the top
the<00:05:00.180> left<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.110> bottom<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.560> left<00:05:01.800> goes

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
the left and the bottom of left goes

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.910 
the left and the bottom of left goes
back<00:05:02.370> down<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.610> here<00:05:02.970> so<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:04.020> cooling<00:05:04.590> goes<00:05:04.740> we

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
back down to here so the cooling goes we

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.340 
back down to here so the cooling goes we
both<00:05:05.100> radiators<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:06.030> it<00:05:06.660> seems<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.320> me

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
both radiators and it seems like to me

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.250 
both radiators and it seems like to me
it<00:05:07.620> that's<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.920> better<00:05:08.250> method<00:05:08.790> so<00:05:09.230> prior<00:05:10.230> to

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
it that's a better method so prior to

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.440 
it that's a better method so prior to
end<00:05:10.530> up<00:05:10.620> changing<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:14.990> also<00:05:15.990> this<00:05:16.140> thing<00:05:16.350> has

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
end up changing that also this thing has

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.660 
end up changing that also this thing has
tons<00:05:18.450> and<00:05:18.870> tons<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.560> compression<00:05:20.190> it's<00:05:20.370> not<00:05:22.670> an

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
tons and tons of compression it's not an

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.700 
tons and tons of compression it's not an
easy<00:05:24.240> bike<00:05:24.540> to<00:05:24.780> kick<00:05:24.930> over<00:05:25.110> even<00:05:25.470> with<00:05:25.560> the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
easy bike to kick over even with the

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.770 
easy bike to kick over even with the
compression<00:05:26.070> release<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:26.730> is<00:05:26.850> not<00:05:27.060> easy<00:05:27.540> to

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
compression release it is not easy to

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.650 
compression release it is not easy to
perfect<00:05:28.880> this<00:05:29.880> is<00:05:30.000> what<00:05:30.180> happened<00:05:30.480> when<00:05:30.570> I

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
perfect this is what happened when I

00:05:30.660 --> 00:06:11.779 
perfect this is what happened when I
first<00:05:30.960> tried<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.350> kick<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.620> over

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.230 

so<00:06:12.789> now<00:06:14.009> yeah<00:06:15.009> I'll<00:06:15.280> be<00:06:15.520> taking<00:06:15.909> off<00:06:16.030> these

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
so now yeah I'll be taking off these

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.680 
so now yeah I'll be taking off these
stickers<00:06:16.509> and<00:06:17.340> putting<00:06:18.340> on<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:19.000> makeup

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
stickers and putting on the makeup

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.930 
stickers and putting on the makeup
stickers<00:06:20.139> that<00:06:20.289> I<00:06:20.380> had<00:06:20.830> made<00:06:21.009> for<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:23.940> not

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
stickers that I had made for it and not

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.820 
stickers that I had made for it and not
right<00:06:25.090> now<00:06:25.240> though<00:06:25.270> I<00:06:25.659> will<00:06:25.870> pipe<00:06:26.139> right<00:06:26.740> now

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
right now though I will pipe right now

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.189 
right now though I will pipe right now
I'll<00:06:26.949> put<00:06:27.130> the<00:06:27.159> exhaust<00:06:27.490> back<00:06:27.669> on<00:06:27.960> stator<00:06:28.960> back

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
I'll put the exhaust back on stator back

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:35.730 
I'll put the exhaust back on stator back
on<00:06:29.440> then<00:06:29.889> see<00:06:30.250> if<00:06:30.370> we<00:06:30.400> can<00:06:34.169> and<00:06:35.169> then<00:06:35.319> I'll<00:06:35.440> see

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
on then see if we can and then I'll see

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.149 
on then see if we can and then I'll see
about<00:06:35.770> starting<00:06:36.460> it

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 
guess the 2000s when I first came out I

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:26.159 
guess the 2000s when I first came out I
said<00:07:24.039> 620<00:07:24.610> on<00:07:24.669> the<00:07:24.759> side<00:07:24.940> there<00:07:25.210> just<00:07:25.990> so<00:07:26.110> you

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.169 
said 620 on the side there just so you

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.080 
said 620 on the side there just so you
see<00:07:26.380> that<00:07:26.560> but<00:07:26.830> I<00:07:27.099> don't<00:07:27.639> think<00:07:27.759> it<00:07:27.880> really

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
see that but I don't think it really

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.809 
see that but I don't think it really
means<00:07:28.300> anything<00:07:28.479> because<00:07:28.930> I<00:07:28.960> think<00:07:29.020> it's<00:07:29.259> 700

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 
means anything because I think it's 700

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:35.129 
means anything because I think it's 700
685<00:07:30.819> also<00:07:31.300> says<00:07:31.509> 620<00:07:32.110> there<00:07:32.490> so<00:07:33.490> I<00:07:33.990> don't<00:07:34.990> think

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:35.139 
685 also says 620 there so I don't think

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.120 
685 also says 620 there so I don't think
that<00:07:35.229> actually<00:07:35.380> means<00:07:36.009> anything

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.130 
that actually means anything

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.860 
that actually means anything
so<00:07:39.130> I'm<00:07:39.279> actually<00:07:39.430> getting<00:07:39.729> a<00:07:41.039> 700<00:07:42.039> so<00:07:42.310> or<00:07:43.240> 685

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:43.870 
so I'm actually getting a 700 so or 685

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.689 
so I'm actually getting a 700 so or 685
so<00:07:44.409> we'll<00:07:44.560> see<00:07:44.740> what<00:07:44.889> it<00:07:44.979> says<00:07:45.190> but<00:07:47.580> so<00:07:48.580> this

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:48.699 
so we'll see what it says but so this

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:53.840 
so we'll see what it says but so this
here<00:07:49.089> is<00:07:49.479> obviously<00:07:49.690> the

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:53.850 

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:59.310 

as<00:07:54.850> I<00:07:55.030> mentioned<00:07:55.330> before<00:07:55.360> the<00:07:55.960> six<00:07:58.020> six<00:07:59.020> twenty

00:07:59.310 --> 00:07:59.320 
as I mentioned before the six six twenty

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.710 
as I mentioned before the six six twenty
so<00:08:00.540> I'm<00:08:01.540> gonna<00:08:01.660> put<00:08:01.900> this<00:08:02.020> exhaust<00:08:02.440> on
