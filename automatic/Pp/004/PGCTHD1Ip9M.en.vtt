I<00:00:21.800> say<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.950> this<00:00:23.070> movie<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.370> basically<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
I say that this movie is basically a

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.310 
I say that this movie is basically a
thriller<00:00:24.870> where<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:25.950> villain<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.370> virus

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270

it's kind of a psychological and
physical<00:00:32.220> thriller<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.480> virus<00:00:33.780> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
physical thriller because the virus is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.720
