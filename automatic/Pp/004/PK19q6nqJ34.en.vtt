00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
here's the thing I actually had another

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.010 
here's the thing I actually had another
two<00:00:29.200> videos<00:00:30.200> at<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.560> 30<00:00:31.250> minute<00:00:31.579> length<00:00:31.880> that<00:00:32.720> I

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
two videos at a 30 minute length that I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.319 
two videos at a 30 minute length that I
could<00:00:33.590> still<00:00:33.920> upload<00:00:34.370> although<00:00:34.820> right<00:00:35.060> now<00:00:35.120> it

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
could still upload although right now it

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.660 
could still upload although right now it
would<00:00:35.480> be<00:00:35.510> out<00:00:35.660> of<00:00:35.690> proportion<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.070> basically

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
would be out of proportion and basically

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.060 
would be out of proportion and basically
those<00:00:38.270> last<00:00:38.780> two<00:00:38.960> episodes<00:00:39.350> just<00:00:39.470> consisted

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
those last two episodes just consisted

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.280 
those last two episodes just consisted
of<00:00:40.990> Deckman<00:00:42.190> Alvaro<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.280> I<00:00:43.670> making<00:00:44.330> our<00:00:44.690> you

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
of Deckman Alvaro and I making our you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.710 
of Deckman Alvaro and I making our you
know<00:00:45.320> last<00:00:46.190> bit<00:00:46.490> of<00:00:46.520> money<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.180> actually<00:00:47.360> maybe

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
know last bit of money to actually maybe

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.580 
know last bit of money to actually maybe
like<00:00:48.020> go<00:00:48.200> into<00:00:48.680> other<00:00:49.010> things<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:51.350> just

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
like go into other things and I just

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.530 
like go into other things and I just
felt<00:00:52.100> like<00:00:52.220> it<00:00:52.490> was<00:00:52.610> kind<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:52.850> unnecessary<00:00:53.120> to

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
felt like it was kind of unnecessary to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.390 
felt like it was kind of unnecessary to
upload<00:00:53.810> that<00:00:55.180> technically<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.270> still<00:00:56.450> could

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
upload that technically I still could

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
upload that technically I still could
but<00:00:58.400> like<00:00:58.490> I<00:00:58.580> said<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:58.880> would<00:00:58.940> kind<00:00:59.150> of<00:00:59.180> be<00:00:59.240> out

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
but like I said it would kind of be out

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.990 
but like I said it would kind of be out
of<00:00:59.450> order<00:00:59.870> all<00:01:00.320> it<00:01:00.560> is<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:00.890> basically<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.820> main

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
of order all it is is basically the main

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.640 
of order all it is is basically the main
point<00:01:02.330> we<00:01:02.510> did<00:01:02.660> a<00:01:02.690> two-hour<00:01:03.080> recording

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
point we did a two-hour recording

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.399 
point we did a two-hour recording
session<00:01:04.040> which<00:01:04.549> showed<00:01:04.939> us<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.750> know<00:01:05.869> doing

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
session which showed us you know doing

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
little methods and you know how to start

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.960 
little methods and you know how to start
out<00:01:09.290> basically<00:01:09.560> from<00:01:10.220> nothing<00:01:10.580> like<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:10.850> you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
out basically from nothing like if you

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.969 
out basically from nothing like if you
have<00:01:11.150> nothing<00:01:11.330> what<00:01:12.109> you<00:01:12.229> can<00:01:12.439> do<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.890> what

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
you can turn it into so that's what that

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:17.230 
you can turn it into so that's what that

to other things I think what we're going
to<00:02:25.629> do<00:02:25.870> first<00:02:26.349> is<00:02:26.709> take<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.700> trip<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.150> ARMA<00:02:28.750> or

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
to do first is take a trip to ARMA or

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.860 
to do first is take a trip to ARMA or
maybe<00:02:29.409> Bandos<00:02:30.239> apparently<00:02:31.239> they<00:02:31.510> said<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
maybe Bandos apparently they said the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.500 
maybe Bandos apparently they said the
arm<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.230> really<00:02:32.500> easy<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:33.190> right<00:02:33.220> now<00:02:33.549> so<00:02:33.790> we

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
arm is really easy to do right now so we

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.670 
arm is really easy to do right now so we
might<00:02:34.690> go<00:02:34.840> over<00:02:34.959> there<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.290> try<00:02:35.379> that<00:02:35.650> out

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.089 
feathers and probably made it really mad
I<00:05:36.760> got<00:05:37.300> some<00:05:37.510> fairly<00:05:37.810> teleport<00:05:38.320> tabs<00:05:38.530> worked

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
I got some fairly teleport tabs worked

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:40.950 
I got some fairly teleport tabs worked
or<00:05:39.220> despatched<00:05:39.550> basic<00:05:40.300> ranging<00:05:40.690> gear<00:05:40.840> and

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
or despatched basic ranging gear and

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.839 
or despatched basic ranging gear and
some<00:05:41.110> potions<00:05:41.560> it's<00:05:41.919> really<00:05:42.250> not<00:05:42.370> too<00:05:42.610> much

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
some potions it's really not too much

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.260 
some potions it's really not too much
but<00:05:43.510> just<00:05:43.780> figured<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.620> uh<00:05:44.650> do<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.430> I<00:05:45.669> was<00:05:46.030> kind

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
but just figured I uh do that I was kind

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.180 
but just figured I uh do that I was kind
of<00:05:46.360> waiting<00:05:46.539> to<00:05:46.810> do<00:05:46.960> this<00:05:47.139> I<00:05:47.409> know<00:05:47.680> it's<00:05:47.919> a<00:05:47.979> big

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
of waiting to do this I know it's a big

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.460 
of waiting to do this I know it's a big
jump<00:05:48.550> from<00:05:48.820> last<00:05:49.120> episode<00:05:49.270> because<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:50.320> was

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
jump from last episode because I was

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.140 
jump from last episode because I was
waiting<00:05:50.919> until<00:05:51.039> those<00:05:51.460> other<00:05:51.699> two<00:05:51.820> episodes

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
waiting until those other two episodes

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.029 
waiting until those other two episodes
would<00:05:52.360> have<00:05:52.479> been<00:05:52.570> posted<00:05:53.020> but<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.590> just<00:05:53.830> felt

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
would have been posted but I just felt

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.339 
would have been posted but I just felt
like<00:05:54.130> it<00:05:54.729> would<00:05:54.909> take<00:05:55.150> too<00:05:55.389> long<00:05:55.419> and<00:05:55.960> it

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
like it would take too long and it

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.200 
like it would take too long and it
really<00:05:56.740> sucks<00:05:57.190> rendering<00:05:57.729> those<00:05:57.909> and

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
really sucks rendering those and

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.060 
really sucks rendering those and
uploading<00:05:58.780> those<00:05:58.930> but<00:05:59.169> it<00:05:59.260> takes<00:05:59.500> probably

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
uploading those but it takes probably

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.040 
uploading those but it takes probably
between<00:06:00.190> like<00:06:00.520> an<00:06:00.639> hour<00:06:00.820> and<00:06:01.090> two<00:06:01.270> for<00:06:01.900> those

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
between like an hour and two for those

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.800 
between like an hour and two for those
which<00:06:02.409> I<00:06:02.710> could<00:06:03.220> do<00:06:03.340> overnight<00:06:03.909> but<00:06:04.419> by<00:06:04.750> the

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
which I could do overnight but by the

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.600 
which I could do overnight but by the
time<00:06:05.020> I<00:06:05.050> think<00:06:05.199> about<00:06:05.590> it<00:06:05.830> I'm<00:06:06.010> already<00:06:06.430> laying
