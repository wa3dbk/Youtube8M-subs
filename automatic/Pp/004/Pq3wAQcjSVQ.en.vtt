00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.639
 the first layer of strawberry that you see 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.389
 super pretty they were after 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.280
 they are going to eat I imagine now we are going 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.410
 to throw peaches we did the same 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.150
 operation 600 and now we go to the height 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.890
 there is no adult raspberry this what 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.869
 flame low pixel 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.869
 the mixture of peach and raspberry 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 good has sugar the grain previously 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.910
 that was only because I'm 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.469
 soaked only we are not with the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.690
 direct fructose with the fruits with 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.000
 NomÃ¡s fruit sugar and is one that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 already in syrup could use it all 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.750
 ways you could use it to see how 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:58.129
 this time the fruit is already quite 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:58.129
 sunny what the sun gives us a mixture 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.280
 if the cookie dog 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.410
 well here we have a layer of formulas 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.570
 then we repeat operation two 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.570
 already there that we have soaked 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.020
 there we have our layer of peaches with 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.550
 the raspberry cream 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.030
 and we are going to make the last layer of 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.030
 cookies 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.620
 that we can put the street is doing 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.620
 the milk mixture 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.900
 good relaxes directions and we put the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.160
 cookies that supposedly are 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.140
 soaked by this time we're going to 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.660
 pour the milk mixture directly 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.340
 condensed with milk and cognac this is 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.750
 reflects this is cooled but not 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.750
 necessarily everything is quite 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.190
 we have more cookies still the bags 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.100
 of champagne so big the bags 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.459
 we are the same they have to be soaked 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.510
 but look 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.510
 with the spoon now yes 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.890
 the cookie mix 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.870
 we try to press a little social 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.710
 pressure to prison people 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.710
 cream cream 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.800
 the idea that we were going to sea 1 on the 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.510
 drink put a spicy then national 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.250
 cookies to put there in the cup 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.650
 they have more cookies is that we're going to give 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.600
 a glass and to which we put the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.030
 cream because we're going to throw the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.590
 blueberries on top of this with cookie 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.750
 milled and down and they milk him 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.890
 condensed today they are but super 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.890
 good for me to cook 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.890
 wonderful 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:39.750
 our parents write pieces because 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:41.620
 if you put it exactly that yes in 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.210
 bits 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.620
 so the house bathes it to go seeing how we 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.620
 this wonderful dessert is staying 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:56.800
 and above is scientifically boyle with 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.540

 It is also made with es with sponge cake 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.859

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.960

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.810
 the other option to not have to do 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.610

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.860

00:04:51.779 --> 00:05:00.659
 get to the whole strawberry the part is 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:05:03.779
 so today it happens to you is that it is not easy 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:09.659
 whole strawberry to see it with the little leaves 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:12.389
 green and cut the cut without 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:16.069
 to reach the end in logic is like 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.069
 I the children for sure 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.879

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.649
 of the water but you're going side the other 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.129
 presentation is the representative voice that 

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:56.779
 the spoon with condensed milk 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:59.249
