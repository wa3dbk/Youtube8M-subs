00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870 
to show you the minor changes in this
one<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.410> opposed<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.980> limited<00:00:29.430> run<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.580> 10

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

one as opposed to the limited run of 10
that<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.060> recently<00:00:30.300> did<00:00:31.129> of<00:00:32.129> course<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> looks

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that I recently did of course it looks

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.369 
that I recently did of course it looks
exactly<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.449> same<00:00:33.539> the<00:00:33.780> parts<00:00:33.989> were<00:00:34.079> machined

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
exactly the same the parts were machined

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.669 
exactly the same the parts were machined
in<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.589> same<00:00:34.769> run<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.969> got<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> same<00:00:36.359> brass

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
in the same run it's got the same brass

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.520 
in the same run it's got the same brass
at<00:00:37.679> attachments<00:00:38.690> just<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> note<00:00:39.960> -<00:00:40.139> these<00:00:40.319> are

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
at attachments just a note - these are

at attachments just a note - these are
just<00:00:41.280> polished<00:00:41.729> brass<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.269> they<00:00:42.389> will<00:00:42.600> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
just polished brass so they will you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.680 
just polished brass so they will you
know<00:00:43.559> weather<00:00:44.190> over<00:00:44.549> time<00:00:44.789> they<00:00:44.999> will<00:00:45.149> with

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
know weather over time they will with

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.539 
know weather over time they will with
the<00:00:45.899> oils<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.440> skin<00:00:46.769> will<00:00:46.949> start<00:00:47.399> to

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
you got your d-ring your your crate bone

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.079 
you got your d-ring your your crate bone
grip<00:00:55.319> there<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.769> what<00:00:56.639> I'm<00:00:56.729> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:56.999> is

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
grip there and what I'm going to do is

I'm<00:00:57.179> going<00:00:57.269> to<00:00:57.329> open<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.839> saber<00:00:58.049> just<00:00:58.319> to

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
I'm going to open up this saber just to

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.069 
I'm going to open up this saber just to
show<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.619> the<00:00:58.949> differences<00:00:59.839> really<00:01:00.839> it's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
show you the differences really it's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.719 
show you the differences really it's
almost<00:01:01.289> identical<00:01:01.529> the<00:01:02.010> only<00:01:02.309> differences

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
almost identical the only differences

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.729 
almost identical the only differences
are<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.179> a<00:01:03.299> new<00:01:03.629> battery<00:01:04.019> pack<00:01:04.290> made<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
D that lights the crystal actually

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.569 
D that lights the crystal actually
pulses<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.749> dim<00:01:31.579> coming

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
pulses you can see it going dim coming

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.940 
pulses you can see it going dim coming
back<00:01:32.789> up<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.899> activate<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:34.710> saber

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
course you've got the off protection

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.920 
course you've got the off protection
gonna<00:01:51.520> do<00:01:51.670> both<00:01:51.820> buttons<00:01:52.119> just<00:01:52.390> turn<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:52.780> off

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
gonna do both buttons just turn it off

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.620 
gonna do both buttons just turn it off
only<00:01:53.170> one<00:01:55.409> let's<00:01:56.409> turn<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.829> off<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.420> what<00:01:58.539> I'm

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
only one let's turn it off so what I'm

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.950 
only one let's turn it off so what I'm
gonna<00:01:58.720> do<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:59.020> I'm<00:01:59.140> gonna<00:02:06.659> calibrate<00:02:07.659> my

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
gonna do is I'm gonna calibrate my

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.930 
gonna do is I'm gonna calibrate my
crystal<00:02:08.860> because<00:02:09.160> it's<00:02:09.369> part<00:02:09.580> number<00:02:09.610> one

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
crystal because it's part number one

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.210 
crystal because it's part number one
when<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.869> go<00:02:11.019> through<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.290> selection<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.950> as

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
when you go through the selection so as

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.350 
when you go through the selection so as
you<00:02:12.340> can<00:02:12.459> see<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:13.260> crystal<00:02:14.260> pulses<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:15.360> in

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
you can see the crystal pulses in in

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.140 
you can see the crystal pulses in in
standby<00:02:16.750> mode<00:02:17.370> I'm<00:02:18.370> gonna<00:02:18.519> activate<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:21.150> it's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
standby mode I'm gonna activate it it's

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.490 
standby mode I'm gonna activate it it's
a<00:02:22.209> really<00:02:22.420> cool<00:02:22.600> effect<00:02:22.690> for<00:02:23.080> calibrate

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
a really cool effect for calibrate

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.100 
a really cool effect for calibrate
because<00:02:24.000> while<00:02:25.000> you're<00:02:25.120> monitoring<00:02:25.600> your

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
because while you're monitoring your

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.100 
because while you're monitoring your
savers<00:02:26.560> innards<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.580> crystals<00:02:27.970> pulsing<00:02:28.750> very

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
savers innards the crystals pulsing very

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:41.100 
savers innards the crystals pulsing very
slowly

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.699 

so<00:02:42.110> anyways<00:02:44.020> just<00:02:45.020> wanted<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.290> show<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
so anyways just wanted to show you the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.640 
so anyways just wanted to show you the
the<00:02:46.160> upgraded<00:02:46.880> features<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.900> particular

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
the upgraded features of this particular

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.410 
the upgraded features of this particular
vein<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.400> like<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.550> said<00:02:49.670> one<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.000> two<00:02:50.270> that's

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
vein but like I said one of two that's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.699 
vein but like I said one of two that's
going<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.690> be<00:02:50.780> going<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:50.990> for<00:02:51.050> auction<00:02:51.200> very

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
going to be going up for auction very

so<00:02:53.060> that's<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.420> new<00:02:53.540> bane<00:02:53.780> saber<00:02:54.110> going<00:02:54.440> up

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
so that's the new bane saber going up

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.180 
so that's the new bane saber going up
for<00:02:54.650> auction

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
for auction

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.900 
for auction
thanks<00:02:55.640> for<00:02:55.760> looking<00:02:55.850> happy<00:02:56.750> bidding
