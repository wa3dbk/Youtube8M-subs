00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.950
 Today I'll show you how to deal with that 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.439
 motto smoker from pro cow one of the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.779
 Absolutely classics I do 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.730
 Spareribs in this case a delicious 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.980
 fleshy saint louis cut with 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.840
 fridge 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.079
 I need a strict spareribs 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.960
 ketchup barbecue sauce and chris lack 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.820
 on 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 after unpacking the ybbs must first 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.399
 once the silver skin on the bottom 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.399
 be removed 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.620
 this skin stays behind too 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.300
 Htc is coming for hours as well 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.020
 no spice and smoker the meat though 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.020
 it leaves the skin 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.960
 next will be the ribs 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.960
 generous with the church kicker 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.620
 this I massage in thoroughly 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.909
 of course from both sides 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.080
 equally then I leave the whole 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.950
 pull through properly 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.950
 was best over 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 when I'm ready to worry 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.560
 I have a suit of chimney briquettes in 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.079
 the coal costs per cow I put one 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.369
 ring rest burned these 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.369
 will later be glowing 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.640
 By this method I have easy 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.610
 a longer burn time total for 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.560
 The smoke will cause some wood later 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.210
 the coals are annealed in the az card 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.700
 I shake them to the others in the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.110
 Crowns I strongly recommend this 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.110
 only with the right glove 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.630
 Next , I fill the water bowl 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.220
 with hot water you have to wait 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.350
 until the ottos pug the desired one 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.420
 temperature has reached in my case 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.420
 here are 120 degrees desired 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.440
 then the richie 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.330
 is reassembled after the atom 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.610
 You can use the rapeseed for five hours 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.130
 either stay put 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.260
 guard or watch the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.720
 Temperature via an external thermometer 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.200
 The leader for this one can through the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.849
 Put practical openings in the smoker 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.110
 After about five hours the webs will be 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.150
 with a claims with 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.069
 I have a mix here 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.069
 barbecue sauce and cherry jam 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.060
 then the rips stay another 45 to 60 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.870
 minutes on the blaze can after 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.870
 repeat as desired 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.049
 when the rips are done then i take 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.860
 she from the cube and judges her 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.860
 accordingly 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.220
 I wish you good appetite now 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.220
