00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello people and welcome to the brisk appearance of the 1 Point 7 Beta 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.020
 that's so 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 the current version is for the 1 point 6 point 6 beta and the next one 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.189
 Update that will follow soon 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.079
 is the 1 seven-hair 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.529
 that from the EHC so far it is not clear when it comes out but it 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.680
 Lotus Travel and though will be 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.460
 comes back from his vacation 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.859
 now is 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.449
 so should center that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.250
 1 7 pictures immediately 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.250
 reads here 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.350
 the phone brings out 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.149
 so 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.560
 and in this video I will be you 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.930
 say two gem 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.080
 this is for 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.810
 Filip shirts 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.830
 will give 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.750
 and that from every place so on here so 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.140
 Well, first of all, it will be hard to take, that is, you can do wool blocks 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 destroy faster 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.659
 and then Kammann 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.600
 also to shear the sheep I think that will not be like that anymore 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.060
 you too here 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.480
 around 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.410
 yes with your fist so that would be able to hit another item 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.670
 that is a bit sad though 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.600
 My strength is becoming more logical 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.420
 I think so 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 OK 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.040
 the net is not funny 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.049
 but so 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.700
 around 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 what's going to happen to the animals will do that 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.340
 Bert Wittke 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.360
 that can be done 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.430
 is there such a tree you build it there 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.900
 who these leaves off 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.380
 and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.259
 So there are these leaves 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.980
 he is both looking for something I was looking for 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.250
 you can stop 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.850
 From these remnants a whole blog remains put together that means you can get them 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.430
 come 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580
 finally would have done 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.580
 One touch eto'o or 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.340
 paul's Boutique Ovations 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.049
 Peshawar AFP epd 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.240
 then there are the pistons 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.049
 These are these 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.209
 Coleman 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.609
 theirs 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.310
 Although you believe that 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.139
 years 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.029
 the Sikhs man 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:28.729
 the force is coupled with Stones three were reservations one white and one 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:29.919
 recoil 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:34.939
 the these pistes are pushing themselves off of a block 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.530
 Bridges that is called by so on two blocks that 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.719
 Block that way 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.709
 the best is in front of the wood panel 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.109
 he will then be pushed away 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.779
 and then there is the man so there are page 1 point three bidders 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.889
 The goal of one can indeed pitfalls 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.639
 and then you sometimes get slain boys and if you look at yourself like that 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:02:59.469
 slopes 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.459
 Tesla 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.769
 which one called that also came 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.859
 Strength occurs 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.989
 then these slopes may be a coated one with this stop 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.119
 / TR 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:14.959
 Blöcker 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.510
 the one 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.699
 So a block 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.079
 are away from this wood surface 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.069
 Taillight Hertha not push 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.939
 So there is such a good video that I will only ever an individual 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.939
 Description pack that he could Daum 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.649
 Well 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.729
 so exactly this year at least normal 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.799
 if you have no hysteria and 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.269
 a jet of water years ago what had a watercourse say so 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.469
 can derive 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.409
 and then test it before even the ladies breaks this waterway then 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.649
 you can 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.439
 the then no more water flows 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.609
 and if you click on the slopes again so with right then 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.920
 Detering together again 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.939
 and the water flows that is you can effects 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.739
 would build or 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.739
 Well, stop something like Basha 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.280
 and these firstly, their blocks can press DEK 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:28.169
 and Mr climbs but there are so many blocks that may be 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.680
 So do not affect it 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.680
 you can not push them away or to yourself Sam 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.659
 that's how I see it 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:37.870
 with these best 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.199
 and that is the obsidian Balch Rock 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.439
 and rest for five 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.490
 music sheet 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.360
 and probably even the power of the tablets 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.879
 good that it is something 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.879
 it was not possible 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:58.720
 Yes 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.720
 well, what else will there be? 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.659
 SMP Server lets future may be already 1 point 7 you 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.349
 Test server lists 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.569
 with the multi player 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.590
 okay that's still not fixed though 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:19.509
 as I said it is 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.389
 give such a list 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.080
 then we can have them 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.999
 go and groups what servers there is of course something 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.430
 stupid if you then 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.969
 if you play with your friends 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.969
 But I want to give the joke normal size 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.249
 the 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:42.849
 just a few like that 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.800
 on this list are 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 So only my Croft Classic server or something 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.879
 the heating plates 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.099
 Turk were power 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.150
 so 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.990
 then the light runs at sunrise and sunset there is no chong off 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.499
 Dec give more that Hayes 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.580
 do not give light 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.580
 his light mistake 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.089
 so 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.479
 yes, and that also means that in daylight 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.839
 around 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:19.359
 other colors could be and at 18 then something 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.259
 Hella but bluish 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:26.949
 goood 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.740
 additional 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.740
 Bollmann with dark ones in the normal pose the boys 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:39.039
 which the studies has published despite at least nothing new 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:40.999
 been 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:42.909
 the contribution 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.909
 look at us 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.969
 Oh, right 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:50.589
 Jörg Haider can be seen 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:52.149
 that's just how it is 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.149
 which is not better 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.279
 possibly there is also still 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.399
 new tree species that is also important 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.469
 Start around 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.889
 here is normal 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.949
 the 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.630
 City Kandern normal Bäumer 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.819
 and then the content will be back 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.889
 I hope the perpetrator still such a sequoia trees 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.770
 If you still feel like Wenders and a big tree, the shop is so 30 Bökko 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.759
 ULZ 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.529
 who knows 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.889
 But it is definitely 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:34.339
 and 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:38.599
 I hope you are as excited as I was on the only seven meters 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.849
 a little 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.809
 insight 

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:47.949
 1 point seven-meter and the next dt I hope you liked it and 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:50.949
 then maybe we'll see each other in a video 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.949
 in the next video of me and not around now 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.270
 a lot of fun and I still 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.099
 Check in
