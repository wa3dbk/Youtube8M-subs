00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
and I'm here to do a deck profile video

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.180 
and I'm here to do a deck profile video
of<00:00:08.900> of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.200> ricotta<00:00:11.090> ricotta<00:00:12.090> electric<00:00:12.780> that

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
of of the ricotta ricotta electric that

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.550 
of of the ricotta ricotta electric that
keep<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.280> mind<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.759> testing<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:16.080> deck<00:00:16.320> I'm

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
keep in mind so testing this deck I'm

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.349 
keep in mind so testing this deck I'm
considered<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.820> deck<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
considered that this deck is going to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.359 
considered that this deck is going to
make<00:00:18.570> any<00:00:18.720> where<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.830> hear<00:00:20.010> something<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
make any where you hear something in the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.150 
make any where you hear something in the
background<00:00:20.430> that's<00:00:20.850> occurred<00:00:21.920> that<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> my

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
background that's occurred that is my

bird he's up being stupid and so yeah I

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.929 
bird he's up being stupid and so yeah I
don't<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.099> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> play

testing this deck I know I know these
two<00:00:33.540> decks<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.410> Garchomp<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> high<00:00:35.430> drag

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
two decks the Garchomp and the high drag

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.389 
two decks the Garchomp and the high drag
on<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:36.420> gonna<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.809> big<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.010> a

on I'm gonna be really big and out of a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.869 
on I'm gonna be really big and out of a
classic<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.850> handle<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.600> them<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.579> let's<00:00:41.579> see

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
this is the Pokemon line as you can see

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.970 
this is the Pokemon line as you can see
some<00:00:48.899> aggression<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:50.270> 28<00:00:51.270> causes

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
some aggression right here 28 causes

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.040 
some aggression right here 28 causes
exas<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.989> your

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
exas just because that's gonna be your

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.830 
exas just because that's gonna be your
main<00:00:55.170> type<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> deck<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.360> what<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
main type of the deck and what if you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.090 
main type of the deck and what if you
don't<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.350> does<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> first

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
don't know what it does for the first

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.880 
don't know what it does for the first
half<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.670> energy<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.329> does<00:01:00.600> nothing<00:01:01.289> but

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
half for one energy it does nothing but

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.410 
half for one energy it does nothing but
its<00:01:02.070> discard<00:01:02.789> tough<00:01:02.969> three<00:01:03.090> card<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> your

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
its discard tough three card to your

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.990 
its discard tough three card to your
deck<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:04.170> yeah<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.549> there's<00:01:05.790> any

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
deck and then yeah and if there's any

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
deck and then yeah and if there's any
energy<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.830> attach<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.310> closet

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
energy you can attach it to a closet

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.870 
energy you can attach it to a closet
it's<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:09.570> cool<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:11.340> want<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> make<00:01:11.670> me

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it's very cool and you want to make me

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.649 
it's very cool and you want to make me
use<00:01:12.030> them<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> sudden<00:01:12.540> attack<00:01:12.780> um<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:14.659> think

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
use them for a sudden attack um I think

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.899 
use them for a sudden attack um I think
I<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> step<00:01:16.619> tak<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.729> um

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
I don't know what the step tak is but um

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.170 
I don't know what the step tak is but um
it<00:01:18.479> does<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> 60<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.850> attach

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it does a 60 you you have to attach

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
it does a 60 you you have to attach
either<00:01:21.420> fire<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:21.869> electric<00:01:22.140> energy<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
either fire or electric energy and you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
either fire or electric energy and you
either<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> start<00:01:24.450> either<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> fire<00:01:25.380> all

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
either to start either all the fire all

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.190 
either to start either all the fire all
the<00:01:25.860> electric<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.520> does<00:01:26.640> 62<00:01:27.509> damage<00:01:27.930> times

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the electric and it does 62 damage times

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.140 
the electric and it does 62 damage times
the<00:01:28.320> number<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.560> energy<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.130> discard<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the number of energy that you discard so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.300 
the number of energy that you discard so
basically<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.689> start<00:01:30.750> three<00:01:31.619> lightning

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
basically you start three lightning

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.219 
basically you start three lightning
energies<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.000> got<00:01:33.180> any<00:01:33.329> XML<00:01:33.840> format<00:01:34.110> I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
energies you not got any XML format I

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.399 
energies you not got any XML format I
believe<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:34.920> where<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:36.500> 603<00:01:37.500> 00

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
believe that's where it is right 603 00

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.630 
believe that's where it is right 603 00
beliefs<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:41.899> no<00:01:42.899> equals<00:01:43.380> 180<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:43.950> uh<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.490> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
beliefs up no equals 180 but uh if you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.840 
beliefs up no equals 180 but uh if you
do<00:01:44.729> another<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.689> ian's<00:01:46.020> um<00:01:46.850> what

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
do another one that's on ian's um what

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.690 
do another one that's on ian's um what
people<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.210> uh<00:01:48.409> next<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.610> these

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
people like uh next one one one of these

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.840 
people like uh next one one one of these
way<00:01:50.850> pauses<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.750> may<00:01:51.960> extend<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.729> like

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
way pauses it may extend this to to like

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.240 
way pauses it may extend this to to like
a<00:01:53.939> three<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.390> four<00:01:54.600> line<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.020> would<00:01:55.920> just

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
a three or four line I would just

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.380 
a three or four line I would just
because<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.490> don't<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> cards<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.329> i

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
because I don't have the cards but i

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.289 
because I don't have the cards but i
would<00:01:58.340> just<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.610> he<00:01:59.909> knocks<00:02:00.119> out

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
would just because he knocks out

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
would just because he knocks out
Gibble's<00:02:00.780> two<00:02:01.259> bites<00:02:01.469> he<00:02:01.710> has<00:02:01.799> 120<00:02:02.219> HP<00:02:02.369> he's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
Gibble's two bites he has 120 HP he's

to us but uh so yeah let's get up to
your<00:02:28.460> tech<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.910> does<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> lightning<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.620> line

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
your tech it does a lightning one line

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.800 
your tech it does a lightning one line
the<00:02:30.860> energy<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.400> does<00:02:31.850> for<00:02:32.060> damages<00:02:32.540> as<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the energy it does for damages as the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.890 
the energy it does for damages as the

it<00:02:36.110> does<00:02:36.320> for<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.610> Carlos<00:02:38.330> like<00:02:38.660> they're<00:02:38.840> gonna

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
it does for a Carlos like they're gonna

fire that's my bird again it has 90

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.340 
fire that's my bird again it has 90
damage<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:44.120> attack<00:02:44.480> isn't<00:02:44.750> affected<00:02:45.260> by

you<00:02:50.450> want<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.750> start<00:02:50.900> off<00:02:50.960> with<00:02:51.110> these<00:02:51.230> just

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
you want to start off with these just

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.780 
you want to start off with these just
for<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.220> charge<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:53.290> gets<00:02:54.290> basically<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.800> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
for the charge and gets basically it the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.300 
for the charge and gets basically it the
energy<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.210> discard<00:02:56.540> one<00:02:57.110> tornadus<00:02:57.650> just

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
energy to discard one tornadus just

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.590 
energy to discard one tornadus just
because<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.730> can<00:02:58.850> move<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> energy<00:02:59.390> around

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.930 

one<00:03:02.600> right<00:03:02.870> qex<00:03:03.590> just<00:03:04.250> because<00:03:04.490> with<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.730> slight

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
one right qex just because with a slight

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.120 
one right qex just because with a slight
damage<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:07.960> 4-3<00:03:08.960> minor<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.320> eels<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.770> prefer

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
damage and a 4-3 minor the eels I prefer

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.210 
damage and a 4-3 minor the eels I prefer
to<00:03:10.280> use<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.760> three<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.630> these<00:03:11.750> are<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.920> spark

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
to use the three of these are the spark

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.610 
to use the three of these are the spark
eels<00:03:13.550> from<00:03:13.700> dark<00:03:14.180> spores<00:03:14.450> just<00:03:15.140> because<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
eels from dark spores just because it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.690 
eels from dark spores just because it
does<00:03:15.770> damage<00:03:15.980> talk<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.310> your<00:03:16.430> opponent's

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
little district-wise are you retreat and

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.120 
little district-wise are you retreat and
then<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.489> go<00:04:10.730> like<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:12.010> remember<00:04:13.010> any

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
then you go like that remember any

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.949 
then you go like that remember any
looking<00:04:13.459> for<00:04:13.550> classes<00:04:13.880> three<00:04:14.540> ultra<00:04:14.780> balls

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
looking for classes three ultra balls

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.860 
looking for classes three ultra balls
you<00:04:15.110> can<00:04:15.200> get<00:04:15.320> energy<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.739> discard<00:04:16.070> uh<00:04:16.870> I

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
you can get energy in the discard uh I

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.180 
you can get energy in the discard uh I
found<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.200> very<00:04:18.260> very<00:04:18.530> helpful<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:19.010> get

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
found it very very helpful and you get

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.450 
found it very very helpful and you get
the<00:04:19.370> V<00:04:19.489> clauses<00:04:19.850> out<00:04:20.000> faster<00:04:21.310> three<00:04:22.310> max

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
the V clauses out faster three max

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.650 
the V clauses out faster three max
potion

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
potion

here's<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.680> thing<00:04:24.890> about<00:04:24.950> this<00:04:25.160> car<00:04:25.220> I'm<00:04:25.490> ace

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
here's the thing about this car I'm ace

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.400 
here's the thing about this car I'm ace
what's<00:04:26.030> this<00:04:26.180> for<00:04:26.390> some<00:04:26.540> energy<00:04:26.810> surges<00:04:27.200> I

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
what's this for some energy surges I

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.350 
what's this for some energy surges I
think<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.310> like<00:04:28.490> been<00:04:28.640> one<00:04:28.910> time<00:04:29.120> there's

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
think this like been one time there's

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.180 
think this like been one time there's
actually<00:04:29.600> helped<00:04:29.930> just<00:04:30.590> heel<00:04:30.830> off<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:30.980> damage

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
actually helped just heel off the damage

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.240 
actually helped just heel off the damage
of<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.520> closet<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:31.970> then<00:04:32.150> uh<00:04:33.220> because<00:04:34.220> I

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
of the closet and then uh because I

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.820 
of the closet and then uh because I
believe<00:04:34.940> it's<00:04:35.450> here<00:04:35.660> for<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:36.200> have<00:04:36.440> no<00:04:36.620> idea

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
believe it's here for I have no idea

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.650 
believe it's here for I have no idea
when<00:04:36.980> I<00:04:37.040> was<00:04:37.070> training<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.790> thought<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.420> believe

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
when I was training I thought I believe

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.040 
when I was training I thought I believe
once<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.440> put<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.590> ricotta<00:04:39.920> down<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:41.050> you

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
once you put the ricotta down and you

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.380 
once you put the ricotta down and you
basically<00:04:42.200> attached<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:43.250> once<00:04:44.120> you've<00:04:44.240> done

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
basically attached a once you've done

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.690 
basically attached a once you've done
all<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.720> attack<00:04:45.020> like<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:46.220> there's<00:04:46.490> only<00:04:46.580> one

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
all the attack like and there's only one

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.480 
all the attack like and there's only one
fire<00:04:47.060> energy<00:04:47.480> now<00:04:47.630> if<00:04:47.840> they<00:04:47.960> attack<00:04:48.230> you<00:04:48.500> just

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
fire energy now if they attack you just

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.590 
fire energy now if they attack you just
fill<00:04:49.640> out<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:49.760> damaging<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.180> describe<00:04:50.480> the

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
fill out the damaging you describe the

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600 
fill out the damaging you describe the
fire<00:04:50.720> energy<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.920> then<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.100> just<00:04:52.250> bring<00:04:52.490> it

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
fire energy and then you just bring it

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.890 
fire energy and then you just bring it
back<00:04:52.730> with<00:04:52.820> energy<00:04:53.090> retrieval<00:04:53.450> I<00:04:53.600> think<00:04:53.870> that

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
back with energy retrieval I think that

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.480 
back with energy retrieval I think that
was<00:04:53.990> going<00:04:54.230> I<00:04:54.530> think<00:04:54.800> that's<00:04:54.980> what<00:04:55.160> was<00:04:55.280> going

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
was going I think that's what was going

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.240 
was going I think that's what was going
to<00:04:55.580> remind<00:04:55.760> oh<00:04:56.090> yeah<00:04:56.840> three<00:04:57.410> max<00:04:57.500> functions<00:04:57.920> so

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
to remind oh yeah three max functions so

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.570 
to remind oh yeah three max functions so
it<00:04:58.340> gets<00:04:58.400> annoying<00:04:59.230> three<00:05:00.230> receivers<00:05:00.830> just<00:05:01.520> to

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
it gets annoying three receivers just to

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.760 
it gets annoying three receivers just to
get<00:05:01.670> your<00:05:01.790> supporters<00:05:02.150> out<00:05:02.300> q+<00:05:03.110> powers<00:05:03.560> I'm<00:05:03.680> a

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
get your supporters out q+ powers I'm a

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.350 
get your supporters out q+ powers I'm a
switch<00:05:04.010> this<00:05:04.160> for<00:05:04.340> energy<00:05:04.580> surge<00:05:04.790> too<00:05:05.030> because

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
switch this for energy surge too because

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.230 
switch this for energy surge too because
this<00:05:05.510> is<00:05:05.630> not<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.980> stop<00:05:06.980> doing<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.340> for<00:05:07.970> me<00:05:08.090> I

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
this is not a stop doing it for me I

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.940 
this is not a stop doing it for me I
don't<00:05:08.540> know<00:05:08.600> what's<00:05:08.860> what's<00:05:09.860> up<00:05:10.010> with<00:05:10.130> this

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
don't know what's what's up with this

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.000 
don't know what's what's up with this
you<00:05:12.950> have<00:05:13.040> to<00:05:13.250> level<00:05:13.460> balls<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:14.830> think<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:15.890> might

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
you have to level balls I think I might

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.940 
you have to level balls I think I might
push<00:05:16.190> up<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.370> me<00:05:16.670> koalas<00:05:17.120> up<00:05:17.380> if<00:05:18.380> we<00:05:18.650> get<00:05:18.740> three

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
push up the me koalas up if we get three

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.550 
push up the me koalas up if we get three
buses<00:05:19.250> but<00:05:19.400> yeah<00:05:19.870> till<00:05:20.870> our<00:05:20.990> balls<00:05:21.260> just<00:05:21.470> to

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
buses but yeah till our balls just to

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.470

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
get the elapsed rates on the time i'm

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.710 
get the elapsed rates on the time i'm
about<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:24.530> switch<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:28.090> 22<00:05:29.090> energy<00:05:29.360> retrievals

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
starting with this rate closet and it's

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.810 
starting with this rate closet and it's
going<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:08.810> be<00:06:08.900> a<00:06:08.930> lot<00:06:09.200> fast<00:06:09.590> and<00:06:09.919> you'll<00:06:10.700> be

going to be a lot fast and you'll be
starting<00:06:11.120> with<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:11.510> ultra<00:06:11.990> balls<00:06:12.200> too<00:06:12.470> and

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
starting with the ultra balls too and

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.420 
starting with the ultra balls too and
it's<00:06:13.760> going<00:06:13.910> to<00:06:14.000> be<00:06:14.120> poof<00:06:15.010> just<00:06:16.010> get<00:06:16.190> out<00:06:16.280> your

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
it's going to be poof just get out your

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.950 
it's going to be poof just get out your
stuff<00:06:16.610> very<00:06:16.760> fast<00:06:17.180> that's<00:06:17.419> why<00:06:17.540> it's<00:06:17.750> a<00:06:17.840> low

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
stuff very fast that's why it's a low

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.230 
stuff very fast that's why it's a low
support<00:06:18.290> account<00:06:18.440> and<00:06:18.710> uh<00:06:18.740> the<00:06:19.460> Bianca's<00:06:19.940> it's

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
support account and uh the Bianca's it's

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.670 
support account and uh the Bianca's it's
very<00:06:20.419> easily<00:06:20.720> to<00:06:20.960> lower<00:06:21.200> down<00:06:21.350> your<00:06:21.410> hand

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
very easily to lower down your hand

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.659 
very easily to lower down your hand
sides<00:06:21.890> in<00:06:22.100> this<00:06:22.190> in<00:06:22.610> this<00:06:22.730> deck<00:06:22.940> and<00:06:24.100> yeah<00:06:25.100> and

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
sides in this in this deck and yeah and

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.550 
sides in this in this deck and yeah and
we're<00:06:26.450> gonna<00:06:26.570> go<00:06:26.690> to<00:06:26.720> the<00:06:26.840> energy<00:06:27.140> line<00:06:27.320> I

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
we're gonna go to the energy line I

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.440 
we're gonna go to the energy line I
believe<00:06:28.130> there<00:06:28.490> is<00:06:28.669> seven<00:06:29.120> lightning

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
believe there is seven lightning

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.170 
believe there is seven lightning
guarantees<00:06:30.070> Dinah<00:06:31.070> motors<00:06:31.370> that's<00:06:31.850> it<00:06:32.000> and

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
guarantees Dinah motors that's it and

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.150 
guarantees Dinah motors that's it and
then

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
then

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.140 
then
up<00:06:33.510> for<00:06:34.510> fire<00:06:34.720> energies<00:06:35.790> just<00:06:36.790> for<00:06:37.000> the

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
up for fire energies just for the

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.750 
up for fire energies just for the
requires<00:06:37.840> a<00:06:37.930> key<00:06:37.990> x<00:06:40.290> and<00:06:41.290> i<00:06:42.010> believe<00:06:42.340> that's<00:06:42.580> it

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
requires a key x and i believe that's it

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.250 
requires a key x and i believe that's it
