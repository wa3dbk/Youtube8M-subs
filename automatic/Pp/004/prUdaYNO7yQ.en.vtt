lighting<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> case-mate<00:00:52.289> logo<00:00:52.980> on

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
lighting here got the case-mate logo on

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.709 
lighting here got the case-mate logo on
the<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:55.320> well<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:57.510> we've

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the back there as well and then we've

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.490 
the back there as well and then we've
got<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:59.180> inner<00:01:00.180> silicon<00:01:00.660> shell<00:01:00.899> which<00:01:01.140> fits

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
got the inner silicon shell which fits

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.650 
got the inner silicon shell which fits
around<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> device<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:02.760> pops<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
around the device and then pops in the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.070 
around the device and then pops in the
outer<00:01:03.809> shell<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.189> let's<00:01:05.339> bring<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
outer shell like so so let's bring in a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.679 
outer shell like so so let's bring in a
device<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.780> we<00:01:09.780> pop<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:12.119> device<00:01:12.390> like

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
device so we pop this on the device like

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.260 
device so we pop this on the device like
so<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.890> fits<00:01:14.700> fairly

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
so so you can see that fits fairly

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.020 
so so you can see that fits fairly
snugly<00:01:15.840> we've<00:01:16.530> got<00:01:16.770> cutouts<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> camera

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
snugly we've got cutouts for the camera

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.280 
snugly we've got cutouts for the camera
and<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.330> speaker<00:01:19.280> we<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.610> still<00:01:21.210> access<00:01:21.479> some

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and the speaker we can still access some

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.780 
and the speaker we can still access some
of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> controls<00:01:23.000> thanks<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.299> these<00:01:25.259> raised

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
of the controls thanks to these raised

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.999 
of the controls thanks to these raised
rubber<00:01:26.790> pieces<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.320> we've<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.470> cutouts

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
rubber pieces here and we've got cutouts

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.800 
rubber pieces here and we've got cutouts
for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> charging<00:01:29.759> ports<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.780> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
for the charging ports and what have you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.609 
for the charging ports and what have you
so<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.680> take<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.430> pop<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.619> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
so now we take this and pop it in the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.450 
so now we take this and pop it in the
outer<00:01:35.930> shell<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> push<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.460> might

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
outer shell so push it in like so might

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760 
outer shell so push it in like so might
take<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.240> wiggling<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.350> some<00:01:43.680> of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
take a bit of wiggling to get some of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
take a bit of wiggling to get some of
these<00:01:43.860> things<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> power<00:01:44.850> buttons

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
these things in like the power buttons

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.800 
these things in like the power buttons
and<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.670> there<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.850> within<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and what have you there it is within the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
and what have you there it is within the
case<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.380> you've<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:49.500> two<00:01:49.799> levels<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
case so you've got two levels of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.889 
case so you've got two levels of
protection<00:01:50.430> there<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> inner<00:01:51.149> silicone<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
protection there the inner silicone and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.330 
protection there the inner silicone and
then<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.149> tough<00:01:54.149> case<00:01:54.590> itself<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.130> most<00:01:59.130> of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
then the tough case itself so most of

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.459 
then the tough case itself so most of
the<00:01:59.399> device<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.360> protected<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:00.930> terms<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the device is protected in terms of the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
the device is protected in terms of the
side<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> back<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:03.180> corners<00:02:03.630> are

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
side and the back the corners are

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.650 
side and the back the corners are
protected<00:02:04.700> as<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:08.030> some<00:02:09.030> elements<00:02:09.479> are

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
protected as well some elements are

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.160 
protected as well some elements are
exposed<00:02:10.819> as<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.239> screen<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.750> may<00:02:12.930> wish

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
exposed as is the screen so you may wish

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.720 
exposed as is the screen so you may wish
to<00:02:13.200> apply

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
to apply

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.990 
to apply
a<00:02:13.790> screen<00:02:14.569> protector<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:16.099> but<00:02:16.879> you<00:02:16.970> can

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
a screen protector on here but you can

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.210 
a screen protector on here but you can
also<00:02:17.239> see<00:02:17.540> on<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:17.870> case<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.590> designed<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
also see on the case that is designed to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.960 
also see on the case that is designed to
fit<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.459> contour<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.599> machine<00:02:21.640> as<00:02:22.640> best

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
fit the contour of the machine as best

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.479 
fit the contour of the machine as best
as<00:02:23.120> possible<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.750> remains<00:02:24.319> dinner<00:02:24.650> here<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
as possible so remains dinner here and

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.660 
as possible so remains dinner here and
then<00:02:25.640> raises<00:02:26.090> up<00:02:26.799> at<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.950> top<00:02:28.159> part<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
then raises up at the top part of the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.610 
then raises up at the top part of the
device<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.599> it<00:02:29.810> would<00:02:29.959> if<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.230> had<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.470> out

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
device like it would if you had it out
