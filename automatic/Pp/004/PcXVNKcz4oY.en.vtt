00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.630
 There are now many action teams 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.430
 on the market but the most cost 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 but a few hundred euros 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.760
 today the easypix is testing folklore 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.470
 mini for just 50 euro for you if 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.390
 she is good for something and maybe even with 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.870
 she can keep up the competition 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.870
 now 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 the gold race mini comes in one 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.379
 Packaging that I like very much 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 in it is first the camera itself 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.159
 Underneath is a carton in which 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.940
 accessory is 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.280
 Included is a handlebar 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.330
 Attaching a user manual 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.729
 a bracket a protective cover 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.399
 mini usb cable a double-sided 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.530
 Adhesive tape for the helmet mount and a 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.930
 but we could only bandage the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.430
 camera closer 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.679
 It does not make the impression as if 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.970
 she immediately breaks up though 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.210
 not necessarily the same 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.310
 Highest quality impression the card is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.470
 quite small and therefore fits in too 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 a jacket pocket which makes it good 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.179
 The camera can be accepted everywhere 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.460
 top left an on and off switch and 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.810
 make a selection button for photos and 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.909
 record videos 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.369
 left one can between the three modes it 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.619
 change the camera 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.750
 this is the camera mode in the top 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.450
 middle of the video mode and below the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.789
 gallery where you can see photos and how 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.310
 can watch 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.369
 the front is the lcd display a high and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.590
 a saucer and an ok button 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.320
 scarce but only for the settings 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.299
 and the menu and is also the mini usb 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.209
 Connection over the man the camera 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:18.060
 can charge and a micro sd slot for 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.640
 micro sd up to 32 gb 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.310
 it will be a sd-card as necessary because no 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.470
 internal memory is installed the battery 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.680
 Unfortunately, he can not be replaced 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.840
 320 milliamps that sounds little 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.450
 but has me in a video recording 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.519
 for one and a half hours of power research 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.220
 But let's have a look 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.329
 Accessories bicycle mount can be 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.040
 easy to assemble 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.010
 however, I really only can 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.500
 recommend if you are on an iran 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.180
 road drives through uneven paths and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.280
 many take the pictures strongly 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.260
 but somehow blatantly logical 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.970
 otherwise i can rather be the one 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 also supplied bracket 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.569
 recommend it will be a double seeber and 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.150
 included 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.100
 for example with a motorcycle helmet 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.109
 Sound may otherwise be another 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.419
 tape included with mine 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.410
 bike m has attached the protective hood 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.140
 I can do less on the go 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.600
 since she only protects the camera from the front 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.790
 but it is still practical to 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.740
 below has a quarter inch thread 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.780
 and you get it to every normal one 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.120
 can screw tripod and thereby also 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.860
 so that your company can be great and with the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.780
 water housing that a very good 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.060
 Impression came with the camera too 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.430
 in up to ten meters deep underwater 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.380
 recording 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.390
 The housing is very well made and 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.400
 makes the entry in a few years 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.560
 Still to protect the camera 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.120
 as a rule strict but not too strict 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.220
 and the seal goes well 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.860
 processed is the only thing to 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.100
 Note, this is just the top two 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.840
 buttons in the housing are operable so 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.210
 the on and off button and the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.280
 trigger button therefore you always have to 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.570
 set for whether you have photos or 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.400
 wants to make videos 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.080
 but I do not see that as a point of criticism 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.480
 because you usually either 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.800
 photographed or filmed and it just 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.810
 can set before 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.090
 also here its bottom one and a quarter 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.920
 make winds and she can do that as well 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.870
 a water housing on a tripod 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.130
 I have the housing to be screwed 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.810
 Actually, whenever I go to much more 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.730
 the camera because if you have it 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.650
 she should just fall down a lot 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.810
 better protected with the protective hood 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.530
 But how is it with other things? 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.360
 equipment 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.310
 There is no manufacturer 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.440
 other accessories but in that the 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.240
 camera has a quarter witness wind 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.370
 There are a lot of accessories from Anna 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.750
 marks and just has to bang a bit 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.220
 but we are now coming to the times 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.169
 most important of the picture quality 27 p so 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.150
 hd but no full hd 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.270
 the white balance and the colors are good 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.580
 all shots are sharp but it is 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.700
 always a slight image noise 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.220
 available 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.870
 in good light city is 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.120
 Not so, but if it's a bit 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.050
 dark is the recordings betrayed 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.210
 quite fast 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.090
 Overall, the image of her victim 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.090
 mum look alright but one 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.350
 I would not be in it 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.180
 Unfortunately we were off and on the gate 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.419
 something really wrong in the video 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.640
 great the linz has an angle of 45 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.380
 But that's not very much 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.720
 I have to say that she is me 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.310
 surprisingly not strengthened there 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.710
 it is enough 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.120
 but now I have talked enough and 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.169
 I'll show you a few shots now 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.699
 with the camera I made 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.150
 and then we'll see each other again 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.150
 Conclusion 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.870
 So for a little camera now suitable 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.630
 I mean you can not forget that 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.880
 this camera and 50 euro costs and you 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.830
 that's why something for people is like them 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.020
 now and then came out with in the 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.970
 vacation but not a few now 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.000
 want to go out a hundred euros and also 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.710
 do not have the highest demands 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.630
 but if you are more often and professional 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.650
 So I want you to movies wolf 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:45.180
 other action and yes it was 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.290
 again with this video I hope 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.670
 you liked it 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.670
 bye until next time
