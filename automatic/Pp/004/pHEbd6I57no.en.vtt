definitely there but we were faced with
a<00:00:37.800> real<00:00:38.100> choice<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.809> go<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:40.110> where<00:00:40.230> the

lot<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.150> games<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.540> put<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.990> other

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170

lot of games that we put out that other
companies<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.860> there's<00:01:35.610> definitely<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
companies put out there's definitely a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.060 
companies put out there's definitely a
trend<00:01:36.329> toward<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.750> realistic<00:01:37.259> graphics<00:01:37.409> we

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
trend toward very realistic graphics we

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
trend toward very realistic graphics we
could<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.340> done<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.520> Capcom<00:01:39.000> certainly

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
could have done that Capcom certainly

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.490 
could have done that Capcom certainly
has<00:01:39.390> technology<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.140> how<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> do

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
has technology and they know how to do

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.319 
has technology and they know how to do
that<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> look<00:01:41.610> back<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.970> history<00:01:42.299> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
that but if you look back the history of

been to have moving paintings on the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
hook effects in the game we certainly

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.130 
hook effects in the game we certainly
thought<00:02:03.570> about<00:02:03.750> putting<00:02:03.930> more<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.350> in

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
thought about putting more of it in

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.750 
thought about putting more of it in
but<00:02:05.440> really<00:02:05.800> we<00:02:05.890> have<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.070> remember<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.670> a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
but really we have to remember that is a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.190 
but really we have to remember that is a
fighting<00:02:07.060> game<00:02:07.090> if<00:02:07.390> there's<00:02:07.570> too<00:02:07.690> much<00:02:07.810> stuff

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
fighting game if there's too much stuff

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.020 
fighting game if there's too much stuff
going<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.890> screen<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.670> would<00:02:09.789> just<00:02:09.880> be

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
going on on the screen it would just be

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.309 
going on on the screen it would just be
difficult<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.450> play<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.690> we<00:02:10.899> have<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.080> strike<00:02:11.290> a

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
difficult to play so we have to strike a

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.809 
difficult to play so we have to strike a
balance<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.860> has<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.130> clear<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> user

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
balance it has to be clear to the user

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.550 
balance it has to be clear to the user
what's<00:02:13.060> happening<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.080> has<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.200> look<00:02:14.380> cool

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
what's happening but it has to look cool

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.110 
what's happening but it has to look cool
as<00:02:14.709> well<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.280> play<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.520> later<00:02:15.730> latest

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
as well so if you play this later latest

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.270 
as well so if you play this later latest
version<00:02:16.480> you'll<00:02:16.630> see<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.930> there<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.950> bit

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
version you'll see that there is a bit

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.350 
version you'll see that there is a bit
of<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.550> there<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.030> will<00:02:19.150> probably

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
of that in there and will probably

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.880 
of that in there and will probably
increase<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.900> here<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.170> there<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:20.500> we

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
increase it here and there but we

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.990 
increase it here and there but we
certainly<00:02:21.160> don't<00:02:21.340> want<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.580> take<00:02:21.730> away<00:02:21.880> from

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
certainly don't want to take away from

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.610 
certainly don't want to take away from
from<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.600> game<00:02:22.780> itself<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.440> last

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
from the game itself that's the last

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.880 
from the game itself that's the last

I'm<00:02:38.680> sure<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.130> know<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.280> Capcom<00:02:39.730> has<00:02:39.820> enough

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
I'm sure you know that Capcom has enough

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.670 
I'm sure you know that Capcom has enough
design<00:02:40.330> sense<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.810> not<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.110> such<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.350> horribly

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
design sense to not have such a horribly

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.949 
design sense to not have such a horribly
unbalanced<00:02:42.190> screen<00:02:42.489> I'll<00:02:43.060> say<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.360> much<00:02:43.690> so

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
unbalanced screen I'll say that much so

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.270 
unbalanced screen I'll say that much so
certainly<00:02:44.350> something's<00:02:44.800> going<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.010> go<00:02:45.070> down

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
certainly something's going to go down

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.130 
certainly something's going to go down
there<00:02:45.489> as<00:02:45.880> far<00:02:46.090> as<00:02:46.209> specifics<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:46.870> there's<00:02:47.019> any

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
new characters more old characters I

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.699 
new characters more old characters I
can't<00:02:49.780> tell<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:49.989> too<00:02:50.080> much<00:02:50.110> right<00:02:50.380> now<00:02:50.410> what<00:02:50.680> I

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
cave game finished up so we're not

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.780 
cave game finished up so we're not
really<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.010> point<00:03:59.099> where<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.459> talk<00:03:59.639> too

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
really the point where you can talk too

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.339 
really the point where you can talk too
much<00:03:59.909> about<00:03:59.970> home<00:04:00.359> conversions<00:04:00.930> what<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.109> can

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
much about home conversions what I can

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.009 
much about home conversions what I can
say<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.620> we're<00:04:01.889> certainly<00:04:02.430> on<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.180> path<00:04:03.870> to

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
say is we're certainly on the path to

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.180 
say is we're certainly on the path to
getting<00:04:04.170> as<00:04:04.290> many<00:04:04.379> people<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.739> play<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> game

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
getting as many people to play the game

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.099 
getting as many people to play the game
as<00:04:05.280> possible<00:04:05.700> it's<00:04:05.819> certainly<00:04:06.030> our<00:04:06.090> goal<00:04:06.420> so

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
as possible it's certainly our goal so

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.960 
as possible it's certainly our goal so
for<00:04:07.290> what<00:04:07.409> it's<00:04:07.560> worth<00:04:07.590> we<00:04:07.739> may<00:04:08.459> indeed<00:04:08.730> see

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
for what it's worth we may indeed see

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.910 
for what it's worth we may indeed see
some<00:04:09.150> sort<00:04:09.329> of<00:04:09.389> move<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.659> that<00:04:09.810> direction

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
some sort of move in that direction

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.990 
some sort of move in that direction
certainly<00:04:10.920> if<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.099> fans<00:04:11.310> want<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.909> know

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
certainly if the fans want it you know

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.979 
certainly if the fans want it you know
if<00:04:12.120> they<00:04:12.209> let<00:04:12.389> us<00:04:12.420> know<00:04:12.540> then<00:04:12.870> we're

we<00:04:33.479> definitely<00:04:33.660> like<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.050> do<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.289> but<00:04:34.530> what

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
we definitely like to do that but what

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.779 
we definitely like to do that but what
we'd<00:04:34.800> like<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:34.979> do<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:35.370> take<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.550> slightly

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
we'd like to do is take a slightly

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:36.860 
we'd like to do is take a slightly
different<00:04:35.880> approach<00:04:36.180> what<00:04:36.599> you've<00:04:36.690> seen

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
different approach what you've seen

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.960 
different approach what you've seen
until<00:04:37.169> now<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.680> what<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.220> mean<00:04:38.460> by<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.820> this

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
until now and what I mean by that this

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.100 
until now and what I mean by that this
might<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.270> a<00:04:39.300> little<00:04:39.449> vague<00:04:39.690> but<00:04:39.720> let's<00:04:40.080> think

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
might be a little vague but let's think

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.080 
might be a little vague but let's think
of<00:04:40.320> chess<00:04:40.560> for<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.800> moment<00:04:40.979> it's<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.699> same<00:04:41.880> game

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
of chess for a moment it's the same game

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.339 
of chess for a moment it's the same game
the<00:04:42.270> same<00:04:42.449> rules<00:04:42.660> but<00:04:42.930> there's<00:04:43.080> lots<00:04:43.139> of<00:04:43.289> ways

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
the same rules but there's lots of ways

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.409 
the same rules but there's lots of ways
to<00:04:43.470> play<00:04:43.740> chess<00:04:43.979> you<00:04:44.190> have<00:04:44.280> casual<00:04:44.760> people

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
different levels we think that Street

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.200 
different levels we think that Street
Fighter<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:52.979> same<00:04:53.160> way<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:53.910> we<00:04:54.000> need<00:04:54.150> to

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
Fighter is the same way so we need to

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.700 
Fighter is the same way so we need to
