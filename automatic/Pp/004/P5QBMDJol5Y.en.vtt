00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
see if we can figure this out you got a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.820 
see if we can figure this out you got a
area<00:02:37.360> where<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:37.990> charge<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.680> everything

area where you can charge and everything

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.240 
area where you can charge and everything

of course it's got a huge kind of

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.160 
of course it's got a huge kind of
plunger<00:02:42.250> or<00:02:42.400> plug<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.970> will<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.780> take<00:02:43.960> and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
plunger or plug if you will to take and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.110 
plunger or plug if you will to take and

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
go in and do that we'll go ahead and set

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.180 
go in and do that we'll go ahead and set
it<00:02:46.240> aside<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:46.510> now<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:47.290> look<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.620> also<00:02:47.830> get

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
it aside for now this look you also get

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.970 
it aside for now this look you also get
probably<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.850> screen<00:02:49.270> cover<00:02:49.540> or<00:02:49.960> see<00:02:50.770> what<00:02:50.860> this

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
probably a screen cover or see what this

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.630 
probably a screen cover or see what this
is<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.480> just<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:54.220> cleaner<00:02:54.520> I

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
is this is like it's just a cleaner I

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.060 
is this is like it's just a cleaner I
guess<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.450> cleaner<00:02:55.750> before<00:02:55.960> your<00:02:56.350> screen<00:02:56.710> and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
guess the cleaner before your screen and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.600 
guess the cleaner before your screen and
then<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:57.820> looks<00:02:58.000> like<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.660> screw<00:02:59.470> on

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
then this looks like it's a screw on

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.910 
then this looks like it's a screw on
it's<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.730> wrench<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.240> some<00:03:01.450> type<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.990> very<00:03:02.590> small

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
it's a wrench of some type a very small

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.450 
it's a wrench of some type a very small
wrench

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
wrench

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.150 
wrench

see if we also have instructions no the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.550 
see if we also have instructions no the
instructions<00:03:06.640> I<00:03:06.730> guess<00:03:06.970> are<00:03:07.210> here<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.870> what

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
instructions I guess are here and what

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.850 
instructions I guess are here and what
we<00:03:08.680> have<00:03:08.710> to<00:03:08.920> do<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.430> unscrew

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
using likely this device and yeah that's

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.660 
using likely this device and yeah that's
how<00:03:15.580> we<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.210> you<00:03:16.870> basically<00:03:17.430> unscrew<00:03:18.430> each

of<00:04:15.520> a<00:04:15.730> rubberized<00:04:16.150> hard<00:04:17.010> feeling<00:04:18.010> back<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.700> it

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
of a rubberized hard feeling back to it

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.150 
of a rubberized hard feeling back to it
and<00:04:19.260> there's<00:04:20.260> this<00:04:20.760> vibe<00:04:21.760> whatever<00:04:22.419> that<00:04:22.660> is

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
and there's this vibe whatever that is

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.470 
and there's this vibe whatever that is
trying<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.190> figure<00:04:24.400> out<00:04:24.580> what<00:04:24.730> that<00:04:24.850> is<00:04:24.910> well<00:04:25.270> I

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
trying to figure out what that is well I

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.480 
trying to figure out what that is well I
guess<00:04:25.780> we'll<00:04:25.960> figure<00:04:26.080> out<00:04:26.260> what<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.650> here

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
guess we'll figure out what that is here

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.060 
guess we'll figure out what that is here
in<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> bit<00:04:27.850> but<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:29.260> can<00:04:29.410> see<00:04:29.560> here<00:04:29.740> you've<00:04:29.860> got

thing<00:06:07.400> we<00:06:07.550> were<00:06:07.640> trying<00:06:07.850> to<00:06:07.940> figure<00:06:08.060> this<00:06:08.240> out

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
thing we were trying to figure this out

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.510 
thing we were trying to figure this out
it's<00:06:08.720> called<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.290> vibes<00:06:09.620> switch<00:06:10.130> that's<00:06:10.400> on

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
it's called the vibes switch that's on

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.910 
it's called the vibes switch that's on
the<00:06:10.640> back<00:06:10.850> and<00:06:11.210> it<00:06:12.110> was<00:06:12.230> so<00:06:12.380> obvious<00:06:12.770> we

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
the back and it was so obvious we

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.770 
the back and it was so obvious we
weren't<00:06:13.130> sure<00:06:13.280> what<00:06:13.460> we're<00:06:13.610> doing<00:06:13.880> but<00:06:14.000> what

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
weren't sure what we're doing but what

weren't sure what we're doing but what
it<00:06:14.870> does<00:06:15.050> it<00:06:15.290> turns<00:06:15.530> on<00:06:15.860> and<00:06:16.010> off<00:06:16.130> the<00:06:16.340> mute

switch underneath the underneath the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
don't think we notice is the

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.379 
don't think we notice is the
it<00:06:50.720> took<00:06:50.930> us<00:06:51.080> a<00:06:51.260> couple<00:06:51.430> uses<00:06:52.430> of<00:06:52.880> the<00:06:53.120> home

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
it took us a couple uses of the home

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:55.570 
it took us a couple uses of the home
button<00:06:53.750> to<00:06:54.020> get<00:06:54.169> it<00:06:54.380> to<00:06:54.860> get<00:06:54.980> it<00:06:55.070> kind<00:06:55.220> of<00:06:55.310> worn

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.260 
button to get it to get it kind of worn
in<00:06:55.790> and<00:06:56.060> we<00:06:56.180> notices<00:06:56.690> it<00:06:56.900> warns<00:06:57.200> in<00:06:57.520> as<00:06:58.520> it<00:06:59.120> gets

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
in and we notices it warns in as it gets

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.510 
in and we notices it warns in as it gets
worn<00:06:59.570> it<00:06:59.930> performs<00:07:00.560> better<00:07:00.860> so<00:07:01.250> initially

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
worn it performs better so initially

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.370 
worn it performs better so initially
we're<00:07:01.910> kind<00:07:02.510> of<00:07:02.540> going<00:07:02.720> to<00:07:02.780> give<00:07:03.020> a<00:07:03.050> little<00:07:03.139> bit

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
we're kind of going to give a little bit

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.860 
we're kind of going to give a little bit
of<00:07:03.500> a<00:07:03.620> press<00:07:03.919> but<00:07:04.280> now<00:07:04.520> it<00:07:05.090> seems<00:07:05.389> to<00:07:05.480> be<00:07:05.690> doing

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
of a press but now it seems to be doing

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.320 
of a press but now it seems to be doing
well<00:07:06.410> on<00:07:06.680> its<00:07:06.980> own<00:07:07.160> or<00:07:07.370> being<00:07:07.639> responsive<00:07:08.150> so

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
well on its own or being responsive so

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.510 
well on its own or being responsive so
it<00:07:08.750> gets<00:07:08.960> better<00:07:09.200> with<00:07:09.410> age

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
it gets better with age

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.790 
it gets better with age
but<00:07:11.300> you<00:07:11.630> know<00:07:11.720> we<00:07:11.840> just<00:07:11.900> had<00:07:12.200> a<00:07:12.230> for<00:07:12.500> a<00:07:12.530> day<00:07:12.680> or

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
but you know we just had a for a day or

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.590 
but you know we just had a for a day or
so<00:07:12.950> now<00:07:13.160> and<00:07:13.580> playing<00:07:13.820> with<00:07:13.970> it<00:07:14.000> it's<00:07:14.330> got<00:07:14.510> the

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:14.600 
so now and playing with it it's got the

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.030 
so now and playing with it it's got the
nice<00:07:14.750> rope<00:07:14.960> around<00:07:15.110> the<00:07:15.350> edges<00:07:15.680> it's

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
nice rope around the edges it's

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.440 
nice rope around the edges it's
definitely<00:07:16.490> something<00:07:16.760> we'll<00:07:16.880> take<00:07:17.090> a<00:07:17.120> hit

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
definitely something we'll take a hit

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.270 
definitely something we'll take a hit
and<00:07:17.570> then<00:07:18.139> one<00:07:18.470> of<00:07:18.590> the<00:07:18.710> things<00:07:18.919> that<00:07:19.100> you<00:07:19.190> know

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 
and then one of the things that you know

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.310 
and then one of the things that you know
I've<00:07:19.490> had<00:07:19.730> I've<00:07:19.940> had<00:07:19.970> nice<00:07:20.480> cases<00:07:21.050> that<00:07:21.230> are

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
I've had I've had nice cases that are

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.860 
I've had I've had nice cases that are
really<00:07:21.530> nice<00:07:21.650> when<00:07:22.310> you<00:07:22.430> drop<00:07:22.700> them<00:07:22.940> if<00:07:23.300> they

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870 
really nice when you drop them if they

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.440 
really nice when you drop them if they
hit<00:07:24.139> right<00:07:24.410> the<00:07:24.860> the<00:07:25.340> phone<00:07:25.700> pops<00:07:26.030> out<00:07:26.300> of<00:07:26.330> the

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:26.450 
hit right the the phone pops out of the

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.360 
hit right the the phone pops out of the
case<00:07:26.720> and<00:07:26.750> drags<00:07:27.200> across<00:07:27.560> the<00:07:27.740> floor<00:07:27.979> and<00:07:28.010> the

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.370 
case and drags across the floor and the

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.000 
case and drags across the floor and the
case<00:07:28.580> just<00:07:28.910> kind<00:07:29.120> of<00:07:29.180> explodes<00:07:30.080> now<00:07:30.410> the<00:07:30.800> case
