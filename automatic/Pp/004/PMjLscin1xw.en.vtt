00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.060
 be on occasion have you thought of 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.730
 apply for a competition come 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.320
 fireman well to police we have 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.570
 given the place where they are prepared 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.579
 for that challenge an intellectual challenge but 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.909
 especially physical good afternoon of 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.909
 Eduardo 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.189
 hello how about susana very good afternoon 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.260
 good afternoon everyone in the oppositions 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.119
 they are still a good alternative for 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.050
 all those who seek a future 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.150
 professional 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.619
 some of the most oppositions 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.809
 defendants continue to be those of the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.000
 security bodies police guard 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.860
 civil or firefighters being the latter 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.140
 the most demanding in terms of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.030
 physical preparation refers to that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.699
 we have come to this academy where 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.890
 they prepare the aspirants to overcome 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.290
 with the best possible grade both the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.420
 theory like the very tough tests 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.309
 physicists want to know what they are 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.549
 these tests and how are the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.839
 kids who are real athletes 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.090
 second minutes we tell you how 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.770
 always here in connection asturias 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.900
 we are here back in connection 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.000
 asturias now to gijón in an academy 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.220
 for opponents where in addition to the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.200
 tables and chairs to study 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.510
 used a lot the gym is going to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.160
 tell now eduardo why why not 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.160
 they leave eduardo there 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 Well, because it 's an academy that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.690
 mainly prepares kids and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.150
 maids for police local police 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.860
 national civil guard or firefighters and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 you all know that next to the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.530
 theory use psychotechnical a good part 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.000
 from that position the weight is carried by 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.250
 very hard physical evidence tests 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 physical therefore that's why they have a 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.899
 own gym where they can train 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.149
 each of the tests already know that there 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.159
 a note that is a 10 and everyone has to 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.960
 try to get to that 10 to get 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.600
 the maximum possible score that then 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.190
 make media with the theory it's true that 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.539
 then that psychotherapist has to pass 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.149
 that personando interview and also 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.830
 they will value therefore a little 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.780
 psychology the most psychological aspect of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.700
 that person who will then have a 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
 very serious responsibility I want 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.509
 introduce them to chema is the coordinator 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.130
 of this academy very good afternoon in 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.170
 the good cuts always surrounded by 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.180
 future aspiring positive ones of those 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.130
 places civil guard police 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.710
 firemen and vice has already a few 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.550
 years you have experience if we go 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.020
 twelve years goes for thirteen years already 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.270
 working with these kids and good 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.610
 I was quite happy we were 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.680
 we physically prepare also theory 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.750
 you even have a driving school because 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.400
 at least the firefighters have to 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.560
 take out that truck license to be able to 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.170
 handle the typical fire truck 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.230
 and in the oppositions that we 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.180
 we prepare the driving licenses are 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.390
 important because they demand it for all 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.150
 even as you just said firefighters 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.270
 it's the biggest level of demand 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 because they demand until I have the cema I know that 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.350
 for example for five seats each 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.300
 neighbor well what today is a 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.000
 a very high level of demand because 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.020
 apart from being difficult to remove then 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.630
 It costs money is the 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.270
 the highest driving license level 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.210
 every year every month you have 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.400
 aspirants preparing as I say both 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.980
 theoretical as physically however not 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.270
 every year they will make oppositions not 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.800
 traditionally for national body of 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.530
 police and civil guard every year 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.010
 lately they come out very few one 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.250
 10% of the casualties that occur 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.380
 annually but they are coming out and in 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.170
 local police because it depends on the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.060
 municipalities gijón for example until the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.060
 moment of the crisis every two years 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.120
 just twelve to fifteen seats and other 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.860
 small town halls - or firefighters 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.200
 also that when I 'm already taking five 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.570
 places until these last years and now 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.240
 same as there is very little in perspective and 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.130
 five places for oviedo and good looks 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.710
 be that is going to move a little gijón in 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.690
 local police and firemen but good 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.940
 it will be from here to spring right now 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.580
 we see only in this bodybuilding room to 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.140
 guys are more and more girls that 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420
 are presented to this type of positions 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.480
 they are scared by physical evidence or they are 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.610
 as brave as them, good woman 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.609
 is integrated into these bodies but 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.459
 still 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.829
 let's say the percentage is small and about 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.409
 everything in firemen in firemen 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.150
 for example in Gijón there is a girl in 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.250
 all the staff and in oviedo there is no 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.620
 none and in return of the principality 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.169
 there is no either, that is, the thing 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.030
 it's quite complicated we see the 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.740
 guys doing bench press and we have to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.180
 Roberto here that is preparing the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.680
 position for firefighters the first time 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.930
 what is going to present is doing 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.650
 dominated roberto up may be one of 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.650
 the toughest tests 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.430
 let 's not forget the rope then 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.229
 We will also see that it also has its 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.930
 safe technique to follow but if 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.900
 dominated accounts you have to do then 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.479
 that depends on the place that we go to 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.219
 introduce us but good in Gijón 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.409
 we do not have to test for pull - ups in 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.029
 álvarez because normally if it's true 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.000
 that there is a minimum and then there is a maximum 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:11.840
 also to get that 10 in pro - 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.599
 here in gijón 10 and there is a mark at 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.460
 Mark the best note of the campaign 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.479
 previous of the previous positions 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.630
 Mark 10 and if you can pass that 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.760
 clean that butt area next that note 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.490
 will mark the best note of that of that 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.410
 good season I do not know how you train 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.880
 the dominated you mark one I'm going to do 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.830
 four series of 10 dominated by 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.210
 example to the pan terminals then 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.610
 doing doing attends 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.080
 doing there is no other way and then the 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.240
 that you find swimming more difficult 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.930
 because you have acting you have a career 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.650
 sprint speed yes good I speak for 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.540
 that Gijón here in Gijón we only have 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.000
 race the 3,000 meters and after 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.740
 we have a swimming test we have 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.259
 climb the rope 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.539
 and we have we have free snatch with 60 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:04.819
 with 60 kilos but good later in others 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:06.710
 sites there are shoveling of those to which 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.250
 we have here right behind the room 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.229
 fitness 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.539
 gracias.roberto is where are the 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.389
 famous tests of rope and shovel 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.520
 sand to transport from a cubicle 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.900
 a few kilos of sand that now 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.539
 I do not remember how many they are but they are 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.190
 many pass them to another to another cubicle 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.330
 with the help of a shovel or also a 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.919
 of good toughest tests is 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.900
 that actually to overcome the test 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.280
 of firefighter all physical evidence 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.110
 to overcome the position all the 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.599
 physical evidence is very hard we will continue 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.940
 with these future lads police 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.800
 some of them the best futures 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.300
 police, civil guards or firemen are 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.650
 a few minutes we are again this 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.650
 chain in the center of Gijón until now
