00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
I'm not convinced I could do this with

00:00:50.080 --> 00:01:02.220 
I'm not convinced I could do this with
two<00:00:50.350> hands<00:00:50.980> oh<00:00:53.130> can<00:00:54.130> I<00:00:54.190> use<00:00:54.370> that<00:00:54.400> lip

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.220 

it's<00:01:02.800> half<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.310> million<00:01:03.640> dollars<00:01:04.330> if<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:05.020> could

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
pick it up and walk out that door I

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.670 
pick it up and walk out that door I
could<00:01:07.720> have<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:09.220> I<00:01:09.250> can't<00:01:09.840> pick<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:10.870> up

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680

the science of extracting it and all
that<00:02:10.769> was<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.580> interesting

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
that was really interesting
