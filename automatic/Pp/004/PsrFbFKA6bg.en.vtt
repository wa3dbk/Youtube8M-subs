00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.860
 hello and welcome to after 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.230
 Approved com was called the markus with the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.529
 foto quantum violin tripod that of pro 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.720
 studio 360 is distributed and that one 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.880
 great helper in the studio in the middle 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.259
 here you can tilt very quickly 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.609
 and just in different angles 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:31.210
 can set the violin 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.990
 move out to a maximum of 225 of the city 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.220
 iwe 185 so the game offered this 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.990
 win two connections 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.950
 different threads and can be 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.970
 also insert something different here 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.160
 the application can be extended behind 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.340
 one counterweight for example 2 so 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.170
 15 liters of water bottles in the front 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.670
 can then weigh up to six kilos 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.280
 how this system will flash a 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.770
 bit of accessories are attached though 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.020
 also has a ball head as I him 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.780
 here it would be possible to have one 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.320
 camera attached to recordings over 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.540
 to make head 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.500
 also helps restore the conversion 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 possibility of the game 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.320
 Of course, these are also big ones 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.060
 studio flash heads as I said six 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.229
 kilogram of course you need next 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.210
 the counterweight 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.090
 and here I had a little video 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.250
 setup with a softbox on the violin stand 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.180
 then really nice soft light of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.729
 get up 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.210
 as a result of this is for example 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.210
 this shot two photo quantum lamps 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.970
 left and right and just the softbox on 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.890
 gallows tripod from the top and it's a great one 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.190
 thing for just under 100 euros 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.630
