00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.610
 good in this video lesson will teach 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.310
 edit video through motion is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.670
 very cool this move to 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.560
 beginners 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 then you have the sony vegas whats more 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.689
 professionals are practically nifty 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.720
 come on, I have here to add 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.720
 videos and photos take any video 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.149
 doubt 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.010
 When you get the video, it will not 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.040
 so it will appear more or 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.950
 less so the advice would you do to 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.550
 keep trying to get closer 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.399
 what you want to edit is come here 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.739
 a 1 gives one more drag you had until 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.890
 the end that is more detailed the sound 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.800
 When you're right, let's suppose 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.379
 happened here I want to dictate or be 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.240
 and cut exactly the live at that point 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.580
 here and here to dictate who to divide then 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.799
 I'm already editing videos let's suppose 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.670
 want to cut this part here spent 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.950
 Girl talking I want after she dictates 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.420
 also editing the two parts does not 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.830
 I want to take this fee just did not fall in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.990
 up and delete 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.990
 ready now you run 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.000
 ok let's do something now 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 quite interesting that people sometimes 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 before long enough program arrived 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.259
 This is what generate the video like you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.960
 write to the cell phone sometimes the image 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.780
 to record so much better than 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.610
 he brought a novelty that is general I see 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.500
 he is capable in the very movement that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.500
 rotate the image no longer need to download 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 programs asks to see the video because the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.899
 people end up worsening wrong that it is 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.119
 common here in general as well as present 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.090
 video that is only you cut I'll teach 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:05.540
 the works video lesson to insert photos 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.540
