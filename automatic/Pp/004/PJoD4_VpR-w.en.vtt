the transistors here the capacitors and
the<00:01:34.229> coils<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.549> meant<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.970> up<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the coils are all meant to up the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.780 
the coils are all meant to up the
voltage<00:01:36.930> from<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.380> 12-volt<00:01:37.799> DC<00:01:38.130> supply

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
voltage from your 12-volt DC supply

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.390 
voltage from your 12-volt DC supply
change<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> AC<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.590> take<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
change it in the AC and take it up to a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580 
change it in the AC and take it up to a
couple<00:01:41.759> hundred<00:01:41.880> volts<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.140> audio

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
couple hundred volts so that the audio

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
couple hundred volts so that the audio
section<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.700> take<00:01:44.939> your<00:01:45.119> signal<00:01:45.570> from<00:01:45.750> your

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
section can take your signal from your

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.160 
section can take your signal from your
head<00:01:46.170> unit<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.299> output<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.810> an

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
head unit and output that at an

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.350 
head unit and output that at an
extremely<00:01:49.979> high<00:01:50.250> voltage<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.090> lower

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
extremely high voltage it's lower

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.679 
extremely high voltage it's lower
current<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> very<00:01:52.829> high<00:01:53.070> voltage<00:01:53.689> AC

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
current but it's a very high voltage AC

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.950 
current but it's a very high voltage AC
signal<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> output<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.479> pretty

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
signal to the output so you have pretty

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.139 
signal to the output so you have pretty
much<00:01:58.140> half<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.649> amplifiers<00:01:59.310> dedicated

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
much half of this amplifiers dedicated

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.109 
much half of this amplifiers dedicated
to<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> audio<00:02:01.110> amplification<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
to the audio amplification and the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.920 
to the audio amplification and the
signal<00:02:03.990> processing<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:05.689> crossover<00:02:06.689> has<00:02:06.869> a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
signal processing the crossover has a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.719 
signal processing the crossover has a
low-pass<00:02:07.380> crossover<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
low-pass crossover because this is a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.750 
low-pass crossover because this is a
subwoofer<00:02:09.209> amplifier<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.580> your

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
subwoofer amplifier and you have your

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.309 
subwoofer amplifier and you have your
bass<00:02:12.030> control<00:02:12.480> knob<00:02:12.599> they<00:02:13.050> give

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
bass control knob they give

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.020 
bass control knob they give
a good<00:02:13.590> amount<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.920> wire<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.489> mount<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.819> up

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
a good amount of wire to mount that up

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.449 
a good amount of wire to mount that up
on<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.329> dash<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.469> thing<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.799> pretty<00:02:16.859> over

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
on the dash so this thing is pretty over

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.640 
on the dash so this thing is pretty over
built<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.329> if<00:02:18.480> he<00:02:18.599> asked<00:02:18.930> me<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.079> think<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.499> has

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
built and if he asked me I think it has

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.470 
built and if he asked me I think it has
a<00:02:19.680> really<00:02:20.129> nice<00:02:20.280> look<00:02:20.639> to<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.239> it's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
a really nice look to it and it's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.149 
a really nice look to it and it's
amazing<00:02:21.749> that<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> technology<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.069> this

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
amazing that the technology in this

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.509 
amazing that the technology in this
amplifier<00:02:23.849> just<00:02:24.659> maybe<00:02:25.260> eight<00:02:25.769> years<00:02:26.310> ago

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
amplifier just maybe eight years ago

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.729 
amplifier just maybe eight years ago
would<00:02:26.909> have<00:02:26.939> been<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.510> six<00:02:28.230> hundred<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.709> a

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
would have been a six hundred to a

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.679 
would have been a six hundred to a
thousand<00:02:29.189> dollar<00:02:29.370> amplifier<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.359> here<00:02:30.569> you

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
thousand dollar amplifier and here you

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.449 
thousand dollar amplifier and here you
get<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.260> third<00:02:31.799> about<00:02:32.189> half<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.760> cost<00:02:34.459> now

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
get it a third about half that cost now

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.849 
get it a third about half that cost now
I<00:02:35.519> have<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:36.060> one<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.329> their<00:02:36.450> woofers<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:37.680> is

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
I have here one of their woofers this is

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.879 
I have here one of their woofers this is
the<00:02:38.010> Vivi<00:02:38.280> x-15<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.389> a<00:02:39.510> 600<00:02:40.109> watt<00:02:40.260> RMS

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
the Vivi x-15 this is a 600 watt RMS

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.050 
the Vivi x-15 this is a 600 watt RMS
woofer<00:02:41.310> line<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.849> it's<00:02:42.749> a<00:02:43.129> very<00:02:44.129> nice<00:02:44.370> robust

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
woofer line and it's a very nice robust

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.240 
woofer line and it's a very nice robust
Wolfer<00:02:45.629> I<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:46.169> the<00:02:46.319> butyl<00:02:46.709> rubber<00:02:46.739> surround

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
Wolfer I like the butyl rubber surround

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.659 
Wolfer I like the butyl rubber surround
and<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.819> polypropylene<00:02:48.659> cap<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:49.889> also<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
and the polypropylene cap here also the

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.479 
and the polypropylene cap here also the
gasket<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.449> let<00:02:51.689> it<00:02:51.810> seal<00:02:52.049> against<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.769> baffle

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
gasket to let it seal against the baffle

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.339 
gasket to let it seal against the baffle
when<00:02:53.609> you<00:02:53.730> mount<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> now<00:02:54.719> this<00:02:54.959> thing<00:02:55.169> has

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
when you mount it now this thing has

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.589 
when you mount it now this thing has
unique<00:02:55.980> cooling<00:02:56.400> feature<00:02:56.699> on<00:02:56.969> the<00:02:57.090> top<00:02:57.329> of<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
unique cooling feature on the top of the

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.709 
unique cooling feature on the top of the
pole<00:02:57.870> piece<00:02:58.199> which<00:02:58.980> obviously<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.819> can't<00:03:00.299> see

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
pole piece which obviously you can't see

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.250 
pole piece which obviously you can't see
and<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.949> vent<00:03:02.609> in<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.849> back<00:03:03.449> plate<00:03:03.810> here

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
and the vent in the back plate here

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.379 
and the vent in the back plate here
along<00:03:04.769> with<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:05.040> spider<00:03:05.370> plateau<00:03:05.969> venting

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
along with the spider plateau venting

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.470 
along with the spider plateau venting
and<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.049> former<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:08.099> coil<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.730> vented

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
and the former of the coil is vented

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.149 
and the former of the coil is vented
itself<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.169> there's<00:03:10.379> a<00:03:10.439> lot<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.650> cooling

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
itself so there's a lot of cooling

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.709 
itself so there's a lot of cooling
techniques<00:03:11.669> here<00:03:11.939> to<00:03:12.090> keep<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:12.449> thing

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
techniques here to keep this thing

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.740 
techniques here to keep this thing
running<00:03:13.079> reliably<00:03:13.980> even<00:03:14.699> when<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.419> over

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
running reliably even when you over

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.159 
running reliably even when you over
power

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
power

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.539 
power
you<00:03:16.799> know<00:03:16.949> if<00:03:17.159> you<00:03:17.400> don't<00:03:17.759> run<00:03:18.060> clipping<00:03:18.720> it

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
you know if you don't run clipping it

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.890 
you know if you don't run clipping it
into<00:03:20.549> your<00:03:20.759> subwoofer<00:03:21.120> out<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.750> your

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
into your subwoofer out of your

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.050 
into your subwoofer out of your
amplifier<00:03:22.409> you<00:03:22.859> can<00:03:22.889> overpower<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.909> this

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
amplifier you can overpower and this

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.960 
amplifier you can overpower and this
thing<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.479> over<00:03:25.079> built<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.919> handle<00:03:26.370> things

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
thing is over built to handle things

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.429 
thing is over built to handle things
like<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.509> so<00:03:27.750> if<00:03:27.870> you're<00:03:27.989> playing<00:03:28.229> up<00:03:28.409> to

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
like that so if you're playing up to

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.129 
like that so if you're playing up to
about<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.799> thousand<00:03:29.310> watts<00:03:29.459> clean<00:03:29.879> power<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.509> say

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
about a thousand watts clean power I say

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.719 
about a thousand watts clean power I say
this<00:03:31.319> thing<00:03:31.530> will<00:03:31.709> handle<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.159> just<00:03:32.430> nicely

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
this thing will handle it just nicely

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.110 
this thing will handle it just nicely
now<00:03:33.449> it's<00:03:33.629> actually<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.049> paper<00:03:34.290> cone<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.159> look

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
now it's actually a paper cone and look

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.170 
now it's actually a paper cone and look
at<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.389> if<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.079> can<00:03:37.229> see<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.769> here<00:03:38.180> nice

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
at the if you can see this here nice

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.030 
at the if you can see this here nice

or any possibility of tearing so this

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:57.289 
or any possibility of tearing so this
thing<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.209> built<00:03:54.479> pretty<00:03:54.810> tough<00:03:55.229> and<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:57.000> does

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
thing is built pretty tough and it does

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.449 
thing is built pretty tough and it does
remind<00:03:57.540> me<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> little<00:03:58.109> bit<00:03:58.379> of<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.650> MTX<00:03:59.250> eight

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
remind me a little bit of the MTX eight

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.890 
remind me a little bit of the MTX eight
thousands<00:03:59.969> from<00:04:00.150> years<00:04:00.359> ago<00:04:00.419> which<00:04:00.750> were

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
thousands from years ago which were

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.830 
thousands from years ago which were
top-of-the-line<00:04:01.409> so<00:04:02.159> this<00:04:02.340> being<00:04:02.639> a<00:04:03.030> 600<00:04:03.810> watt

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
top-of-the-line so this being a 600 watt

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.580 
top-of-the-line so this being a 600 watt
RMS<00:04:04.469> well<00:04:04.919> for<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.189> think<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.579> very<00:04:05.909> underrated

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
RMS well for I think is very underrated

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.050
