covergirl foundation and the reason i'm
using<00:00:51.250> this<00:00:51.400> is<00:00:51.640> because<00:00:52.150> it<00:00:52.300> has<00:00:52.329> SPF<00:00:52.690> in<00:00:53.230> it

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
using this is because it has SPF in it

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.680 
using this is because it has SPF in it
i'm<00:00:53.500> only<00:00:53.949> using<00:00:54.129> this<00:00:54.430> as<00:00:54.640> a<00:00:54.670> concealer<00:00:55.239> under

i'm only using this as a concealer under
my<00:00:55.720> eyes<00:00:55.870> because<00:00:56.379> i<00:00:56.410> have<00:00:56.650> really<00:00:57.040> dark

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
do this unless you feel like you need to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.509

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.970 
this and putting it in the crease of my
eye<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.240> yes<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.900> probably<00:02:13.930> could<00:02:14.680> do<00:02:14.830> this

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
eye and yes you probably could do this

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.860 
eye and yes you probably could do this
before<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.490> do<00:02:15.610> your<00:02:15.640> eyeliner<00:02:15.880> but<00:02:16.660> I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
before you do your eyeliner but I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.330 
before you do your eyeliner but I
figured<00:02:17.260> since<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.860> kind<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.220> an

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
figured since this is kind of an

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.280 
figured since this is kind of an
optional<00:02:18.880> step<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.330> don't<00:02:19.540> have<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.990> do<00:02:20.110> this

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
optional step you don't have to do this

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.870 
optional step you don't have to do this
I<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.680> kind<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.950> felt<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.460> doing<00:02:21.790> it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
I just kind of felt like doing it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.300 
I just kind of felt like doing it
because<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.120> wanted<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.600> more<00:02:22.870> makeup<00:02:23.860> makeup

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
because I wanted a more makeup makeup

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.120 
because I wanted a more makeup makeup
look<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.210> makes<00:02:25.480> any<00:02:25.660> sense<00:02:25.840> at<00:02:26.290> all<00:02:26.320> but

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
look if that makes any sense at all but

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.500 
look if that makes any sense at all but
anyways<00:02:27.490> because<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.210> cream

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
anyways because this is the cream

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.150 
anyways because this is the cream
eyeshadow<00:02:29.020> it's<00:02:29.260> actually<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.830> stay<00:02:29.980> on

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
eyeshadow it's actually going to stay on

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.590 
eyeshadow it's actually going to stay on
our<00:02:30.190> eyelids<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:30.880> much<00:02:31.090> longer<00:02:31.420> than<00:02:31.540> a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
our eyelids so much longer than a

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.810 
our eyelids so much longer than a
regular<00:02:31.660> eyeshadow<00:02:32.260> would<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.520> went

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
regular eyeshadow would and I went

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.940 
regular eyeshadow would and I went
swimming<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.330> this<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.690> my<00:02:34.720> eyelids<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.560> it's

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
swimming with this on my eyelids so it's

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.650 
swimming with this on my eyelids so it's
going<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.190> be<00:02:36.250> purpose<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.060> know<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.240> have

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
going to be purpose you know I have

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.900 
going to be purpose you know I have
proof<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.260> definitely<00:02:38.770> stays<00:02:39.160> on<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.700> then

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
proof it definitely stays on and then

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.760 
proof it definitely stays on and then
I'm<00:02:40.030> taking<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.570> again<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.350> applying<00:02:41.680> that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
I'm taking it again and applying that

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.890 
I'm taking it again and applying that
underneath<00:02:42.280> my<00:02:42.640> eyes<00:02:42.820> like<00:02:43.150> right<00:02:43.420> below<00:02:43.600> my

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
underneath my eyes like right below my

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.990 
underneath my eyes like right below my
waterline<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.620> I'm<00:02:45.160> applying<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.610> with<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
waterline and I'm applying that with a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.390 
waterline and I'm applying that with a
tapered<00:02:46.840> liner<00:02:47.350> brush<00:02:47.650> I'm<00:02:47.920> not<00:02:48.040> sure<00:02:48.220> if

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
tapered liner brush I'm not sure if

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.280 
tapered liner brush I'm not sure if
that's<00:02:48.550> what<00:02:48.670> it's<00:02:48.880> called<00:02:49.060> but<00:02:49.540> anyways<00:02:50.110> I'm

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
that's what it's called but anyways I'm

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:58.170 
that's what it's called but anyways I'm
just<00:02:50.500> doing<00:02:50.770> that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.720 

then<00:02:58.989> I'm<00:02:59.230> taking<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.680> same<00:02:59.920> liner<00:03:00.280> brush<00:03:00.519> I

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
then I'm taking the same liner brush I

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.119 
then I'm taking the same liner brush I
used<00:03:01.000> before<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.719> I'm<00:03:02.049> actually<00:03:02.260> using<00:03:02.739> that

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
used before and I'm actually using that

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.789 
used before and I'm actually using that
like<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.579> did<00:03:03.790> with<00:03:04.000> my<00:03:04.060> liquid<00:03:05.049> eyeliner<00:03:05.530> air

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
like I did with my liquid eyeliner air

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.740 
like I did with my liquid eyeliner air
quotes<00:03:06.159> but<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.459> can't<00:03:06.640> see<00:03:06.819> me<00:03:06.939> and<00:03:07.629> I'm<00:03:07.719> just

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
quotes but you can't see me and I'm just

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.660 
quotes but you can't see me and I'm just
applying<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.409> on<00:03:08.590> my<00:03:08.799> waterline<00:03:09.129> like<00:03:09.519> a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
applying that on my waterline like a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.580 
applying that on my waterline like a
stick<00:03:10.239> liner<00:03:10.510> because<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.989> didn't<00:03:11.379> really<00:03:11.469> have

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
stick liner because I didn't really have

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.490 
stick liner because I didn't really have
another<00:03:11.980> option<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.719> basically<00:03:13.959> it

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
another option and that is basically it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.309
