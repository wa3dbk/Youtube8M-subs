00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.440

 shooting on my camera which I am worth 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.449
 In general, 720 is drunk, I like it to us 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.910
 not old for 3 years already 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.000

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.090

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.380

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.040
 something without a team is also so in general a fight 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.790
 started because of the lips 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.790

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.409
