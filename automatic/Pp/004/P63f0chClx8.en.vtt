a gas can so I think there might be I

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.870 
a gas can so I think there might be I
might<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.769> left<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> gas<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> trunk

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880

in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> world<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.420> hopefully<00:01:24.420> I'll<00:01:24.510> work

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
in the world but hopefully I'll work

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.490 
in the world but hopefully I'll work
well<00:01:27.450> let's<00:01:27.720> see<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.050> can<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.410> this

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
well let's see what we can do with this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:04:31.300 
well let's see what we can do with this
thing

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.059 

there<00:04:32.310> we<00:04:32.430> go<00:04:34.699> all<00:04:35.699> I<00:04:35.729> needed<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.860> figure<00:04:37.860> to

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
there we go all I needed to figure to

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.770 
there we go all I needed to figure to
going<00:04:38.340> was<00:04:38.460> my<00:04:38.610> special<00:04:39.060> ford<00:04:39.300> tool<00:04:39.539> that's

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
going was my special ford tool that's

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.760 
going was my special ford tool that's
for<00:04:40.520> that's<00:04:41.520> for<00:04:41.669> beating<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.199> battery<00:04:43.199> cable

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
for that's for beating the battery cable

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.149 
for that's for beating the battery cable
ends<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:45.030> they<00:04:45.180> snug<00:04:45.419> up<00:04:45.569> on<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.810> battery<00:04:46.159> also

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
ends so they snug up on the battery also

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:53.330 
ends so they snug up on the battery also
works<00:04:47.490> for<00:04:47.669> opening<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.150> door<00:04:52.009> well<00:04:53.009> I've<00:04:53.190> got

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
works for opening the door well I've got

works for opening the door well I've got
at<00:04:53.460> least<00:04:53.490> one<00:04:53.789> flat<00:04:54.060> tire<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:55.340> not<00:04:56.340> gonna

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
at least one flat tire so I not gonna

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.620 
at least one flat tire so I not gonna
not<00:04:58.349> going<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.650> try<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.830> move<00:04:59.069> it<00:04:59.300> that<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.569> it
