00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620 
the next thing you want to do is that
when<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.340> spawn<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> no<00:01:54.000> one's<00:01:54.180> around<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
when you spawn and no one's around you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200 
when you spawn and no one's around you
just<00:01:55.140> stay<00:01:55.320> still<00:01:55.590> don't<00:01:55.829> move<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:56.820> don't

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just stay still don't move right don't

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.819 
just stay still don't move right don't
move<00:01:57.329> because<00:01:57.570> people<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.649> other<00:01:58.710> team

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
move because people on the other team

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.940 
move because people on the other team
will<00:01:59.369> usually<00:01:59.640> spawn<00:02:00.210> near<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.560> don't

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
will usually spawn near you so you don't

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.679 
will usually spawn near you so you don't
move<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.759> make<00:02:03.030> sure<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.420> check<00:02:03.630> your

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
move you make sure you check your

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.810 
move you make sure you check your
surroundings<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:05.159> when<00:02:05.369> no<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.759> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

in<00:02:57.660> order<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.770> camp<00:02:59.070> yes<00:02:59.520> I'm<00:02:59.790> saying<00:03:00.090> camping

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
in order to camp yes I'm saying camping

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.500 
in order to camp yes I'm saying camping
why<00:03:00.840> because<00:03:01.620> camping<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.489> one<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.360> ways

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
why because camping is one of the ways

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.740 
why because camping is one of the ways
in<00:03:03.959> order<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.770> guarantee<00:03:05.220> or<00:03:06.030> somewhat

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
in order to guarantee or somewhat

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.680 
in order to guarantee or somewhat
guarantee<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.590> good<00:03:08.250> till<00:03:08.850> death<00:03:09.030> ratio<00:03:09.239> and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
the reason why tilda tilda ratio is so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.850 
the reason why tilda tilda ratio is so
important<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.959> TDM<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.230> because<00:03:16.620> it's

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
important in TDM is because it's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.920 
important in TDM is because it's
everything<00:03:17.640> now<00:03:17.820> what<00:03:18.030> I'm<00:03:18.150> saying<00:03:18.540> here<00:03:18.630> does

everything now what I'm saying here does

not apply to rush over conquest because

not apply to rush over conquest because
camping<00:03:23.850> in<00:03:24.060> conquest<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.830> most<00:03:26.130> boring

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
camping in conquest is the most boring

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.020 
camping in conquest is the most boring
thing<00:03:26.580> ever<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:28.230> mean<00:03:28.470> like<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:29.030> insanely

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
thing ever I mean like it's insanely

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.490 
thing ever I mean like it's insanely
boring<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:31.290> camping<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.830> TDM<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.840> makes<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.380> lot

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
boring but camping in TDM it makes a lot

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.990 
boring but camping in TDM it makes a lot
more<00:03:34.560> sense<00:03:35.040> because<00:03:35.459> they're<00:03:35.760> going<00:03:35.880> to

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
more sense because they're going to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.360 
more sense because they're going to
spawn<00:03:36.269> new<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.720> eventually<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.799> if<00:03:38.220> you're

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
spawn new you eventually and if you're

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.880 
spawn new you eventually and if you're
patient<00:03:38.610> enough<00:03:38.930> when<00:03:39.930> they<00:03:40.049> spawn<00:03:40.440> near<00:03:40.650> you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890

you<00:03:41.519> have<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.700> better<00:03:41.940> advantage<00:03:42.120> which<00:03:43.079> means

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
you have a better advantage which means

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.100 
you have a better advantage which means
that<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.650> almost<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.459> guaranteed<00:03:45.299> shot

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.940 
at killing the person you're trying to
kill<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:48.000> mean<00:03:48.660> ultimately<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:49.290> really<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.650> that

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
kill I mean ultimately it really is that

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.569 
kill I mean ultimately it really is that
simple<00:03:50.360> but<00:03:51.360> then<00:03:51.600> again<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.709> see<00:03:53.310> this

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
simple but then again this is see this

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:54.800 
simple but then again this is see this
is<00:03:53.730> one<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.090> ways<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.540> could<00:03:54.690> be
