 you leave your memory card already 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.880

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.400

 you only will you and with your space 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.110
 memory card 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.550
 in case your memory card is going to be 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.780
 only an inner you will not have me 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.520
 You know it 's like you have a 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.830
 only 32 gigabyte but has a 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.539
 however you can install what the 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.460
 application if you have a card one 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.740
 30 day card like honey 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.860
 you can install an application of 16 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.650
 gigas only if the cadengue galera has 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.469
 that being small because the sinning will 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.350
 occupy the same system memory or 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:29.730
 be 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.770
 the r7 has a gigolo 8 of internal memory 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.710
 then all the sins that you 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.500
 install in vain to occupy the internal memory 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:42.990
 already the date for example here this game 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:48.540
 Here are the bands I'm not going to get another 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:52.920
 destructor is not real 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:56.640
 here he has two gigs and 36 I think 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:00.210
 I'm not mistaken, I installed it and the 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.850
 sin he who has 10 megabytes I think 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.120
 it was with real internal memory 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.170
 memory even occupying a gigabyte 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.160
 chicken 8 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:13.920
 already the date went to the card then two 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.460
 gigas and 36 since 2020 more or less 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.790
 left I have on the card and 10 megabytes 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.290
 I have in the year in internal memory 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.300
