 megapopular dreams about the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 the flying growth beautiful pun 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.930
 Truth never again about it is one 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.329
 stayer 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 yes it started a while ago with 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.960
 change some smaller devices 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.969
 these are becoming increasingly professional 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.020
 become bigger and it is important that you 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.760
 the propellers 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.739
 getting good rogierop turns is no 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.430
 big movies a lot of hassle about it 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.170
 out 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.539
 so the police were aware by this 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.309
 movies made about a brand new 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.719
 what you can do you may not be in it 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.370
 very many yes many uncertainties 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.719
 about you is of course with the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.820
 privacy law 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.719
 there is often often flown with 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.390
 a camera 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.100
 under the quadcopter and then people can 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.080
 problem of making it officially allowed 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.640
 he didn't get you just doing work 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.549
 then you will have to deal with much more 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.650
 rules and you do it as a private person 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.580
 then you also have more options here 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.360
 it remain so, how can they 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.770
 varying from 20 meters or lower but 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.610
 you too can quickly get hundreds 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.560
 meters the sky and actually 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.530
 we that such a height are the possibilities 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.750
 infinity with the right device 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.160
 so you can definitely fly but try 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.930
 it own private grounds, for example 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.330
 to do and things like that you are not allowed 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.130
 so random around by his by her 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.710
 fly for example to look sweet and 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.570
 cute but also a plane or 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.070
 a quadcopter can come down and 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.070
 You have to take that into account 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.090
 I don't know why but I also want it 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.830
 have one 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.390
 and you are not the only one per week 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.880
 once you think you can talk 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.160
 between 10 and 30 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.860
 kwanta costa per piece varying between 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.479
 the 50 and and grab more thousand euros 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.000
 the store has only just opened or the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.890
 toys for boys seeking men 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.690
 pour in despite everyone 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.570
 actually think it's for kids 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.790
 is our yes target group and not the children 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.140
 are often the the men who used it 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.580
 have wanted and now actually one 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.900
 we believe it is going to make a purchase 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.100
 money to fly 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.410
 I think it 's a lot of men 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
 those who do this as a on binding 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.230
 factor see coming few women here 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.670
 over the floor 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.370
 it's really more of a toy for 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.010
 Men in the popularity of the thing 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.180
 eye doth the noise so do n't think so 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.769
 make that the market 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.989
 has become much more accessible as 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.760
 in the past you had to do everything yourself 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.000
 put each other and the prices lower higher 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.220
 and now because everything is actually already 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.530
 mainly ready-to-fly is ready to 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.090
 for that reason it will become a piece 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.010
 more accessible also for the people who 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.900
 less captain 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.280
 that you have to purchase everything separately then 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.450
 you are simply much more expensive 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.820
 and now you have everything complete one 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.980
 package put who put such a thing also 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.670
 me 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.670
 No
