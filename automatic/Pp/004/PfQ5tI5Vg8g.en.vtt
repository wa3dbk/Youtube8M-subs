00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.510 
definitely has some pop out of the hole
definitely<00:02:13.050> uh<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.890> really<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.310> I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
definitely uh it really it's like I

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760 
definitely uh it really it's like I
having<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.790> lighter<00:02:15.000> wrap<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.569> very<00:02:16.530> good

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
having a lighter wrap on very good

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.210 
having a lighter wrap on very good
quality<00:02:18.260> didn't<00:02:19.260> hold<00:02:19.380> moisture<00:02:19.650> real<00:02:20.040> bad

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
quality didn't hold moisture real bad

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.290 
quality didn't hold moisture real bad
which<00:02:20.430> was<00:02:20.580> what<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.730> was<00:02:20.880> worried<00:02:21.240> about

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
which was what I was worried about

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.300 
which was what I was worried about
because<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.350> training<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.890> gym<00:02:22.920> with

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
because I'm not training in the gym with

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.430 
because I'm not training in the gym with
no<00:02:23.400> air<00:02:23.580> conditioners<00:02:24.030> us<00:02:24.209> pretty<00:02:24.450> warm<00:02:24.720> but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
no air conditioners us pretty warm but

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.710 
no air conditioners us pretty warm but
overall<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.640> like<00:02:27.090> them<00:02:27.270> I'm<00:02:27.510> going<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
overall I really like them I'm going to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.330 
overall I really like them I'm going to
continue<00:02:27.959> using<00:02:28.230> amendment<00:02:28.740> warm-ups<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
continue using amendment warm-ups and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.850 
continue using amendment warm-ups and
more<00:02:29.940> resilient<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.290> convenience<00:02:34.800> thing

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
more resilient just a convenience thing

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.850 
more resilient just a convenience thing
so<00:02:35.510> my<00:02:36.510> recommendation<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:37.319> they're<00:02:37.500> good<00:02:37.709> for

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
so my recommendation is they're good for

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.830 
so my recommendation is they're good for
not<00:02:38.040> only<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.400> raw<00:02:38.640> lifters<00:02:39.090> who<00:02:39.120> don't<00:02:39.660> use

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
not only just raw lifters who don't use

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.080 
not only just raw lifters who don't use
knee<00:02:40.050> wraps<00:02:40.290> but<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.220> guys<00:02:41.370> like<00:02:41.640> me<00:02:41.700> who<00:02:41.970> were

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
knee wraps but for guys like me who were

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.900 
knee wraps but for guys like me who were
