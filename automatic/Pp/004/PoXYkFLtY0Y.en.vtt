steel<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:47.420> this<00:01:47.869> one<00:01:48.109> actually<00:01:48.439> isn't<00:01:48.979> too<00:01:49.159> bad

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
steel so this one actually isn't too bad

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.029 
steel so this one actually isn't too bad
so<00:01:50.840> now<00:01:51.020> just<00:01:51.619> pour<00:01:52.130> out<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.609> water<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:54.039> then

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
I'm going to take my paper towel and

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.279 
I'm going to take my paper towel and
just<00:01:56.719> wipe<00:01:57.109> out<00:01:58.030> whatever<00:01:59.030> other<00:01:59.689> greasy

just wipe out whatever other greasy

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.300 
just wipe out whatever other greasy
liquid<00:02:01.250> that's<00:02:01.460> still<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.030> pan<00:02:03.159> okay<00:02:04.159> now

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
liquid that's still in the pan okay now

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.959 
liquid that's still in the pan okay now
I<00:02:04.340> wash<00:02:04.609> the<00:02:04.789> pan<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.799> as<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.070> can<00:02:07.189> see<00:02:07.250> just

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
I wash the pan and as you can see just

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.730 
I wash the pan and as you can see just
hot<00:02:08.119> soapy<00:02:08.479> water<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.750> wash<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.170> pan<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.710> just

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
hot soapy water to wash the pan and just

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.270 
hot soapy water to wash the pan and just
the<00:02:10.610> way<00:02:10.729> stainless<00:02:11.180> steel<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:12.080> don't<00:02:13.070> know

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the way stainless steel is I don't know

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.580 
the way stainless steel is I don't know
I<00:02:13.640> guess<00:02:14.390> that's<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:14.750> some<00:02:15.140> chemical

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
I guess that's just some chemical

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.070 
I guess that's just some chemical
reaction<00:02:16.070> high<00:02:16.280> heat<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.850> food<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.420> so

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
reaction high heat and the food and so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.250 
reaction high heat and the food and so
now<00:02:18.230> we're<00:02:18.410> going<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.950> off<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.930> we're

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
now we're going to get that off so we're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.650 
now we're going to get that off so we're
going<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.410> go<00:02:21.560> over<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.490> counter<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
going to go over to the counter and the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.479 
going to go over to the counter and the
sink<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.140> use<00:02:24.680> bar<00:02:25.489> keeper's<00:02:25.970> friend

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.399 

so<00:02:30.489> we're<00:02:31.030> going<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.209> get<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.420> pan<00:02:31.629> wet<00:02:31.930> never

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
so we're going to get the pan wet never

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.099 
so we're going to get the pan wet never
put<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:33.040> never<00:02:33.670> put<00:02:33.909> bar<00:02:34.060> keeper's<00:02:34.359> friend<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:35.049> a

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
put I never put bar keeper's friend on a
