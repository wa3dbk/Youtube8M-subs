00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
that like all the tough na teams are we

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.000 
that like all the tough na teams are we
used<00:01:32.150> all<00:01:32.300> this<00:01:32.450> we<00:01:32.960> don't<00:01:33.290> really<00:01:33.410> have<00:01:33.860> those

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
used all this we don't really have those

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.740 
used all this we don't really have those
like<00:01:34.160> tournament<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.730> scares<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.240> guess<00:01:35.420> which

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
like tournament it scares I guess which

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.080 
like tournament it scares I guess which
like<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> first-time<00:01:37.160> competitor<00:01:37.640> will

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
like a first-time competitor will

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.540 
like a first-time competitor will
probably<00:01:38.600> have<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:39.020> know<00:01:39.860> we're<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.190> underdog

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
probably have I know we're the underdog

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.460 
probably have I know we're the underdog
team<00:01:40.760> but<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.630> think<00:01:41.870> we<00:01:41.960> showed<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.320> we<00:01:42.410> were

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
team but I think we showed that we were

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.080 
team but I think we showed that we were
really<00:01:42.650> strong<00:01:42.950> we're<00:01:43.550> gonna<00:01:43.640> work<00:01:43.880> really

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
really strong we're gonna work really

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.910 
really strong we're gonna work really
