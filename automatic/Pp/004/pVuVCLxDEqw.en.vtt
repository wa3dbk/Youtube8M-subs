00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.330
 today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.350
 Tattoos 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.810
 possibly many of you have 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:17.130
 enough doubts about that 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.710
 maybe some of you I summarize 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.710
 The child does not 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.289
 it is a treble clef an eighth note and some 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.720
 one thousand eighth 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.820
 and I'm going to clarify some doubts that are 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.070
 most frequent creators 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.850
 The first question everyone asks is whether 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.010
 it hurts, it always depends on the part 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.399
 where do you get state where I give it to me 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.440
 I did in the part from down here I did not 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.140
 it hurt nothing the wrist does hurt 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.650
 pretty and up here it did not hurt either 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.410
 much 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.170
 the truth does not hurt as much as it is written 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.760
 today 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.840
 and it 's not a pain either, it's not a pain 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.840
 quite tolerable 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.309
 and 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.070
 already the second 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.220
 and the cares 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.170
 many people who wear 60 suits 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.830
 just his tattoo is touched by a 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.620
 cream that puts like a plastic paper 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.740
 you do not have to leave that much 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.880
 weather 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.490
 a lot to an hour two hours because that 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.920
 is for the hand and prevents air from entering 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.990
 and what 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.200
 the wound is healed then it is not 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.799
 recommendable to change another 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.860
 wash and put on another not better if you 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.530
 Lava paper bags with water not only 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.840
 use soaps lights nothing just water you 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.580
 you put and you bought yourself a cream that 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.650
 more famous 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.680
 and the second one that I'm using is 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.370
 a cream of the USA called tatung or 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.370
 tattoo 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.320
 Sports the cream and you stop to read not 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.320
 let's put the paper because you're not going 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.520
 the third advice would be to choose a good 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.710
 place are not made in the first place that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.910
 see it is preferable to wait a while 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.150
 more think well what they were 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.180
 think well that is for life 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.390
 that does not have to be removed 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.269
 very expensive painful tattoo choose a 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.080
 good place a neat place that they use 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.480
 new things because many people have 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.350
 dead because when getting a piercing or 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.780
 when doing 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.780
 a tattoo use contaminated things 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.390
 take you to death then 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.150
 preferable you are a very very place 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.980
 good the price 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.190
 It also depends on what you want to be the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.480
 size depends on whether it is black 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.150
 and everything depends on the pressure or if it is 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.160
 very big because it will cost you quite 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.080
 Chiquito and also in 1135 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.390
 it also seems pretty cheap 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.480
 and it was quite good the boy that I 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.360
 He says it all made me so 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.940
 I thought it was pretty 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.410
 If you have more questions than the questions 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.410
 I will try to answer them
