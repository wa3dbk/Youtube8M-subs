defending<00:06:39.040> so<00:06:39.490> deep<00:06:40.120> and<00:06:40.720> I<00:06:40.840> hate<00:06:41.140> when<00:06:41.410> teams

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
defending so deep and I hate when teams

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.420 
defending so deep and I hate when teams
do<00:06:41.920> that

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
do that

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.710 
do that
