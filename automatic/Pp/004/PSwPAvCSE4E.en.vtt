00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.309
 this sports calendar and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.649
 Nonetheless, this calendar can 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.600
 become very interesting namely 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.940
 Yesterday we invited the one 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.820
 to tell a lot about the theme of this week 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.530
 I have allegations about doping 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.799
 Sincerely welcome the Olympic champion 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.990

 christian schenk here we have them 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 on the right in the picture and on the left next to it 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:22.380
 They saw him second in the sequence 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.630
 world championships from 87 to the two 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.390
 later more to football 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.850
 last game in the eighth-final round the dfb 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.180
 club match between the fc remscheid 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.710
 and the ksv hessen kassel five 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.570
 Erstligisten stand firmly for 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.400
 quarterfinal a second division 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.590
 the seventh team will be determined in 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
 repetition game between harmony 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 frankfurt and the 1 fc saarbrücken and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.460
 the eighth participant is definitely 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.159
 an amateur team either 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.870
 remscheid or kassel and i can do it 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.729
 now a true crime promise 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.600
 wolfgang maier it was for us in 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.600
 Remscheid here 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.210
 long cliffs for a deep bottom and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.800
 a tough fight with Bengali 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.720
 fire, the crews were received 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.850
 and fire, there was a well in the space 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.160
 real pokalfight from the first to the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.870
 last minute had the first chances 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.630
 remscheid thereby kosanovic the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.430
 captain the remscheider lie in 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.230
 the upper league north rhine in second place 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.180
 only one point behind alemannia harbor 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.280
 They are similar to kassel 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.500
 moderate season beginning just in the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.560
 last played significantly increased 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.860
 andré kröning and then again to the individual 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.480
 against schmidt much confusion here in the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.390
 otherwise quite solid back team of the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.160
 ksv the remscheider always try it 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.580
 again with high flanks they have yes 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.140
 header strong kassel could the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.780
 both tips through schmelting and 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.840
 carsten lakies very mobile lakies 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.210
 kosanovic is trying it alone 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.610
 still in between 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.380
 after 26 minutes free kick for kassel of 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.570
 Thomas Freudenstein cut 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.420
 brought in and holds carsten lakies 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.790
 head out that 0 to 1 kassels leadership 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.320
 important of course because the hsv now 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.860
 his counter made even easier 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.780
 were schmelting burgeoning fast 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.500
 schmelting runs in with but no 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.440
 fast game too late from at least one 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.480
 The door to Kassel was in the air 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.660
 not only ksv coach hans-ullrich 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.670
 thumann in the second half that 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.770
 same picture remscheid again and again with 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.750
 high balls in the penalty area 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.950
 she still has some options though 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.620
 the hessians were with their counterparts 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.110
 far more dangerous 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.120
 thomas joy steinberg schmelting leaves 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.220
 pass by and then it's carsten 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.900
 lakies completely free but in such 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.590
 situations will be the goalkeeper for the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.470
 Striker just bigger and bigger just before lagos 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.720
 schmelting and again clarifies others 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.970
 stocki in gate of remscheid then again 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.709
 carsten lakies got remscheid defense 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.500
 The quick tips of the ksv never hessen 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.170
 in the grip again andré stocki the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.470
 winner and then had the goalkeeper of 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.110
 race time also luck with this 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.239
 lattenschuss of carsten lakies four 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.060
 or five to zero could have led to kassel 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.629
 can and omit the opportunities 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.640
 should take revenge 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.820
 three minutes before the conclusion of a first 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.829
 accidental defense of zoran silko and 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.840
 then it tries other kröning out of 40 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.419
 meters the ball jumps over to 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.790
 hiring a curious tor the 1 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.370
 1 just before the end of the regular 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.380
 playing time that means extension 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.760
 it speaks for kassel that the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.860
 team after this unfortunate 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.930
 Do not compensate your playful line 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.770
 lost an outstanding attack over 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.289
 short jacket 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.710
 Klaus Schäfer came in shortly before 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:47.190
 brought the ksv in the 105 minute again 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.710
 in but still in the same minute the 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.410
 renewed compensation schmidt on jakub 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.910
 gas and then through the legs of saeco 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.430
 again a curious goal 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.090
 5000 spectators were enthusiastic about the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.169
 Dramatic of this cup game second 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.570
 half of the extension 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.250
 Thomas Freudenstein can do the 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.070
 shot does not hold on to michael drube 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.780
 makes it quite clever 23 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.450
 the kasselerinnen for the third time in 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.190
 Guided tour in the 111 minutes and this time 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.440
 they did not give up the lead anymore 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.690
 they reached the quarter-finals 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.530
 of the dfb cup and can get up now 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.760
 the next opponent is looking forward to bremen 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.060
 we are looking forward to the ksv 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.580
 hessen kassel in the second league was there 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.560
 another game and that Schweinfurt im 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.479
 Trade is one to one in the amateur 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.430
 Oberliga Hessen There were two games today
