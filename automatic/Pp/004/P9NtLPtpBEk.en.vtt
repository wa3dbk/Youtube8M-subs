00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 well we are here on the site of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.080
 plant garden so a site 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.270
 historical in the heart of v 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 arrondissement of paris and more 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.910
 especially we are in the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 great gallery of evolution which is a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 nineteenth century building that was 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.789
 completely reworked in 1994 to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.039
 install this great gallery of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.960
 evolution which was an act I say 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.640
 engaged at the time talking about evolution and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.230
 make sure that the state speaks 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.030
 of evolution accepts this mobilization 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.250
 has been something already enough 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.079
 exceptional and so this building was 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.449
 fully reviewed by 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.409
 architects who was paul chemetov and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.420
 died at hamid hobereau in 1994 for 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.869
 revise the presentation of the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.610
 biodiversity of evolutionary factors and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.070
 of the place of man and the role of 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.310
 the man in this evolution visited the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 great gallery of evolution is such 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.030
 that it had been imagined in 1994 by 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.159
 amateurs 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.320
 architects it's first of all a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.390
 emotion until there is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.210
 now three years or so 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.920
 general direction of the museum wished 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 really reinvest all that and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.640
 make sure that sound and light re 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.470
 become a reality for for the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.439
 visitor that's why we worked 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.000
 the show in a different way but we 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.950
 tried it has to be even more 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 of emotion because would say from a point of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.189
 technical view what we can find 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.810
 today is what we can find 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.329
 in a movie theater 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.130
 or elsewhere it's like emotion and 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.990
 it's an emotional shock so it's 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.670
 finally we said good after all 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.079
 we are in an environment that is there 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.100
 to remind the natural environment 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.189
 so let's make sure that 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.229
 then recreate a rhythm day night 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.580
 so we work on a show that 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.220
 lasts 1h15 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.680
 we actually recreated a typical day 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:24.170
 sunrise until sunset 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:26.239
 that he leaves his storm sequences ya 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.250
 dawn and dusk when we do 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.380
 really a day a day 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.660
 complete if we are mostly focused on 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.550
 the salad and then after this thunderstorm we 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.110
 this fabulous rainbow that appears 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.280
 then we leave with birds that 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.280
 reveals to be after sorting 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.549
 he makes this gallery goes through 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.290
 extremely marked color levels 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.970
 we worked with a scenographer 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.370
 called stephanie daniel who has 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.010
 reworked all this program a 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.629
 quarter hour and with whom we pushed 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.250
 actually colors and push the 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.519
 technique so that we have 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.959
 bright orange oranges and then 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.340
 neon pink because in nature a 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.290
 sunset wine and fluo roses 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.180
 in africa that's what they look like 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.670
 we really wanted to translate all that 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.870
 and we managed to do it and that we 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.150
 take like that to sunset 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.730
 recreate shadows on the caravan of 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.480
 animals that moves and that go in 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.609
 season besides 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.250
 but we have the impression of having to 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.319
 move so we realize that that 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.049
 that this show works rather 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.760
 rather rather not bad with the visitors 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.129
 and it was this feeling anyway and all 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.629
 that overall and it looks like it's 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.230
 pass something at once through 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.610
 the sound and through 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.610
 the lighting that has been put in place
