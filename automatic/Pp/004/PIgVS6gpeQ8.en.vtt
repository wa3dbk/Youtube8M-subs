00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello dear followers of my 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.210
 today's video review channel I would 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.549
 I wanted to show you two new things in my 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.420
 system case or rather my build 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:21.510
 computer 2000 14 year it turns out 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.490
 case from the company aerocool in my opinion model 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.609
 which with no through 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.710
 again with like the full full name i 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.700
 I do not remember this body in general 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.460
 I would buy it ear for 250 hryvnia 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.379
 In my store , he became about 700 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:52.129
 hryvnia in my opinion and so in general I will say 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:56.010
 about this case the case has a seed 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.350
 all agnes yes for different cooler then 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.949
 we have it two lower 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:09.140
 it is 120 by 120 tons an inch behind 120 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.950
 inch front 200 inch rather side 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.720
 200 inch front 100 twenty and 2 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.720
 top under the table 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.280
 140 millimeters in general are still new. 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.259
 the components I have are water cooling 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.430
 from cooler master 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.310
 120 in and therefore want you 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.700
 show it all good in general 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.750
 I did not have a bottom here 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.409
 plugs and and ordinary holes as 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.190
 I have a good powerful cooling 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.950
 strong 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.200
 blows and blows air so they 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.690
 taped in order to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.540
 longer the cold air remained inside 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:05.220
 the body and the body and as it has the bottom 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.220
 power supply location 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.820
 also has built-in reobas 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.950
 that is, three buttons stop Astana 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:20.010
 stops all connected cooler 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:23.110
 fire to him turns cruise button 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.890
 Well, as if all the cooler works on the middle 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.000
 rotational speed and turbo mode this all 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.610
 running at maximum speed in mid 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.050
 the two buttons on the top are power on and 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.060
 This reboot as it has reset 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:46.170
 several cells a times two three pancake 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.569
 how then 5 x 5 cells for installation 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.079
 additional reobasa 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.670
 disk drives and other crap let's 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.670
 probably we will look we will look inside 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:14.519
 the lid opens easily 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.760
 you are a little dusty to me since 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.249
 just got finally our time as 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.069
 would shoot a video 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:26.219
 so this is our video card geforce gtx770 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.049
 since you know from the last build all 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:32.459
 components left motherboard 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:39.409
 also added currents water cooling 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:42.629
 from cooler master 120 to model 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:47.159
 that's such a thing of yourself pretty 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:52.949
 good bought her this new one for 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:56.280
 how much liquid is for 350 hryvnia to 350 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:04:01.169
 hryvnia and in the store he was already order 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:04.250
 so 950 in my hryvnia but I'm new 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:09.150
 bought it there it turns out how it happened 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:12.120
 the warehouse as if the shop closed and stayed 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.280
 after him the warehouse in general warehouse began 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.609
 sell all the things that they have 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.840
 stayed there mostly company this 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.940
 cooler master 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.130
 any cooler there are two relatives 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.570
 coolers this is 120 millimeters aerocool 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.940
 and 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.750
 200 millimeters on the side cover 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.750
 also aerocool 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.849
 so here it is here is quite 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:44.599
 good quick release clips 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:48.320
 I do not know how to call 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:51.860
 component parts 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.790
 and in front of this you can see already 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.930
 slow 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:04.180
 new cooler zalman 120 millimeters 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:07.510
 also like this roomy 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.880
 generally comes from the store with lighting and 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.340
 so understood me on not cheated us 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.050
 a little bit there is still one at 140 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.900
 millimeters nest where you can put 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.720
 one more cooler and at the bottom, as it were, at 120 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:27.310
 millimeters by the way in my even 140 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:30.430
 fit did not measure I do not know you can close 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.390
 now let's show you on 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.480
 rather, this cable and cable management 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:41.440
 what is he called apologize 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.440
 now bolt twist 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:11.960
 put it means on another place on 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:14.840
 the other side so from the chest is our cap 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.370
 now there is no floor as there is a cable there and or 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:24.770
 so fit the cap a little belly 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:28.659
 now I like shooting of I told you straight 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.659
 the prophet bitch without scratching 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:43.490
 so here males from the stage clamped 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:48.499
 ties these are obtained connectors 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:53.779
 this one go like jan bass it 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:57.529
 200mm cooler plug in here 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:59.689
 so here is mounted processor rather 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:01.669
 water cooling on the processor water block 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:03.800
 By the way, I have a little more 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.529
 this one had to be tweaked 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.250
 foam rubber steps because for some reason 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:13.550
 they turned out to be too long and when i 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.189
 I will become myself but this one when I became them 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:20.620
 the water unit is a little in place at 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:20.620
