00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.759
 good 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.759
 [Music] 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.260
 hello that such friends today in this video 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.599
 I'm going to show you an application with the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.990
 that they will be able to hack their games and have 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:23.120
 all the currencies that you want 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.310
 this application is called game hacker 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.640
 to be able to use it they need to be 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.600
 good root user first we're going to 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.600
 open the application 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.050
 As you can see there, he says he has already had 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.570
 superuser permissions and it shows up 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.670
 this little window here we're going to 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.640
 minimize giving it here in the hairline 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.800
 from here and now we will have to enter 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.020
 game that we want to hack for example 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.590
 I'm going to enter this one here, I already 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.110
 I have modified but we are going to add 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.590
 other changes also for you 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.590
 can see 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.909
 [Music] 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.950
 good once already here in the game 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.770
 as they see when we open the first time 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.710
 application we were made this little 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.399
 floating icon which we can open 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.210
 from here they are in the game and as you see 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.210
 has already detected that we are in the game 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.920
 let's minimize it again and good 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.680
 as you see here I already have all the coins 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.900
 to work we have to 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.000
 to write first in the amount 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.220
 of coins that we have in this case I'm going 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.680
 to notice the amount I have 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.810
 we just press and this appears 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.120
 small keyboard 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.120
 [Music] 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.619
 [Music] 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.479
 as you see and I noticed the amount that I have of 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.030
 coins and we give you here in search 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.950
 the game will stay a little slow but 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.560
 Once it's finished, it will come back 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.629
 the normality as you see here throws us 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.670
 these results what we will have to 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.880
 do is give again here in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.710
 modify values 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.020
 here we come and here we are going to put the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.470
 amount we want to have of coins 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.900
 we are going to put for example this way by the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.540
 nine and we give you here to modify 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.689
 as good says modification made 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.709
 Here as you can see we have already been 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:45.450
 put the amount that we put if 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.959
 It works like I'm going to buy here 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.530
 ammunition and as you can see there we are getting off 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.440
 the money 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.940
 in this way, they can advance more 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.060
 quickly in the games 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.090
 and then also 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.800
 and make it a little easier I hope that 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.130
