00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 these men who defy the laws of the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.620
 severity 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.240
 probe freerunner the free run this is the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.809
 acrobatic version of the art of 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.599
 displacement 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 the principle invent new ones 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.100
 routes to move in a way 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.840
 more efficient in the city ​​but 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.449
 behind these spectacular performances 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.800
 there is an intensive free run workout 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.970
 it's something very complete 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 since it comes from different sports 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.140

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.199
 parts of your body so there are 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.120
 everything that is important the arms the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.590
 legs need that the muscles be 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.000
 reinforced at the joints 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.540
 so that's why we have 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.750
 physical workouts their key word 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 freedom here no need for stadiums or 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 two gyms the street furniture allows 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.000
 to make the most beautiful figures 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.579
 acrobatic 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.030
 but before you get there you have to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.430

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.100
 go for it nickel branch without 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 neglect the danger all that is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.240
 prepare one is not in the process of 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.560
 look at an obstacle say good 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.580
 Come on we'll go we'll go over 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.040
 one really still make it all 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 test here we test if we have our 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.180
 hunters who looks good 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.860

 daredevils it's really very 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.229
 thoughtful discipline can be

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.159
 also low hens and if we want to do 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.159
 that too 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.829
 for the free run practitioners it is 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.189
 important to transmit the philosophy 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.630
 from this sport to new generations 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.880

 and when we have children kids who 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.670

 who makes me happy when I 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.159
