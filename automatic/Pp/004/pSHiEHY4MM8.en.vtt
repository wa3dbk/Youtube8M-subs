00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
something that would be a thin case

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.289 
something that would be a thin case

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
so that when you lay it flat on its back

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.469 
so that when you lay it flat on its back
it's<00:03:44.379> flush<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.970> camera<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:48.030> protrudes<00:03:49.030> from

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
it's flush that camera it protrudes from

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
was for me another plus one huge problem

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.460 
was for me another plus one huge problem
I<00:04:41.509> had<00:04:41.780> though<00:04:42.169> was<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:43.810> access<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.169> mute

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470

button here you can take a look
that's<00:04:49.099> recessed<00:04:49.759> so<00:04:50.120> it's<00:04:50.300> really<00:04:50.569> hard<00:04:50.930> to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
that's recessed so it's really hard to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.790 
that's recessed so it's really hard to
get<00:04:51.259> to<00:04:51.639> it's<00:04:52.639> not<00:04:53.000> impossible<00:04:53.599> but<00:04:54.229> it's<00:04:54.590> just

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
get to it's not impossible but it's just

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.920 
get to it's not impossible but it's just
hard<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:57.440> other<00:04:57.469> thing<00:04:58.099> is<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:59.449> outline

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
hard the other thing is that the outline

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.939 
hard the other thing is that the outline
of<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:01.370> inner<00:05:01.699> casing<00:05:02.150> is<00:05:02.659> black<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.500> that

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
of the inner casing is black and that

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.550 
of the inner casing is black and that
makes<00:05:04.219> my<00:05:04.430> iPhone<00:05:04.909> 6<00:05:05.330> screen<00:05:05.840> appear<00:05:06.319> a<00:05:06.349> little

makes my iPhone 6 screen appear a little

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.420 
makes my iPhone 6 screen appear a little
smaller<00:05:07.190> than<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.669> actually<00:05:07.819> is<00:05:08.860> plus<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:10.250> also

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
smaller than it actually is plus it also

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.969 
smaller than it actually is plus it also
adds<00:05:10.879> a<00:05:11.090> little<00:05:11.270> more<00:05:11.389> width<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.349> the<00:05:12.379> iPhone<00:05:12.949> 6

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
adds a little more width to the iPhone 6

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.580 
adds a little more width to the iPhone 6
overall<00:05:13.819> so<00:05:14.330> it<00:05:14.479> does<00:05:14.659> take<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:14.990> little<00:05:15.229> getting

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
overall so it does take a little getting

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.040 
overall so it does take a little getting
used<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.009> but<00:05:16.370> once<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.360> got<00:05:17.539> used<00:05:17.599> to<00:05:17.930> the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
used to but once I got used to the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.230 
used to but once I got used to the
screen<00:05:18.680> size<00:05:19.039> and<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:20.479> add<00:05:20.599> it<00:05:20.810> with<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.680> me

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
rotation the cons just weren't enough to

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.490 
rotation the cons just weren't enough to
make<00:05:30.949> me<00:05:31.099> not<00:05:31.400> want<00:05:31.430> to<00:05:31.819> use<00:05:32.029> this<00:05:32.270> case<00:05:32.599> this
