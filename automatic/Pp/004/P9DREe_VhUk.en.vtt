hi<00:00:01.470> and<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.940> is<00:00:03.120> Pluto<00:00:03.330> our<00:00:03.840> four<00:00:04.290> year<00:00:04.440> old

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
hi and this is Pluto our four year old

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
hi and this is Pluto our four year old
faker<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:06.020> today<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.500> are<00:00:07.740> going<00:00:07.920> to<00:00:08.130> practice

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
faker and today we are going to practice

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.589 
faker and today we are going to practice
some<00:00:09.049> hop<00:00:10.049> up<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.820> show<00:00:12.089> you<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.269> technique

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
some hop up and show you the technique

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.649 
some hop up and show you the technique
that<00:00:12.629> we<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.459> when<00:00:14.459> training<00:00:14.969> sugar<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.449> do

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:15.659 
that we use when training sugar to do

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.980 
that we use when training sugar to do
hop<00:00:15.839> ups<00:00:16.049> as<00:00:17.150> some<00:00:18.150> people<00:00:18.300> call<00:00:18.600> them<00:00:18.690> step

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
hop ups as some people call them step

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.240 
hop ups as some people call them step
ups<00:00:20.060> it's<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.420> important<00:00:21.870> to<00:00:21.990> teach<00:00:22.200> your

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
ups it's really important to teach your

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.029 
ups it's really important to teach your
parrot<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.870> about<00:00:24.870> tree<00:00:25.230> step<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:28.039> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
parrot to do about tree step up and the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.760 
parrot to do about tree step up and the
reason<00:00:29.520> for<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:31.350> they're<00:00:31.680> an

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
reason for this is that if they're an

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.209 
reason for this is that if they're an
installation<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.289> change<00:00:34.289> situation<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.129> if

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
installation and change situation or if

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.649 
installation and change situation or if
they're<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.399> someone's<00:00:35.820> shoulder<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.480> your

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:36.659 
they're on someone's shoulder on your

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.029 
they're on someone's shoulder on your
own<00:00:36.780> shoulder<00:00:37.199> or<00:00:37.320> you're<00:00:37.440> trying<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> get<00:00:37.800> off

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
own shoulder or you're trying to get off

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.880 
own shoulder or you're trying to get off
the<00:00:38.070> cage<00:00:38.429> to<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.420> able<00:00:39.510> she<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:40.019> response

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the cage to be able she would response

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.910 
the cage to be able she would response
when<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.670> ask<00:00:41.850> her<00:00:42.449> to<00:00:42.659> hop<00:00:42.839> up<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.319> then<00:00:43.679> type

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
when you ask her to hop up and then type

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.479 
when you ask her to hop up and then type
up<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.370> makes<00:00:44.699> it<00:00:44.850> easier<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:46.489> cooperate

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
up it just makes it easier to cooperate

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.680 
up it just makes it easier to cooperate
and<00:00:47.729> and<00:00:48.120> manage<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> way<00:00:49.199> you<00:00:49.260> need<00:00:49.499> to<00:00:50.690> it's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and and manage the way you need to it's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.430 
and and manage the way you need to it's
very<00:00:51.749> important<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.210> when<00:00:54.409> you<00:00:55.409> are

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
very important that when you are

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.959 
very important that when you are
training<00:00:56.069> and<00:00:56.659> your<00:00:57.659> parish<00:00:58.699> starts<00:00:59.699> biting

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
training and your parish starts biting

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.899 
training and your parish starts biting
you<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.659> it<00:01:00.899> becomes<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.409> fee<00:01:01.799> or<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.429> whatnot

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
you or it becomes a fee or and whatnot

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.710 
you or it becomes a fee or and whatnot
that<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.409> pull<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:04.800> hand<00:01:05.010> away<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.720> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that you don't pull my hand away and you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
that you don't pull my hand away and you
don't<00:01:06.840> show<00:01:07.110> any<00:01:07.140> fear<00:01:07.560> towards<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.130> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
don't show any fear towards that you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.010 
don't show any fear towards that you
just<00:01:08.430> potential<00:01:08.930> happening<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.940> continue

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
just potential happening and continue

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.840 
just potential happening and continue
the<00:01:13.020> training<00:01:13.260> session<00:01:16.160> as<00:01:17.160> soon<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.550> you<00:01:17.670> do

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the training session as soon as you do

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.440 
the training session as soon as you do
show<00:01:18.120> some<00:01:18.480> sort<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.840> response<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.820> parrot

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
show some sort of response to a parrot

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.850 
show some sort of response to a parrot
body<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.560> becomes<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.010> game<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:25.500> will

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
body it then becomes a game and it will

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.410 
body it then becomes a game and it will
be<00:01:25.920> something<00:01:26.340> they'll<00:01:26.550> do<00:01:26.760> on<00:01:26.940> a<00:01:26.970> regular

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
be something they'll do on a regular

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.150 
be something they'll do on a regular
basis<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.050> just<00:01:28.080> make<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.530> difficult<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
basis and just make it difficult to

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.450 
basis and just make it difficult to
control<00:01:29.520> them<00:01:29.820> under<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.480> circumstances<00:01:34.460> in

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
control them under the circumstances in

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.870 
control them under the circumstances in
a<00:01:35.820> general<00:01:36.240> rule<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.480> thumb<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.880> usually

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
a general rule of thumb is that usually

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
a general rule of thumb is that usually
parents<00:01:39.780> become<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.050> little<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.320> attached<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
parents become a little bit attached to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.460 
parents become a little bit attached to
their<00:01:40.920> cage<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:42.960> trying<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
their cage and so if you're trying to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.790 
their cage and so if you're trying to
train<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.520> step<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.620> it's<00:01:46.620> usually

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
train them to step up it's usually

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.400 
train them to step up it's usually
easier<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.120> train<00:01:48.330> them<00:01:48.510> away<00:01:48.720> from<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> cage

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
easier to train them away from the cage

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.460 
easier to train them away from the cage
so<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.280> they're<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.610> trying<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.330> find<00:01:52.230> a<00:01:52.320> way

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so that they're not trying to find a way

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.860 
so that they're not trying to find a way
to<00:01:52.530> get<00:01:52.710> back<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.160> cage<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:56.780> when<00:01:57.780> you

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
to get back to the cage so is when you

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.240 
to get back to the cage so is when you
first<00:01:58.310> teach<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.520> to<00:02:00.420> hop<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:02.010> just

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
first teach you to hop up you just

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.710 
first teach you to hop up you just
slightly<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:04.140> put<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.440> feet

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
slightly you put your feet

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.590 
slightly you put your feet
in<00:02:04.780> front<00:02:05.050> of<00:02:05.170> them<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.850> say<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.030> commander

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
in front of them you say the commander

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.400 
in front of them you say the commander
of<00:02:07.930> up<00:02:08.500> or<00:02:08.740> step<00:02:08.979> up<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:10.230> obviously<00:02:11.230> they're

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
of up or step up and obviously they're

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.540 
of up or step up and obviously they're
not<00:02:11.500> going<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.740> know<00:02:11.830> what<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.070> command<00:02:12.430> is

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
not going to know what the command is

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.490 
not going to know what the command is
you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.590 
you
so<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.800> lightly<00:02:15.220> push<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:16.390> their

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
so you just lightly push on their

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.820 
so you just lightly push on their
stomach<00:02:17.140> which<00:02:17.770> will<00:02:19.500> change<00:02:20.500> their

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
stomach which will change their

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.130 
stomach which will change their
stability<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.790> they'll<00:02:21.940> have<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.390> step

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
stability and they'll have to step

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.880 
stability and they'll have to step
forward<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.950> UM<00:02:24.700> gain<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.270> stability<00:02:26.230> again

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
forward to UM gain that stability again

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.580 
forward to UM gain that stability again
so<00:02:27.550> I'll<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.790> do<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> hop<00:02:28.240> up<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.630> Pluto<00:02:29.020> and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590
