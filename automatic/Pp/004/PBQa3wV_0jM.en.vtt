this you know yes fingers this time and
here's<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.310> battle<00:01:12.030> axe<00:01:13.399> this<00:01:15.020> goes<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
here's this battle axe this goes in the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.989 
here's this battle axe this goes in the
small<00:01:16.950> hole<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:19.039> so<00:01:20.039> it<00:01:20.310> could<00:01:20.429> hold

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
small hole right there so it could hold

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:27.649 
small hole right there so it could hold
it<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:24.289> like<00:01:25.289> this<00:01:25.319> I<00:01:26.390> leave<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.509> know

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it like this like this I leave you know

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.130 
it like this like this I leave you know
axons<00:01:28.499> know<00:01:29.399> excellent<00:01:30.030> had<00:01:30.210> no<00:01:30.479> arm<00:01:30.719> support

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
axons know excellent had no arm support

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.840 
axons know excellent had no arm support
so<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.289> can<00:01:31.439> hold<00:01:31.649> anything<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.700> one

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
so you can hold anything but this one

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.539 
so you can hold anything but this one
can<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.020> could<00:01:34.170> pose<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.100> he's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
can so you could pose like you know he's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.450 
can so you could pose like you know he's
going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.789> kill<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.119> something<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that's for the arms it spins around

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.020 
that's for the arms it spins around
almost<00:01:41.310> 180<00:01:41.969> except<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.630> top<00:01:43.139> portion

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
almost 180 except with this top portion

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.929 
almost 180 except with this top portion
we're<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.179> perfectly<00:01:45.659> fine<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.079> move<00:01:46.350> it

point same with this one goes like that
we're<00:02:13.049> gonna<00:02:13.170> specs<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.950> probably<00:02:14.489> like<00:02:14.700> black

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
we're gonna specs I probably like black

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
we're gonna specs I probably like black
panels<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.230> make<00:02:16.379> give<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.650> back

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
panels to make give it back

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.280 
panels to make give it back
is<00:02:17.620> jet<00:02:17.890> form<00:02:18.190> all<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.550> pieces<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:20.170> look

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
is jet form all the pieces and you look

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.420 
is jet form all the pieces and you look
right<00:02:20.550> there<00:02:22.110> he<00:02:23.110> had<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.380> spine<00:02:23.710> so<00:02:24.070> he<00:02:24.280> could

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
right there he had the spine so he could

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.180 
right there he had the spine so he could
punch<00:02:24.970> /<00:02:25.330> forward<00:02:25.690> or<00:02:25.780> go<00:02:25.900> side<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.260> side<00:02:26.410> it's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
punch / forward or go side to side it's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.490 
punch / forward or go side to side it's
really<00:02:27.460> cool<00:02:27.810> actually<00:02:28.810> with<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.290> piece

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
really cool actually with that piece

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
really cool actually with that piece
prograf<00:02:29.860> said<00:02:30.040> replace<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.640> right<00:02:30.790> now<00:02:30.940> and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
prograf said replace it right now and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.250 
prograf said replace it right now and
for<00:02:33.520> his<00:02:33.700> spine<00:02:34.350> nice<00:02:35.350> pine<00:02:35.710> waste<00:02:36.750> these<00:02:37.750> go

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
for his spine nice pine waste these go

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.050 
for his spine nice pine waste these go
out<00:02:38.470> like<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:39.960> that's<00:02:40.960> where<00:02:41.290> his<00:02:41.410> leg<00:02:42.060> meets

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
out like this that's where his leg meets
