a<00:00:27.360> good<00:00:27.480> team<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.470> went<00:00:28.770> to<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> finish

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
a good team but they went to the finish

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.940 
a good team but they went to the finish
line<00:00:29.640> over<00:00:30.450> the<00:00:30.540> last<00:00:30.750> six<00:00:31.080> weeks<00:00:31.290> going<00:00:31.650> just

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
line over the last six weeks going just

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.840 
line over the last six weeks going just
two<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.340> four<00:00:32.580> straight<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.400> again<00:00:35.400> some

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
two and four straight up and again some

two and four straight up and again some
of<00:00:35.970> those<00:00:36.060> losses<00:00:36.360> though<00:00:36.810> were<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
of those losses though were to the

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.460 
of those losses though were to the
better<00:00:38.250> teams<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> big<00:00:39.090> ten<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
better teams in the big ten so you

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.580 
better teams in the big ten so you
really<00:00:40.770> don't<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:41.160> where<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.970> gauge<00:00:42.590> Iowa

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
really don't know where to gauge Iowa

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
really don't know where to gauge Iowa
they're<00:00:43.829> better<00:00:44.310> than<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:45.420> finish<00:00:45.810> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
they're better than they finish the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.950 
they're better than they finish the
season<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.980> they're<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.310> as<00:00:47.550> good<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:48.120> what

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
season but they're not as good is what

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.690 
season but they're not as good is what
we<00:00:49.080> saw<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> beginning<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.920> season<00:00:50.310> when

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
we saw at the beginning this season when

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.130 
we saw at the beginning this season when
they<00:00:50.790> were<00:00:50.910> playing<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.390> soft<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
they were playing a soft out of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.830 
they were playing a soft out of
conference<00:00:52.410> schedule<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.340> owe<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> me<00:00:54.540> is

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
conference schedule I owe it to me is

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.530 
conference schedule I owe it to me is
Ben<00:00:55.770> Paisley<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.580> same<00:00:56.820> team<00:00:57.090> over<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> last

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
Ben Paisley the same team over the last

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.440 
Ben Paisley the same team over the last
decade<00:00:58.170> Kurt<00:00:58.800> Francis<00:00:59.010> got<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> team<00:00:59.970> that<00:01:00.240> has

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
decade Kurt Francis got a team that has

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.060 
decade Kurt Francis got a team that has
got<00:01:01.110> it<00:01:01.920> gets<00:01:02.310> a<00:01:02.670> good<00:01:03.180> amount<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.799> play<00:01:04.799> out<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
got it gets a good amount of play out of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.469 
got it gets a good amount of play out of
his<00:01:05.189> players<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.210> over

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
his players that I think they over

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.380 
his players that I think they over
perform<00:01:07.070> but<00:01:08.070> they're<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.640> able<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> step<00:01:09.210> up

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
perform but they're not able to step up

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.090 
perform but they're not able to step up
to<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.509> next<00:01:09.600> level<00:01:09.900> they're<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.009> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to the next level they're not up to the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.469 
to the next level they're not up to the
michigan<00:01:11.430> state<00:01:11.520> level<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> ohio

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
michigan state level and not to the ohio

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510 
michigan state level and not to the ohio
state<00:01:12.600> level<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.229> i<00:01:13.770> think<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.430> way

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
state level and i think this is the way

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
state level and i think this is the way
this<00:01:14.670> team<00:01:14.880> has<00:01:14.939> been<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.180> year<00:01:15.330> similar<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
this team has been this year similar to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260 
this team has been this year similar to
that<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:17.130> played<00:01:17.369> teams<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:18.000> should

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that they played teams that they should

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
that they played teams that they should
have<00:01:18.359> beaten<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.929> they<00:01:19.200> didn't<00:01:19.499> and<00:01:19.679> they

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
have beaten and they didn't and they

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.319 
have beaten and they didn't and they
played<00:01:20.310> teams<00:01:20.579> that<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:20.939> should<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.179> lost

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
played teams that they should have lost

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.760 
played teams that they should have lost
two<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:21.960> were<00:01:22.020> able<00:01:22.109> to<00:01:22.289> play<00:01:22.469> him<00:01:22.619> well

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
two and they were able to play him well

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.889 
two and they were able to play him well
so<00:01:23.249> it's<00:01:23.880> simple<00:01:24.270> Iowa<00:01:25.049> team<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.649> my<00:01:26.009> regard

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
so it's simple Iowa team and my regard

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.630 
so it's simple Iowa team and my regard
obviously<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:28.499> defense<00:01:28.859> carries<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> load

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
obviously the defense carries the load

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.230 
obviously the defense carries the load
the<00:01:30.479> offense<00:01:30.869> struggles<00:01:31.789> more<00:01:32.789> of<00:01:32.969> a<00:01:33.060> running

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the offense struggles more of a running

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
the offense struggles more of a running
team<00:01:33.569> it's<00:01:34.289> just<00:01:34.469> typical<00:01:34.679> what<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.249> were<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
just at the last few games and look at

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.370 
just at the last few games and look at
the<00:01:50.670> scores<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> games<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:52.319> were

the scores of the games they were
involved<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.069> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.700> something<00:01:53.999> that's

involved in this is something that's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.050 
involved in this is something that's
dangerous<00:01:54.749> if<00:01:54.929> all<00:01:55.079> you're<00:01:55.259> doing<00:01:55.289> is<00:01:55.740> looking

an SEC team but we're not going to one

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.979 
an SEC team but we're not going to one
of<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.549> teams<00:02:36.819> that<00:02:36.939> was<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.599> upper

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
of the teams that was on the upper

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.710 
of the teams that was on the upper
echelon<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.799> SEC<00:02:39.670> but<00:02:40.180> we're<00:02:40.360> playing<00:02:40.599> at

Tennessee<00:02:41.110> team<00:02:41.349> it's<00:02:41.739> got<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> great

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
Tennessee team it's got a great

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.000 
Tennessee team it's got a great
offensive<00:02:43.060> line<00:02:43.329> that<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.230> think<00:02:44.680> we'll<00:02:44.980> be

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
offensive line that I think we'll be

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.619 
offensive line that I think we'll be
able<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.430> dominate<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.180> line<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.540> scrimmage

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
able to dominate the line of scrimmage

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.860 
able to dominate the line of scrimmage
here<00:02:47.230> not<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.250> degree<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.909> a<00:02:49.090> Wisconsin<00:02:49.720> or

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
here not to the degree of a Wisconsin or

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.679 
here not to the degree of a Wisconsin or
Nebraska<00:02:50.079> but<00:02:51.069> they're<00:02:51.250> going<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.609> able<00:02:51.790> to

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
Nebraska but they're going to be able to

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.930 
Nebraska but they're going to be able to
dominate<00:02:52.900> move<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.920> ball<00:02:54.129> but<00:02:54.640> they're<00:02:54.819> going

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
to move the ball slower instead of a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.339 
to move the ball slower instead of a
Wisconsin<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.659> know<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.840> got<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.170> guy

that could break you know a 20-yard gain

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.069 
that could break you know a 20-yard gain
like<00:03:02.650> nothing<00:03:03.150> Tennessee<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.420> going<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.780> grind

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079

Tennessee<00:03:07.510> hasn't<00:03:07.870> been<00:03:08.109> one<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:08.950> elite

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
Tennessee hasn't been one of the elite

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.770 
Tennessee hasn't been one of the elite
teams<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.730> while<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.239> this<00:03:10.299> is<00:03:10.359> a<00:03:10.510> young

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
teams in a while but this is a young

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.949 
teams in a while but this is a young
team<00:03:10.989> that's<00:03:11.019> getting<00:03:11.470> better<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:13.480> offense<00:03:13.870> i

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
team that's getting better the offense i

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.059 
team that's getting better the offense i
believe<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.290> getting<00:03:14.530> better<00:03:14.650> as<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:14.950> season

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
believe is getting better as the season

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.580 
believe is getting better as the season
goes<00:03:15.370> on<00:03:15.659> defense<00:03:16.659> it's<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.989> guy<00:03:17.109> way<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.409> go

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
goes on defense it's a guy way to go

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.160 
goes on defense it's a guy way to go
defensively<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:19.420> they<00:03:19.540> have<00:03:19.690> played<00:03:19.930> well<00:03:20.139> in

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
defensively but they have played well in

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.110 
defensively but they have played well in
certain<00:03:20.470> games<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.099> it's<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.310> certain<00:03:21.609> sort<00:03:22.000> of

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
certain games so it's a certain sort of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.189 
certain games so it's a certain sort of
a<00:03:22.150> matchup<00:03:22.599> situation<00:03:23.409> for<00:03:23.590> Tennessee<00:03:24.010> but

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
a matchup situation for Tennessee but

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.050 
a matchup situation for Tennessee but
yeah<00:03:26.199> I<00:03:26.230> like<00:03:27.099> your<00:03:27.250> thinking<00:03:27.280> here<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.790> think

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
yeah I like your thinking here I think

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.539 
yeah I like your thinking here I think
it<00:03:28.180> will<00:03:28.329> be<00:03:28.389> a<00:03:28.540> lower<00:03:28.780> scoring<00:03:29.169> game<00:03:29.549> the

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
it will be a lower scoring game the

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.949 
it will be a lower scoring game the
matchups<00:03:30.970> would<00:03:31.150> dictate<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.510> at<00:03:31.690> least<00:03:31.810> in

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
matchups would dictate that at least in

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.110 
matchups would dictate that at least in
my<00:03:32.049> mind<00:03:32.079> yeah<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:32.949> like<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.370> said<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.699> think

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
my mind yeah and like I said I think

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.939 
my mind yeah and like I said I think
that<00:03:34.269> this<00:03:34.389> is<00:03:34.449> a<00:03:34.599> game<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.379> Tennessee<00:03:35.889> is

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
that this is a game the Tennessee is

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.210 
that this is a game the Tennessee is
going<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.280> want<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.549> go<00:03:36.849> out<00:03:37.000> run<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.690> ball

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
going to want to go out run the ball

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.610 
going to want to go out run the ball
protect<00:03:39.220> their<00:03:39.400> defense<00:03:39.910> try<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.750> dominate<00:03:41.049> a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
protect their defense try to dominate a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.250 
protect their defense try to dominate a
smaller<00:03:42.160> Iowa<00:03:42.669> team<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.419> I<00:03:43.720> like<00:03:43.870> i<00:03:43.959> said<00:03:44.139> i

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
smaller Iowa team and I like i said i

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.050

like<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.739> offensive<00:03:45.129> line<00:03:45.459> for<00:03:45.699> Tennessee

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
like this offensive line for Tennessee

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.309 
like this offensive line for Tennessee
and<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.239> think<00:03:46.419> that's<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.720> key<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.109> game

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
and I think that's the key to the game

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.379 
and I think that's the key to the game
and<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:48.280> am<00:03:48.549> going<00:03:48.699> to<00:03:48.790> go<00:03:48.879> ahead<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.150> play<00:03:49.359> this
