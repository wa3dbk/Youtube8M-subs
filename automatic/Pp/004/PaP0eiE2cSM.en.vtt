00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.079
 What does not happen 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.630
 Hello, how much is it? Chicken fried chicken from Nongshim . 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.760
 I know it's from the one who came out to you. 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.320
 I want to sell the same grassland in the middle of the night, 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.310
 There are two things. 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.800
 I bought it at 1,050 won. It is a product from Nong Shim. 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.740
 It's a 330 kcal product. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.820
 Recommended retail price of 13,300 won 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.530
 I thought that it was crispy because I sprinkled chicken loaf of bread powder on it. 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.129
 Flour is in a pile of bread and contains 3% of 4% chicken. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 I will 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.380

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:56.500
 Local waters are quite low and sodium is not so high. 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.670
 Here's toktok-box couple sabot amount of SiO andoeseo much as we 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.550
 It's inside. 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.830
 Uh, eating a chicken leg vein soul would have cut the film so yeah 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.660
 It is. 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.820
 I'll give you four hoochies to catch the rain. 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.980
 So let's me 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.710
 Ah 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.960
 Oh , it 's true. At first glance, 100 strawberries shake in line. 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.810
 It's an erotic product. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.520
 Something that looks like a chapter like my answer. 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.450
 Does this sudden rattling Ulu three months yesterday, the same Dongdaemun me what every 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 Chungyi the tag team've never bought eight friggin Asada 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.610
 Nevertheless, it's hard to see some sparrows . 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.610
 Jadot's probably empty now. 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.130
 Together with some crispy texture you a little bit smart, crisp feeling a little stiff 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.909
 Holding 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.570
 Well the big crumb has got something buried deeply whats 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.380
 You feel like a fried so that is seems a little bit handsome, but 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.530
 Putting Anna I gave it to the front by two opposite 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.119
 It was a p to say no. 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.119
 For example, did not create the appearance that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.890
 Crispy and deceived 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.870
 I feel a little stiff . 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.459
 Oh, to 5 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.459
 I do not even think about it , and then 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.580
 If you speak good 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:41.590
 I tell you to go ahead and catch a cow l10 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:44.950
 I have a smart texture. I think it 's just a good product to be frightened. 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.260
 A little something 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.260
 Because of its negative crumbs Rome 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:59.870
 There is no feeling of touching more contact with the texture. 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.870
 Not sleeping, but not too bright, but not ambiguous. 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.049
 It's kind of fun to get some seeds. 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.140
 5 It would be nice to have a baggage . 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:13.280
 It's not a lot of money at the moment, but it's empty. 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.980
