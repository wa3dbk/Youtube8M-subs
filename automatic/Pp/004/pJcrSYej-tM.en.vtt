the<00:00:09.090> second<00:00:09.570> advancer<00:00:10.260> topic<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
the second advancer topic is the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.820 
the second advancer topic is the
application<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.879> the<00:00:12.150> muscle<00:00:12.629> rule<00:00:12.900> so

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
application of the muscle rule so

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.849 
application of the muscle rule so
because<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.389> finger<00:00:15.809> band<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.500> we

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
because we have this finger band and we

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.029 
because we have this finger band and we
have<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.640> stick<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:19.430> varying<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.390> loose

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
have this stick is varying the so loose

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.910 
have this stick is varying the so loose
what<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.160> important<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:23.940> when<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.539> lose<00:00:24.920> do

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
what is important is when you lose do

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.200 
what is important is when you lose do
this<00:00:26.160> bounce<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.390> before<00:00:27.840> he<00:00:27.869> clicks

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
this bounce here but before he clicks

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.299 
this bounce here but before he clicks
you<00:00:30.210> put<00:00:30.480> your<00:00:30.600> thumb<00:00:30.930> be<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.350> and<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.009> thumb

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you put your thumb be here and the thumb

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.959 
you put your thumb be here and the thumb
we<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:32.940> stop<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.510> click<00:00:34.219> OK<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
we will stop the click OK with this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.069 
we will stop the click OK with this
concept<00:00:36.360> now<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.680> want<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.640> try<00:00:38.969> this

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
concept now I want you to try this

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.290 
concept now I want you to try this
instead<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.410> starting<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.220> stroke<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.970> this

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
instead of starting the stroke like this

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.440 
instead of starting the stroke like this
you're<00:00:42.630> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> start<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.790> we're

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you're going to start like this so we're

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.979 
you're going to start like this so we're
gonna<00:00:45.690> play<00:00:46.280> this<00:00:47.280> stick<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.270> other<00:00:48.450> will

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
gonna play this stick and the other will

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.889 
gonna play this stick and the other will
drop<00:00:52.280> okay<00:00:53.280> let's<00:00:53.579> start<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> fourth

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
drop okay let's start with a fourth

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.139 
drop okay let's start with a fourth
position<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> zero<00:00:56.280> position<00:00:56.520> probably

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
position with the zero position probably

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.490 
position with the zero position probably
that's<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.809> easiest<00:00:58.200> to<00:00:58.410> understand<00:00:58.950> this

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
that's the easiest to understand this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.020 
that's the easiest to understand this
okay<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.800> then<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> same<00:01:02.760> thing

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
okay and then you have the same thing

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
okay and then you have the same thing
here<00:01:04.280> notice<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.570> my<00:01:06.570> hand<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.079> not<00:01:07.350> like

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
here notice that my hand is not like

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.880 
here notice that my hand is not like
this<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.079> internal<00:01:10.500> mallet

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
this is like this so the internal mallet

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.680 
this is like this so the internal mallet
is<00:01:11.070> higher<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.690> go<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
is higher so if I go like this is this

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.310 
is higher so if I go like this is this
see<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.820> slower<00:01:21.360> try<00:01:22.260> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
see and if you go really slower try to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.399 
see and if you go really slower try to
balance<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.220> 16<00:01:23.880> notes<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:25.020> kind<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
balance the 16 notes that's kind of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.730 
balance the 16 notes that's kind of
difficult<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.790> slow<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:28.619> get

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
difficult when it's really slow to get

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
difficult when it's really slow to get
the<00:01:28.830> Gator<00:01:29.070> Gator<00:01:29.159> Gator<00:01:29.400> Gator<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.180> feel

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the Gator Gator Gator Gator you can feel

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.130 
the Gator Gator Gator Gator you can feel
both<00:01:34.610> okay<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.330> start<00:01:36.600> open

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
both okay and then you can start open

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.550 
both okay and then you can start open
interval<00:01:38.689> that's<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> same

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
interval that's going to be the same

00:01:40.560 --> 00:02:04.050 
interval that's going to be the same
thing

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.200 

let's<00:02:05.060> see<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.420> same<00:02:05.660> concept<00:02:06.230> on<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.500> table<00:02:07.210> so

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
let's see the same concept on a table so

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.640 
let's see the same concept on a table so
just<00:02:08.600> get<00:02:08.840> one<00:02:09.620> hand<00:02:09.980> by<00:02:10.220> one<00:02:10.460> hand<00:02:11.650> imagine

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
just get one hand by one hand imagine

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.410 
just get one hand by one hand imagine
that's<00:02:12.860> your<00:02:13.070> fourth<00:02:13.430> your<00:02:13.820> zero<00:02:14.150> position

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
that's your fourth your zero position

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.360 
that's your fourth your zero position
now<00:02:15.350> lose<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.430> finger<00:02:16.670> here<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:18.370> lets

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
now lose it this finger here and lets

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.390 
now lose it this finger here and lets
the<00:02:19.640> stick<00:02:19.910> bounce<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:21.410> at<00:02:21.830> first<00:02:21.890> this<00:02:24.400> place

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
the stick bounce so at first this place

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.940 
the stick bounce so at first this place
simultaneous<00:02:26.300> at<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.570> same<00:02:26.780> time<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.530> see

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
simultaneous at the same time so you see

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.330 
simultaneous at the same time so you see
they<00:02:28.490> are<00:02:28.520> having<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.240> same<00:02:29.480> space<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:31.160> they

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
they are having the same space so they

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.580 
they are having the same space so they
are<00:02:31.490> they<00:02:32.090> are<00:02:32.210> playing<00:02:32.450> together<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.260> then

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
are they are playing together and then

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.170 
are they are playing together and then
from<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:38.420> way<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.110> role<00:02:39.500> works<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.520> like

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
from here the way the role works is like

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.680 
from here the way the role works is like
a<00:02:41.210> timpani<00:02:41.780> roll<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.770> faster<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.610> gets<00:02:43.940> we

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
a timpani roll the faster it gets we

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.610 
a timpani roll the faster it gets we
have<00:02:44.980> more<00:02:45.980> movements<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.210> risk<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:48.260> can<00:02:48.440> go

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
have more movements and risk you can go

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.990 
have more movements and risk you can go
really<00:02:49.040> bad<00:02:50.410> but<00:02:51.410> then<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.040> software<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.790> go

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
really bad but then the software you go

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.310 
really bad but then the software you go
you<00:02:53.510> start<00:02:53.840> doing<00:02:54.110> less<00:02:54.530> wrist<00:02:55.400> motion<00:02:56.320> and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
you start doing less wrist motion and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:06.340 
you start doing less wrist motion and
you<00:02:58.190> start<00:02:58.780> ripple<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.570> have<00:03:05.930> really

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
you start ripple so you have really

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.320 
you start ripple so you have really
unlimited<00:03:07.280> power<00:03:07.850> for<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.390> fort

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.220 

is<00:03:13.330> too<00:03:13.599> cool<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.360> process<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:20.020> learning

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
is too cool so in a process of learning

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.400 
is too cool so in a process of learning
in<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.560> grip<00:03:20.800> good<00:03:21.550> luck<00:03:21.760> be<00:03:22.360> creative<00:03:22.569> be

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
in the grip good luck be creative be

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.830 
in the grip good luck be creative be
patient<00:03:24.069> every<00:03:24.700> hand<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.090> different<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:25.810> have

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
patient every hand is different you have

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.140 
patient every hand is different you have
to<00:03:26.200> adjust<00:03:26.500> for<00:03:26.650> your<00:03:26.950> hand<00:03:27.190> but<00:03:27.880> you're<00:03:28.030> going

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
to adjust for your hand but you're going
