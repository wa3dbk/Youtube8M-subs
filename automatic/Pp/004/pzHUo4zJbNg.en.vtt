00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
because I know that they could work

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.560 
because I know that they could work
quickly<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.800> quality<00:01:41.250> work

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.170 

I<00:01:44.010> think<00:01:45.010> she<00:01:45.159> have<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.310> little<00:01:45.729> more<00:01:45.909> color

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
I think she have a little more color

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.940 
I think she have a little more color
actually<00:01:46.540> that's<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.020> little<00:01:47.290> because<00:01:47.710> it's

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
actually that's a little because it's

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.010 
actually that's a little because it's
really<00:01:48.250> pretty<00:01:48.550> though<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:49.150> take<00:01:49.450> this<00:01:49.720> and

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
really pretty though so take this and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.370 
really pretty though so take this and
like<00:01:50.290> run<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.710> right<00:01:50.890> along<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:52.090> lash<00:01:52.300> line

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
like run it right along the lash line

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.219 
like run it right along the lash line
since<00:01:53.380> there<00:01:53.620> are<00:01:53.770> 10<00:01:54.280> different<00:01:54.900> design<00:01:55.900> team

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
since there are 10 different design team

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.770 
since there are 10 different design team
we<00:01:56.530> had<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.890> create<00:01:57.550> one<00:01:58.030> look<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:58.360> works

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
we had to create one look that works

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.050 
we had to create one look that works
across<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.710> board<00:02:00.040> that's<00:02:00.520> really<00:02:00.820> simple

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
across the board that's really simple

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.930 
across the board that's really simple
yet<00:02:01.900> it<00:02:02.140> still<00:02:02.440> really<00:02:03.040> complements<00:02:03.820> each

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
yet it still really complements each

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.060 
yet it still really complements each
individual<00:02:04.630> life<00:02:04.840> really<00:02:05.410> concentrating<00:02:05.979> on

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
individual life really concentrating on

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.790 
individual life really concentrating on
using<00:02:06.400> very<00:02:06.610> neutral<00:02:07.090> colors<00:02:07.479> organic<00:02:08.350> earth

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
using very neutral colors organic earth

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.100 
using very neutral colors organic earth
tones<00:02:09.220> on<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.850> skin<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.509> actually<00:02:10.750> just

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
tones on the skin so it actually just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.920 
tones on the skin so it actually just
sculpts<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.680> face<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.910> doesn't<00:02:13.330> really<00:02:13.750> bring

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
sculpts the face it doesn't really bring

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.440 
sculpts the face it doesn't really bring
emphasis<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.800> as<00:02:14.920> much<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
emphasis to it as much so that the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.080
