and play rugby I think it was the first
time<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.590> her<00:00:58.710> mother<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.100> wrong<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.940> the

son was right in Fiji asleep with his

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.820 
son was right in Fiji asleep with his
evident<00:01:06.360> talent<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> game<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.439> soon
