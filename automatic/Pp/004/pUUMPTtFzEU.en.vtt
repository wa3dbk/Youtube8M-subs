00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
like it makes me look a little older and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
I kind of want to wear more colors
because<00:01:26.549> I've<00:01:26.759> never<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.330> wore<00:01:27.869> colors

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
because I've never really wore colors

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.550 
because I've never really wore colors
until<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.770> moved<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.400> LA<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:31.049> slowly

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
until I moved out to LA so I'm slowly

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.280 
until I moved out to LA so I'm slowly
introducing<00:01:32.340> color<00:01:32.610> into<00:01:33.090> my<00:01:33.119> closet<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
introducing color into my closet and I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.069 
introducing color into my closet and I
think<00:01:34.619> royal<00:01:35.070> blue<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.729> cool<00:01:36.509> tone<00:01:36.720> colors

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.530 
are a great way to kind of slowly
