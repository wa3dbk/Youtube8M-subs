likely knows there's a better look at it
right<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:02.270> now<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.600> might<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.989> messed

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

up on the other side I'm not sure or

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.450 
up on the other side I'm not sure or
maybe<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.049> supposed<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.010> but

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
maybe it's supposed to be like that but

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.380

should be fun to play I'm coming in on
the<00:01:56.130> vehicle<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
the vehicle and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.330 
the vehicle and
I'm<00:01:57.680> only<00:01:58.040> going<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.400> shoot<00:01:58.549> my<00:01:58.700> cannon<00:01:59.090> at<00:01:59.210> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580 

some<00:02:06.030> reason<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:06.509> i<00:02:06.630> did<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.990> i<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.289> frame

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
some reason as i did that i had a frame

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.210 
some reason as i did that i had a frame
rate<00:02:07.829> drop<00:02:07.859> that<00:02:08.369> usually<00:02:08.759> doesn't<00:02:09.030> happen

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
rate drop that usually doesn't happen

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.199 
rate drop that usually doesn't happen
hopefully<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.670> something<00:02:11.849> with<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
hopefully that's just something with the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.699 
hopefully that's just something with the
dev<00:02:12.360> server<00:02:12.540> that'll<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:13.050> fixed<00:02:13.349> before<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
dev server that'll be fixed before it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.869 
dev server that'll be fixed before it
goes<00:02:13.830> live<00:02:15.200> we'll<00:02:16.200> see<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.830> rest<00:02:17.099> plane<00:02:17.640> seems

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
goes live we'll see the rest plane seems

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.550 
goes live we'll see the rest plane seems
to<00:02:18.090> handle<00:02:18.390> nicely<00:02:18.750> with<00:02:18.900> its<00:02:19.080> current<00:02:19.290> flight

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's introduced into the real game but i

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.449 
it's introduced into the real game but i
believe<00:02:26.670> i'll<00:02:27.330> definitely<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.750> buying<00:02:28.080> this

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
cannons the machine gun just to see how

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.900 
cannons the machine gun just to see how
fast<00:02:44.459> they<00:02:44.640> fly<00:02:50.750> very<00:02:51.750> fast<00:02:52.160> also<00:02:53.160> very<00:02:53.640> easy

that<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.040> haven't<00:04:46.520> said<00:04:46.670> my<00:04:46.820> graphic<00:04:47.270> settings

two kilometers in altitude and this is

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
of this plane idea of this is I'm going

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.060 
of this plane idea of this is I'm going
to<00:05:35.800> dive<00:05:35.950> down<00:05:36.220> cool<00:05:36.790> up<00:05:36.910> sharply<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.510> see<00:05:38.170> if

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
to dive down cool up sharply and see if

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.040 
to dive down cool up sharply and see if
we<00:05:39.580> can<00:05:39.760> get<00:05:39.850> it<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.030> rip<00:05:40.300> and<00:05:40.480> if<00:05:40.780> it<00:05:40.900> does

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
we can get it to rip and if it does

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.460 
we can get it to rip and if it does
really<00:05:41.320> see<00:05:41.980> what<00:05:42.630> what<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.840> highest

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
really see what what the highest

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.760 
really see what what the highest
g-forces<00:05:45.010> that<00:05:45.340> it<00:05:45.460> can<00:05:45.580> cool<00:05:45.730> not<00:05:46.770> judging

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
g-forces that it can cool not judging

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.120 
g-forces that it can cool not judging
from<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.280> other<00:05:48.430> libraries<00:05:49.060> I<00:05:49.330> believe

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
from the other libraries I believe

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.470 
from the other libraries I believe
compression<00:05:51.130> sets<00:05:51.670> in<00:05:51.850> before<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.390> can

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
compression sets in before you can

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.750 
compression sets in before you can
actually<00:05:52.630> rip<00:05:52.990> so<00:05:53.620> we're<00:05:53.980> going<00:05:54.040> to<00:05:54.190> see<00:05:54.550> that

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
actually rip so we're going to see that

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.350 
actually rip so we're going to see that
now

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.709 

ok<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:57.990> see<00:05:58.199> 11<00:05:58.439> Gees<00:05:59.180> couldn't<00:06:00.180> pull<00:06:00.360> any<00:06:00.389> more

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
ok I see 11 Gees couldn't pull any more

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.490 
ok I see 11 Gees couldn't pull any more
than<00:06:00.930> that<00:06:00.960> and<00:06:01.370> we're<00:06:02.370> heading<00:06:02.490> back<00:06:02.759> up<00:06:02.969> I

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
than that and we're heading back up I

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.689 
than that and we're heading back up I
believe<00:06:04.500> it's<00:06:04.680> safe<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:05.009> say<00:06:05.069> you<00:06:05.250> shouldn't

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
believe it's safe to say you shouldn't

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.860 
believe it's safe to say you shouldn't
really<00:06:05.969> have<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.330> worry<00:06:06.509> too<00:06:06.599> much<00:06:06.719> about

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
really have to worry too much about

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.670 
really have to worry too much about
ripping<00:06:07.379> means<00:06:07.800> it<00:06:08.039> was<00:06:08.219> plain<00:06:09.139> you'd<00:06:10.139> worry

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
ripping means it was plain you'd worry

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.110 
ripping means it was plain you'd worry
more<00:06:10.949> about<00:06:10.979> smacking<00:06:11.669> into<00:06:11.759> the<00:06:11.909> ground

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
more about smacking into the ground

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.929 
more about smacking into the ground
because<00:06:12.389> you<00:06:12.479> can't<00:06:12.689> pull<00:06:12.870> up<00:06:12.990> in<00:06:13.110> time<00:06:13.610> so<00:06:14.610> I

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
because you can't pull up in time so I

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:18.260 
because you can't pull up in time so I
try<00:06:15.360> it<00:06:15.419> one<00:06:15.599> more<00:06:15.629> time<00:06:16.879> this<00:06:17.879> time<00:06:17.939> instead

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
try it one more time this time instead

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.550 
try it one more time this time instead
of<00:06:18.419> pooling<00:06:18.719> up<00:06:18.990> with<00:06:19.379> negative<00:06:19.860> G's

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.629 

can't<00:06:25.220> do<00:06:25.340> you<00:06:25.400> even<00:06:25.550> do<00:06:25.700> that<00:06:25.730> stops<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:26.900> all

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
can't do you even do that stops you all

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.590 
can't do you even do that stops you all
right<00:06:29.080> thank<00:06:30.080> you<00:06:30.139> for<00:06:30.200> watching
