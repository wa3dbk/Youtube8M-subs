00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
downward and I have a slice of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
downward and I have a slice of
demonstration<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.030> thick

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
demonstration like this about this thick

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.819 
demonstration like this about this thick
and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.730> should<00:00:50.730> always<00:00:51.030> practice<00:00:51.719> safe

kitchen<00:00:53.059> method<00:00:54.110> but<00:00:55.110> however<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> did

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
kitchen method but however so what I did

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.700 
kitchen method but however so what I did
is<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.980> split<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.340> down<00:00:59.640> into<00:00:59.969> three<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.050> then

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
is I split that down into three and then

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.630 
is I split that down into three and then
I<00:01:02.149> split<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.180> into<00:01:03.480> three<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.519> know

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
I split it into three so I get you know

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.420 
I split it into three so I get you know
these<00:01:05.820> small<00:01:06.030> cubes<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:08.250> way

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
these small cubes like this that way

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.550 
these small cubes like this that way
with<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> cubes<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> makes<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> whole<00:01:10.530> lot

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
with the cubes it makes it a whole lot

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
with the cubes it makes it a whole lot
easier<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.340> melt<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> doesn't<00:01:12.150> take<00:01:12.299> as

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
easier to melt and it doesn't take as

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.960 
easier to melt and it doesn't take as
long<00:01:13.070> because<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.760> take

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
long because you don't want it to take

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.320 
long because you don't want it to take
too<00:01:15.180> long<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.530> watch<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.330> otherwise

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
too long you have to watch it otherwise

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.310 
too long you have to watch it otherwise
it<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.200> stick<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.509> finished<00:01:21.869> chopping

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
it will stick so as I finished chopping

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.380

something if you strike the bottom on

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.350 
something if you strike the bottom on
the<00:03:25.900> top<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.380> Susy<00:03:26.710> and<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.700> whole<00:03:28.000> thing

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
the top that is Susy and the whole thing

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.170 
the top that is Susy and the whole thing
low<00:03:28.630> will<00:03:28.990> take<00:03:29.170> force<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.790> don't<00:03:30.970> want

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
low will take force and you don't want

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.160 
low will take force and you don't want
that<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.570> happen<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:32.910> they'll<00:03:33.910> cut<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.450> cheese

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
that to happen so they'll cut the cheese

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.110 
that to happen so they'll cut the cheese
too<00:03:35.500> high<00:03:35.740> because<00:03:36.490> you<00:03:36.730> don't<00:03:36.880> want<00:03:37.030> to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
too high because you don't want to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.270 
too high because you don't want to
scorch<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.720> because<00:03:38.080> cheese<00:03:38.440> scorches<00:03:39.040> very

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
scorch it because cheese scorches very

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280 
scorch it because cheese scorches very
easily<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.450> why<00:03:40.600> it's<00:03:40.810> kind<00:03:41.170> of

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
easily and that's why it's kind of

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.270 
easily and that's why it's kind of
important<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.740> put<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:41.920> little<00:03:42.100> bit<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.400> extra

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
important to put a little bit of extra

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.370 
important to put a little bit of extra
not<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.310> little<00:03:45.520> bit<00:03:45.640> extra<00:03:45.940> but<00:03:46.180> out<00:03:46.450> well<00:03:46.900> yeah
