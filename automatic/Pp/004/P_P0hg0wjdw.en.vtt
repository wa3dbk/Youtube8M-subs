of flavor to it nothing really too

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.850 
of flavor to it nothing really too
spectacular<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:17.230> probably<00:02:17.710> be<00:02:17.830> good

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
spectacular would probably be good

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.370 
spectacular would probably be good
slathered<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.580> butter<00:02:18.760> maybe<00:02:19.450> warmed<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.170> I

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
slathered in butter maybe warmed up to I

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.810 
slathered in butter maybe warmed up to I
think<00:02:20.620> warmed<00:02:20.890> up<00:02:21.010> though<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.640> probably

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
think warmed up though so it probably

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.770 
think warmed up though so it probably
helped<00:02:22.210> us<00:02:22.330> stuff<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.600> lot<00:02:24.570> superdry<00:02:25.570> though

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
helped us stuff a lot superdry though

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
things there's really no like surfing

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.920 
things there's really no like surfing
suggestions<00:02:36.940> it's<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.300> like<00:02:37.420> figuring<00:02:37.750> out

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
suggestions it's just like figuring out

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.330 
suggestions it's just like figuring out
on<00:02:38.050> your<00:02:38.200> own<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.530> doesn't<00:02:38.800> even<00:02:38.830> have<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.100> do

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
on your own it doesn't even have to do

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.380 
on your own it doesn't even have to do
like<00:02:39.580> explaining<00:02:40.090> what<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.390> do<00:02:40.480> with<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:40.960> I

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
like explaining what to do with it so I

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.180 
like explaining what to do with it so I
think<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.780> another<00:02:44.050> like<00:02:44.350> three<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.980> mean

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
think this is another like three I mean

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.670 
think this is another like three I mean
I<00:02:45.280> could<00:02:45.460> see<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.850> mean<00:02:46.000> these<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.680> these

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
I could see that mean these are these

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.700 
I could see that mean these are these
are<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:47.890> substrate<00:02:48.430> for<00:02:48.670> something<00:02:49.000> else<00:02:49.710> so

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
are a substrate for something else so

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.150 
are a substrate for something else so
one<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.010> those<00:02:51.130> possible<00:02:51.610> things<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:53.160> tag

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
one of those possible things is the tag

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.130 
one of those possible things is the tag
corn<00:02:54.790> seaweed<00:02:55.780> topic<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.930> I've<00:02:58.930> seen
