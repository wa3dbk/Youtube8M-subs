00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
gonna move that one over there we've got

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.490 
gonna move that one over there we've got
a<00:01:55.770> music<00:01:56.219> disc<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.759> we've<00:01:56.939> got<00:01:57.149> two<00:01:57.500> melons

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
a music disc and we've got two melons

probably gonna have to find the pig

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.219 
probably gonna have to find the pig
semen<00:02:03.030> or<00:02:03.180> something<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.810> you'd<00:02:03.930> had<00:02:04.079> two

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
