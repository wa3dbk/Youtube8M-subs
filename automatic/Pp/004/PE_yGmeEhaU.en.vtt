00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.730
IS EXACTLY WHY PEOPLE SHOULD

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.600
NEVER FEED WILD ANIMALS?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.230
REPORTER: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.370
MORE HARM THAN GOOD, THAT'S THE

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.340
MESSAGE BEHIND THEIR CAMPAIGN.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.810
AND IT REALLY HITS HOME HERE.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.010
THOSE DOZEN DEER FOUND IN WOODS

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.080
RIGHT BEHIND ME AMONG THEM

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.450
BUCKS, FAWNS, DOES, TWO

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.380
PREGNANT, ONE WITH TWINS, ALL

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.450
DIED AFTER EATING FOOD LEFT OUT

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.690
BY PEOPLE THAT THOUGHT THEY WERE

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.360
HELPING.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.690
THIS TIME OF YEAR DEER DO WHAT'S

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.890
NATURAL.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.130
BROWSING FOR BUDS AND OLD

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.860
ACORNS.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.460
AFTER A LONG WINTER WITH THE

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.730
DEEP SNOW PACK LEFT THEM LIVING

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.970
OFF FAT THEY STORED IN THE FALL.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.470
YEAH, I LIVED JUST BEYOND

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.100
THOSE PINE TREES ON THE NEXT

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.770
ROAD OVER.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.700
REPORTER: CHRISTOPHER HAPPENS TO

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.770
BE A FEDERAL WILDLIFE OFFICER,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.140
BUT ON FRIDAY HE WAS JUST A GUY

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.410
FROM SOUTHAMPTON TAKING HIS

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.950
DAILY WALK WITH HIS DOG THROUGH

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.110
THESE WOODS, WHEN HE CAME UPON

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.680
DEER AFTER DEER LYING DEAD ON

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.980
THE SIDE OF THE TRAIL.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.250
I THOUGHT IF THERE WERE SEVEN

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.390
DEER AND MY LOOP THAT I TAKE,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.660
THE MILE LOOP THAT I TAKE, HOW

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.220
MANY MORE ARE THERE AND WHAT

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.390
KILLED THEM.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.230
REPORTER: SO HE CALLED HIS

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.430
FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR, FISH AND

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.660
GAME CONSERVATION OFFICER,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.460
GRAHAM COURTNEY.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.100
I IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED ON

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.030
MY WAY TO MEET HIM ANOTHER DEAD

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.570
DEER, THAT APPEARED PERFECTLY

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.270
HEALTHY.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.770
REPORTER: 12 IN ALL.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.570
THE REGION'S WILD LIVE BUY OLDS

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.810
STUDYING THEM RIGHT THERE IN THE

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.380
WOODS.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.200
I WAS SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.850
OF DEER, THAT SURPRISED ME.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.020
REPORTER: BUT HE WASN'T

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.420
SURPRISED AT WHAT HE FOUND IN

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.590
THEIR STOMACHS, CORN, HAY, DEER

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.490
PELLETS, PUT OUT BY WELL MEANING

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.960
HUMANS.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.830
DEER'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS NEED

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.030
TIME TO ADJUST TO CHANGE.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.060
IF THERE'S A SUDDEN CHANGE IN

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.130
THE FOOD THEY'RE EATING IT

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.900
CAUSES BAD BACTERIA TO GROW, AND

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.500
THE BAD BACTERIA PRODUCES TOXINS

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.570
WHICH THEN POISONS THE BODY.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.340
REPORTER: THE OFFICER WENT DOOR

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.780
TO DOOR, ANY NEIGHBORS WHO HAD

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.510
PUT FOOD OUT CLEANED IT UP,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.910
DISHEARTENED.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.810
SOME PEOPLE, IT WAS

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.310
TRAUMATIZING FOR THEM.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.210
AS IT WAS FOR ALL OF US THAT

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.580
WERE OUT THERE.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.920
WE ALL LOVE WILDLIFE.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.250
SO IT WAS A SAD SIGHT.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.060
REPORTER: LESSON LEARNED HERE?

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.760
LESSON LEARNED, WILD ANIMALS

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.790
NEED TO STAY WILD.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.430
REPORTER: HE SAYS FEEDING DEER,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.030
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS NOT TO.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.170
IT BRINGS THEM CLOSER TO

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.870
TRAFFIC, INCREASES THEIR

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.470
DENSITY, WHICH MAKES THEM MORE

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.700
VULNERABLE TO PREDATORS AND

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.710
DISEASE.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.530
SO THE REMINDER HERE, LEAVE ALL
