just<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> good<00:01:10.830> nice<00:01:11.010> working<00:01:11.460> area<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
just a good nice working area on the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.899 
just a good nice working area on the
larger<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.080> map<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.549> detail<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
larger your map is the more detail you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.679 
larger your map is the more detail you
can<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.330> i'm<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> add<00:01:16.290> noise<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.689> my

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
can have i'm going to add noise to it my

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.859 
can have i'm going to add noise to it my
default<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.200> uniform<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:19.979> i<00:01:20.009> always<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
default is uniform but i always like to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.859 
default is uniform but i always like to
use<00:01:21.990> Gaussian<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.890> different

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
use Gaussian it's just a different

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.450 
use Gaussian it's just a different
calculation<00:01:24.869> method<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:28.340> we're<00:01:29.340> going

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
calculation method and then we're going

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.440 
calculation method and then we're going
to<00:01:29.549> take<00:01:29.729> our<00:01:29.790> layer<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:31.759> we're<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
to take our layer and we're going to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.429 
to take our layer and we're going to
select<00:01:34.380> everything<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.960> then<00:01:36.960> stretch

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
select everything in it and then stretch

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.569 
select everything in it and then stretch
it<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.079> i<00:01:40.140> zoom<00:01:40.439> pretty<00:01:41.159> far<00:01:41.430> out

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
it out and you see i zoom pretty far out

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.050 
it out and you see i zoom pretty far out
and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.770> stretch<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.829> way<00:01:44.250> far<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:47.060> what

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and I just stretch it way far up what

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.490 
and I just stretch it way far up what
that's<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that's going to do is that's going to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.440 
that's going to do is that's going to
give<00:01:49.680> us<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:53.240> texture<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:55.380> nice

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
give us this texture here this nice

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.319 
give us this texture here this nice
lines<00:01:58.130> vertical<00:01:59.130> lines<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
lines vertical lines that are going to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.350 
lines vertical lines that are going to
be<00:02:00.659> our<00:02:02.119> um<00:02:04.070> texture<00:02:05.070> that'll<00:02:05.850> make<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.030> looked

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
be our um texture that'll make it looked

be our um texture that'll make it looked
brushed<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:08.069> next<00:02:08.340> thing<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.610> want<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.060> is

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
brushed the next thing we want to do is

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.970 
brushed the next thing we want to do is
offset<00:02:10.289> our<00:02:12.440> image<00:02:13.440> so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
offset our image so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.830 
offset our image so
can<00:02:14.099> get<00:02:14.310> rid<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.730> creature<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.690> we

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
can get rid of this creature so then we

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.500 
can get rid of this creature so then we
can<00:02:16.019> make<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.349> tileable<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:18.030> will<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.390> use

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
can make it tileable and I will just use

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.940 
can make it tileable and I will just use
my<00:02:18.780> clone<00:02:19.049> brush<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:20.599> clone<00:02:21.599> up<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.959> here<00:02:23.659> and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
my clone brush and clone up in here and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.180 
my clone brush and clone up in here and
I<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.010> really<00:02:26.310> care<00:02:26.670> how<00:02:27.950> how<00:02:28.950> noticeable

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
I don't really care how how noticeable

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:41.690 
I don't really care how how noticeable
it<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.750> fine<00:02:33.410> how<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:41.069> then<00:02:41.579> you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
it is it's fine how it is so then you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.369 
it is it's fine how it is so then you
can<00:02:41.849> go<00:02:42.000> ahead<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.299> say<00:02:42.569> this<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.110> i<00:02:43.170> already

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
can go ahead and say this but i already

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.369 
can go ahead and say this but i already
have<00:02:43.709> made<00:02:44.069> mine<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.690> next<00:02:48.840> thing<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.200> do

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
have made mine so the next thing you do

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.960 
have made mine so the next thing you do
is<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:50.069> add<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.700> texture<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.890> your<00:02:53.459> blender

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
is you add a texture to your blender

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.050 
is you add a texture to your blender
material<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.049> add<00:02:55.230> new<00:02:55.440> texture<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.129> then<00:02:56.879> we

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
material so add new texture and then we

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.300 
material so add new texture and then we
go<00:02:57.209> into<00:02:57.239> our<00:02:57.569> textures<00:02:57.959> go<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.680> image<00:02:58.890> and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
go into our textures go to image and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.300 
go into our textures go to image and
load<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:01.310> image<00:03:03.170> next<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.500> want<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.859> change

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
load your image next you want to change

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.819 
load your image next you want to change
what<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.299> mapping<00:03:06.540> from<00:03:07.079> mapping<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.620> color

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
what it's mapping from mapping the color

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:14.360 
what it's mapping from mapping the color
you<00:03:08.670> want<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.030> map<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.920> UM<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.920> part<00:03:14.190> on

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
you want to map it to UM the part on

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.819 
you want to map it to UM the part on
your<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:16.230> your<00:03:17.810> metal<00:03:18.810> that'll<00:03:19.290> make<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.470> look

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
your on your metal that'll make it look

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.370 
your on your metal that'll make it look
like<00:03:20.099> aluminum<00:03:20.760> which<00:03:21.269> in<00:03:21.419> this<00:03:21.540> case<00:03:21.599> happens

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
like aluminum which in this case happens

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.229

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
the bottom of our material we can see

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:36.229 
the bottom of our material we can see
what<00:03:30.299> blunder<00:03:32.840> what<00:03:33.840> blender<00:03:34.730> materials<00:03:35.730> how

what blunder what blender materials how
that<00:03:36.480> gets<00:03:36.599> mapped<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:39.109> Jaffa<00:03:40.109> ray<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.440> we

that gets mapped in to Jaffa ray and we

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.770 
that gets mapped in to Jaffa ray and we

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780

there but it's not being mapped quite
right<00:04:02.099> I'm<00:04:02.669> going<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:02.940> turn<00:04:03.209> on<00:04:03.329> color<00:04:03.750> right

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
right I'm going to turn on color right

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.610 
right I'm going to turn on color right
now<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.709> go<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:04.919> map<00:04:05.160> input<00:04:05.669> I'm<00:04:06.329> going<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.230> map

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
now and go to map input I'm going to map

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.879 
now and go to map input I'm going to map
it<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.859> a<00:04:07.980> sphere<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:09.750> should<00:04:10.049> be<00:04:10.079> good

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
it to a sphere and that should be good

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.140 
it to a sphere and that should be good
enough<00:04:11.239> sometimes<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.449> map<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.620> X<00:04:14.609> Y<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:14.879> X

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
enough sometimes I map it to X Y and X

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.680 
enough sometimes I map it to X Y and X
instead<00:04:15.569> of<00:04:16.199> x<00:04:16.440> y&amp;z<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.579> just<00:04:18.239> gives<00:04:18.449> it<00:04:18.570> a

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
instead of x y&amp;z it just gives it a

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.390 
instead of x y&amp;z it just gives it a
different<00:04:20.750> stretch<00:04:21.750> over

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
different stretch over

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.050 
different stretch over
the<00:04:25.699> over<00:04:26.699> your<00:04:27.620> object<00:04:28.639> take<00:04:29.639> it<00:04:29.790> off<00:04:29.880> of

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
the over your object take it off of

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.900 
the over your object take it off of
color<00:04:30.300> now<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:34.970> when<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.120> start<00:04:36.419> off<00:04:36.740> this

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
color now and when you start off this

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.480 
color now and when you start off this
material<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:40.080> want<00:04:40.259> to<00:04:40.560> make<00:04:40.740> sure<00:04:40.770> your

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
material you want to make sure your

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.060 
material you want to make sure your
diffuse<00:04:41.970> reflection<00:04:42.449> is<00:04:42.840> lower<00:04:43.560> than<00:04:43.889> your

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
diffuse reflection is lower than your

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.710 
diffuse reflection is lower than your
glossy<00:04:44.490> reflection<00:04:45.000> otherwise<00:04:47.539> you<00:04:48.539> might

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
glossy reflection otherwise you might

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.279 
glossy reflection otherwise you might
get<00:04:48.990> some<00:04:49.199> strange<00:04:50.009> results<00:04:50.699> so<00:04:51.360> I'm<00:04:51.479> going<00:04:51.539> to

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.930 

do<00:04:55.289> that<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.650> your<00:04:55.860> exponent<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.639> what's

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
do that and your exponent is what's

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.230 
do that and your exponent is what's
going<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.150> make<00:04:57.360> your<00:04:59.630> reflection<00:05:00.630> blur<00:05:01.110> and

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
going to make your reflection blur and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.820 
going to make your reflection blur and
so<00:05:03.240> if<00:05:03.750> we<00:05:04.680> put<00:05:05.130> this<00:05:05.370> down<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.880> 50<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.960> render

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
so if we put this down to 50 and render

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.120 
so if we put this down to 50 and render
it<00:05:07.889> will<00:05:08.550> have<00:05:08.760> more<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.780> blur<00:05:09.990> up<00:05:10.169> here<00:05:10.470> you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
it will have more of a blur up here you

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.300 
it will have more of a blur up here you
can<00:05:11.250> see<00:05:11.430> more<00:05:11.699> of<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.940> blur<00:05:12.979> will<00:05:13.979> make<00:05:14.160> this

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
can see more of a blur will make this

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:25.310 
can see more of a blur will make this
bigger

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:33.119 

and<00:05:25.410> then<00:05:26.220> if<00:05:26.370> we<00:05:26.490> put<00:05:26.700> this<00:05:26.850> to<00:05:27.300> 100

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.689 

you<00:05:33.759> see<00:05:33.969> less<00:05:34.179> of<00:05:34.209> a<00:05:34.449> blur<00:05:34.659> and<00:05:35.699> that's

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
you see less of a blur and that's

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:43.100 
you see less of a blur and that's
basically<00:05:37.179> your<00:05:40.439> your<00:05:41.439> brushed<00:05:42.339> aluminum<00:05:42.879> um

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
basically your your brushed aluminum um

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.909 
basically your your brushed aluminum um
