something here on this new rs5 to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.120 
something here on this new rs5 to
dissipate<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> heat<00:00:44.450> of<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> rotors

it's like a waffle almost really makes a
big<00:00:50.940> impact

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:07.060 

here's<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> transmitter<00:00:57.150> key<00:00:57.390> now

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.630

plate I don't think I'd actually run

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.740 
plate I don't think I'd actually run
that<00:01:12.620> I<00:01:12.860> think<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:13.940> looks<00:01:13.970> great<00:01:14.270> without<00:01:14.450> the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
that I think it looks great without the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.100 
that I think it looks great without the

get<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.460> flat<00:01:23.170> but<00:01:24.170> like<00:01:24.800> most<00:01:24.980> vehicles<00:01:25.280> today

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
get a flat but like most vehicles today

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:43.300 
get a flat but like most vehicles today
no<00:01:26.930> more<00:01:27.140> spares

as<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.030> great<00:01:50.150> piping

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.199 

this<00:02:13.860> paper<00:02:14.099> also<00:02:14.459> has<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.849> blind<00:02:15.060> spot

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
this paper also has the blind spot

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.990 
this paper also has the blind spot
detection<00:02:15.360> system<00:02:16.550> let's<00:02:17.550> take<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> look<00:02:17.940> at

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
detection system let's take a look at

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.980 
detection system let's take a look at
the<00:02:18.060> LEDs<00:02:18.510> because<00:02:18.930> it's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.870 

these<00:02:26.920> newer<00:02:27.190> LEDs<00:02:27.820> are<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:30.400> don't<00:02:30.610> actually

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
these newer LEDs are you don't actually

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.940 
these newer LEDs are you don't actually
just<00:02:31.270> see<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> individual<00:02:31.990> bulbs<00:02:32.320> anymore

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.770 

but<00:02:39.370> they<00:02:39.520> have<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> bright<00:02:40.030> as<00:02:40.209> ever<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.480> think

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
but they have a bright as ever I think

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:50.080 
but they have a bright as ever I think
these<00:02:40.959> things<00:02:40.989> are<00:02:41.260> even<00:02:41.500> brighter<00:02:41.800> than<00:02:42.040> most

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.110 

let<00:02:51.019> me<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:51.290> show<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.370> way<00:02:52.519> things<00:02:52.819> look

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120
