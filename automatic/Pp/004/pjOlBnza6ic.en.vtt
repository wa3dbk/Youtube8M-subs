00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.850
 I'm not re happy 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.710
 over the super natural things I think 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.640
 what am i 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.980
 it's quite special because good 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.570
 true that they have a very active life already 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.330
 I had it, I had a first child and 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.099
 after all, it always happened the same 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.110
 loses his wings I always like the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.970
 large family played signs that 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.400
 It's full of dolls and babies and they were 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.500
 as all my children believe something like very 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.829
 silent was not something that communicated 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.050
 to my family see a huge family what 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.090
 what I did before I think that 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.430
 know how to give or get married and everything 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.440
 that every time I passed below a 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.079
 bridge and passed the measured train of desire 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.079
 to have children was to be somewhat afraid 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.789
 like I handled it super silent and 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.559
 after knowing my daughter plus the 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.589
 dating crossed us or we talked about the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.140
 word children we get married and neither 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.380
 we said good I know how many we have two and 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.150
 already when it 's having the fourth was like 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.400
 what's happening and the fifth one is not 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.350
 story and the sixth in this story and the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 seventh of it the eighth and that will make her 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.530
 a heart attack 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.870
 but we are proud of the family 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.330
 we have 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.920
 what we form with all the suffering 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.840
 we had with Paco and everything 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.119
 which I think is not easy for someone 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 that has a loss traced and follow 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.240
 I would tell you that there is nothing easy I was the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.060
 I wanted to continue, it seemed to me that 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.490
 you have to show my children that the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.990
 life is so that you have to continue and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.780
 that you do not have to lower your arms and that 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.149
 facu came to give us something but I 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.080
 I felt right at that moment they have 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.640
 better also that stay 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.610
 pregnant women it felt like life 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.590
 you told me you have to bet again 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.140
 to speak nor was I more afraid had I dale 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.840
 it seems that no and well that this fear 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.780
 It's time to say what will happen if only one 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.130
 which is like very perspective from which 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.069
 he says animal was telling me he's going to go back to 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.080
 spend the same and well I looked at her 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.179
 from there fat we thought that we are not going to 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.580
 want to go pray so this does not 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.130
 always happen again if I imagined 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.959
 that like if I said good out there 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.330
 I have my last son at 40 who is 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.950
 it came to me it seemed I took myself angle I had 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.830
 when 29 years then how did it come 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.540
 imagined seemed that also helps 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.790
 boy can normal was a talking topic 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.099
 with varnish 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.629
 we are like lists and we have a 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.299
 religion but good we are also 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.560
 realistic and everything that happens 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.780
 we explain them clearly 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.819
 as they pass by luck we are all 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.340
 religious because I think the spiritual 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.989
 He helped me a lot with the facundo because 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.390
 this one was with another story that of 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.030
 suddenly the average earthly thing that you love 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.890
 throw out the window this but but 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.959
 supertramp than normal 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.569
 supertramp than normal with the normal of 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:06.030
 religion and what you live 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:08.340
 but if you can not and we are not 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.379
 people that we have the boys and that 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.879

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.609

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.989
 place meeting trip and suddenly I have it 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.430
