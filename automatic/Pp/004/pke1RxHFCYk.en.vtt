00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 very good guys that so welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.210
 a new video text zombies in which 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.400
 I will explain how to make the stereo 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.480
 of the map of out break 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.370
 first of all tell you that it is a 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.019
 pretty easy interest in a matter of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.570
 one hour you can have it perfectly 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.940
 if you are lucky and it is much easier in 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.890
 only that in cooperative since if it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.810
 we do cooperatively we will have to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 join with colleagues to do 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 certain steps which I will let you know 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.099
 as I advance this tutorial so 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.230
 without further delay we go to the mess the first 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820
 step is to take the black box that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.620
 we found in the beginning area 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 you know that in zombies to perform 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.030
 some action of these because we have to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 press x or square in play we do it and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.540
 once we have it we go to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.520
 second step we go to the zone of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.680
 computers down exo recharge and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.300
 we put the black box when the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.300
 let's place we will hear the following 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.060
 we're going to need more permission from 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.160
 security in the four identifications 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.230
 for encryption first there will be that 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.729
 find them basically they have told us 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.890
 that is encrypted and that for 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.619
 decrypt we need the four 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.150
 permissions of our characters the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.190
 third step is to get the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.810
 four cards if we are in only 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.360
 we will have to get us the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.820
 four if we are with two players each 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.820
 one two cards and four players 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.860
 everyone will have to get their card 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.930
 depending on the character corresponding 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.509
 so take it so let's see how it 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.160
 get each card there are two that touch 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.289
 quite the balls that are the 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.970
 lilith and baker's we are going to see them 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.070
 first to get lilith's 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.259
 we'll have to get the n-1 the weapon 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.630
 the third 3d printer and subsequently 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.670
 shoot at the printer and activate it at 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.500
 same time in this way the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 card in the printer and we can 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.920
 get as you see when the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.259
 we get a little bit in 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.770
 our player card regarding the 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.960
 of baker 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.550
 you have to go to the incinerator very attentive 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.710
 guys to access this area 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.590
 we will have to go to one of the two cubes 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.060
 of garbage that there is by the map to activate it 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.430
 once without getting 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.890
 again in which already if we get 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.020
 to get to this area this is only if 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.729
 we do cooperative two players 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.220
 they will have to agree so that 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.920
 each one put in a garbage can and 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.780
 activate it at the same time once 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.730
 we are in the incinerator we will have to 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.620
 shoot to the ground to raise a 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.569
 heap of dust there will be a moment in the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.459
 Let the baker card go 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.380
 if you look, it looks pretty good and 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.420
 when we take it we will leave the area 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.790
 since the walls are advancing and 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.709
 we can die this card guys was the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.170
 it cost me more to get it, I had to go 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.630
 up to five times to the incinerator and have 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.730
 be careful because if you agree several times to 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.319
 this area in the same round the cost of 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.660
 the garbage cans to go up like this 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.280
 It is advisable to go round before 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.810
 go again we go now with 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.239
 ace card the name of the cleaning 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.489
 we will have to go to the exo health zone 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.590
 and break a kind of tube there 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.940
 under some white boxes we could 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.970
 say once we break it 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.670
 we need the exo stomp to jump to 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.099
 the second box will be lowered and we can 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.810
 take the card last for the 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.790
 khan card will have to wait 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.930
 a round of infected let us 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.390
 infect or in the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.000
 of administration activate four panels 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.430
 it is very important to activate them in one 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.140
 Once we are infected when 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.780
 we have done we go to the reception of the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.129
 beginning and we take the camps card 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.349
 the fourth step is quite simple 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.209
 we have to kill zombies which we 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.730
 They will leave cards until they reach the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.459
 number 49 on our player card 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.920
 step number 5 is to get 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.659
 the number 50 we will have to go to the 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.000
 recognition panels that there are by the 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.219
 map if we are in alone only is 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.079
 necessary to go to the panel that corresponds 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.659
 with our character but for example 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.790
 with four players each will go to his 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.430
 corresponding panel depending on the 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.709
 character that carries the meat is at 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.019
 end of the administration area the 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.269
 baker is on the stairs in the area 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.819
 of the exoskeleton of the ones in the area 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.430
 of exo health and finally the one of lilith 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.250
 that was the character that I was wearing in 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.829
 the exo recharge zone then we activate and 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.139
 the number is up to 50 and already 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.480
 we are ready to decrypt the box 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.459
 black step number 6 consists of 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.819
 decrypt the for it we go to where 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.400
 we had left it and pressed 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.799
 once done this step number 7 already 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.410
 the end of the interest is to go to the 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.910
 exoskeleton area do as not 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.039
 we put it again if we are in 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.259
 cooperative eye all players 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.300
 they should do it at the same time they 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.070
 will open an improvement machine in a 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.080
 wall and a guard bear will come to 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.000
 rescue us in the beginning zone 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.490
 when we go out and we think we're going to 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.560
 escape they bring down the war bear and we are 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.599
 is a silly face quite 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.259
 incredible and we take for granted the 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:49.509
 achievement of lister in 50 gs it's over uncle 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.789
 so nothing witnesses until here the 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.500
 Listeria tutorial is a hysteria is 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.090
 pretty simple the most complicated thing is 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.070
 get the cards of the players 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.900
 and such and if you are lucky with the subject of 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.870
 get the n-1 from the box for the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.030
 lille card and then you skip the 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.160
 quick card in the incinerator the 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.199
 baker you can do it very fast on 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.970
 interest is much easier in just me what 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.800
 I have done in solo and in one hour what 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.599
 I had and nothing, I hope it has 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.979
 I love the video vote it I like it 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.759
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.759
 goodbye
