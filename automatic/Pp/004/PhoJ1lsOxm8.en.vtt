00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.019
 Phelps 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.669
 the first round of the last century 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.809
 sounds like his swan song 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.829
 because now there is competition 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.189
 that stands there 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.529
 relentless and quiet 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.529
 almost silent 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.689
 an authority comes from these silent rivals 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.470
 this is called Bruins Dr 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.420
 he refrains from exhaust 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.630
 he can afford it 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.630
 CO2 emissions 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 and now comes the topic teacher reserve wegtaut represent 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.040
 da van Gaal 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.770
 it may 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.910
 the electric motor becomes the consultant 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.590
 but you see 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.150
 he shows it in the red area 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.170
 that means who lives back again that means different threats in the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470
 world 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.920
 from 0 to 100 in 5 seconds 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.630
 250 things 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.530
 360 hp 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.800
 our trip is short but call says we would come with a battery charge 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.910
 over 300 kilometers far 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.860
 we drive to one of his three hydroelectric power plants 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.720
 Electricity from natural sources that we have been doing for a long time 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.600
 but we also know how to drive cars knows who he is for two years 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.760
 Maybe it was for Hertha expiring 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.690
 of course found it 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.750
 how do you find the eleven-year-old is won 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.330
 for the car and one of our vehicles on friday was that 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.990
 always like that 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.930
 a long-awaited wish 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.680
 Rafi Refaeli 44 days later you will reach the SLF louder 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.920
 but now 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.920
 it works 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.000
 this frequency also judges 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.070
 Of course this is a very important component of the electric motor can only 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.370
 work with these moments or on 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.910
 warned in winter 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.140
 although the last module for the author's film under this development 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.510
 the coach cares 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.190
 Manufacture Ruf of all places puts the industry under power 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.689
 so far, it's only known for PS from articles around the world 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.839
 to pimp their petrol 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.769
 out of 400 hp makes 7 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.299
 The unreasonableness of the Raser brought the money to develop the new drive 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.669
 Porsche Turbo Club's license 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.099
 but reputation became independent with the years Porsche has a winemaker 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.099
 Project no share 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.099
 change of location 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.479
 Ingolstadt 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.879
 this green may not lack the sale of any recent Massa 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.879
 The topic electrifies the big German automakers 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.289
 The professional car comes with a marketable large trunk 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.469
 Also in 2010, it should go into production 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.909
 so polished calls currently on the reputation of the car country Germany 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:07.819
 Thumbs up Dougan 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.239
 we do not know how to win the meter 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.409
 come later 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:12.669
 van Bommel 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.730
 read more the construction of Marburg Syndrome Nortmoor fruit only propagate it 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.619
 nobody buys 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.109
 We already had electric vehicles in the early 90s or want 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.430
 we have the burning car in the beginning of the nineties nobody has it 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.469
 Bought 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.249
 Of course, it is also a question of not only the development of loyalty 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:33.509
 but stolen by the drivers 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.509
 there is still set MÃ¼ller Pascal back 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.960
 There are already customers 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.229
 even if the artist still costs 180 thousand euros 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.819
 of it alone make the battery is not 50 euros not a pity 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:48.769
 Pillar of choice 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.569
 the tightened German automobile next to Goethe himself is probably only 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.499
 coincidence 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.659
 the IBM winding has overslept its association that is supposed to be with the electric car 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.859
 not happen 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.309
 the Bavarian electro-pioneer is doing a banking feasible in his office 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.899
 like with 1000 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.149
 also not solved 

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:10.249
 Here are in addition to the whole subject battery and electric 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:14.189
 There is only one thing you need to know about developments worldwide 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.659
 Today, a lithium-ion battery costs between 10 and 15 thousand euros 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.039
 more than a few small vehicles 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.090
 more and l 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.749
 to bring down the costs 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:30.579
 Increase storage capacity to make the security complete and the 

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:34.429
 Range of the are the major technical tasks of ours 

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:37.429
 for everyone else in the world over the next five to ten years 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.610
 the wife of Aloys Ruf 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.099
 his lectures are in demand like never before 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.029
 2009 has to travel a lot with them 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.579
 but let's just finally get the subject of electric cars in motion 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.069
 and again he grins he's shipped elsewhere 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.990
 To show all that and that's the Brummer, the engineers do not come to that 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.990
 to develop further 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.650
 for now 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.309
 Projects under 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:08.539
 the Chinese 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:09.679
 Ask already after
