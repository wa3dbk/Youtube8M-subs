00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it's so we've made it to be more rugged

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.760 
it's so we've made it to be more rugged
and<00:00:59.910> one<00:01:00.059> durable<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.260> saw<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.620> can

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and one durable like you saw you can

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.619 
and one durable like you saw you can
drop<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.370> dropped<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> twice<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:03.359> away

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
drop it you dropped it twice right away

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.280 
drop it you dropped it twice right away
and<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.830> ok<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.330> water<00:01:06.570> resistant

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and it was ok this is water resistant

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
and it was ok this is water resistant
you<00:01:08.130> know<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> think<00:01:08.790> about<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.060> child

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you know when you think about a child

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.249 
you know when you think about a child
putting<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> into<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.260> school<00:01:10.560> bag<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:15.259> we

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
putting it into a school bag and go we

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.789 
putting it into a school bag and go we
designed<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> voice<00:01:17.720> with<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> help<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.350> some

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
designed the voice with the help of some

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
designed the voice with the help of some
special<00:01:20.220> people<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.939> Intel<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:21.570> are

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
special people at Intel which are

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.859 
special people at Intel which are
focused<00:01:22.710> more<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:22.979> ethnography<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> user

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
focused more on ethnography and user

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.609 
focused more on ethnography and user
designers<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.340> wasn't<00:01:26.670> designed<00:01:27.000> by<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
designers so it wasn't designed by so is

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.530 
designers so it wasn't designed by so is
there<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.909> difference<00:01:29.909> between<00:01:30.119> these

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
there a difference between these

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.410 
there a difference between these
generation<00:01:31.259> laptops<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.820> other<00:01:32.939> half

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
generation laptops and the other half

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.770 
generation laptops and the other half
okay<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.740> yeah<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.630> main

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
okay so yeah that was one of the main

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.399 
okay so yeah that was one of the main
ones<00:01:37.130> there's<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.220> camera<00:01:38.549> oh<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.020> got<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
ones there's a camera oh and we got that

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.289 
ones there's a camera oh and we got that
actually<00:01:40.799> from<00:01:41.159> our<00:01:41.460> feedback<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.030> Latin

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
actually from our feedback in Latin

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.899 
actually from our feedback in Latin
America<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> kids<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.130> wanted<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
America where the kids really wanted to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.480 
America where the kids really wanted to
uh<00:01:45.240> huh<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.409> look<00:01:46.649> one<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.040> things<00:01:47.130> we've

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
uh huh to look one of the things we've

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.999 
uh huh to look one of the things we've
learned<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.810> nice<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
learned is this is nice but if I want to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.610 
learned is this is nice but if I want to
take<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> picture<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:52.490> then<00:01:53.490> let's<00:01:53.880> look<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.240> me

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
take a picture and then let's look at me

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.010 
take a picture and then let's look at me
so<00:01:55.340> now<00:01:55.490> we're<00:01:55.700> looking<00:01:55.790> at<00:01:56.150> how<00:01:56.750> can<00:01:56.930> you

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
so now we're looking at how can you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.050 
so now we're looking at how can you
design<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.530> camera<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.130> it's<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:58.430> top<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.940> it

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
design the camera so it's on top and it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.560 
design the camera so it's on top and it
turns<00:01:59.330> back<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.660> forth<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.500> come<00:02:00.680> no<00:02:01.310> I'm

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
mean we're taking this and we're looking

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.820 
mean we're taking this and we're looking
at<00:02:07.340> how<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:07.760> it<00:02:07.880> being<00:02:08.030> used<00:02:08.150> and<00:02:08.630> how<00:02:09.440> can<00:02:09.680> we

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
at how is it being used and how can we

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.250 
at how is it being used and how can we
improve<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> design<00:02:10.970> brochures<00:02:11.780> moving

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
improve on the design brochures moving

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.680 
improve on the design brochures moving
forward<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.060> skin<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.540> is

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
forward and and this is skin this is

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.100 
forward and and this is skin this is
typical<00:02:15.200> if<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.400> follow<00:02:16.550> technology<00:02:17.330> put<00:02:18.080> a

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
typical if you follow technology put a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.610 
typical if you follow technology put a

new technology out you learn for what it
how<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.190> works<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:23.030> can<00:02:23.180> make<00:02:23.330> better<00:02:23.540> and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
how it works and we can make better and

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.490 
how it works and we can make better and
you<00:02:25.010> were<00:02:25.130> advising<00:02:26.200> what<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.230> want<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
you were advising what I want the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.170 
you were advising what I want the
battery<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:29.360> battery<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:30.790> we<00:02:31.790> did<00:02:31.970> two

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
battery this battery is we did two

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.660 
battery this battery is we did two
things<00:02:32.210> on<00:02:32.600> this<00:02:32.750> design<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.860> first<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.400> you

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
things on this design the first is you

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.660 
things on this design the first is you
see<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.150> bag<00:02:35.510> stops<00:02:35.990> here<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.430> can

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
see that bag stops here and so I can

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.640 
see that bag stops here and so I can
easily<00:02:37.820> access<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.720> battery<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.230> take<00:02:39.500> it
