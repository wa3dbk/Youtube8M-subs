00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
don't have square paper you can take a

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.560 
don't have square paper you can take a
piece<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.750> printer<00:01:26.320> paper<00:01:26.350> with<00:01:26.950> Poppy<00:01:27.160> paper

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
is double-sided I'm going to pick the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.330 
is double-sided I'm going to pick the
side<00:02:54.660> where<00:02:54.870> my<00:02:55.019> creases<00:02:55.319> are<00:02:55.620> most<00:02:55.799> dominant

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
side where my creases are most dominant

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.330 
side where my creases are most dominant

get to this line right here then on do
it<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.890> then<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.490> want<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.790> cut<00:03:41.130> right<00:03:42.130> here

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
it and then you want to cut right here

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.970 
it and then you want to cut right here
where<00:03:44.800> your<00:03:45.130> new<00:03:45.490> crease<00:03:45.820> meets<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.690> old<00:03:46.870> one

but<00:06:34.680> I'm<00:06:34.860> not<00:06:35.010> going<00:06:35.250> to<00:06:35.310> be<00:06:35.490> doing<00:06:35.729> that<00:06:36.000> step

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
but I'm not going to be doing that step

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.379 
but I'm not going to be doing that step
so<00:06:36.919> to<00:06:37.919> add<00:06:38.070> them<00:06:38.340> together<00:06:38.550> you<00:06:38.820> come<00:06:39.210> up<00:06:39.360> with

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
so to add them together you come up with

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:44.629 
so to add them together you come up with
glue<00:06:39.870> around<00:06:40.410> that<00:06:40.590> square<00:06:42.590> here<00:06:43.590> and<00:06:43.770> some

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
glue around that square here and some

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:55.890 
glue around that square here and some
glue<00:06:46.310> edit<00:06:47.310> both<00:06:47.669> of<00:06:47.970> them

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:07.360 

and<00:06:56.350> then<00:06:57.540> together<00:06:58.740> diagonally<00:06:59.740> like<00:06:59.920> this

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:15.390 

just<00:07:08.060> kind<00:07:08.360> of<00:07:09.940> what<00:07:10.940> this<00:07:11.210> dry

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.740 

when<00:07:16.030> it<00:07:16.120> dries<00:07:16.449> it<00:07:16.780> look<00:07:17.020> like<00:07:17.199> this<00:07:17.470> and<00:07:18.750> that

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750 
when it dries it look like this and that

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.650 
when it dries it look like this and that
is<00:07:19.900> how<00:07:20.020> you<00:07:20.080> make<00:07:20.290> the<00:07:20.440> paper<00:07:20.740> stars<00:07:23.520> and

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 
is how you make the paper stars and

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.600 
is how you make the paper stars and
there<00:07:25.660> you<00:07:25.840> have<00:07:26.050> it<00:07:26.229> that<00:07:26.410> is<00:07:26.440> how<00:07:26.830> to<00:07:27.460> make

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
there you have it that is how to make

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:35.880
