00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
to go up to weather here and we're going

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.179 
to go up to weather here and we're going
to<00:02:32.569> go<00:02:32.720> show<00:02:33.019> weather<00:02:35.409> so<00:02:36.409> if<00:02:36.650> we<00:02:36.799> just<00:02:36.980> sit

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.189 
to go show weather so if we just sit

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.580 
to go show weather so if we just sit
here<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.549> wait<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.849> second<00:02:38.329> it<00:02:38.629> should<00:02:38.870> load

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
here and wait a second it should load

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.949 
here and wait a second it should load
the<00:02:39.829> weather<00:02:42.909> okay<00:02:43.909> so<00:02:44.389> it<00:02:44.510> looks<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:44.810> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
the weather okay so it looks like the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.369 
the weather okay so it looks like the
weather<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.680> heading<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.159> 1<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.549> 0<00:02:47.379> so

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
weather is on a heading of 1 to 0 so

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.449 
weather is on a heading of 1 to 0 so
that's<00:02:48.560> going<00:02:49.720> southeast<00:02:50.889> which<00:02:51.889> is<00:02:52.040> perfect

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
that's going southeast which is perfect

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.660 
that's going southeast which is perfect
so<00:02:52.879> we're<00:02:53.120> going<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.299> take<00:02:53.569> off<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.959> runway<00:02:54.670> a30

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
so we're going to take off of runway a30

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.899

I know that right away to find out which

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.809 
I know that right away to find out which
runway<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.599> what<00:03:00.230> if<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.220> go<00:03:01.340> ahead<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.700> zoom

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.939 

so<00:03:25.849> we'll<00:03:25.970> go<00:03:26.060> ahead<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.359> look<00:03:26.480> at<00:03:26.629> that

so we'll go ahead and look at that

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.559 
so we'll go ahead and look at that
runway<00:03:27.949> 3-0<00:03:28.459> we<00:03:28.970> know<00:03:29.120> we're<00:03:29.269> going<00:03:29.359> to<00:03:29.449> have

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
runway 3-0 we know we're going to have

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.599 
runway 3-0 we know we're going to have
to<00:03:29.690> take<00:03:29.840> off<00:03:30.019> into<00:03:30.199> the<00:03:30.319> wind<00:03:30.379> so<00:03:31.310> that's

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
to take off into the wind so that's

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.699 
to take off into the wind so that's
really<00:03:31.849> good<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.690> we're<00:03:33.019> going<00:03:33.109> to<00:03:33.169> zoom<00:03:33.260> out

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
really good so we're going to zoom out

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.770 
really good so we're going to zoom out
over<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> little<00:03:34.639> bit<00:03:34.879> we're<00:03:35.510> going<00:03:35.629> to<00:03:35.690> go

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
over that a little bit we're going to go

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.520 
over that a little bit we're going to go
to<00:03:35.859> Sid<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.370> we're<00:03:37.519> going<00:03:37.699> to<00:03:37.760> select<00:03:38.530> and

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
to Sid and we're going to select and

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.199 
to Sid and we're going to select and
we're<00:03:39.799> going<00:03:39.919> to<00:03:39.949> go<00:03:40.159> ahead<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.699> look<00:03:40.879> for<00:03:40.940> our

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
we're going to go ahead and look for our

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.180 
we're going to go ahead and look for our
runway<00:03:41.510> 3-0<00:03:42.139> now<00:03:42.500> we<00:03:42.560> want<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:42.889> find<00:03:43.099> a

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
runway 3-0 now we want to find a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.530 
runway 3-0 now we want to find a
waypoint<00:03:43.340> that's<00:03:43.699> going<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:43.879> take<00:03:44.060> us<00:03:44.209> south

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
waypoint that's going to take us south

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.110 
waypoint that's going to take us south
to<00:03:44.780> Calgary<00:03:45.169> so<00:03:45.889> we<00:03:46.069> want<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.370> find<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.760> good<00:03:46.940> one

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
to Calgary so we want to find a good one

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.599 
to Calgary so we want to find a good one
so<00:03:47.359> we're<00:03:47.510> going<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.709> find<00:03:48.709> one<00:03:48.889> until<00:03:49.310> we<00:03:49.400> see

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
so we're going to find one until we see

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.180 
so we're going to find one until we see
one<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.000> now<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:51.260> one<00:03:51.470> looks<00:03:51.739> pretty<00:03:51.829> good

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
one and now that one looks pretty good

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.670 
one and now that one looks pretty good
so<00:03:52.599> now<00:03:53.599> what<00:03:53.870> we're<00:03:53.989> going<00:03:54.079> to<00:03:54.139> do<00:03:54.349> is<00:03:54.530> we're

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
so now what we're going to do is we're

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.399 
so now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.829> zoom<00:03:55.159> out<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.840> looks<00:03:57.109> like<00:03:57.229> it

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
going to zoom out and that looks like it

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.849 
going to zoom out and that looks like it
takes<00:03:57.620> us<00:03:57.799> right<00:03:57.979> to<00:03:58.310> where<00:03:58.549> we<00:03:58.729> want<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.000> go

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
takes us right to where we want to go

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.420 
takes us right to where we want to go
which<00:04:00.859> is<00:04:01.040> perfect<00:04:02.979> so<00:04:03.979> we'll<00:04:04.099> go<00:04:04.190> ahead<00:04:04.220> and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
which is perfect so we'll go ahead and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.110
