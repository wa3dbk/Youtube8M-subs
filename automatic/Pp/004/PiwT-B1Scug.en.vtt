probably won't be able to use it unless
you<00:04:09.840> unless<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.470> go<00:04:10.590> over<00:04:10.980> your<00:04:11.160> skin<00:04:11.459> with

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
you unless you go over your skin with

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.270 
you unless you go over your skin with
something<00:04:12.000> else<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.470> at<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.980> point<00:04:14.100> it's

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
something else and at that point it's

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.800 
something else and at that point it's
like<00:04:14.370> what's<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.610> point<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:15.120> using<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.600> tinted

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
like what's the point of using a tinted

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.360 
like what's the point of using a tinted
moisturizer<00:04:16.109> if<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.680> have<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:16.950> cover<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.220> with

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
moisturizer if you have to cover it with

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.890 
moisturizer if you have to cover it with
something<00:04:17.519> else

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
something else

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.090 
something else
and<00:04:19.079> I'm<00:04:19.260> in<00:04:19.579> my<00:04:20.579> darkest<00:04:21.000> I'm<00:04:21.150> NW<00:04:21.630> 43<00:04:22.079> /nc<00:04:22.620> 50

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
and I'm in my darkest I'm NW 43 /nc 50

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.850 
and I'm in my darkest I'm NW 43 /nc 50
and<00:04:23.430> for<00:04:24.360> me<00:04:24.540> it<00:04:24.810> matches<00:04:25.229> perfectly

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
and for me it matches perfectly

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.250 
and for me it matches perfectly
so<00:04:26.790> NW<00:04:27.419> 45<00:04:27.840> or<00:04:29.030> NC<00:04:30.030> 55<00:04:30.510> which<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.840> lot<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.050> people

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
so NW 45 or NC 55 which a lot of people

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.350 
so NW 45 or NC 55 which a lot of people
aren't<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:32.310> know<00:04:32.430> anybody<00:04:33.000> darker

aren't but you know anybody darker
that's<00:04:34.050> probably<00:04:34.530> going<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.800> probably<00:04:35.010> be<00:04:35.310> a

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
that's probably going to probably be a

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.430 
that's probably going to probably be a
little<00:04:35.430> bit<00:04:35.610> too<00:04:35.729> light<00:04:35.880> for<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:37.020> if

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
little bit too light for you so if

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.110 
little bit too light for you so if
you're<00:04:37.889> lighter<00:04:38.190> than<00:04:38.340> if<00:04:38.669> you're<00:04:38.850> someone

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
you're lighter than if you're someone

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.510 
you're lighter than if you're someone
like<00:04:39.150> me<00:04:39.300> or<00:04:39.660> lighter<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.979> you<00:04:41.100> just<00:04:41.280> want

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
light coverage you just want something

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.230 
light coverage you just want something
to<00:04:43.410> kind<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.680> smooth<00:04:43.979> even<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.550> out<00:04:44.610> without

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
to kind of smooth even you out without

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.360 
to kind of smooth even you out without
having<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.720> whole<00:04:45.870> lot<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:46.169> makeup<00:04:46.290> on<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:47.220> is

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
having a whole lot of makeup on this is

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.480 
having a whole lot of makeup on this is
really<00:04:47.550> nice<00:04:47.820> um<00:04:48.660> again<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:51.800> con<00:04:52.800> is<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.190> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
really nice um again the con is that the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.120 
really nice um again the con is that the
coloring<00:04:53.850> is<00:04:54.240> way<00:04:54.419> off<00:04:54.449> it<00:04:54.900> does<00:04:55.020> not<00:04:55.229> it's<00:04:55.889> not

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
coloring is way off it does not it's not

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.010 
coloring is way off it does not it's not
suitable<00:04:56.550> for<00:04:56.610> all<00:04:56.729> skin<00:04:56.789> for<00:04:57.389> all<00:04:57.539> skin<00:04:57.810> tones

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
suitable for all skin for all skin tones

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.659 
suitable for all skin for all skin tones
and<00:04:59.240> um<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:00.560> just<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.919> think<00:05:02.039> it<00:05:02.280> is<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.400> little

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
and um I just I think it is a little

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.480 
and um I just I think it is a little
expensive<00:05:02.990> me<00:05:03.990> personally<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.440> don't<00:05:05.160> know<00:05:05.400> if

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
expensive me personally I don't know if

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.860 
expensive me personally I don't know if
I<00:05:05.550> would<00:05:05.669> pay<00:05:05.789> 20<00:05:07.400> 1964<00:05:08.400> than<00:05:08.550> this<00:05:08.669> so<00:05:09.270> I<00:05:09.300> can't

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
I would pay 20 1964 than this so I can't

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.520 
I would pay 20 1964 than this so I can't
say<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:10.260> I<00:05:10.289> would<00:05:10.410> pay<00:05:10.940> $30<00:05:11.940> for<00:05:11.970> this<00:05:12.330> um<00:05:12.630> I'm

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
say that I would pay $30 for this um I'm

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.560 
say that I would pay $30 for this um I'm
probably<00:05:13.770> going<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.250> do<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.520> because<00:05:14.639> I'm<00:05:15.510> not
