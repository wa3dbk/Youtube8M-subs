00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hey now welcome to drill stuff real easy

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.290 
hey now welcome to drill stuff real easy
and<00:00:02.340> today<00:00:02.700> I'm<00:00:02.760> going<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> show<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.060> how<00:00:03.210> to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.480 
and today I'm going to show you how to
draw<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.510> sailboat<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.529> because<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.430> is

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
draw a sailboat and because this is

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.220 
draw a sailboat and because this is
drill<00:00:05.759> stuff<00:00:06.000> with<00:00:06.180> each<00:00:06.330> other<00:00:06.509> through<00:00:06.810> draw

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
drill stuff with each other through draw

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.230 
drill stuff with each other through draw
it<00:00:08.010> easy<00:00:08.400> for<00:00:08.639> kind<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:08.970> from<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> side<00:00:09.950> draw

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
it easy for kind of from the side draw

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.900 
it easy for kind of from the side draw
kind<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.710> bit<00:00:13.710> like<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.099> that's<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.519> prow

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
kind of a bit like that that's the prow

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.250 
kind of a bit like that that's the prow
that's<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> bit<00:00:15.630> that's<00:00:15.719> cutting<00:00:16.080> through

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
that's the bit that's cutting through

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.640 
that's the bit that's cutting through
the<00:00:16.379> water<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:17.730> then<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.449> banking<00:00:19.410> down

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the water and then just banking down

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.120 
the water and then just banking down
slightly<00:00:20.480> so<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.930> will<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.289> kind<00:00:23.039> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
slightly so that it will then kind of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.950 
slightly so that it will then kind of
slope<00:00:23.609> down<00:00:23.910> into<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> water<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> back

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
slope down into the water at the back

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.130 
slope down into the water at the back
there<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:26.220> you're<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:27.019> kind<00:00:28.019> of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
there and you're going to have kind of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.859 
there and you're going to have kind of
railings<00:00:29.039> across<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> front<00:00:30.060> like<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
railings across the front like that and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.430 
railings across the front like that and
then<00:00:31.590> you're<00:00:31.740> also<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:34.050> kind

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440

I'm going to zoom out

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.360 
I'm going to zoom out
it's<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> physics<00:00:48.930> organ<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it's a physics organ is that going to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.319 
it's a physics organ is that going to
fit<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:51.059> there<00:00:51.629> yeah<00:00:52.579> then<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:54.210> we

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
fit up about there yeah then what we

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.580 
fit up about there yeah then what we
want<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> line<00:00:54.989> coming<00:00:55.350> straight<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
want is a line coming straight there and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
want is a line coming straight there and
then<00:00:59.210> curving<00:01:00.210> round<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> about<00:01:03.000> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then curving round to kind of about like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.789 
then curving round to kind of about like
that

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.200 
that
some<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:04.979> portholes<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:05.820> well<00:01:06.030> you're

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
some little portholes as well you're

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
sail in first now I'm not going to do

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.240 
sail in first now I'm not going to do
this<00:01:25.880> that's<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.470> is<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> bits<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> stop

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
this that's the is the bits that stop

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.749 
this that's the is the bits that stop
you<00:01:29.369> falling<00:01:29.729> off<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.060> you're<00:01:30.210> doing<00:01:30.689> your

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
you falling off when you're doing your

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
you falling off when you're doing your
Titanic<00:01:32.930> pose<00:01:34.820> um<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:40.159> sound<00:01:41.159> is

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
Titanic pose um and then your sound is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.870 
Titanic pose um and then your sound is
going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.880> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
going to going to go like that and the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.270 
going to going to go like that and the
body<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.960> cabin<00:01:46.500> will

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
body of the cabin will

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.580 
body of the cabin will
go<00:01:48.000> along<00:01:48.300> like<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:50.660> that's<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.900> mast<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
go along like that that's the mast and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.080 
go along like that that's the mast and
somewhere<00:01:53.010> in<00:01:53.190> all<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.550> of<00:01:53.730> course<00:01:53.760> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
somewhere in all of this of course is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.690 
somewhere in all of this of course is
the<00:01:54.120> rigging<00:01:54.630> which<00:01:55.160> I'm<00:01:56.160> not<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.550> put

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the rigging which I'm not going to put

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.360 
the rigging which I'm not going to put
in<00:01:56.850> since<00:01:57.120> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.600> drill<00:01:58.140> stuff<00:01:58.410> real

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
in since this is the drill stuff real

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.210 
in since this is the drill stuff real
easy<00:01:59.640> version<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.170> find<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> kind

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
easy version of it if you find that kind

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.080 
easy version of it if you find that kind
of<00:02:02.340> case<00:02:03.590> something<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.650> that<00:02:04.770> uh<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.850> want

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
of case something like that uh you want

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.210 
of case something like that uh you want
some<00:02:06.300> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.900> spray<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.740> water

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
some kind of spray on the water

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.910 
some kind of spray on the water
and<00:02:09.440> um<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:12.260> usually<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.410> painted<00:02:13.830> quite

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and um and usually it's painted quite

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.150 
and um and usually it's painted quite
dark<00:02:14.280> along<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> bottom<00:02:15.270> right<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:16.160> fill

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
dark along the bottom right there fill

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.520 
dark along the bottom right there fill
that<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.030> you're<00:02:18.959> gonna<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.350> some

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
that in and then you're gonna want some

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.620 
that in and then you're gonna want some
