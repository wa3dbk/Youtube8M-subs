00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
called revolution which is really cool I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.140 
called revolution which is really cool I
like<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> idea<00:00:27.740> to<00:00:28.880> basically<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.000> don't

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
like the idea to basically you don't

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.609 
like the idea to basically you don't
have<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.359> spin<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.840> buttons<00:00:31.199> anymore

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
have to spin your buttons anymore

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.799 
have to spin your buttons anymore
especially<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.189> Slayer<00:00:32.430> task<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.120> think

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
especially on the Slayer task I think

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.479 
especially on the Slayer task I think
that<00:00:34.110> would<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> best<00:00:34.559> thing<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that would be the best thing to do and I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.020 
that would be the best thing to do and I
as<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.180> 99<00:00:36.660> Slayer<00:00:36.989> master<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.879> it's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
as a 99 Slayer master I think it's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
as a 99 Slayer master I think it's
pretty<00:00:39.510> cool

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
pretty cool

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.650

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.510 
clothes and make some money so as a dual
of<00:01:43.920> PBM<00:01:45.049> it'd<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.229> more<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.680> reason<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> get

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
of PBM it'd be more of a reason to get

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.440 
of PBM it'd be more of a reason to get
that<00:01:47.670> quest<00:01:47.909> done<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.299> start<00:01:48.860> going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.450> Dedes

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.480 
yeah dragon calls or so God swords again
probably<00:02:19.500> most<00:02:19.830> likely<00:02:20.160> due<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.610> price

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
probably most likely due to the price

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.170 
probably most likely due to the price
skyrocketing<00:02:23.490> due<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> fact<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
skyrocketing due to the fact that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.089 
skyrocketing due to the fact that
special<00:02:24.600> attacks<00:02:24.810> are<00:02:25.050> back

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
now I've they'll about around a little

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.690 
now I've they'll about around a little
dabbled<00:02:30.980> around<00:02:31.159> a<00:02:31.219> little<00:02:31.340> bit<00:02:31.549> before

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
dabbled around a little bit before

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.030 
dabbled around a little bit before
starting<00:02:32.599> this<00:02:32.689> video<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.260> realized<00:02:33.590> that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
starting this video and I realized that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.459 
starting this video and I realized that
the<00:02:34.219> vine<00:02:34.670> whip<00:02:34.909> does<00:02:35.329> not<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.049> special

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
the vine whip does not have a special

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.690 
the vine whip does not have a special
attack<00:02:36.939> I<00:02:37.939> don't<00:02:38.239> know<00:02:38.510> if<00:02:38.599> this<00:02:38.749> is<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> mint<00:02:39.139> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
attack I don't know if this is a mint of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.020 
attack I don't know if this is a mint of
mist

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
mist

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.720 
mist
what's<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.450> code

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.000

offhand<00:03:32.940> will<00:03:33.330> give<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.810> option<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.440> use

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
offhand will give you the option to use

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
offhand will give you the option to use
a<00:03:34.620> special<00:03:35.040> attack<00:03:35.130> or<00:03:35.460> not

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
a special attack or not

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.340 
a special attack or not
this<00:03:36.790> will<00:03:36.940> find<00:03:37.120> out<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.540> apparently<00:03:37.990> not<00:03:38.170> it

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
this will find out and apparently not it

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.460 
this will find out and apparently not it
is<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.800> ass<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.220> be<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.400> main<00:03:39.550> hand<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:41.080> the

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
is the ass to be the main hand so the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.900 
is the ass to be the main hand so the
best<00:03:41.650> combination<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.190> have<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.550> can<00:03:42.700> I

best combination you have you can I

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.480 
best combination you have you can I
could<00:03:43.210> have<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.480> hands<00:03:44.140> Excalibur<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.370> the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
could have the hands Excalibur and the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.030 
could have the hands Excalibur and the
main<00:03:45.670> dragon<00:03:46.090> dagger<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.650> now<00:03:47.740> we'll<00:03:47.860> give<00:03:47.950> it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.800 
a special attack
as<00:03:50.880> right<00:03:51.090> now<00:03:51.240> I'm<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:54.000> scale<00:03:54.540> which

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
as right now I'm on the the scale which

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.560 
as right now I'm on the the scale which
they<00:03:55.080> call<00:03:55.640> revolution<00:03:56.640> basically<00:03:57.360> what<00:03:57.480> it

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
they call revolution basically what it

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.210 
they call revolution basically what it
does<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.870> activate<00:03:58.200> revolution<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.010> might

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
does is activate revolution I might

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.560 
does is activate revolution I might
leave<00:03:59.370> your<00:03:59.550> basic<00:03:59.850> abilities<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.330> order

interaction<00:04:02.250> border<00:04:02.490> that's<00:04:03.090> one<00:04:03.270> line<00:04:03.420> so

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
interaction border that's one line so

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.270 
interaction border that's one line so
basically<00:04:03.900> they<00:04:04.650> will<00:04:04.740> just<00:04:04.890> use<00:04:05.040> all<00:04:05.190> your

use one of these you have built yourself

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.260 
use one of these you have built yourself
which<00:04:11.070> is<00:04:11.100> kind<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.370> cool<00:04:11.550> because<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.240> know

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
with the mace I was also able to get

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.180 
with the mace I was also able to get
that<00:05:06.130> is<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.460> 25%

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
that is that 25%

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.450

and the dragon battle-ax is at

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.360 
and the dragon battle-ax is at
100%<00:05:12.690> do<00:05:13.690> 20%<00:05:14.050> more<00:05:14.440> melee<00:05:14.710> damage<00:05:14.980> would

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
100% do 20% more melee damage would

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.790 
100% do 20% more melee damage would
reduce<00:05:15.610> your<00:05:15.670> hit<00:05:16.660> chance<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.290> defense<00:05:17.620> by

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
reduce your hit chance and defense by

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.730 
reduce your hit chance and defense by
10%<00:05:18.280> for<00:05:18.340> a<00:05:18.520> minute<00:05:18.850> that's<00:05:19.840> pretty<00:05:20.140> cool

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.800 

do<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:23.340> do<00:05:23.460> more<00:05:23.610> damage<00:05:24.390> yeah<00:05:24.510> I<00:05:24.570> think<00:05:24.660> you

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
do you do more damage yeah I think you

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.900 
do you do more damage yeah I think you
used<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.080> be<00:05:25.200> like<00:05:25.500> more<00:05:25.800> strengths<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.550> think<00:05:26.580> I

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
used to be like more strengths I think I

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.680 
used to be like more strengths I think I
don't<00:05:27.060> know<00:05:27.240> man

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
don't know man

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.210 
don't know man
my<00:05:28.080> penny<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.380> think<00:05:28.620> you'd<00:05:28.710> go<00:05:28.830> back<00:05:28.980> to<00:05:29.130> it

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
my penny I think you'd go back to it

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.980 
my penny I think you'd go back to it
used<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.520> be<00:05:29.640> where<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:29.850> think<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.450> increase

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
used to be where I think you increase

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.360 
used to be where I think you increase
yell<00:05:31.230> based<00:05:31.440> though<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.710> Davis<00:05:31.950> increase<00:05:32.190> your

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
yell based though it Davis increase your

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.840 
yell based though it Davis increase your
strength<00:05:33.140> by<00:05:34.140> believe<00:05:34.830> like<00:05:35.340> four<00:05:35.730> or<00:05:35.820> five

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
strength by believe like four or five

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.909 
strength by believe like four or five
levels

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
levels

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.040 
levels
but<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.250> guess<00:05:38.430> that's<00:05:38.639> just<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.910> big<00:05:39.180> ESC

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
but I guess that's just the big ESC

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.590 
but I guess that's just the big ESC
version<00:05:40.440> of<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.680> I'm<00:05:40.860> not<00:05:41.040> sure<00:05:41.250> mmm<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.360> again

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
version of it I'm not sure mmm and again

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.390 
version of it I'm not sure mmm and again
as<00:05:43.259> I<00:05:43.350> mentioned<00:05:43.380> earlier<00:05:43.889> that<00:05:43.979> language

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
as I mentioned earlier that language

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.330 
as I mentioned earlier that language
does<00:05:44.580> not<00:05:44.790> have<00:05:45.030> a<00:05:45.060> special<00:05:45.389> attack<00:05:46.220> when<00:05:47.220> you

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
does not have a special attack when you

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.260 
does not have a special attack when you
put<00:05:47.759> it<00:05:47.820> on<00:05:47.910> there

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
put it on there

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.640 
put it on there
it<00:05:48.570> just<00:05:48.780> says<00:05:50.539> well<00:05:51.539> that's<00:05:52.110> time<00:05:52.350> I<00:05:52.380> remember

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
it just says well that's time I remember

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.529 
it just says well that's time I remember
the<00:05:52.800> best<00:05:52.949> vine<00:05:53.610> whip<00:05:53.789> did<00:05:54.000> have<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.180> special

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
the best vine whip did have a special

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.689 
the best vine whip did have a special
attack<00:05:54.780> in<00:05:54.960> it<00:05:55.080> I<00:05:55.590> think<00:05:56.039> it<00:05:56.130> hit<00:05:56.250> pretty<00:05:56.280> good

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
attack in it I think it hit pretty good

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.900 
attack in it I think it hit pretty good
and<00:05:57.000> he<00:05:57.539> poisoned<00:05:58.169> people<00:05:58.340> so<00:05:59.340> I'm<00:05:59.699> not<00:05:59.850> sure

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
and he poisoned people so I'm not sure

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.439 
and he poisoned people so I'm not sure
like<00:06:00.360> again<00:06:00.600> if<00:06:00.750> this<00:06:00.840> was<00:06:01.020> a<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:02.210> missed<00:06:03.210> by

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
like again if this was a I missed by

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.400 
like again if this was a I missed by
jagex<00:06:03.930> or<00:06:04.229> they<00:06:04.800> decided<00:06:05.280> not<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:05.430> do<00:06:05.639> it

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
jagex or they decided not to do it

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.100 
jagex or they decided not to do it
so<00:06:08.000> no<00:06:09.000> take<00:06:09.900> off<00:06:10.050> from<00:06:10.199> this

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
so no take off from this

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.360 
so no take off from this
they've<00:06:12.440> been<00:06:12.590> off<00:06:12.770> mission<00:06:13.310> interactive

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
they've been off mission interactive

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.560 
they've been off mission interactive
momentum<00:06:16.370> is<00:06:16.550> apparently<00:06:16.880> a<00:06:16.940> lot<00:06:17.150> better<00:06:17.360> now

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
momentum is apparently a lot better now

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.630 
momentum is apparently a lot better now
they<00:06:18.320> appreciate<00:06:18.890> the<00:06:18.980> called<00:06:19.280> super

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
they appreciate the called super

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.100 
they appreciate the called super
movement<00:06:19.970> so<00:06:20.090> I'm<00:06:20.300> not<00:06:20.450> sure<00:06:20.660> if<00:06:20.870> they

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
movement so I'm not sure if they

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.630 
movement so I'm not sure if they
implement<00:06:21.950> their<00:06:22.070> because<00:06:22.280> it<00:06:22.370> this<00:06:22.460> is

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
implement their because it this is

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.480 
implement their because it this is
momentum<00:06:22.940> right<00:06:23.240> now

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.500 

here<00:06:27.490> we<00:06:27.610> go<00:06:27.759> this

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
here we go this

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.879 
here we go this
through<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.900> old-fashioned<00:06:30.440> way

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.550 

it<00:06:34.039> was<00:06:34.430> gay

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.100 

and<00:06:38.740> caver<00:06:39.160> up<00:06:39.460> the

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
and caver up the

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.100 
and caver up the
use<00:06:41.590> their<00:06:41.740> special<00:06:41.949> attack

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.170 

so<00:06:45.740> that's<00:06:46.039> nice<00:06:46.280> to<00:06:46.520> have<00:06:46.610> that<00:06:46.819> one<00:06:47.000> back

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
so that's nice to have that one back

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.499 
so that's nice to have that one back
that<00:06:47.629> was<00:06:47.900> one<00:06:48.050> of<00:06:48.080> my<00:06:48.169> favorites

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
that was one of my favorites

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.240 
that was one of my favorites
of<00:06:50.930> course<00:06:51.139> I'm<00:06:51.289> sure<00:06:51.349> the<00:06:51.560> dragon<00:06:51.860> claws<00:06:52.039> are

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
of course I'm sure the dragon claws are

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.670 
of course I'm sure the dragon claws are
pretty<00:06:52.280> cool<00:06:52.900> I've<00:06:53.900> seen<00:06:54.139> a<00:06:54.169> little<00:06:54.439> bit<00:06:54.560> of

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
pretty cool I've seen a little bit of

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.839 
pretty cool I've seen a little bit of
them

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.790 

and<00:06:56.969> it<00:06:57.300> just<00:06:57.449> was<00:06:57.749> one<00:06:58.020> of<00:06:58.139> those<00:06:58.199> things

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
and it just was one of those things

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.609 
and it just was one of those things
that's<00:06:59.279> fun<00:06:59.520> to<00:06:59.939> the<00:06:59.999> dragon<00:07:00.509> mace<00:07:00.659> again<00:07:01.169> as

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:01.619 
that's fun to the dragon mace again as

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:03.320 
that's fun to the dragon mace again as
that

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
that

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.999 
that
so<00:07:03.870> pretty<00:07:04.110> much<00:07:04.169> all<00:07:04.289> your<00:07:04.440> dragon<00:07:04.710> weapons

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:05.009 
so pretty much all your dragon weapons

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.219 
so pretty much all your dragon weapons
still<00:07:05.159> have<00:07:05.310> their<00:07:05.490> special<00:07:06.150> attacks<00:07:06.229> just

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
still have their special attacks just

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.740 
still have their special attacks just
good<00:07:07.669> something<00:07:08.669> I'm<00:07:08.909> going<00:07:09.030> to<00:07:09.150> say<00:07:09.330> since<00:07:09.629> I

sent they not really report I guess on

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.649 
sent they not really report I guess on
my<00:07:16.440> opinion<00:07:17.009> I'm<00:07:17.669> not<00:07:17.729> many<00:07:18.120> I'm<00:07:18.389> sure<00:07:18.539> many

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:18.659 
my opinion I'm not many I'm sure many

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:21.260 
my opinion I'm not many I'm sure many
people<00:07:18.750> have<00:07:19.199> said<00:07:19.800> hey<00:07:20.000> we're<00:07:21.000> about<00:07:21.150> the

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.270 
people have said hey we're about the

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.740 
people have said hey we're about the
abyssal<00:07:21.509> whip<00:07:21.750> or<00:07:22.409> the<00:07:22.590> Bissell<00:07:23.069> vine<00:07:23.220> whip

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
abyssal whip or the Bissell vine whip

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.270 
abyssal whip or the Bissell vine whip
hopefully<00:07:24.750> this<00:07:24.870> would<00:07:24.990> help<00:07:25.139> leave<00:07:25.889> us<00:07:26.069> when

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
hopefully this would help leave us when

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.890 
hopefully this would help leave us when
we<00:07:26.400> least<00:07:26.639> go<00:07:26.819> up<00:07:26.849> a<00:07:27.030> little<00:07:27.120> bit<00:07:27.330> in<00:07:27.449> price<00:07:27.659> and

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 
we least go up a little bit in price and

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.960 
we least go up a little bit in price and
I<00:07:27.990> think<00:07:28.259> you<00:07:28.319> know<00:07:28.409> I'm<00:07:28.639> gonna<00:07:29.639> skyrocket

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970 
I think you know I'm gonna skyrocket

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.899 
I think you know I'm gonna skyrocket
like<00:07:30.300> dragon<00:07:30.629> calls<00:07:30.810> or<00:07:30.960> anything<00:07:31.139> like<00:07:31.379> that

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:31.909
