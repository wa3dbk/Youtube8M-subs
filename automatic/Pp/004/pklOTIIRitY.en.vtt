00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
to push as far as you have to press it

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.469 
to push as far as you have to press it
multiple<00:05:02.400> times<00:05:02.460> is<00:05:02.880> just<00:05:02.910> you<00:05:03.150> have<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.300> get

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
multiple times is just you have to get

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.510 
multiple times is just you have to get
used<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.780> having<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.110> press<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.740> little<00:05:05.340> bit

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
used to having to press a little bit

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.180 
used to having to press a little bit
harder<00:05:05.910> because<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.680> rubber<00:05:07.680> is<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.919> little

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
harder because of the rubber is a little

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.439 
harder because of the rubber is a little
stiff<00:05:08.400> but<00:05:08.669> i'm<00:05:08.880> pretty<00:05:09.030> sure<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.210> will

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
stiff but i'm pretty sure that will

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.180 
stiff but i'm pretty sure that will
loosen<00:05:09.539> up<00:05:09.780> over<00:05:09.990> time<00:05:10.789> and<00:05:12.889> man<00:05:13.889> i'm<00:05:14.009> really

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
loosen up over time and man i'm really

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.320 
loosen up over time and man i'm really
like<00:05:14.340> in<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:14.550> case<00:05:14.759> it's<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.090> really<00:05:15.240> good

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
like in this case it's a really good

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.170 
like in this case it's a really good
case<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.840> chose<00:05:16.500> not<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.949> get<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.400> black<00:05:17.910> when<00:05:18.150> I

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
case I chose not to get the black when I

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.580 
case I chose not to get the black when I
chose<00:05:18.449> to<00:05:18.510> get<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.690> white<00:05:18.840> one<00:05:18.870> only<00:05:19.440> because

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
chose to get the white one only because

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.960 
chose to get the white one only because
I<00:05:20.070> think<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.340> white<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.639> grey<00:05:20.789> would

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
I think the white and the grey would

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.300 
I think the white and the grey would
look<00:05:21.090> better<00:05:21.270> with<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.870> carbon<00:05:22.770> fiber<00:05:23.010> as

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
look better with the carbon fiber as

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.460 
look better with the carbon fiber as
well<00:05:23.729> as<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.419> black<00:05:24.690> when<00:05:24.990> you<00:05:25.080> get<00:05:25.199> cases

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
well as the black when you get cases

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.050 
well as the black when you get cases
like<00:05:25.830> this<00:05:26.039> with<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.490> black<00:05:26.760> with<00:05:27.030> the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
like this with the black with the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.360 
like this with the black with the
plastic<00:05:27.570> on<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.720> back<00:05:27.930> they<00:05:28.770> tend<00:05:28.979> to<00:05:29.039> scratch

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
plastic on the back they tend to scratch

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.300 
plastic on the back they tend to scratch
really<00:05:29.699> easy<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:31.139> know<00:05:31.410> it<00:05:31.949> sounds<00:05:32.130> dumb

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
really easy and I know it sounds dumb

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.129 
really easy and I know it sounds dumb
but<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.699> like<00:05:32.850> my<00:05:33.030> cases<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.510> look<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.750> little<00:05:33.870> new

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
but I like my cases to look a little new

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.839 
but I like my cases to look a little new
I<00:05:34.320> mean<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.740> do<00:05:34.800> kind<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.160> cover<00:05:35.400> up<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.639> very

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
I mean I do kind of cover up a very

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.060 
I mean I do kind of cover up a very
beautiful<00:05:36.060> device<00:05:36.510> so<00:05:36.780> I<00:05:36.840> figured<00:05:37.229> and<00:05:37.440> all

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
beautiful device so I figured and all

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.529 
beautiful device so I figured and all
these<00:05:38.190> should<00:05:38.430> cases<00:05:39.090> should<00:05:39.210> kind<00:05:39.479> of

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
these should cases should kind of

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.589 
these should cases should kind of
withstand<00:05:40.470> some<00:05:40.770> wear<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.099> tear<00:05:41.280> but<00:05:41.610> the

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
withstand some wear and tear but the

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:43.550 
withstand some wear and tear but the
white<00:05:42.750> when<00:05:42.900> it's<00:05:43.020> not<00:05:43.110> going<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.320> show<00:05:43.440> us

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
white when it's not going to show us

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.080 
white when it's not going to show us
many<00:05:43.740> scratches<00:05:43.919> that's<00:05:44.280> why<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.550> got<00:05:44.729> it<00:05:44.910> and

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
many scratches that's why I got it and

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.560 
many scratches that's why I got it and
just<00:05:45.840> another<00:05:46.080> thing<00:05:46.199> to<00:05:46.259> add<00:05:46.349> to<00:05:46.500> is<00:05:47.570> there's

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
just another thing to add to is there's

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.990 
just another thing to add to is there's
a<00:05:48.720> case<00:05:48.960> mate<00:05:49.199> cut<00:05:49.440> out<00:05:49.590> right<00:05:49.800> here<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.280> the

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
a case mate cut out right here and the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.129 
a case mate cut out right here and the
case-mate<00:05:51.330> logo<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.110> actually<00:05:52.440> rubber<00:05:54.139> so

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
case-mate logo is actually rubber so

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.110 
case-mate logo is actually rubber so
that<00:05:55.169> will<00:05:55.470> go<00:05:55.620> well<00:05:55.800> when<00:05:56.220> you're<00:05:56.760> laying<00:05:56.970> it

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
that will go well when you're laying it

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.909 
that will go well when you're laying it
down<00:05:57.180> and<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:58.110> maybe<00:05:58.139> have<00:05:58.470> it<00:05:58.590> somewhere<00:05:58.740> you

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
down and you maybe have it somewhere you

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.260 
down and you maybe have it somewhere you
don't<00:05:59.010> want<00:05:59.099> it<00:05:59.250> to<00:05:59.310> slide<00:05:59.550> I<00:05:59.849> don't<00:06:00.150> know

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
don't want it to slide I don't know

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.870 
don't want it to slide I don't know
really<00:06:00.690> what<00:06:00.990> that<00:06:01.110> would<00:06:01.289> be<00:06:01.380> used<00:06:01.590> for<00:06:01.880> also

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
really what that would be used for also

a good buy i will let you guys know in a
couple<00:06:29.220> weeks<00:06:29.460> or<00:06:29.669> so<00:06:29.849> how<00:06:30.000> I<00:06:30.030> think<00:06:30.659> about<00:06:30.870> it

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
couple weeks or so how I think about it

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.399 
couple weeks or so how I think about it
and<00:06:31.860> how<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.820> holds<00:06:33.090> up<00:06:33.210> I<00:06:33.510> don't<00:06:34.080> drop<00:06:34.289> my

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
and how it holds up I don't drop my

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.770 
and how it holds up I don't drop my
phone<00:06:34.620> costs<00:06:34.949> so<00:06:35.070> I<00:06:35.099> can't<00:06:35.400> really<00:06:35.550> say<00:06:35.849> if

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
phone costs so I can't really say if

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.320 
phone costs so I can't really say if
it's<00:06:37.349> going<00:06:37.470> to<00:06:37.530> last<00:06:37.770> a<00:06:38.010> drop<00:06:38.880> or<00:06:39.030> anything

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
it's going to last a drop or anything
