whether<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.789> better<00:04:22.969> than<00:04:23.120> Maxie<00:04:23.599> I

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
whether this is better than Maxie I

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.490 
whether this is better than Maxie I
don't

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
don't

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.740 
don't
no<00:04:24.620> Maxie<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.520> coming<00:04:25.760> out<00:04:25.850> in<00:04:26.000> storm<00:04:26.270> Ragnarok

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.000 
no Maxie is coming out in storm Ragnarok
and<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:27.020> think<00:04:27.260> that<00:04:27.410> would<00:04:27.500> be<00:04:27.620> one<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.830> the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
and I think that would be one of the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.440 
and I think that would be one of the
better<00:04:28.160> cards<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.640> side<00:04:28.850> ik<00:04:28.970> against<00:04:29.330> them

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
better cards to the side ik against them

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.270 
better cards to the side ik against them
as<00:04:29.570> well<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.880> this<00:04:32.090> can<00:04:32.270> slow<00:04:32.450> them<00:04:32.630> down

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
as well but this can slow them down

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.560 
as well but this can slow them down
Maxie<00:04:34.280> if<00:04:34.490> they're<00:04:34.700> about<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:35.000> kill<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.360> they

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
Maxie if they're about to kill you they

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.660 
Maxie if they're about to kill you they
don't<00:04:35.780> care<00:04:35.990> about<00:04:36.250> stopping<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.460> from

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
don't care about stopping you from

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.210 
don't care about stopping you from
drawing<00:04:37.970> they<00:04:38.390> can<00:04:38.600> pretty<00:04:39.140> much<00:04:39.320> let<00:04:40.070> you

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
drawing they can pretty much let you

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.880 
drawing they can pretty much let you
draw<00:04:40.490> as<00:04:40.640> many<00:04:40.760> cards<00:04:41.060> as<00:04:41.180> they<00:04:41.500> they<00:04:42.500> want<00:04:42.740> you

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
draw as many cards as they they want you

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.460 
draw as many cards as they they want you
to<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.370> just<00:04:44.090> swarm<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.690> feeling<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.260> kill

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
to and just swarm the feeling and kill

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.140 
to and just swarm the feeling and kill
you<00:04:45.620> in<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:45.830> turn<00:04:46.010> if<00:04:46.250> they<00:04:46.430> really<00:04:46.820> want<00:04:47.090> it

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
you in that turn if they really want it

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.850 
you in that turn if they really want it
so<00:04:47.420> this<00:04:47.780> could<00:04:48.050> be<00:04:48.170> better<00:04:48.320> in<00:04:48.650> some

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
so this could be better in some

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.590 
so this could be better in some
situations<00:04:49.370> and<00:04:49.550> Maxie<00:04:49.970> could<00:04:50.120> be<00:04:50.240> better<00:04:50.420> by

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
situations and Maxie could be better by

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.200 
situations and Maxie could be better by

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.760 
bills running around chill to me but
let's<00:05:41.419> just<00:05:41.630> factor<00:05:41.960> in<00:05:42.229> torrential<00:05:42.530> tribute

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
let's just factor in torrential tribute

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.570 
let's just factor in torrential tribute
so<00:05:43.100> that's<00:05:43.280> all<00:05:43.430> they<00:05:43.610> really<00:05:43.640> do<00:05:44.000> have<00:05:45.580> for

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
so that's all they really do have for

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.190 
so that's all they really do have for
your<00:05:46.729> counters<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:47.210> Kaiser<00:05:47.510> collosseum<00:05:48.050> and

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
your counters to Kaiser collosseum and

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.840 
your counters to Kaiser collosseum and
if<00:05:48.560> you<00:05:48.710> do<00:05:48.830> have<00:05:49.010> Kaiser<00:05:49.190> calcium<00:05:49.729> on<00:05:49.790> the

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
if you do have Kaiser calcium on the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.909 
if you do have Kaiser calcium on the
field<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:50.240> you<00:05:50.960> pick<00:05:51.169> a<00:05:51.200> partner<00:05:51.530> in<00:05:51.590> monsters

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
field and you pick a partner in monsters

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.190 
field and you pick a partner in monsters
one<00:05:52.070> by<00:05:52.190> one<00:05:52.570> when<00:05:53.570> you're<00:05:53.690> pretty<00:05:53.870> much<00:05:54.020> gonna

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
one by one when you're pretty much gonna

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.560 
one by one when you're pretty much gonna
win<00:05:54.380> because<00:05:54.680> they<00:05:55.430> don't<00:05:55.610> have<00:05:55.700> much<00:05:56.120> outs<00:05:56.330> to

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
win because they don't have much outs to

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.600 
win because they don't have much outs to
this<00:05:56.690> except<00:05:57.169> double<00:05:58.010> MST<00:05:58.400> and<00:05:58.669> a<00:05:59.300> true<00:05:59.600> nade

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
this except double MST and a true nade

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.210 
this except double MST and a true nade
so<00:06:01.610> that's<00:06:01.760> my<00:06:02.320> probably<00:06:03.320> my<00:06:03.440> my<00:06:03.830> SciTech

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
so that's my probably my my SciTech

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.409 
so that's my probably my my SciTech
choice<00:06:04.400> against<00:06:04.760> them<00:06:04.910> will<00:06:05.090> be<00:06:05.210> Kaiser

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
choice against them will be Kaiser

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.909 
choice against them will be Kaiser
collosseum<00:06:06.880> again<00:06:07.880> I'm<00:06:08.000> not<00:06:08.150> going<00:06:08.330> into<00:06:08.600> the

collosseum again I'm not going into the
generic<00:06:09.919> I'm<00:06:10.070> sad<00:06:10.370> at<00:06:10.490> cards<00:06:10.700> that<00:06:10.790> people<00:06:11.000> are
