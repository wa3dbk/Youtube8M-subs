00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.150
 game channel pixel world is represented 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.830
 Hello to you but this is a pilot 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.290
 release of my games reviews for the channel 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.630
 pixel world this review will be dedicated 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.289
 arcade race called black or 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.630
 how nicer the blue developed 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.670
 game guys from bizarre cracking studio 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.260
 only once in its existence has reached 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 high popularity in the ninety-sixth 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.970
 year by developing a formula 1 game for 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.160
 playstation she became the best selling 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.600
 playing for that year since the studio 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.550
 specializes in racing and and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.800
 the penultimate victim of this child 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.360
 The review did not come out with a kind of feces 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 different from other arcade races 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320
 its element of supernatural 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
 represented in the game this element in the form 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.100
 the so-called charges the essence of the game 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.390
 trite to beat all rivals and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 become the best racer 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.910
 and now the plot is more detailed 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.840
 elementary races in different modes and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.760
 on different tracks 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.340
 local list of rivals with something 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.850
 reminds blacklist first nps bridge 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.859
 vanted 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.140
 only riders here are less plot 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 frames trimmed down even more it doesnâ€™t care 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.799
 that from bridge vanted cut all 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.990
 videos with m with alerts and calls 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.049
 which are at least some indicators 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 plot availability 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.710
 gameplay is not special 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.330
 Difficulty of arrival there is no police 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.159
 open world for that is not only 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.799
 urban roads but coastal 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.330
 onboard and so on autoshop here 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.939
 not the same as the possibility of tuning 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.680
 his iron horse cars open 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.720
 the number of fans who 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.640
 appear after each race and your 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 the number of visitors depends only on 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 how well you went 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.980
 certain race with fans 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 can get even come last 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.070
 finishing top three besides 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.350
 fans you get the so-called 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.600
 beacons that serve as shoulders to new 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 tracks and the boss is convenient for what 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.990
 opening a subsequent trust optional 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.150
 pass all the events of a certain 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.070
 the enemy and at the end of the page with the main 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.510
 the boss as it says canon is necessary 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.580
 just dial a certain amount 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.340
 beacons and tracks with new rivals 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.960
 will open themselves to fight 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.820
 every ringleader needs to perform 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.440
 certain conditions stated for 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.130
 specific territory on which and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.450
 dwells this main rival 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.090
 aspect of the action in the game contribute so 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.220
 called charges to are like weapon 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.530
 so and protection having the most various 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.690
 properties shooting forward and against 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.480
 rocket movements raising the car in 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.100
 air energy pulses 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.510
 a repulsive rival to mine 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.180
 lightning acceleration 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.010
 shockers and so on the charges are located in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.320
 certain points each 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.600
 second you have the opportunity to pick 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.190
 only three of any charge and use them 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.780
 at any moment some may 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.580
 combine creating tactical 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.800
 acceleration maneuvers for example can 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.600
 bypass the opponent and put a mine right 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.180
 in front of his nose thereby obtaining 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.500
 serious time advantage 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.840
 attack charges can be used and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.130
 to protect any attacking charge you can 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.260
 prevent most attacks 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.330
 opponents put in front of you mine 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.220
 can ruin a shot at her with lightning 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.830
 or repel the charge seeking for you 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.870
 using momentum out of 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.000
 of all charges the acceleration gives the greatest 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.190
 feeling of arcade in this game is by itself 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.110
 imagine the speed of the machines is not so big but 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.310
 to speed up a huge speed lover 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.540
 feel at ease 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.909
 sources say the game has 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.310
 total destructible but it is not 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.799
 the car in the game happens in three states 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.840
 perfect whole and visually mutilated 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.489
 or completely broken and that from 2 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.680
 differs only in a temporary descent 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.840
 rhinestones and no deterioration in management 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.049
 falling off pieces of body you are not here 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.180
 see the game of 2010 that says about her 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.159
 low system requirements and times 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.860
 so the opportunity to try always in 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.060
 power well what is it all if you 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.640
 like it like subscribe 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.109
 on my channel to a channel of the pixel of the world and 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.540
 also do not forget to leave your 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.470
