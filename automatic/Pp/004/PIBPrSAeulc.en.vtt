 attack with bauder with ralf schneider 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.129
 but class reacts by frederic löhe 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.620
 so is the break and after the change 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.230
 the next opportunity again 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 schneider again and again 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.460
 Excitement of the Oberhausen builders 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.449
 tries to execute a free kick 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 to delay 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.890
 the aachener aimen demai shoots him 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.350
 he is warned he already had yellow 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.020
 seen and looks yellow red 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.659
 kauder is also warned aachen 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.330
 only with ten men afterwards 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.040
 interrupt seven minutes of play and 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 the aachener fans angry 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.290
 additional security personnel relates 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.330
 position on the lawn becomes violent 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.229
 discusses the referees 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.020
 Overall, by no means sovereign the game 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.439
 So then break up football again 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.780
 a shot of pascal tasci he changes 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.079
 in the summer after schalke then the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.840
 injury of niko opper must with 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.729
 a knee injury to the hospital 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.079
 aachen only with nine men because 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.540
 Trainer already pushes three times 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.810
 has replaced and still with 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.869
 this chance still for rafael garcia like 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.320
 Good morale and strong will fought for 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.700
 the alemannia drew in 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.500
 Of course they want their season 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.870
 also cleverly ended and with the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.790
 viewers also the guys of course 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.640
 The traveled are also what show something 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.660
 and that is our living room here 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.360
 of course, do not want to give it away 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.470
 and that's why you noticed that 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.900
 on both sides 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.020
 yes one wants to give away anything you want 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.640
 win and I think that has that 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.540
 we also like to play yes 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.720
 not all in vain nor vacation money 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.180
 This is not about the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.320
 That's another reason why 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.320
 reasonable that all fire is in it
