100% chance every single time that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
100% chance every single time that
you're<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.710> ticks<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.250> damage<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:29.910> reset

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
intake 50% faster and so that means that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.030 
intake 50% faster and so that means that
instead<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.719> ticking<00:00:37.050> every<00:00:37.200> three<00:00:37.590> seconds

instead of ticking every three seconds

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.000 
instead of ticking every three seconds
it<00:00:38.309> takes<00:00:38.610> every<00:00:38.910> 1.5<00:00:39.570> seconds<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.860> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it takes every 1.5 seconds now this is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
it takes every 1.5 seconds now this is
actually<00:00:41.340> taking<00:00:41.610> arms<00:00:41.820> warriors<00:00:42.239> from<00:00:42.420> being

is<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.400> cool<00:01:14.549> fire<00:01:14.790> thing<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
is really cool fire thing I think it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300 
is really cool fire thing I think it
does<00:01:15.869> damage<00:01:16.020> too<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> same<00:01:16.560> time<00:01:16.860> but

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
does damage too at the same time but

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
does damage too at the same time but
let's<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.670> focus<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.090> what's<00:01:18.270> awesome<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
let's just focus on what's awesome is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.469 
the fire thing that doesn't y'all are
going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.060> I've<00:01:21.299> actually

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
going to see that so I've actually

Colossus smash I almost forgot and these
two<00:03:03.609> top<00:03:03.849> buttons<00:03:04.239> don't<00:03:04.840> worry<00:03:05.019> about<00:03:05.139> those

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
two top buttons don't worry about those

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.689 
two top buttons don't worry about those
maybe<00:03:05.590> they<00:03:05.769> might<00:03:05.889> add<00:03:06.040> something<00:03:06.459> in<00:03:06.579> the

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:06.699 
maybe they might add something in the

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.339 
maybe they might add something in the
next<00:03:07.000> expansion<00:03:07.389> that<00:03:07.629> we<00:03:07.719> can<00:03:07.840> use<00:03:07.989> this<00:03:08.109> for

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
next expansion that we can use this for

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.439 
next expansion that we can use this for
might<00:03:08.769> as<00:03:08.859> well<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.040> don't<00:03:09.579> make<00:03:09.699> this<00:03:09.819> one<00:03:10.000> I

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:10.449 
might as well I don't make this one I

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:11.789 
might as well I don't make this one I
don't<00:03:10.750> know<00:03:10.840> summon<00:03:11.290> your<00:03:11.349> mountain<00:03:11.739> or

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
don't know summon your mountain or

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:12.869 
don't know summon your mountain or
something<00:03:11.829> like<00:03:12.129> this<00:03:12.219> maybe<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.609> one<00:03:12.730> can

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
something like this maybe this one can

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.939 
something like this maybe this one can
link<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.120> damage<00:03:13.419> meter<00:03:13.569> so<00:03:14.139> anyway<00:03:14.530> guys<00:03:14.709> I'm

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:14.949 
link a damage meter so anyway guys I'm

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.559 
link a damage meter so anyway guys I'm
very<00:03:15.280> very<00:03:15.489> happy<00:03:15.849> about<00:03:15.939> this<00:03:16.150> but<00:03:16.269> I<00:03:16.299> do<00:03:16.389> want

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
very very happy about this but I do want

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.050 
very very happy about this but I do want
to<00:03:16.599> explain<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.379> hard<00:03:17.680> part<00:03:17.949> about<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.370> spec

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.240 

let's<00:03:22.060> not<00:03:22.239> think<00:03:22.389> about<00:03:22.509> that<00:03:23.069> okay<00:03:24.069> just

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
let's not think about that okay just

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.770 
let's not think about that okay just
can't<00:03:24.430> think<00:03:24.609> of<00:03:24.699> it<00:03:24.790> right<00:03:24.819> now<00:03:24.970> anyway<00:03:25.720> so

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
can't think of it right now anyway so

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.420 
can't think of it right now anyway so
let's<00:03:26.109> take<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.319> look<00:03:26.470> at<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.739> three<00:03:26.979> targets

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
let's take a look at the three targets

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.189 
let's take a look at the three targets
the<00:03:27.939> three<00:03:28.150> target<00:03:28.509> damage<00:03:28.629> and<00:03:28.870> I'm<00:03:28.930> doing

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
the three target damage and I'm doing

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.719 
the three target damage and I'm doing
now<00:03:29.560> what<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.769> want<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.009> be<00:03:30.069> doing<00:03:30.189> here<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.639> I'm

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
now what I want to be doing here is I'm

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.679 
now what I want to be doing here is I'm
viewing<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.209> solid<00:03:31.599> about<00:03:32.040> 70<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.159> 80<00:03:33.220> K<00:03:33.639> DPS<00:03:34.120> on

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
viewing a solid about 70 to 80 K DPS on

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.050 
viewing a solid about 70 to 80 K DPS on
three<00:03:35.169> targets<00:03:35.620> with<00:03:35.979> no<00:03:36.189> real<00:03:36.400> raid<00:03:36.639> buffle

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
three targets with no real raid buffle

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.270 
three targets with no real raid buffle
so<00:03:37.239> ever<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.829> way<00:03:38.919> that<00:03:39.069> I'm<00:03:39.129> gonna<00:03:39.220> be

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
so ever and the way that I'm gonna be

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.069 
so ever and the way that I'm gonna be
doing<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.639> is<00:03:39.849> I'm<00:03:40.180> gonna<00:03:40.299> ply<00:03:40.540> R<00:03:40.599> into<00:03:40.930> all

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
doing that is I'm gonna ply R into all

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.929 
doing that is I'm gonna ply R into all
of<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.259> different<00:03:41.349> targets<00:03:41.889> use<00:03:42.400> sweeping

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
of the different targets use sweeping

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.280 
of the different targets use sweeping
strikes<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.389> guess<00:03:43.540> that's<00:03:43.750> one<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.049> maybe

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
strikes I guess that's one of the maybe

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.869 
strikes I guess that's one of the maybe
I<00:03:44.379> can<00:03:44.530> use<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.680> for<00:03:44.949> select<00:03:45.340> or<00:03:45.549> something

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
I can use that for select or something

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.379 
I can use that for select or something
like<00:03:46.000> that

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
like that

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.059 
like that
I've<00:03:46.599> still<00:03:46.840> got<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.049> program<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.620> thing<00:03:47.889> in

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
I've still got a program this thing in

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.490 
I've still got a program this thing in
anyway<00:03:49.000> basically<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:50.109> want<00:03:50.259> to<00:03:50.319> go<00:03:50.409> ahead

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
anyway basically I just want to go ahead

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.330 
anyway basically I just want to go ahead
and<00:03:50.769> do<00:03:50.949> that

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
and do that

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.520 
and do that
apply<00:03:51.759> R<00:03:51.819> into<00:03:52.120> all<00:03:52.269> my<00:03:52.449> targets<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.199> then<00:03:53.290> put

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
apply R into all my targets and then put

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.679 
apply R into all my targets and then put
down<00:03:53.620> sleeping<00:03:53.889> strikes<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.669> then<00:03:54.819> again<00:03:55.090> put

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
down sleeping strikes and then again put

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.360 
down sleeping strikes and then again put
down<00:03:55.870> Colossus<00:03:56.409> smash<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.859> just<00:03:57.189> keep

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
down Colossus smash and just keep

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.099 
down Colossus smash and just keep
hitting<00:03:57.699> the<00:03:57.819> same<00:03:57.849> button<00:03:58.419> over<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:58.989> over

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
hitting the same button over and over

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.449 
hitting the same button over and over
and<00:03:59.319> over<00:03:59.409> and<00:03:59.650> over<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.009> over<00:04:00.159> and<00:04:00.340> over

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
and over and over and over and over

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.429 
and over and over and over and over
until<00:04:00.819> one<00:04:01.359> of<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.509> other<00:04:01.659> two<00:04:01.840> buttons<00:04:02.139> comes

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
until one of the other two buttons comes

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.800 
until one of the other two buttons comes
up<00:04:02.680> now<00:04:03.069> guys<00:04:03.609> I<00:04:03.819> know<00:04:03.879> that<00:04:04.030> sometimes<00:04:04.629> it<00:04:04.780> can

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
up now guys I know that sometimes it can

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.300 
up now guys I know that sometimes it can
be<00:04:04.959> complicated<00:04:05.560> keeping<00:04:05.859> or<00:04:05.949> end<00:04:06.069> up<00:04:06.189> on

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
be complicated keeping or end up on

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.580 
be complicated keeping or end up on
multiple<00:04:06.669> targets<00:04:07.060> who<00:04:07.419> cares<00:04:07.750> just<00:04:08.049> I<00:04:08.469> mean

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
multiple targets who cares just I mean

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.959 
multiple targets who cares just I mean
if<00:04:08.709> you<00:04:08.829> don't<00:04:09.040> do<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.310> you're<00:04:09.549> probably<00:04:09.729> still

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:09.969 
if you don't do it you're probably still

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.849 
if you don't do it you're probably still
gonna<00:04:10.150> be<00:04:10.299> top<00:04:10.509> DPS<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.409> don't<00:04:11.650> really<00:04:11.769> worry

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
gonna be top DPS so don't really worry

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.469 
gonna be top DPS so don't really worry
about<00:04:12.340> no<00:04:12.519> in<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.729> minute<00:04:13.000> here<00:04:13.209> I've<00:04:13.299> actually

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
about no in a minute here I've actually

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.509 
about no in a minute here I've actually
I'm<00:04:13.989> very<00:04:14.049> glad<00:04:14.349> that<00:04:14.590> Blizzard<00:04:15.129> had<00:04:15.219> actually

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
I'm very glad that Blizzard had actually

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.550 
I'm very glad that Blizzard had actually
decided<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:16.180> rebalance<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:17.049> make<00:04:17.169> warriors

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
decided to rebalance and make warriors

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.800 
decided to rebalance and make warriors
where<00:04:18.039> they<00:04:18.250> should<00:04:18.489> be<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.880> because<00:04:19.599> of<00:04:19.630> that

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
where they should be and because of that

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
sometimes I worried that like it's like

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.920 
sometimes I worried that like it's like
whenever<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.850> gets<00:04:42.970> past<00:04:43.300> like<00:04:43.510> two<00:04:43.720> or<00:04:43.900> three

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
whenever it gets past like two or three

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.080 
whenever it gets past like two or three
buttons<00:04:44.500> it's<00:04:44.980> like<00:04:45.160> which<00:04:45.400> one<00:04:45.670> should<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:46.030> do

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
buttons it's like which one should I do

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.510 
buttons it's like which one should I do
I<00:04:46.660> don't<00:04:46.840> really<00:04:47.170> know<00:04:47.500> but<00:04:48.160> this<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.490> really

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
I don't really know but this is really

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.330 
I don't really know but this is really
really<00:04:48.970> simple<00:04:49.450> and<00:04:49.950> occasionally<00:04:50.950> like<00:04:51.190> I

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
really simple and occasionally like I

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.280 
really simple and occasionally like I
can<00:04:51.520> get<00:04:51.640> a<00:04:51.670> little<00:04:51.940> bit<00:04:52.060> complicated<00:04:52.290> you

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
can get a little bit complicated you

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.750 
can get a little bit complicated you
know<00:04:53.410> a<00:04:53.440> little<00:04:53.860> bit<00:04:53.950> confused<00:04:54.460> because<00:04:54.580> it

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
know a little bit confused because it

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.860 
know a little bit confused because it
gets<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:54.940> little<00:04:55.000> complicated<00:04:55.360> sometimes<00:04:55.630> you

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
gets a little complicated sometimes you

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.800 
gets a little complicated sometimes you
can<00:04:55.990> either<00:04:56.170> press<00:04:56.440> mortal<00:04:56.890> strike<00:04:57.220> oh<00:04:57.810> yeah

can either press mortal strike oh yeah
actually<00:04:58.870> no<00:04:59.230> nevermind<00:04:59.680> it's<00:04:59.860> not<00:05:00.040> that<00:05:00.250> hard

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
actually no nevermind it's not that hard

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.020 
actually no nevermind it's not that hard
sometimes<00:05:00.730> by<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.210> way<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.450> can<00:05:01.750> also<00:05:01.960> use

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
sometimes by the way you can also use

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.760 
sometimes by the way you can also use

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
have rage if you want to be fancy but

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.180 
have rage if you want to be fancy but
we're<00:05:07.930> warriors<00:05:08.320> so<00:05:08.530> we're<00:05:08.710> not<00:05:08.800> really<00:05:09.070> too

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
we're warriors so we're not really too

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.550 
we're warriors so we're not really too
fancy<00:05:09.610> now<00:05:10.000> take<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:10.720> look<00:05:10.900> at<00:05:11.020> this<00:05:11.140> chart<00:05:11.440> here

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
fancy now take a look at this chart here

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.560 
fancy now take a look at this chart here
now<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:11.890> is<00:05:12.040> a<00:05:12.070> chart<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.580> simulate<00:05:13.090> DPS

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
now this is a chart that simulate DPS

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.230 
now this is a chart that simulate DPS
for<00:05:14.110> patch<00:05:14.290> 6.2<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.610> think<00:05:15.880> really<00:05:16.060> the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
for patch 6.2 and I think really the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.760 
for patch 6.2 and I think really the
first<00:05:16.450> thing<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.750> stands<00:05:17.140> out<00:05:17.290> to<00:05:17.470> me<00:05:17.500> and

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
first thing that stands out to me and

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.620 
first thing that stands out to me and
probably<00:05:17.920> should<00:05:18.250> see<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.460> guys<00:05:18.640> is<00:05:19.030> how<00:05:19.300> low

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
probably should see you guys is how low

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.720 
probably should see you guys is how low
gladiator<00:05:20.260> is<00:05:20.500> on<00:05:20.830> this<00:05:21.070> speck<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:21.670> I

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
gladiator is on this speck and so I

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.610 
gladiator is on this speck and so I
think<00:05:22.030> that<00:05:22.180> as<00:05:22.600> long<00:05:22.660> as<00:05:22.930> Blizzard<00:05:23.410> like

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
think that as long as Blizzard like

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.740 
think that as long as Blizzard like
gives<00:05:23.950> gladiator<00:05:24.490> a<00:05:24.520> few<00:05:24.820> more<00:05:25.030> bucks<00:05:25.300> to

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
gives gladiator a few more bucks to

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.820 
gives gladiator a few more bucks to
where<00:05:25.840> they<00:05:25.960> can<00:05:26.140> be<00:05:26.170> up<00:05:26.410> towards<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.800> top

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
where they can be up towards the top

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.800 
where they can be up towards the top
with<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.250> other<00:05:27.280> warrior<00:05:27.760> specs<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.390> think

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
with the other warrior specs I think

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.090 
with the other warrior specs I think
that<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.050> would<00:05:29.140> really<00:05:29.290> be<00:05:29.470> achieving<00:05:29.920> true

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
that that would really be achieving true

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.310 
that that would really be achieving true
balance<00:05:30.370> in<00:05:30.700> this<00:05:30.850> game<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:31.330> making<00:05:32.170> it<00:05:32.290> to

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
balance in this game and making it to

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.960 
balance in this game and making it to

where it's fair for every all of the

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
different warrior specs to all be able

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.100

to do top DPS and raid above all the

to do top DPS and raid above all the

are kind of above arms words as well
that's<00:05:43.690> kind<00:05:44.020> of<00:05:44.080> an<00:05:44.200> issue<00:05:44.350> but<00:05:44.950> honestly

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
that's kind of an issue but honestly

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.340 
that's kind of an issue but honestly
it's<00:05:45.910> not<00:05:46.120> really<00:05:46.300> too<00:05:46.450> bad<00:05:46.600> I<00:05:46.660> can<00:05:47.050> just<00:05:47.230> see

the<00:05:49.180> pack<00:05:49.420> which<00:05:49.720> is<00:05:49.870> like<00:05:50.050> really<00:05:50.530> not<00:05:50.710> where

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
the pack which is like really not where

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.470 
the pack which is like really not where
Warriors<00:05:51.250> should<00:05:51.460> be<00:05:51.640> and<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.270> hopefully

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
Warriors should be and so hopefully

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.750 
Warriors should be and so hopefully
Blizzard<00:05:53.080> it's<00:05:53.500> probably<00:05:53.890> a<00:05:53.920> tuning<00:05:54.310> problem

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
Blizzard it's probably a tuning problem

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.580 
Blizzard it's probably a tuning problem
maybe<00:05:55.270> there's<00:05:55.750> a<00:05:55.840> problem<00:05:56.170> with<00:05:56.500> the

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
maybe there's a problem with the

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.620 
maybe there's a problem with the
simulation<00:05:57.100> I<00:05:57.550> don't<00:05:57.940> really<00:05:58.120> know<00:05:58.300> what<00:05:58.510> it

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
simulation I don't really know what it

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.060 
simulation I don't really know what it
is<00:05:58.750> but<00:05:58.930> hopefully<00:05:59.350> Blizzard<00:05:59.710> will<00:05:59.860> be<00:05:59.950> able

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
is but hopefully Blizzard will be able

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.150 
is but hopefully Blizzard will be able
to<00:06:00.160> fix<00:06:00.370> this<00:06:00.610> this<00:06:01.450> error<00:06:01.750> this<00:06:02.080> I<00:06:02.140> guess<00:06:02.860> it's

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
to fix this this error this I guess it's

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.340 
to fix this this error this I guess it's
not<00:06:03.580> really<00:06:03.640> a<00:06:03.880> bug<00:06:04.180> but<00:06:04.840> it's<00:06:04.990> just<00:06:05.110> probably

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
not really a bug but it's just probably

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.840 
not really a bug but it's just probably
it's<00:06:05.620> probably<00:06:05.680> just<00:06:06.100> they<00:06:06.400> just<00:06:06.610> didn't

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
it's probably just they just didn't

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.670 
it's probably just they just didn't
understand<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.360> math<00:06:07.540> and<00:06:07.870> so<00:06:08.320> hopefully

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
understand the math and so hopefully

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.440 
understand the math and so hopefully
they'll<00:06:08.860> fix<00:06:09.130> that<00:06:09.340> pretty<00:06:09.610> soon<00:06:09.820> and<00:06:10.090> I'm

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
they'll fix that pretty soon and I'm

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.700 
they'll fix that pretty soon and I'm
really<00:06:10.480> looking<00:06:10.810> forward<00:06:11.200> to<00:06:11.350> that<00:06:11.410> and

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
really looking forward to that and

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.290 
really looking forward to that and
hopefully<00:06:11.950> you<00:06:12.220> guys<00:06:12.400> are<00:06:12.610> too<00:06:12.790> I<00:06:12.820> really<00:06:13.150> want

like this huge like fire thing and then

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.630 
like this huge like fire thing and then
like<00:06:23.170> it<00:06:23.320> also<00:06:23.500> scales<00:06:23.980> with<00:06:24.160> the<00:06:24.220> size<00:06:24.460> of

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
like it also scales with the size of

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.010 
like it also scales with the size of
your<00:06:24.760> character<00:06:25.090> so<00:06:25.450> you<00:06:25.480> can<00:06:25.660> put<00:06:25.810> on<00:06:25.870> like

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
so many particle effects on the screen

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.090 
so many particle effects on the screen
that<00:06:38.770> they're<00:06:38.979> gonna<00:06:39.100> lag<00:06:39.370> out<00:06:39.610> this<00:06:39.910> is

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
that they're gonna lag out this is

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
this can be complicated you go ahead and

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.530 
this can be complicated you go ahead and
you<00:06:56.870> do<00:06:56.990> Rend<00:06:57.410> okay<00:06:58.190> so<00:06:58.580> listen<00:06:58.970> listen<00:06:59.360> write

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
you do Rend okay so listen listen write

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.770 
you do Rend okay so listen listen write
this<00:06:59.720> down<00:06:59.900> rend<00:07:00.680> okay<00:07:01.280> and<00:07:01.520> then<00:07:01.780> Colossus

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.780

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
strike to do this a bunch of times and

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.560 
strike to do this a bunch of times and
then<00:07:07.370> ah<00:07:07.820> II<00:07:07.850> gotta<00:07:08.060> hit<00:07:08.210> this<00:07:08.360> button

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
then ah II gotta hit this button

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.040 
then ah II gotta hit this button
again

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
again

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.360 
again
okay<00:07:09.350> occasionally<00:07:09.770> this<00:07:09.890> one<00:07:10.070> will<00:07:10.160> pop<00:07:10.340> up

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
okay occasionally this one will pop up

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.430 
okay occasionally this one will pop up
and<00:07:10.610> it's<00:07:10.730> kind<00:07:10.910> of<00:07:10.970> random<00:07:11.180> so<00:07:11.630> that's<00:07:11.810> again

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
and it's kind of random so that's again

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.830 
and it's kind of random so that's again
what<00:07:12.620> kind<00:07:12.740> of<00:07:12.830> confusing<00:07:13.400> and<00:07:13.670> I<00:07:14.000> I<00:07:14.030> do<00:07:14.510> hope

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
what kind of confusing and I I do hope

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.570 
what kind of confusing and I I do hope
that<00:07:14.870> they<00:07:15.080> change<00:07:15.350> that<00:07:15.500> as<00:07:15.650> well<00:07:15.830> maybe<00:07:16.340> just

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
that they change that as well maybe just
