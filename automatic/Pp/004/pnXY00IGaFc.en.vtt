there's<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.869> recurring<00:00:19.470> theme<00:00:19.650> here<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.189> that

there's a recurring theme here and that
theme<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.880> zero<00:00:21.539> chemistry<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
theme is zero chemistry so this is a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
theme is zero chemistry so this is a
team<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.160> went<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.609> inform<00:00:24.180> Diego<00:00:24.720> Ben

that we're gonna go with and there we go
the<00:00:36.690> zero<00:00:36.870> chemistry<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> first

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the zero chemistry so this is the first

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.160 
the zero chemistry so this is the first
match<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.180> saw<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.540> team<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.960> thought

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
match and I saw this team and I thought

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.290 
match and I saw this team and I thought
my<00:00:40.559> god<00:00:40.590> please<00:00:41.190> make<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.489> stop<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.090> want

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
my god please make it stop I don't want

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
my god please make it stop I don't want
to<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.870> EA<00:00:43.649> actually<00:00:44.100> obliged<00:00:44.370> me

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to do this and EA actually obliged me

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.740 
to do this and EA actually obliged me
and<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.730> made<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.969> stopped<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> game<00:00:45.329> froze

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and they made it stopped the game froze

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.170 
and they made it stopped the game froze
he<00:00:45.989> disconnected<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.340> had<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:47.969> again

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
he disconnected so I had to do it again

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.639 
he disconnected so I had to do it again
as<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> zero<00:00:49.020> chemistry<00:00:49.200> theme

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
as you can see that zero chemistry theme

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.000 
as you can see that zero chemistry theme
is<00:00:49.890> hot<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.610> heavy<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.860> winning<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
is hot and a heavy so winning with a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.069 
is hot and a heavy so winning with a
zero<00:00:53.370> chemistry<00:00:53.640> team<00:00:54.149> should<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.660> difficult

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
zero chemistry team should be difficult

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
zero chemistry team should be difficult
however<00:00:55.230> I've<00:00:55.829> got<00:00:56.219> some<00:00:56.489> pretty<00:00:56.879> darn<00:00:57.360> good

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
however I've got some pretty darn good

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
however I've got some pretty darn good
players<00:00:58.020> out<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.739> put<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> little

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
players out there and if I put a little

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830 
players out there and if I put a little
bit<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.760> thought<00:01:00.030> into<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.480> probably

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
bit more thought into it I probably

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.060 
bit more thought into it I probably
could<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.230> come<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.739> some<00:01:01.920> better

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
could have come up with some better

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.470 
could have come up with some better
players<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> did<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.000> during<00:01:03.329> my

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
players but I did this during my
