00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.860 

okay<00:00:06.750> guys<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.890> have<00:00:08.460> created<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:09.120> Rube<00:00:09.480> Goldberg

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
okay guys I have created a Rube Goldberg

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.620 
okay guys I have created a Rube Goldberg
machine<00:00:10.650> which<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.309> basically<00:00:11.700> like<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> domino

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
machine which is basically like a domino

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.400 
machine which is basically like a domino
effect<00:00:12.840> thing<00:00:14.030> so<00:00:15.030> yep<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
effect thing so yep it's just the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.099 
effect thing so yep it's just the
instructions<00:00:17.449> so<00:00:18.449> what<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.720> does<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
instructions so what it does is

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.950 
instructions so what it does is
basically<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.859> step<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> pressure<00:00:20.490> plate

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
basically you step on the pressure plate

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.519 
basically you step on the pressure plate
activates<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.170> redstone<00:00:22.619> wiring<00:00:24.529> repeaters

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
activates the redstone wiring repeaters

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.769 
activates the redstone wiring repeaters
there<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.220> slow<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:28.849> makes<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.000> TNT<00:00:30.330> blow

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
there to slow it down makes a TNT blow

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.490 
there to slow it down makes a TNT blow
up<00:00:31.550> will<00:00:32.550> create<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> chain<00:00:33.210> reaction<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.870> TNT

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
up will create a chain reaction of TNT

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.650 
up will create a chain reaction of TNT
and<00:00:35.239> will<00:00:36.239> block<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.719> redstone<00:00:37.230> torch<00:00:38.660> which

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
and will block this redstone torch which

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.760 
and will block this redstone torch which
in<00:00:40.620> turn<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.610> allow<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.570> redstone<00:00:43.050> circuit

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
in turn will allow this redstone circuit

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.950 
in turn will allow this redstone circuit
to<00:00:43.860> pass<00:00:44.070> through<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.000> locked<00:00:45.870> redstone<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
to pass through the locked redstone and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.709 
to pass through the locked redstone and
up<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.610> activating<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> dispenser<00:00:51.480> which

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
up here activating the dispenser which

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.580 
up here activating the dispenser which
will<00:00:51.989> spawn<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> skeleton<00:00:54.050> onto<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.260> pressure

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
will spawn a skeleton onto the pressure

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.359 
will spawn a skeleton onto the pressure
plate<00:00:56.930> which<00:00:57.930> will<00:01:01.489> deactivate<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:03.270> torch

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
plate which will deactivate this torch

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
plate which will deactivate this torch
yes<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.729> activate<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.270> torch<00:01:06.600> push<00:01:07.170> making

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
yes you activate this torch push making

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.429 
yes you activate this torch push making
the<00:01:07.830> waterfall<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.860> flowing<00:01:12.439> then

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the waterfall and flowing then

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.210 
the waterfall and flowing then
destroying<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.250> redstone<00:01:14.760> torch<00:01:16.220> which

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
destroying this redstone torch which

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.149 
destroying this redstone torch which
would<00:01:17.610> make<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.450> redstone<00:01:19.110> torch<00:01:19.500> shine<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
would make this redstone torch shine and

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.539 
would make this redstone torch shine and
then<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.970> make<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.770> piston<00:01:26.220> pushed

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
then which would make the piston pushed

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.810 
then which would make the piston pushed
the<00:01:26.700> minecart<00:01:27.180> down<00:01:29.390> over<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> detector<00:01:31.409> rail

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
the minecart down over the detector rail

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.170 
the minecart down over the detector rail
detect<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> rail<00:01:34.369> goes<00:01:35.869> redstone<00:01:36.869> torch<00:01:37.409> off

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
detect the rail goes redstone torch off

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.590 
detect the rail goes redstone torch off
piston<00:01:39.180> retracts

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
piston retracts

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.930 
piston retracts
the<00:01:42.600> redstone<00:01:43.410> torch<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.070> sandstone

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
the redstone torch on the sandstone

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.820 
the redstone torch on the sandstone
block<00:01:45.300> would<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:46.110> destroyed

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
block would get destroyed

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.730 
block would get destroyed
yeah<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.860> yes<00:01:49.860> which<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.120> turn<00:01:51.740> unlock

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
yeah and yes which will in turn unlock

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.820 
yeah and yes which will in turn unlock
the<00:01:53.100> locked<00:01:53.630> redstone<00:01:54.630> repeater<00:01:55.020> allowing

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
the locked redstone repeater allowing

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.920 
the locked redstone repeater allowing
this<00:01:56.040> redstone<00:01:56.460> torches<00:01:56.970> circuit<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.720> pass

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this redstone torches circuit to pass

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.680 
this redstone torches circuit to pass
through<00:01:58.350> and<00:02:00.620> activating<00:02:01.620> with<00:02:01.740> TNT

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
through and activating with TNT

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.080 
through and activating with TNT
basically<00:02:03.690> that's<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> final<00:02:04.920> goal<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.910> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
basically that's the final goal is to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.490 
basically that's the final goal is to
activate<00:02:06.480> the<00:02:06.630> TNT<00:02:08.690> yeah<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:10.290> we're<00:02:10.440> just

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
activate the TNT yeah now we're just

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.290 
activate the TNT yeah now we're just
gonna<00:02:10.619> spawn<00:02:11.010> a<00:02:11.070> bunch<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.550> skeletons<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.210> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
gonna spawn a bunch of skeletons in the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.500 
gonna spawn a bunch of skeletons in the
hole<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:14.460> see<00:02:15.210> what<00:02:15.360> kind<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.600> damage<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.050> does

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
hole and see what kind of damage it does

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.090 
hole and see what kind of damage it does
so<00:02:18.510> we're<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.720> gonna<00:02:18.930> put<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> bunch<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.950> these

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
so we're just gonna put a bunch of these

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.680 
so we're just gonna put a bunch of these
skeletons<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:21.060> there<00:02:23.090> too<00:02:24.090> much<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.510> always

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
skeletons in there too much is always

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.830 
skeletons in there too much is always
good<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:28.520> then<00:02:29.520> what<00:02:29.760> we're<00:02:29.910> gonna<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:32.840> block

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
good so then what we're gonna do block

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.520 
good so then what we're gonna do block
the<00:02:34.020> hole<00:02:34.230> off<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.270> we<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:36.600> what<00:02:36.960> damage<00:02:37.230> this

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the hole off and we see what damage this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.090 
the hole off and we see what damage this
baby<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.950> do
