00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
make sure that you position it so that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.180 
make sure that you position it so that
it's<00:00:54.239> fit<00:00:54.480> really<00:00:54.780> well<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.649> corners<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's fit really well in the corners and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180 
it's fit really well in the corners and
wipe<00:00:56.489> off<00:00:56.789> any<00:00:57.180> blood<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.350> may<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
wipe off any blood that may be on the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
wipe off any blood that may be on the
opening<00:00:59.579> it<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.300> not<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> sealing

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
opening it will not make the sealing

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.070 
opening it will not make the sealing
process<00:01:01.590> any<00:01:02.039> easier<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.750> gonna<00:01:03.840> wipe

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
process any easier so we're gonna wipe

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.780 
process any easier so we're gonna wipe
this<00:01:04.260> off<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.830> thoroughly<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.610> then

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
this off really thoroughly and then

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.550 
this off really thoroughly and then
obviously<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> lot

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
obviously as you can see we have a lot

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.590 
obviously as you can see we have a lot
of<00:01:07.740> extra<00:01:08.159> material<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.119> will<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.360> hard

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
of extra material here that will be hard

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.109 
of extra material here that will be hard
to<00:01:09.840> pull<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> vacuum<00:01:10.710> through<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.909> we're<00:01:12.030> gonna

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to pull a vacuum through so we're gonna

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.660 
to pull a vacuum through so we're gonna
trim<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.540> off<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.780> leave<00:01:13.310> well<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
trim it off and leave well this is a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880 
trim it off and leave well this is a
sirloin<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:16.110> pretty<00:01:16.380> thick<00:01:16.680> we

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
sirloin so it's it's pretty thick we

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890 
sirloin so it's it's pretty thick we
want<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.130> make<00:01:17.250> sure<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.610> leave<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:17.970> five

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
want to make sure we leave about five

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.190 
want to make sure we leave about five
inches<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.220> four<00:01:20.610> five<00:01:20.850> six<00:01:21.509> inches<00:01:21.810> in

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
inches or so four five six inches in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.219 
inches or so four five six inches in
general<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:24.119> gonna<00:01:24.509> make<00:01:24.750> sure<00:01:24.810> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
general and I'm gonna make sure that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.310 
general and I'm gonna make sure that
inside<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.250> real<00:01:26.640> clean<00:01:27.110> just<00:01:28.110> makes

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
inside here is real clean just makes

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.160 
inside here is real clean just makes
that<00:01:28.530> process<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.280> sealing<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.270> bag<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.750> little

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that process of sealing the bag a little

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
that process of sealing the bag a little
bit<00:01:31.290> easier<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> tricky

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
bit easier it can be kind of a tricky

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
bit easier it can be kind of a tricky
material<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> seal<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.650> at<00:01:34.799> all

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
material to seal because it's not at all

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.090 
material to seal because it's not at all
like<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> vacuum<00:01:36.150> bag<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.320> saw<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> crimped

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
like a vacuum bag so you saw I crimped

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.590 
like a vacuum bag so you saw I crimped
the<00:01:38.130> opening<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.939> give<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.329> bit<00:01:39.450> more

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the opening to give a little bit more

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
the opening to give a little bit more
texture<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> little<00:01:41.250> more

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
texture there you have a little more

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.999 
texture there you have a little more
channel<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.869> food<00:01:43.259> saver<00:01:43.500> channel

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
channel for this food saver channel

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.330 
channel for this food saver channel
sealer<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.610> draw<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.850> air<00:01:45.090> through<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.340> we

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
sealer to draw the air through and we

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.830 
sealer to draw the air through and we
will<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.640> using<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.210> Mouse<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.630> saw

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
will be using the back Mouse you saw

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080 
will be using the back Mouse you saw
there<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.259> first<00:01:49.500> I'm<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.280> give<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.729> 45

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
there but first I'm gonna give it a 45

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.710
