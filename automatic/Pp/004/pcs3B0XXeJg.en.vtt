00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.940
 hello I was welcome from 9 channels that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.680
 we are once again in a new video and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.120
 Let's go read the epic trade title 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.770
 or yes sir if I feel we are 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.240
 speaking with contracts I call him spectra 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.710
 I see because from the beginning of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 ultimate yen from the first one I've 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.540
 played I asked to bring something with this and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.950
 in a whole year in 2010 I was 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.050
 trader not only with contracts always 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.880
 he took a lot of pasta he came to sign 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.740
 to Christian ronaldo and to messi simply 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.390
 with contracts from that the people do not 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.850
 worked with nothing practically is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 they just played and played and won 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 money that way they came up with the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.120
 I really would not be the only one I suppose but 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.890
 It was one of the very few we are 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.050
 working with contracts and we buy them 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 sold them very well very well 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.649
 tica was not necessary weekend and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.480
 As the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.519
 channels always to not share this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.379
 kind of tricks people started to another 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.120
 weapons with contracts and now it 's something else 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.980
 complicated but does not mean it's 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.080
 impossible since everyone can 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.339
 train in this way those who know 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 work well those who do not know 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.780
 also because it's a pretty job 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.100
 sure you know that the contracts 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.220
 when the weekend arrives it increases 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.320
 price 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.840
 is not really about to increase or because 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.160
 they like it but because a lot more 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.810
 people play the weekend is when 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.480
 people have free or when 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.040
 kids arrive from class and has all the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.690
 time they want process affects the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.270
 contract since it is something essential 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.920
 to play the same ultimate team all 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.330
 the cadres need contracts and I 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.340
 I think the easiest way to work 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.980
 like 6 - of I go to advanced pages 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.630
 I'm 132 134,000 passing more 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.600
 go ahead and I'm looking for all 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.520
 contracts 350 coins 400 thus unpaid 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.630
 and it's clear that I will not take them all 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.030
 but I will take the vast majority 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.470
 since for the week I do not put much 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.580
 them and after the weekend already 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.960
 you will see that it sells us very well and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.880
 you will see my result of the weekend 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.010
 previous and contacts of coaches 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.510
 they are still much cheaper or if there 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.680
 people who do not have much pasta to 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.110
 make your run eating what you do 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.430
 only with the coach does not mean 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.780
 that are cheaper and that they are going to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.850
 sell much less but the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.259
 we will sell for 100 less coins but it will 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.240
 will sell just as well as those of 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.399
 coach and how are you seeing I already have 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.620
 all signed up I think they are about 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.900
 90 contracts or something like that you're looking at 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.040
 fast camera numbers I'm taking away and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.189
 all for 350 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.849
 those trained for 250 coins 350 the 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:24.159
 of player 350 with a total of 90 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.260
 contracts more or less and as the 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.819
 you have in preservation of the ship I know that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.920
 when you go and return this selection of 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.329
 soldiers appear nine pages but one 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.069
 Once you remove all of preselection 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.049
 you go anywhere you go to template 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.579
 or so cool in the preselection and you 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.989
 all contracts will reappear 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.640
 and the rest that he had heard 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.739
 like to say a single topic nine 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.060
 pages here on infinite pages what 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.469
 I say again because the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.269
 pages that you want what happens that only 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.620
 they reflect nine and so directly 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.389
 let's move to the end you're already seeing 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.760
 the price that we have sold them in the 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.530
 weekend we put everything because it would be 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.540
 a tostÃ³n to compose the contracts 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.540
 contracts I want to make a quickie video 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.129
 of 43 minutes and you are seeing that already 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.549
 they are all sold coach 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.319
 50 coins and those of player for 650 here 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.209
 it was already Monday we set the price 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.709
 because you see that I started with 55 thousand 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.900
 coins in 50,000 coins and now I have 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.220
 35 the pass that between weekends in 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.540
 how much of the selling was going to 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.180
 buy the players and they were 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.310
 riding a hybrid 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.849
 35000 coins but you are seeing that it 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.709
 sells perfectly for 600 coins and 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.859
 650 and we get mad for the time that 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.079
 the best in one hour 24 to the next 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.060
 23 hour and at best at another time not 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.079
 you sell none the only thing that you have to 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.969
 do and this is the requirement 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.159
 essential to sell them all 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.049
 you have to put it every hour and putting 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.670
 to be constant to put it to put it by 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.439
 Carlos continuously like this until 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.900
 you can sell all of them because if not 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.370
 that way I will not sell it and if you imagine 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.349
 that you put an hour later at 4 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.849
 hours we put ourselves back or even 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.709
 put them one day to sell with purchase and 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.750
 nothing of that you have to put the purchase 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.030
 there are already put them every hour between 500 and 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.639
 600 coins depends if you are a coach or 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.989
 player and putting them to continuously from 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.269
 hour by hour and how are you already seeing 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.829
 I only had seven contracts and they were big 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.629
 bronze that I had had envelopes of 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.159
 gift and so now that the 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.150
 halloween bridge approaching 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.469
 the weekend I hope that what 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.180
 make the most of 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.260
 that they sign the maximum contracts and so 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.239
 what did we get to the end of 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.469
 videos but many comments and we 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.469
 we see in the next kids
