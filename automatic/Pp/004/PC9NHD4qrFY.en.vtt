00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040
 What better house for those who 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.860
 I wanted a million coming out of the law. 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:20.189
 I used this in this little sims chain. 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:23.250
 Lover, I know the day. Hello. 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.260
 personal bath back the channel today by 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.640
 All disheveled but we'll find a way 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.640
 In this j 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.070
 today I will teach you four 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.760
 stepchildren will provide you with 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.020
 some little fields and elastic so let's go 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.360
 start brushing that mane 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.420
 what do we do hope to 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.250
 better way to make 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.110
 minute transfers is that the dictator 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.520
 be well brushed holy then embarrass 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 Let's start here I 'm picking up a 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:05.100
 part of my hair as you can see 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:08.460
 and I'm going to separate her into three parts and I 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.420
 I'll make a white one in front of me. 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 so I'll do it, I 'll get the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.880
 hair on the sides and I'll get a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.070
 little more hair she can 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 explain this way but you are 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.590
 watching video one at a time 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.100
 add a little more 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.470
 This will do this on the pieces of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 hair on the left and right side of the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:43.079
 means unintentionally be taking paradinho 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:46.880
 and adding mine and now I'm going alone 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.880
 continues to make a normal braid 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:58.790
 when it ended up holding back only badly 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.790
 elastic come and well is 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.860
 and ready to give a little hair 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.039
 and hairstyle my hairstyle is ready I 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.989
 I love this very easy hairstyle now 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.590
 Let's go to the next one. 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.170
 the next one is also very similar but 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.640
 It's what I most use, actually, so 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.480
 We're going to do the same thing with 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.360
 that braid inlaid on the fringe then 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.069
 three little pieces of new I'm going to do 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.459
 start making my transition from 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.459
 team 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.480
 I add a little hair 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.269
 every time I go next, it's easy 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.860
 who is married there are also 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.860
 facing fear again 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.870
 adds a little more looks good 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.180
 complicated not 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.910
 but the first time I understand the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.269
 Can do more but just train. 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.730
 enough that you can do it quickly if 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.130
 I can do this hair in series 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.030
 - of a boy who now does all the time 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.799
 which is very easy it seems that it seems 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:17.340
 It's difficult but it's not trying now 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:19.829
 one dinho mess again preparing the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.440
 white and that we do is optional 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.829
 for the writing of hair in dialogue with 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.600
 the father because he gives and then we go 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.569
 move on to hide the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.290
 staples surrounding the staples in the 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:39.329
 form of xis and I found this method 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.100
 better to hold France well all day 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.620
 now I'm putting my hair back 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:49.950
 go ahead and give it a go 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.030
 france in very cool February to 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:58.350
 liberty ex is now if preval se 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.260
 will call France gives the used for today is 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.750
 again you do not find me this project 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.420
 but I really like doing this 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.069
 technique could do a negative braid. 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.139
 it's on the fringe 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.940
 Now I started the same thing again. 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.069
 that they can now realize that I am 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.949
 doing in the piece 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:26.729
 very large in my role was a tone 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:29.070
 big chunk and then continuing this Chicken 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.110
 take a piece of the solid make 30 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.210
 technique is this legal effect 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:41.039
 the technician continues to pick up his hair 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:44.000
 even three pieces in your hand with him 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.919
 as if it were a normal transaction even 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.160
 and we 'll end up making a 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.160
 Normal transition again easily 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.510
 and now I'm just going to tie pan I think 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.900
 What's new in Let's send a 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.880
 alone in France this is how it is 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.940
 Pretty well actually but I like 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.520
 draw a string pull a string 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.240
 little fan to launch the France that is 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:37.370
 also a business that pays the website 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:41.090
 small cbs nothing geniton now for 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:44.900
 near and the team feels the pain 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:49.130
 that time is now very easy to take the 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.280
 leader of the source of your hair and 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.400
 making a normal transition 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.419
 I think the video explains the easiest 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.380
 to understand or video that I'm talking about 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.380
 I'll stop talking to people. 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.760
 good now made the other side in the hair 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:23.160
 rocket was well and do more 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:25.500
 braid and another Frenchwoman with 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.180
 Elastic if I talk but I'm going alone. 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.030
 hold with my mouth even though the 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.040
 We'll have to use again so now 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.160
 I have another one ready, I'll take the 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:39.380
 athletic with the same elastic 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.630
 I'll use it to connect the two then 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:48.180
 standing of the two pieces of hair with 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:51.690
 the braids made in loving with elastic o 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:55.620
 ready now looks like a crown of france 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:07:01.490
 Jorge to vote giving one of the nights to 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.490

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.790

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.150

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:24.500
