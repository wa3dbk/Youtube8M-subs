as you can see here is a little too

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.160 
as you can see here is a little too
thick<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.510> add<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:54.960> bit<00:00:55.079> more

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
thick so I will add a little bit more

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:05.380 
thick so I will add a little bit more
developers<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.190> mix<00:00:57.180> until<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.719> am

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.840 

it<00:01:05.930> is<00:01:06.140> right<00:01:06.440> now<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:06.650> little<00:01:06.950> too<00:01:07.190> thin<00:01:07.460> for<00:01:07.490> me

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
it is right now a little too thin for me

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.310 
it is right now a little too thin for me
I<00:01:08.090> don't<00:01:08.870> want<00:01:09.080> my<00:01:10.240> reach<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.510> one<00:01:11.750> on<00:01:12.050> my

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
I don't want my reach to one on my

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.170 
I don't want my reach to one on my
charger<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:12.860> I'm<00:01:13.070> going<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.400> do<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.670> or<00:01:13.910> add<00:01:14.150> a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
charger so I'm going to do it or add a

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.860 
charger so I'm going to do it or add a
little<00:01:14.390> bit<00:01:14.510> more<00:01:14.660> powder<00:01:14.900> into<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.320> sphere

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
little bit more powder into the sphere

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.370 
little bit more powder into the sphere
and<00:01:18.550> that's<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.670> trick<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:20.210> keeping<00:01:21.110> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
and that's the trick to keeping the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.560 
and that's the trick to keeping the
bleach<00:01:21.860> only<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.550> mat<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.030> not<00:01:23.180> seeping

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
bleach only on the mat and not seeping

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.390 
bleach only on the mat and not seeping
through<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.810> closure<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.920> getting<00:01:25.250> on<00:01:25.370> the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
through the closure and getting on the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.830 
through the closure and getting on the
roots<00:01:25.729> of<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.060> hair<00:01:28.060> okay<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:29.240> will<00:01:29.390> do<00:01:29.570> and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
roots of the hair okay this will do and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.300 
roots of the hair okay this will do and
you<00:01:29.870> can<00:01:30.110> see<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.470> stiff<00:01:30.800> and<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.160> not

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
you can see is stiff and it's not

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.670 
you can see is stiff and it's not
falling<00:01:31.610> off<00:01:31.729> my<00:01:31.760> sexual<00:01:32.330> so<00:01:33.229> now<00:01:33.380> I'm<00:01:33.500> just

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
falling off my sexual so now I'm just

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.590 
falling off my sexual so now I'm just
going<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:33.920> Pat<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.970> then<00:01:35.090> spread<00:01:35.450> it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
going to Pat it on and then spread it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.190 
going to Pat it on and then spread it
gently<00:01:36.490> not<00:01:37.490> adding<00:01:38.240> too<00:01:38.390> much<00:01:38.509> pressure<00:01:38.900> so

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
gently not adding too much pressure so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.780 
gently not adding too much pressure so
that<00:01:39.229> that<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.740> doesn't<00:01:39.979> go<00:01:40.250> through<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
that that it doesn't go through the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.140 
that that it doesn't go through the
closure<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:42.340> get<00:01:43.340> on<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.550> rest<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.970> hair

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.710 
mistake before of applying it and not
going<00:02:09.550> all<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.880> way<00:02:09.910> through<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.240> edge<00:02:10.390> and

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
going all the way through the edge and

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.480 
going all the way through the edge and
then<00:02:10.810> have<00:02:10.990> like<00:02:11.140> little<00:02:11.470> black<00:02:11.650> dots<00:02:11.920> along

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
then have like little black dots along

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.460 
then have like little black dots along
the<00:02:12.640> hairline<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.510> make<00:02:13.900> sure<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.380> all

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
the hairline so make sure you get it all

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.090 
the hairline so make sure you get it all
over<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.920> edge<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.490> closure<00:02:15.700> as<00:02:15.910> well<00:02:15.940> and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
over the edge of the closure as well and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.500 
over the edge of the closure as well and
by<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.160> having<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.640> nice<00:02:18.850> stiff<00:02:19.209> consistency

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
by you having a nice stiff consistency

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:48.960 
by you having a nice stiff consistency
it<00:02:20.500> won't<00:02:20.830> spray<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.520> run<00:02:21.790> into<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.810> hair

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.910 

so<00:02:49.540> now<00:02:49.720> I'm<00:02:49.810> going<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.110> apply<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.320> plastic

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
so now I'm going to apply a plastic

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.220 
so now I'm going to apply a plastic
processing<00:02:51.160> cap<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.000> let<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.630> sit<00:02:52.840> for<00:02:52.870> about

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
processing cap and let it sit for about

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.760 
processing cap and let it sit for about
20-25<00:02:53.980> minutes<00:02:54.580> until<00:02:55.210> it<00:02:55.420> processes<00:02:56.050> in<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
20-25 minutes until it processes in the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.650 
20-25 minutes until it processes in the
speech<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.660> they're<00:02:58.900> not<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.200> bleach<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:01.510> now

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
speech and they're not the bleach so now

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.800 
speech and they're not the bleach so now
I'm<00:03:01.750> removing<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.350> cap<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.510> I'm<00:03:04.510> going<00:03:04.750> to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
I'm removing the cap and I'm going to

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.800 
I'm removing the cap and I'm going to
remove<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.350> closure<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.240> I'll<00:03:07.240> be<00:03:07.540> able<00:03:07.600> to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810

have<00:03:11.530> been<00:03:11.740> reached<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:14.220> now<00:03:15.220> I'm<00:03:15.280> going<00:03:15.520> to

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
have been reached so now I'm going to

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.300
