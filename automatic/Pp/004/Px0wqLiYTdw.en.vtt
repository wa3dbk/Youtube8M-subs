a<00:00:09.860> massive<00:00:10.860> flow<00:00:11.210> mass<00:00:12.210> airflow<00:00:12.509> sensor<00:00:14.660> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
a massive flow mass airflow sensor the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.920 
a massive flow mass airflow sensor the
mass<00:00:15.900> airflow<00:00:16.170> sensor<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:17.039> some<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
mass airflow sensor is some here and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.170 
mass airflow sensor is some here and
this<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> air<00:00:19.770> box<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> hose

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
this is the air box this is the hose

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.929 
this is the air box this is the hose
that<00:00:21.480> connects<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.980> seen<00:00:23.250> other<00:00:23.460> videos

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
that connects I have seen other videos

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.720 
that connects I have seen other videos
in<00:00:24.660> YouTube<00:00:25.050> they<00:00:25.769> totally<00:00:26.160> took<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> air

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
in YouTube they totally took out the air

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.400 
in YouTube they totally took out the air
box<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.269> don't<00:00:27.570> think<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.840> need<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.050> take<00:00:28.260> this

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
box I don't think we need to take this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.220 
box I don't think we need to take this
off<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.920> will<00:00:29.550> try<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:30.480> remove<00:00:30.840> without

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
off I will try to just remove without

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.700 
off I will try to just remove without
taking<00:00:31.619> off<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.980> air<00:00:32.099> box

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
taking off the air box

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
taking off the air box
first<00:00:34.710> disconnect<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.630> air<00:00:36.630> hose<00:00:37.910> just<00:00:38.910> one

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
first disconnect this air hose just one

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.079 
first disconnect this air hose just one
screw<00:00:39.629> here

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.470 

now<00:00:44.089> I<00:00:44.120> disconnect<00:00:44.839> the<00:00:44.899> air<00:00:45.739> hose<00:00:46.070> and

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
now I disconnect the air hose and

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.729 
now I disconnect the air hose and
disconnect<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:47.600> electrical<00:00:48.260> connector

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
disconnect this electrical connector

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.389

here<00:00:52.149> now<00:00:53.149> I'm<00:00:53.329> disconnecting<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.399> electric

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
here now I'm disconnecting the electric

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:03.700 
here now I'm disconnecting the electric
connector<00:00:58.299> and<00:00:59.379> the<00:01:00.789> mass<00:01:01.789> airflow<00:01:02.500> sensor<00:01:03.500> is

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
connector and the mass airflow sensor is

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.050 
connector and the mass airflow sensor is
here<00:01:04.250> in<00:01:04.460> this<00:01:04.580> part<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.960> has<00:01:06.200> two<00:01:07.060> connections

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
here in this part it has two connections

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:22.870

delight and this needs to be cleaned you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.620 
delight and this needs to be cleaned you
can<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.480> mass<00:02:00.810> airflow<00:02:01.170> sensor<00:02:01.470> cleaner

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
can get to mass airflow sensor cleaner

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.260 
can get to mass airflow sensor cleaner
spray<00:02:03.630> from<00:02:04.350> Walmart<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.160> discount<00:02:06.150> auto

parts but I couldn't find one but you

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.630 
parts but I couldn't find one but you
can<00:02:11.670> still<00:02:11.940> use<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.360> carb<00:02:12.959> cleaner<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.400> same

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
can still use this carb cleaner the same

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.400 
can still use this carb cleaner the same
thing<00:02:14.910> that's<00:02:15.240> what<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.810> been<00:02:15.840> told<00:02:16.140> in

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
thing that's what I have been told in

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.300 
thing that's what I have been told in
Walmart<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.090> use<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:18.810> to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
Walmart so I'm going to use this to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:32.930 
Walmart so I'm going to use this to
clean<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.610> sensor

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.000 

repeat<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.150> cleaning<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:35.110> many<00:02:35.440> times<00:02:35.710> you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
repeat this cleaning as many times you

00:02:36.010 --> 00:03:01.940 
repeat this cleaning as many times you
feel<00:02:36.490> like<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.820> is<00:02:36.940> required

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.020 

now<00:03:02.520> I<00:03:02.550> think<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.150> clean<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.930> use<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.590> whole

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
now I think it is clean I use the whole

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.020 
now I think it is clean I use the whole
you<00:03:06.030> know<00:03:06.060> spray<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:08.010> now<00:03:08.280> let<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.760> dry

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
you know spray and then now let it dry

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.480 
you know spray and then now let it dry
as<00:03:09.300> much<00:03:10.170> time<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.560> takes<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.860> dry<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.400> then

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
as much time it takes to dry it and then

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.230 
as much time it takes to dry it and then
put<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.150> back<00:03:13.100> now<00:03:14.100> I'm<00:03:14.310> done<00:03:14.580> cleaning<00:03:14.880> this

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
put it back now I'm done cleaning this

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.640 
put it back now I'm done cleaning this
one<00:03:16.580> sensor<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.819> then<00:03:19.880> now<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.300> dried<00:03:22.050> for<00:03:22.350> 30

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
one sensor and then now I dried for 30

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.960 
one sensor and then now I dried for 30
minutes<00:03:23.400> now<00:03:23.820> it's<00:03:24.060> ready<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.390> put<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.720> back

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
minutes now it's ready to put it back

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.600 
minutes now it's ready to put it back
spot<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:28.170> same<00:03:28.380> way<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.860> took<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.160> out

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.949 

now<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:34.680> know<00:03:34.770> fix<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.510> pull<00:03:36.510> back<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
now I you know fix the pull back the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.280 
now I you know fix the pull back the
hose<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:38.010> schooling<00:03:38.340> here<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.450> then<00:03:40.110> I'm

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
hose the schooling here and then I'm

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:49.370 
hose the schooling here and then I'm
going<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.620> connect<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.989> connector

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.440 

you
