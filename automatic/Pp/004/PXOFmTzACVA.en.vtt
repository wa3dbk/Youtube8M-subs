00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 Next Christmas galley is coming and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.550
 This is my little pine tree. 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.260
 Good night, people are coming. It's a joke. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 very special date for everyone I 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.179
 I bet you did and I wanted to spend a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.390
 message to you that is a very long message 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.880
 and I would very much like to see you 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.850
 can of course do it is also 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.369
 basically it's about charity guys 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.480
 next every year end I gather clothes 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.610
 shoes that I use the most and I give 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.160
 Somebody give my mom to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.230
 someone fifasul a destination for them 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 because I know there are people who do not have 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.300
 need more than the people who have not 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.870
 use of course and therefore I was 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 separating some clothes to donate né 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.420
 interference something and I did it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.649
 Are not you talking about what I did, I separated. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.690
 some clothes to donate and when I did 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.489
 This is my right wardrobe and I 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.980
 I separated some t-shirts there that are 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.589
 related to games and others I will not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.330
 show you guys so let's go there more 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.000
 next you guys will look at you too 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.430
 The bottom has several shirts and I go 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 show you now one by one until 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.600
 I talk a little bit about the history of each 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.880
 one of them is going to start here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 so I know why I'm going to start with 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 here but finally the camera battery is 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.950
 ending then there 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.070
 this is a chemistry t-shirt 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.979
