 One of them is called ring position 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.449
 It is called the t-dancing position of the treasure case of your dominant hand 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.449
 It is a corde 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.030
 If not a dominant hand 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.730
 It is called d position of no 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.560
 It's the way you have basic playing cards 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.070

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.100
 Build grip is a listener 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:01.110
 From the individual will be in such Fu If you have in the way of the listener 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.230
 I feel like I 'm covering my thumb just in the middle 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.020
 It is like this 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.910
 The operation is a bit old and soft It's like lifting like this 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.050
 I can do this 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.050
 This is how to hold 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 Hey ! 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.280
 When holding it like this 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.620
 Even if I did this by supporting my toe here, it should not fall 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.970
 It is hard to fall down 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:34.600
 There is 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:37.620
 The back can make a space that a finger can enter by red and white in this area 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 You can various way or can also be suppressed Well 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:46.640
 This is the most basic way of holding, as it is easy to make a balu move like this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.640
 I will 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.870
 Well then I will explain the cut 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.870
 Cutting is only now 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.190
 For example , please divide the place you like 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.150
 Flying 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:12.810
 It is a good I'd come out Toka selfish this kind of movement 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:14.690
 Please keep this in mind as it is a package . 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.130

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.120
 Something like this 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.760
 Yes 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.500

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.400

 Black is cut 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.870
 This is 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:45.320
 And it was remembered in the build grip the future by the audience it is with weapons not a living Te right 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:48.310
 I think, but if you cut with this building and grip , remove it from the bottom and take the top 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.310
 Will and statements say 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.920
 It is not limited to cut once more 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.880
 I say double cut 1 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.880

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.030
 me too 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:18.840
 It's about holding words little by little above you. 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:22.400
 Will open here if this remains this way to remove from the state this in this state put controller 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.400
 If you align with your finger 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.940
 It is such a movement 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.780
 This one 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.340
 Once
