00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.219 
that's not enough let's go ahead and
launch<00:04:20.820> into<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.150> creative<00:04:21.479> world<00:04:21.930> here<00:04:22.109> which

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
launch into a creative world here which

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.870 
launch into a creative world here which
might<00:04:22.440> give<00:04:22.620> me<00:04:22.650> an<00:04:22.830> error<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.280> say<00:04:23.430> things

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
might give me an error and say things

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.060 
might give me an error and say things
aren't<00:04:24.150> installed<00:04:24.570> that's<00:04:25.289> from<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.650> previous

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
aren't installed that's from a previous

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.930 
aren't installed that's from a previous
mod<00:04:26.280> not

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
mod not

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.390 
mod not
a<00:04:27.000> new<00:04:27.810> one<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.500> actually<00:04:28.680> looks<00:04:29.010> like<00:04:29.130> it

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
a new one and it actually looks like it

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400 
a new one and it actually looks like it
crashed<00:04:29.850> now<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.690> reason<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.140> crash

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
crashed now the reason this crash

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.080 
crashed now the reason this crash
happened<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.190> like<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.400> show<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:32.670> guys<00:04:32.760> how

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
happened is I like to show you guys how

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.000 
happened is I like to show you guys how
to<00:04:33.120> fix<00:04:33.360> crashes<00:04:33.780> live<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.260> because<00:04:34.830> our

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
to fix crashes live is because our

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.000 
to fix crashes live is because our
render<00:04:35.370> distance<00:04:35.490> was<00:04:35.880> set<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.480> high<00:04:36.750> for<00:04:37.470> 1.8

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
render distance was set to high for 1.8

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.920 
render distance was set to high for 1.8
so<00:04:38.370> let<00:04:38.460> me<00:04:38.550> go<00:04:38.640> ahead<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:38.910> launch<00:04:39.000> 1.8<00:04:39.600> real

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
so let me go ahead and launch 1.8 real

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.600 
so let me go ahead and launch 1.8 real
quick<00:04:40.170> I'll<00:04:40.350> show<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.680> guys<00:04:40.920> how<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.130> fix<00:04:41.400> this

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
quick I'll show you guys how to fix this

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.120 
quick I'll show you guys how to fix this
and<00:04:41.790> then<00:04:41.880> we'll<00:04:42.450> launch<00:04:42.560> 1.7.10<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:43.950> will

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
and then we'll launch 1.7.10 and it will

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.340 
and then we'll launch 1.7.10 and it will
work<00:04:44.310> perfectly<00:04:44.370> now<00:04:45.330> this<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.080> probably

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
work perfectly now this is probably

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.570 
work perfectly now this is probably
gonna<00:04:46.470> happen<00:04:46.620> too<00:04:46.800> many<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.160> guys<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.490> I'm

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
gonna happen too many of you guys so I'm

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.800 
gonna happen too many of you guys so I'm
glad<00:04:47.670> it<00:04:47.880> happened<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.210> me<00:04:48.330> somebody<00:04:48.660> just

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
glad it happened to me somebody just

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.830 
glad it happened to me somebody just
opened<00:04:49.140> up<00:04:49.200> 1.3<00:04:50.160> options<00:04:51.000> video<00:04:51.300> settings

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
opened up 1.3 options video settings

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.970 
opened up 1.3 options video settings
render<00:04:52.140> distance<00:04:52.230> we're<00:04:52.530> gonna<00:04:52.620> turn<00:04:52.860> that

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
render distance we're gonna turn that

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.580 
render distance we're gonna turn that
down<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.310> 13<00:04:53.730> which<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.180> has<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.750> be<00:04:54.870> below<00:04:55.080> 16

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
down to 13 which it has to be below 16

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.110 
down to 13 which it has to be below 16
so<00:04:55.770> 16<00:04:55.950> or<00:04:56.280> below<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.670> would<00:04:56.730> just<00:04:56.880> check<00:04:56.970> them

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
so 16 or below I would just check them

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.640 
so 16 or below I would just check them
in<00:04:57.210> 13<00:04:57.540> we<00:04:57.690> can<00:04:57.810> turn<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.050> up<00:04:58.140> once<00:04:58.320> we<00:04:58.380> get<00:04:58.500> back

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
in 13 we can turn it up once we get back

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.920 
in 13 we can turn it up once we get back
over<00:04:58.800> there<00:04:59.010> quit<00:04:59.700> the<00:04:59.880> game<00:05:00.060> now<00:05:00.480> we<00:05:00.540> need<00:05:00.840> to

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
over there quit the game now we need to

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.890 
over there quit the game now we need to
reopen<00:05:01.290> up<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.400> minecraft<00:05:02.940> Launcher<00:05:03.090> right

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
reopen up the minecraft Launcher right

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.860 
reopen up the minecraft Launcher right
so<00:05:04.440> going<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.430> minecraft<00:05:05.850> in<00:05:06.000> minecraft<00:05:06.420> this

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
so going to minecraft in minecraft this

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.350 
so going to minecraft in minecraft this
is<00:05:06.930> because<00:05:07.380> we've<00:05:07.560> ran<00:05:07.860> 1.8<00:05:08.610> previously<00:05:09.180> and

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
is because we've ran 1.8 previously and

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.470 
is because we've ran 1.8 previously and

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
perfectly the reason to crash there

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.290 
perfectly the reason to crash there
again<00:05:23.220> wasn't<00:05:23.460> because<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:23.910> mods<00:05:24.120> were

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
again wasn't because the mods were

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.150 
again wasn't because the mods were
installed<00:05:24.660> wrong<00:05:24.870> or<00:05:25.080> anything<00:05:25.260> like<00:05:25.740> that<00:05:25.800> it

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
was simply a render distance issue which

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.110 
was simply a render distance issue which
does<00:05:28.530> occasionally<00:05:28.980> happen<00:05:29.250> if<00:05:29.640> you<00:05:29.910> switch

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120
