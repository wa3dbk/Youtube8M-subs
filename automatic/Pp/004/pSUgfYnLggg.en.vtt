00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
at the spool the threads go right next

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.369 
at the spool the threads go right next
to<00:01:01.280> each<00:01:01.399> other<00:01:01.640> all<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.879> way<00:01:02.000> up<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:02.510> down<00:01:02.780> so

to each other all the way up and down so
depending<00:01:04.129> on<00:01:04.189> which<00:01:04.339> spool<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.670> have<00:01:04.969> you'll

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
depending on which spool you have you'll

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.629 
depending on which spool you have you'll
have<00:01:05.569> a<00:01:06.200> for<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.709> stack<00:01:06.979> thread<00:01:07.340> we're<00:01:07.609> going

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:07.639 
have a for the stack thread we're going

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:10.239 
have a for the stack thread we're going
to<00:01:07.759> lay<00:01:07.999> it<00:01:08.030> down<00:01:08.209> here<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:09.229> one<00:01:09.560> of<00:01:09.709> your<00:01:09.829> spool

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
to lay it down here is one of your spool

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.309 
to lay it down here is one of your spool
caps<00:01:10.579> is<00:01:10.850> actually<00:01:11.299> stored<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.990> machine

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:12.319 
caps is actually stored on the machine

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:13.989 
caps is actually stored on the machine
when<00:01:12.499> it<00:01:12.619> shipped<00:01:12.859> to<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.219> and<00:01:13.459> then<00:01:13.880> you'll

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:13.999 
when it shipped to you and then you'll

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:17.489 
when it shipped to you and then you'll
have<00:01:14.149> another<00:01:14.600> one<00:01:14.959> in<00:01:15.229> your<00:01:15.920> accessory<00:01:16.479> box

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
have another one in your accessory box

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:20.559 
have another one in your accessory box
so<00:01:18.499> this<00:01:18.740> will<00:01:18.950> be<00:01:19.130> what<00:01:19.520> we're<00:01:19.670> using<00:01:19.909> since<00:01:20.479> I

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
so this will be what we're using since I

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.899 
so this will be what we're using since I
have<00:01:20.719> a<00:01:20.749> smaller<00:01:21.200> spool<00:01:21.799> it<00:01:22.609> will<00:01:22.759> actually

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
have a smaller spool it will actually

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.149 
have a smaller spool it will actually
wind<00:01:23.420> up<00:01:23.659> with<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.350> then<00:01:24.649> make<00:01:24.950> sure<00:01:24.979> that

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
wind up with and then make sure that

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.949 
wind up with and then make sure that
spool<00:01:25.579> cap<00:01:25.789> goes<00:01:25.999> all<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.270> way<00:01:26.509> on<00:01:26.689> don't

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
spool cap goes all the way on don't

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.260 
spool cap goes all the way on don't
leave<00:01:27.109> any<00:01:27.380> gap<00:01:27.709> in<00:01:27.920> between<00:01:28.039> there<00:01:28.549> now<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.179> I

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
leave any gap in between there now if I

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.999 
leave any gap in between there now if I
was<00:01:29.450> using<00:01:29.600> this<00:01:29.990> spool<00:01:30.319> with<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.740> thread

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
was using this spool with the thread

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.830 
was using this spool with the thread
that's<00:01:31.189> cross<00:01:31.490> well<00:01:31.789> I'm<00:01:32.179> going<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.479> pull<00:01:32.659> out

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
that's cross well I'm going to pull out

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.080 
that's cross well I'm going to pull out
the<00:01:33.259> vertical<00:01:33.499> spool<00:01:34.039> cap<00:01:34.279> and<00:01:34.549> then<00:01:34.849> place

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
the vertical spool cap and then place

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.690 
the vertical spool cap and then place
the<00:01:35.329> thread<00:01:35.599> on<00:01:35.899> it<00:01:36.139> like<00:01:36.709> so<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.279> then<00:01:37.549> it

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the thread on it like so and then it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.389 
the thread on it like so and then it
will<00:01:37.819> spin<00:01:38.209> like<00:01:38.779> that<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.709> that<00:01:39.920> actually

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
will spin like that so that actually

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.039 
will spin like that so that actually
will<00:01:40.520> help<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.969> lot<00:01:41.209> of<00:01:41.240> different<00:01:41.659> types<00:01:41.869> of

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
will help in a lot of different types of

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.230 
will help in a lot of different types of
threads<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.619> you're<00:01:42.799> using<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.369> sometimes

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
threads that you're using and sometimes

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.760 
threads that you're using and sometimes
depending<00:01:44.749> on<00:01:44.840> how<00:01:45.020> they<00:01:45.169> are<00:01:45.200> set<00:01:45.469> up<00:01:45.499> they

depending on how they are set up they

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.980 
depending on how they are set up they
will<00:01:45.979> come<00:01:46.159> off<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:46.909> way<00:01:47.119> better<00:01:47.539> than<00:01:47.840> the

will come off one way better than the
other<00:01:48.579> okay<00:01:49.579> so<00:01:50.090> we're<00:01:50.329> going<00:01:50.419> to<00:01:50.479> take<00:01:50.719> our

extra<00:02:20.870> noise<00:02:21.020> all<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.560> need<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.860> do<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.280> take

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
extra noise all you need to do is take

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.270 
extra noise all you need to do is take
your<00:02:22.820> hand<00:02:23.150> wheel<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.690> pull<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.320> out<00:02:24.530> by

your hand wheel and pull it out by

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.250 
your hand wheel and pull it out by
holding<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.850> thread<00:02:26.210> straight<00:02:26.750> up<00:02:27.020> and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
holding the thread straight up and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.290 
holding the thread straight up and
stepping<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> foot<00:02:28.190> control<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:29.150> will

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
stepping on the foot control that will

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.540 
stepping on the foot control that will
go<00:02:29.420> ahead<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.810> let<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.260> thread<00:02:30.860> eventually

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
go ahead and let that thread eventually

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.050 
go ahead and let that thread eventually
break<00:02:31.880> off<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.550> continue<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.670> wind<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.940> whole

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
break off and continue to wind the whole

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.740 
break off and continue to wind the whole
rest<00:02:35.300> of<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.450> bobbin<00:02:36.910> these<00:02:37.910> really<00:02:38.330> fill<00:02:38.570> out

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
rest of the bobbin these really fill out

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.170 
rest of the bobbin these really fill out
fasted<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.220> they<00:02:40.400> fill<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.760> full

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
fasted but and they fill it full

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.300 
fasted but and they fill it full
so<00:02:41.300> these<00:02:41.780> bobbins<00:02:42.200> are<00:02:42.290> great<00:02:42.620> size<00:02:42.920> for<00:02:43.190> this

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
so these bobbins are great size for this

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.460 
so these bobbins are great size for this
machine<00:02:43.490> I<00:02:43.670> love<00:02:44.120> them<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:44.780> once<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.200> get<00:02:45.350> it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
machine I love them so once you get it

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.170 
machine I love them so once you get it
all<00:02:45.650> once<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.340> gets<00:02:46.430> all<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.700> way<00:02:46.790> full<00:02:47.000> it

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
all once it gets all the way full it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.150 
all once it gets all the way full it
will<00:02:47.330> stop<00:02:47.630> spinning<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:48.860> keep<00:02:49.010> your

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
will stop spinning so just keep your

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.809 
will stop spinning so just keep your
foot<00:02:49.310> on<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.550> foot<00:02:49.700> control

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.869 

okay<00:02:55.819> so<00:02:56.450> when<00:02:56.599> you're<00:02:56.749> done<00:02:56.959> clip<00:02:57.469> the<00:02:57.620> thread

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
okay so when you're done clip the thread

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.250 
okay so when you're done clip the thread
take<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.030> hand<00:02:59.269> wheel<00:02:59.420> push<00:02:59.689> it<00:02:59.870> back<00:03:00.019> in<00:03:00.230> that

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
take the hand wheel push it back in that

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.020 
take the hand wheel push it back in that
will<00:03:00.530> engage<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.980> needle<00:03:01.219> from<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.849> back

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
will engage the needle from going back

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.149 
will engage the needle from going back
up<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.420> down<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.560> take<00:03:03.769> your<00:03:03.920> bobbin

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
up and down and then take your bobbin

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.309 
up and down and then take your bobbin
and<00:03:04.549> slide<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.939> all<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.150> way<00:03:05.269> off<00:03:05.569> let's<00:03:06.170> go

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
and slide it all the way off let's go

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.940 
and slide it all the way off let's go
ahead<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:07.180> thread<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.359> machine<00:03:08.719> next<00:03:09.439> this

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
ahead and thread the machine next this

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.129 
ahead and thread the machine next this
pre-tensioner<00:03:10.909> for<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.209> bobbin<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:11.989> you

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
don't get your thread in there and maybe

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.030 
don't get your thread in there and maybe
it<00:03:14.480> just<00:03:14.629> goes<00:03:14.750> around<00:03:14.840> loosely<00:03:15.260> this<00:03:15.620> bobbin
