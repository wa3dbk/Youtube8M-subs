on all of my little school videos so I
decided<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> video<00:00:13.469> kind<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
decided to do a video kind of just to

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.730 
decided to do a video kind of just to
explain<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.240> because<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.690> get<00:00:15.900> asked<00:00:16.560> this

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
explain it just because I get asked this

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.950 
explain it just because I get asked this
way<00:00:17.730> way<00:00:18.180> too<00:00:18.240> much

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
way way too much

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.890 
way way too much
so<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.590> big<00:00:19.949> question<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> what<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
so the big question is what is the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.050 
so the big question is what is the
difference<00:00:22.320> between<00:00:22.470> outline<00:00:23.460> notes<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
difference between outline notes and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.630 
difference between outline notes and
crystals<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.199> we're<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.769> I'm<00:00:26.490> going

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
crystals so we're going to be I'm going

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.370 
crystals so we're going to be I'm going
to<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.849> explaining<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> guys<00:00:27.960> today

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
for all of my other school related

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.380 
for all of my other school related
videos<00:00:34.110> because<00:00:35.040> then<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.460> guess<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.090> see

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
videos because then I guess you can see

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
videos because then I guess you can see
what<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> mean<00:00:37.350> by<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:37.739> outline<00:00:38.100> notes<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.430> my

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
what I mean by my outline notes and my

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
what I mean by my outline notes and my
class<00:00:38.790> notes<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> video<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.410> class

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
class notes I have a video on my class

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.170 
class notes I have a video on my class
notes<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> how<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.370> them<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.030> have

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
notes and how I do them and then I have

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.060 
notes and how I do them and then I have
a<00:00:42.210> video<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.020> line<00:00:43.320> notes<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> how<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> do

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
a video on my a line notes and how I do

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.310 
a video on my a line notes and how I do
those<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.390> videos<00:00:45.780> purpose<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.289> just

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
those so this videos purpose is just

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
those so this videos purpose is just
simply<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.010> explain<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.850> difference<00:00:48.180> between

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
simply to explain the difference between

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.990 
simply to explain the difference between
the<00:00:48.570> two<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.230> use<00:00:49.590> each<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the two and what I use each one for and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
the two and what I use each one for and
you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.660> how<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> use<00:00:52.260> each<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.680> differently

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
you know how I use each one differently

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.850 
you know how I use each one differently
and<00:00:53.340> why<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.730> both<00:00:54.270> um<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> guys<00:00:55.649> want

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.420 
to see how I do the notes itself you
guys<00:00:57.840> need<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.230> watch<00:00:58.379> another<00:00:58.410> video<00:00:58.949> but

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
guys need to go watch another video but

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.910 
guys need to go watch another video but
yeah<00:00:59.609> let's<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.030> jump<00:01:00.210> right<00:01:00.300> into<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
yeah let's just jump right into this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
yeah let's just jump right into this
explanation<00:01:01.920> video<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.629> very<00:01:03.840> first

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
explanation video so the very first

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.260 
explanation video so the very first
thing<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.379> class<00:01:04.949> notes<00:01:05.159> class<00:01:05.580> notes<00:01:06.030> are

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
thing is class notes class notes are

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.250 
thing is class notes class notes are
notes<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.380> taken<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.070> class<00:01:08.850> based<00:01:09.840> on

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
notes that are taken in class based on

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
notes that are taken in class based on
the<00:01:10.530> lecture<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.729> teacher<00:01:11.970> gives

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the lecture that your teacher gives

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.840 
the lecture that your teacher gives
based<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.110> PowerPoint<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> shown<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.490> class

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
based on PowerPoint that shown in class

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
based on PowerPoint that shown in class
and<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.869> little<00:01:16.170> activities<00:01:16.770> or

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and you know little activities or

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.100 
and you know little activities or
examples<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.090> shown<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.390> class<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.900> it's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
examples that are shown in class if it's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.649 
examples that are shown in class if it's
a<00:01:19.229> math<00:01:19.560> class<00:01:19.970> well<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.299> don't<00:01:21.390> think

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
a math class well actually I don't think

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.149 
a math class well actually I don't think
a<00:01:21.720> line<00:01:21.930> notes<00:01:22.140> would<00:01:22.259> apply<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> math<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.040> if

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
a line notes would apply to math but if

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
a line notes would apply to math but if
this<00:01:23.280> let's<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.549> say<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> chemistry

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
this let's just say like a chemistry

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
this let's just say like a chemistry
class<00:01:25.200> um<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:26.280> would<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
class um it would be like you know the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.730 
class um it would be like you know the
little<00:01:27.509> example<00:01:28.049> problems<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> your

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
little example problems that your

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.819 
little example problems that your
teachers<00:01:29.189> would<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.900> PowerPoint<00:01:30.900> slides<00:01:31.380> any

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
teachers would do PowerPoint slides any

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.560 
teachers would do PowerPoint slides any
videos<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.490> were<00:01:32.909> shown<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.240> class<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
videos that were shown in class I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
videos that were shown in class I
required<00:01:33.900> some<00:01:34.110> sort<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.350> note-taking<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.490> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
required some sort of note-taking but it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
required some sort of note-taking but it
just<00:01:35.850> recorded<00:01:36.390> everything<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.229> happened

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
just recorded everything that happened

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.249 
just recorded everything that happened
in<00:01:37.890> class<00:01:38.430> specifically<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.540> only<00:01:39.930> class

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
in class specifically at only class

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.830 
in class specifically at only class
based<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.070> teacher<00:01:41.659> lectures<00:01:42.659> on

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
based on what your teacher lectures on

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
class notes look like this I always use

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.900 
class notes look like this I always use
a<00:02:09.410> small<00:02:09.709> compositional<00:02:10.399> book<00:02:10.550> for<00:02:10.700> class

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
a small compositional book for class

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.120 
a small compositional book for class
notes<00:02:11.330> but<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.380> looks<00:02:12.560> like<00:02:12.650> this

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
notes but it just looks like this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.370 
notes but it just looks like this
I<00:02:13.160> just<00:02:13.400> always<00:02:13.610> have<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.630> date<00:02:15.170> in<00:02:15.349> the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
I just always have the date in the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.710 
I just always have the date in the
corner<00:02:15.500> up<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.670> then<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.849> just<00:02:16.880> have<00:02:17.239> you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
corner up here and then I just have you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.290 
corner up here and then I just have you
know<00:02:17.840> everything<00:02:18.349> going<00:02:18.650> down<00:02:18.830> here<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.700> it's

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
know everything going down here and it's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.410 
know everything going down here and it's
really<00:02:20.900> messy<00:02:21.410> honestly<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.280> because<00:02:23.150> it's<00:02:23.300> in

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
really messy honestly of because it's in

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.910 
really messy honestly of because it's in
class<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.050> have<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.319> write<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.680> kind<00:02:24.890> of

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
class and you have to write it kind of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.940 
class and you have to write it kind of
fast<00:02:25.190> or<00:02:25.550> whatever<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.840> kind<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.410> messy<00:02:27.769> for

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
fast or whatever it's kind of messy for

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.339 
fast or whatever it's kind of messy for
the<00:02:28.040> most<00:02:28.280> part<00:02:28.640> I've<00:02:29.060> got<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.330> Gambas<00:02:29.900> in<00:02:30.110> there

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
the most part I've got a Gambas in there

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.650 
the most part I've got a Gambas in there
and<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:30.890> other<00:02:31.220> squiggly<00:02:32.030> stuff<00:02:32.420> that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
and just other squiggly stuff that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.160 
and just other squiggly stuff that
happens<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.319> class<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.940> um<00:02:35.209> that's<00:02:35.870> pretty

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
happens in class so um that's pretty

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.750 
happens in class so um that's pretty
much<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.590> that's<00:02:36.769> what<00:02:36.980> class<00:02:37.130> notes<00:02:37.400> are<00:02:37.549> just

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
much it that's what class notes are just

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.630 
much it that's what class notes are just
notes<00:02:38.120> taken<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:39.019> class<00:02:39.410> now<00:02:40.160> what<00:02:40.489> our

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
outline notes outlines notes are taken

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.809

while<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.330> are<00:02:44.480> reading<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.410> test<00:02:45.709> walk<00:02:46.069> um<00:02:46.730> I

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
while you are reading the test walk um I

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.030 
while you are reading the test walk um I
don't<00:02:47.540> really<00:02:47.840> understand<00:02:48.410> why<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> lot<00:02:48.920> of

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
don't really understand why a lot of

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.059 
don't really understand why a lot of
people<00:02:49.220> are<00:02:49.340> confused<00:02:49.910> about<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.569> um<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.769> I

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
people are confused about this um so I

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.979 
people are confused about this um so I
don't<00:02:52.280> know<00:02:52.430> why<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.760> keep<00:02:53.090> are<00:02:53.269> confused<00:02:53.690> but

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
don't know why I keep are confused but

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.830 
don't know why I keep are confused but
maybe<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:55.220> is<00:02:55.370> what<00:02:55.700> I'm<00:02:55.940> thinking<00:02:56.630> I'm

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
maybe this is what I'm thinking I'm

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.530 
maybe this is what I'm thinking I'm
thinking<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.380> maybe<00:02:57.739> some<00:02:58.489> teachers<00:02:59.060> teach

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
thinking that maybe some teachers teach

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.559 
thinking that maybe some teachers teach
with<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.470> textbook<00:03:01.100> in<00:03:01.459> class<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.299> then<00:03:02.450> you

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
with the textbook in class so then you

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.350 
with the textbook in class so then you
guys<00:03:02.720> can't<00:03:03.410> really<00:03:03.590> identify<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:04.610> difference

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
guys can't really identify a difference

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.479 
guys can't really identify a difference
because<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.110> know<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.560> class<00:03:06.799> notes<00:03:07.069> seem<00:03:07.340> to

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
because you know the class notes seem to

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.370 
because you know the class notes seem to
be<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.760> same<00:03:07.970> thing<00:03:08.269> as<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.810> lecture<00:03:09.260> notes

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
be the same thing as the lecture notes

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.009 
be the same thing as the lecture notes
and<00:03:09.650> let<00:03:10.340> me<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.459> say<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.150> way<00:03:11.209> class

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
and let me just say it this way class

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.740 
and let me just say it this way class
notes<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.410> lecture<00:03:12.650> notes<00:03:12.829> do<00:03:13.570> class<00:03:14.570> of

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
notes and lecture notes do class of

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.539 
notes and lecture notes do class of
class<00:03:15.079> notes<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.470> outlining<00:03:15.859> notes<00:03:16.160> to

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
class notes and outlining notes to

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.030 
class notes and outlining notes to
overlap<00:03:17.359> because<00:03:17.900> essentially<00:03:18.739> you're

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
overlap because essentially you're

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.130 
overlap because essentially you're
covering<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.760> same<00:03:20.000> material<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:20.810> there<00:03:21.019> is

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
covering the same material so there is

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.370 
covering the same material so there is
going<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.590> be<00:03:21.829> some<00:03:22.070> sort<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.400> overlapping

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
going to be some sort of overlapping

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.479 
going to be some sort of overlapping
especially<00:03:24.380> if<00:03:24.470> your<00:03:24.590> teacher<00:03:24.769> refers<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.250> the

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
especially if your teacher refers to the

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.670 
especially if your teacher refers to the
book<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.820> lot<00:03:26.060> in<00:03:26.239> class<00:03:26.420> it's<00:03:26.840> gonna<00:03:27.320> pretty

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
book a lot in class it's gonna pretty

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.190 
book a lot in class it's gonna pretty
much<00:03:27.769> be<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.160> same<00:03:28.519> thing<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.690> like<00:03:30.019> to

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
much be the same thing but I like to

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.979 
much be the same thing but I like to
take<00:03:30.410> class<00:03:30.680> notes<00:03:30.950> anyways<00:03:31.670> because<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.480> feel

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
take class notes anyways because I feel

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.500 
take class notes anyways because I feel
like<00:03:33.019> with<00:03:33.859> in<00:03:34.100> class<00:03:34.549> notes<00:03:34.910> are<00:03:35.060> always

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
like with in class notes are always

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.090 
like with in class notes are always
things<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.989> teacher<00:03:36.200> explains<00:03:36.829> that

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
things that the teacher explains that

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.800 
things that the teacher explains that
might<00:03:37.340> not<00:03:37.579> be<00:03:37.609> exactly<00:03:38.180> how<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.450> textbook

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
might not be exactly how the textbook

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.330 
might not be exactly how the textbook
explains<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.590> sometimes<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.160> helpful

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
explains it and sometimes it's helpful

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.830 
explains it and sometimes it's helpful
if<00:03:40.609> you<00:03:40.700> don't<00:03:40.850> understand<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.299> concept<00:03:41.690> to

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
if you don't understand a concept to

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.539 
if you don't understand a concept to
have<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.290> explained<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.069> you<00:03:43.190> in<00:03:43.250> many

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
have it explained to you in many

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.009 
have it explained to you in many
different<00:03:43.730> ways<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.420> way<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:44.660> can<00:03:44.840> kind

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
different ways and that way you can kind

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.080 
different ways and that way you can kind
of<00:03:45.049> understand<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.799> better<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.790> going<00:03:46.970> to

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
of understand it better so going to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.580 
of understand it better so going to
outline<00:03:47.480> notes<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.109> my<00:03:48.230> outline

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
like I use a bigger number for this one

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.860 
like I use a bigger number for this one
and<00:04:00.560> it's<00:04:01.100> just<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.609> this<00:04:01.910> outline<00:04:02.389> system

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
and it's just in this outline system

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.920 
and it's just in this outline system
that<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.049> have<00:04:03.139> going<00:04:03.560> on<00:04:04.030> highlighting<00:04:05.030> key

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
that I have going on highlighting key

that I have going on highlighting key
vocabulary<00:04:06.170> words<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.340> red<00:04:07.700> underlining<00:04:08.329> or

so um

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.289 
so um
yeah<00:04:14.390> this<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:15.080> outline<00:04:16.040> notes<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.760> this

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
yeah this is outline notes and this

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.830 
yeah this is outline notes and this
little<00:04:17.600> one<00:04:17.690> is<00:04:17.810> class<00:04:18.080> notes<00:04:18.459> so<00:04:19.459> how<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.299> would

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
little one is class notes so how I would

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.800 
little one is class notes so how I would
use<00:04:20.870> them<00:04:21.350> is<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.980> have<00:04:22.610> actually<00:04:23.210> talked<00:04:23.720> about

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
use them is I have actually talked about

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.390 
use them is I have actually talked about
this<00:04:23.960> in<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.290> previous<00:04:24.470> video<00:04:24.740> but<00:04:25.040> I<00:04:25.100> would

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
this in a previous video but I would

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.270 
this in a previous video but I would
study<00:04:25.700> them<00:04:26.060> together<00:04:26.570> um<00:04:27.290> kind<00:04:27.950> of<00:04:27.980> like<00:04:28.070> the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
study them together um kind of like the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.250 
study them together um kind of like the
same<00:04:28.520> subject<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.150> I'll<00:04:29.240> have<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.420> subject<00:04:29.750> open

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
same subject so I'll have a subject open

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.410 
same subject so I'll have a subject open
in<00:04:30.470> this<00:04:30.770> book<00:04:31.070> I'll<00:04:31.220> have<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> subject<00:04:31.790> open

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
in this book I'll have the subject open

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.390 
in this book I'll have the subject open
in<00:04:32.600> this<00:04:32.810> book<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.350> I'll<00:04:33.740> be<00:04:33.890> able<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.220> have

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
in this book and I'll be able to have

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.820 
in this book and I'll be able to have
two<00:04:35.030> sources<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.930> same<00:04:36.110> information<00:04:36.560> to

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
two sources of the same information to

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.950 
two sources of the same information to
study<00:04:37.070> from<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:38.150> they<00:04:38.420> explain<00:04:38.810> it

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
study from and so they explain it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.600 
study from and so they explain it
differently<00:04:39.050> they<00:04:39.560> give<00:04:39.710> different<00:04:39.740> examples

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
differently they give different examples

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.100 
differently they give different examples
look<00:04:40.790> it's<00:04:41.000> kind<00:04:41.240> of<00:04:41.270> helpful<00:04:41.510> sometimes<00:04:41.810> to

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
look it's kind of helpful sometimes to

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.950 
look it's kind of helpful sometimes to
have<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:42.530> repeat<00:04:43.190> it<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.580> um<00:04:43.820> once<00:04:44.660> again

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
have it repeat it to you um once again

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.900 
have it repeat it to you um once again
like<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.260> said<00:04:45.320> before<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:45.950> is<00:04:45.980> very<00:04:46.520> very

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
like I said before it is very very

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.510 
like I said before it is very very
repetitive<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.660> they<00:04:47.840> do<00:04:48.020> overlap<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.710> lot<00:04:48.950> but

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
repetitive and they do overlap a lot but

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.060 
repetitive and they do overlap a lot but
I<00:04:49.700> do<00:04:50.000> them<00:04:50.300> both<00:04:50.450> anyways<00:04:50.990> just<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:52.040> I

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
I do them both anyways just so that I

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.820 
I do them both anyways just so that I
get<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.550> information<00:04:53.230> delivered<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.440> me<00:04:54.590> many

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
get the information delivered to me many

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.400 
get the information delivered to me many
many<00:04:54.950> times<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.640> in<00:04:56.030> multiple<00:04:56.570> ways<00:04:56.720> so<00:04:56.750> that

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
many times and in multiple ways so that

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.320 
many times and in multiple ways so that
if<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.830> don't<00:04:58.010> understand<00:04:58.340> it<00:04:58.430> one<00:04:58.550> way<00:04:58.700> I<00:04:58.730> can

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
if I don't understand it one way I can

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.930 
if I don't understand it one way I can
get<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.780> from<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.080> other<00:05:00.200> way<00:05:00.380> so<00:05:00.440> um<00:05:01.040> that's

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
get it from the other way so um that's

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.520 
get it from the other way so um that's
pretty<00:05:02.240> much<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.870> that's<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.200> big<00:05:03.380> difference

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
pretty much it that's the big difference

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.830 
pretty much it that's the big difference
one<00:05:04.040> is<00:05:04.190> from<00:05:04.400> class<00:05:04.640> one<00:05:05.000> is<00:05:05.120> from<00:05:05.330> at<00:05:05.480> home

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
one is from class one is from at home

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.890 
one is from class one is from at home
from<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.380> textbook<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:07.330> they're<00:05:08.330> meant<00:05:08.630> to

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
from the textbook and they're meant to

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.900 
from the textbook and they're meant to
overlap<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:09.920> if<00:05:09.980> you<00:05:10.130> think<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.550> it<00:05:10.670> is<00:05:10.820> very

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
overlap so if you think that it is very

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.110 
overlap so if you think that it is very
very<00:05:11.480> very<00:05:11.870> repetitive<00:05:12.800> and<00:05:13.400> kind<00:05:13.580> of<00:05:13.670> like<00:05:13.820> um

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
very very repetitive and kind of like um

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.860 
very very repetitive and kind of like um
tedious<00:05:14.930> to<00:05:15.200> kind<00:05:15.410> of<00:05:15.440> do<00:05:15.590> twice<00:05:15.950> it<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:17.030> but<00:05:17.600> um

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
tedious to kind of do twice it is but um

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.520 
tedious to kind of do twice it is but um
my<00:05:18.530> system<00:05:19.190> is<00:05:19.490> tedious<00:05:20.210> although<00:05:21.140> I<00:05:21.169> feel

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
my system is tedious although I feel

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.100 
my system is tedious although I feel
like<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.950> repetition<00:05:22.669> is<00:05:22.910> really<00:05:23.780> helpful

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
and I feel like by making it that

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.980 
and I feel like by making it that
tedious<00:05:27.530> after<00:05:27.890> a<00:05:28.580> while<00:05:28.880> you'll<00:05:29.510> kind<00:05:29.900> of

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
tedious after a while you'll kind of

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.740 
tedious after a while you'll kind of
start<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:30.620> understand<00:05:31.310> it<00:05:31.520> even<00:05:32.300> if<00:05:32.540> you

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
start to understand it even if you

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.810 
start to understand it even if you
didn't<00:05:33.050> before<00:05:33.230> the<00:05:33.890> fact<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.430> was<00:05:34.580> just

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
didn't before the fact that it was just

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.060 
didn't before the fact that it was just
pounded<00:05:35.600> into<00:05:35.810> your<00:05:35.900> head<00:05:36.050> so<00:05:36.380> many<00:05:36.530> times<00:05:36.680> you

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
start to get it and you start to

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.960 
start to get it and you start to
memorize<00:05:38.450> it<00:05:38.960> without<00:05:39.320> even<00:05:39.820> realizing<00:05:40.820> that
