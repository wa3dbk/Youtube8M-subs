00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
so as we all know formula One is the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.660 
so as we all know formula One is the

of<00:00:14.000> formula<00:00:14.360> 1<00:00:14.480> cars<00:00:14.830> but<00:00:15.830> wouldn't<00:00:16.039> it<00:00:16.070> be

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
of formula 1 cars but wouldn't it be

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.890 
of formula 1 cars but wouldn't it be
really<00:00:16.219> cool<00:00:16.670> if<00:00:16.910> we<00:00:17.030> took<00:00:17.270> a<00:00:17.330> Formula<00:00:17.720> One<00:00:17.750> car

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.500 
really cool if we took a Formula One car
and<00:00:18.320> split<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:18.830> and<00:00:19.160> opened<00:00:19.640> it<00:00:19.760> just<00:00:20.180> like<00:00:20.330> an

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
and split it and opened it just like an

the car so starting at the rear we've

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180 
the car so starting at the rear we've
got<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> gearbox<00:00:42.870> we've<00:00:43.680> got<00:00:43.830> the<00:00:43.920> clutch

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
got the gearbox we've got the clutch

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.100 
got the gearbox we've got the clutch
we've<00:00:44.760> got<00:00:44.880> the<00:00:44.970> engine<00:00:45.120> I've<00:00:45.810> got<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> oil

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
we've got the engine I've got the oil

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.620 
we've got the engine I've got the oil
tank<00:00:46.260> we've<00:00:47.070> got<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.310> fuel<00:00:47.520> system<00:00:47.700> here

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
tank we've got the fuel system here

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.180 
tank we've got the fuel system here
we've<00:00:48.750> got<00:00:48.780> all<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> electronic<00:00:49.530> boxes<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
we've got all the electronic boxes and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
we've got all the electronic boxes and
then<00:00:51.000> moving<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.450> to<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.630> front<00:00:51.750> we've<00:00:52.020> got

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
then moving up to the front we've got

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.720 
then moving up to the front we've got
all<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.380> pedals<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.950> steering<00:00:53.010> system

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
all the pedals and the steering system

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.060 
all the pedals and the steering system
now<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.900> very<00:00:55.080> important<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.650> formula<00:00:55.890> 1

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
now it's very important on a formula 1

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
now it's very important on a formula 1
car<00:00:56.130> that<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.640> keep<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> weight<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.540> low

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
car that we keep all the weight very low

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
car that we keep all the weight very low
this<00:00:58.290> reduces<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> center<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.250> gravity<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
this reduces the center of gravity of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.780 
this reduces the center of gravity of
the<00:00:59.850> car<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.270> brings<00:01:00.540> us<00:01:00.660> performance

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.330 

this<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.660> car<00:01:05.840> steering<00:01:06.140> system<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:07.100> start

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
this is the car steering system we start

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.160 
this is the car steering system we start
with<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> steering<00:01:07.850> wheel<00:01:08.020> clearly<00:01:09.020> it's<00:01:09.140> not

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
with a steering wheel clearly it's not

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.870 
with a steering wheel clearly it's not
just<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.500> steering<00:01:09.830> wheel<00:01:09.980> it<00:01:10.400> also<00:01:10.700> doubles

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
just the steering wheel it also doubles

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.700 
just the steering wheel it also doubles
up<00:01:11.180> as<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.420> drivers<00:01:11.780> interface<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.470> rest

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
up as the drivers interface to the rest

these horizontal baffles the fuel would

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.460 
these horizontal baffles the fuel would
surge<00:02:19.120> around<00:02:19.450> particularly<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.080> breaking

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
lots of pipes and pumps in here these

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.870 
lots of pipes and pumps in here these
are<00:02:40.450> positioned<00:02:40.870> strategically<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:42.250> feed<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.400 

spoken<00:02:49.660> about<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.080> technical

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
spoken about all the technical

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.570 
spoken about all the technical
components<00:02:50.860> on<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.040> car<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.370> how<00:02:51.520> we

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
components on the car and how we

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.850 
components on the car and how we
position<00:02:51.850> them<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.510> package<00:02:52.810> them<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:53.170> guess

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
position them and package them I guess

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.010 
position them and package them I guess
the<00:02:53.950> final<00:02:54.070> piece<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.520> jigsaw<00:02:54.850> now<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.330> to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
the final piece of the jigsaw now is to

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.050 
the final piece of the jigsaw now is to
position<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.410> driver<00:02:56.680> some<00:02:57.580> say<00:02:57.730> he's<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
position the driver some say he's the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.640 
position the driver some say he's the
most<00:02:58.180> important<00:02:58.660> part<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.990> car<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.440> were

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
most important part of the car so were

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.980 
most important part of the car so were
so<00:02:59.950> let's<00:03:00.130> get<00:03:00.220> him<00:03:00.340> in<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:01.240> important<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.900> be

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
so let's get him in it's important to be

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.920 
so let's get him in it's important to be
fit<00:03:02.320> you<00:03:02.890> are<00:03:03.010> not<00:03:03.190> in<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> normal<00:03:03.820> position<00:03:03.970> you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
fit you are not in a normal position you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.840 
fit you are not in a normal position you
have<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.170> lot<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.410> forces<00:03:05.980> especially<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.760> a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
have a lot of forces especially in a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.690 
have a lot of forces especially in a
crash<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.390> had<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.080> big<00:03:08.440> accident<00:03:08.620> last<00:03:09.190> year<00:03:09.340> in

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
crash I had a big accident last year in

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.990 
crash I had a big accident last year in
in<00:03:10.030> Monaco<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.830> we<00:03:12.160> quite<00:03:12.430> know<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.850> it's

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
in Monaco so we we quite know that it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.540 
in Monaco so we we quite know that it's
a<00:03:13.120> safe<00:03:13.660> car<00:03:13.990> should<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.500> get<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.710> in<00:03:14.830> then<00:03:15.010> of

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.610 
looks as I told you not a very
comfortable<00:03:24.069> position<00:03:24.849> to<00:03:25.390> be<00:03:25.510> sitting<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:25.989> in

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
comfortable position to be sitting in in

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.920 
comfortable position to be sitting in in
two<00:03:27.250> hours<00:03:27.580> we<00:03:27.819> smoking<00:03:28.150> about<00:03:28.239> getting<00:03:28.810> all

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
two hours we smoking about getting all

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.809 
two hours we smoking about getting all
the<00:03:29.019> components<00:03:29.379> is<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:30.160> slow<00:03:30.400> down<00:03:30.580> on<00:03:30.730> the

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
the components is it slow down on the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.420 
the components is it slow down on the
cars<00:03:31.060> as<00:03:31.450> as<00:03:32.349> possible<00:03:32.830> obviously<00:03:33.010> you're

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
cars as as possible obviously you're

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.699 
cars as as possible obviously you're
you're<00:03:33.940> just<00:03:34.150> another<00:03:34.269> component<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:35.349> it<00:03:35.379> so

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
you're just another component to it so

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.220 
you're just another component to it so
as<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.040> can<00:03:36.129> see<00:03:36.569> you're<00:03:37.569> sort<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.810> backside

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
as you can see you're sort of backside

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.320 
as you can see you're sort of backside
is<00:03:38.500> ten<00:03:38.950> millimeters<00:03:39.489> away<00:03:39.580> from<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:39.940> tarmac

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
is ten millimeters away from the tarmac

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.210 
is ten millimeters away from the tarmac
not<00:03:40.360> sure<00:03:40.720> which<00:03:41.140> obviously<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.799> know<00:03:42.160> you

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
not sure which obviously you know you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.490 
not sure which obviously you know you
feel<00:03:42.580> when<00:03:42.849> you're<00:03:42.989> when<00:03:43.989> you're<00:03:44.110> racing<00:03:44.290> in

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
feel when you're when you're racing in

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.990 
feel when you're when you're racing in
the<00:03:44.530> car<00:03:44.769> yeah<00:03:45.069> it's<00:03:45.370> usually<00:03:45.610> a<00:03:45.640> good<00:03:45.790> gauge

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
the car yeah it's usually a good gauge

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.930 
the car yeah it's usually a good gauge
to<00:03:46.680> tell<00:03:47.680> as<00:03:47.799> if<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> car<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.340> too<00:03:48.489> low<00:03:48.700> because

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
to tell as if the car is too low because

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.270 
to tell as if the car is too low because
his<00:03:49.440> backside<00:03:50.440> maybe<00:03:50.680> gets<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.980> little<00:03:51.099> bit

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
his backside maybe gets a little bit

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.449 
his backside maybe gets a little bit
warm<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:52.329> still<00:03:52.660> there<00:03:52.870> for<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.319> small<00:03:54.250> touch

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
warm you still there for a small touch

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.340 
warm you still there for a small touch
ya<00:03:55.000> back<00:03:55.660> there<00:03:55.690> yeah

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.470 

safety<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.250> obviously<00:04:00.490> paramount<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.120> Formula

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
safety is obviously paramount in Formula

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.140 
safety is obviously paramount in Formula
One<00:04:01.630> obviously<00:04:02.080> if<00:04:02.470> anything<00:04:02.950> does<00:04:03.100> happen<00:04:03.250> we

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
One obviously if anything does happen we

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.460 
One obviously if anything does happen we
have<00:04:04.240> a<00:04:04.270> fire<00:04:04.480> extinguisher<00:04:04.510> system<00:04:05.080> on<00:04:05.350> the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
at the track the actual chassis is one

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.920
