00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.170 

I<00:00:02.389> hate<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.540> level<00:00:03.770> so<00:00:04.770> down<00:00:05.069> much<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.730> hate

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
I hate this level so down much I hate

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.030 
I hate this level so down much I hate
this<00:00:06.330> stupid<00:00:06.779> wind<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.500> comes<00:00:07.649> over<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
this stupid wind that comes over the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.220 
this stupid wind that comes over the
fence<00:00:08.309> but<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.000> doesn't<00:00:09.420> only<00:00:09.599> just<00:00:09.990> come<00:00:10.139> over

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
fence but it doesn't only just come over

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.759 
fence but it doesn't only just come over
the<00:00:10.410> fence

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
the fence

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.839 
the fence
yeah<00:00:10.889> actually<00:00:10.980> goes<00:00:11.250> through<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.639> fence

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
yeah actually goes through the fence

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.120 
yeah actually goes through the fence
which<00:00:12.509> makes<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.900> extremely<00:00:13.380> hard<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.950> go

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
which makes it extremely hard to go

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.880 
which makes it extremely hard to go
along<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:15.389> I'm<00:00:15.570> doing<00:00:15.809> now<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:16.230> trying<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.710> do

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
along like I'm doing now or trying to do

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.250 
along like I'm doing now or trying to do
because<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.060> wind<00:00:18.240> somehow<00:00:18.690> gets<00:00:18.930> through<00:00:19.140> it

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
because the wind somehow gets through it

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.540 
because the wind somehow gets through it
every<00:00:19.439> now<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.680> then<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.039> pushes<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
every now and then it just pushes you

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.029 
every now and then it just pushes you
off<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:21.240> some<00:00:21.449> weird<00:00:21.660> reason<00:00:21.779> also<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.800> gate

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
off for some weird reason also this gate

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.040 
off for some weird reason also this gate
that<00:00:23.189> I'm<00:00:23.279> come<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.630> go<00:00:24.779> through

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that I'm come up to you just go through

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.920 
that I'm come up to you just go through

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so many times I've got to this position

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.830 
so many times I've got to this position
and<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.860> burnt<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.369> bread<00:01:50.579> somehow<00:01:50.939> because
