00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.789 

it<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.689> gains<00:01:19.619> speed<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> quickly<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
it just gains speed so quickly and

violently the clutches surprisingly
stiff<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.280> short<00:01:29.670> throw<00:01:30.000> that's

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
stiff but it's a short throw that's

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.389 
stiff but it's a short throw that's
positive<00:01:30.930> engagement<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> shifter<00:01:32.220> went

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
positive engagement and the shifter went

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.160 
positive engagement and the shifter went
to<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> same<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> mean<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:35.930> 60<00:01:36.930> that's

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to be the same way I mean this 60 that's

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.950 
to be the same way I mean this 60 that's
in<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.860> an<00:01:38.190> amazingly<00:01:38.909> short<00:01:39.299> throw<00:01:39.720> for

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
in this is an amazingly short throw for

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.830 
in this is an amazingly short throw for
what<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.289> and<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.759> bit<00:01:41.970> notchy<00:01:42.210> but

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
what it is and it's a bit notchy but

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
what it is and it's a bit notchy but
it's<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.830> be<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.580> hard<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> miss

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it's going to be really hard to miss

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.580 
it's going to be really hard to miss
shifts<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:47.810> leather<00:01:48.810> changes<00:01:49.320> they've<00:01:49.560> made

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
shifts with leather changes they've made

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230 
shifts with leather changes they've made
just<00:01:50.100> make<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> zl1

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
just make to the zl1

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
just make to the zl1
they<00:01:51.509> finally<00:01:51.869> put<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.289> normal<00:01:52.710> shape<00:01:53.220> steering

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
they finally put a normal shape steering

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.419 
they finally put a normal shape steering
wheel<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.479> which<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.110> plus<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.069> far<00:01:56.310> as

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
wheel in it which is a plus as far as

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.160 
wheel in it which is a plus as far as
I'm<00:01:56.550> concerned<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:58.789> steering<00:01:59.789> itself<00:02:00.270> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
I'm concerned the steering itself I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.570 
I'm concerned the steering itself I
don't<00:02:01.740> really<00:02:02.100> know<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.640> they<00:02:02.909> did<00:02:04.580> between

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
don't really know what they did between

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.010 
don't really know what they did between
this<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:07.440> normal<00:02:07.950> Camaro<00:02:08.519> but<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
this and the normal Camaro but it is

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.640 
this and the normal Camaro but it is
so<00:02:10.950> much<00:02:11.370> better<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:12.030> comparison<00:02:12.440> there's<00:02:13.440> so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so much better in comparison there's so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.110 
so much better in comparison there's so
much<00:02:13.740> it's<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.220> much<00:02:14.370> more<00:02:14.550> direct<00:02:15.000> than

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
much it's so much more direct than

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.480 
much it's so much more direct than
there's<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.540> much<00:02:15.630> more<00:02:15.870> feedback<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:17.130> course

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
there's so much more feedback of course

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.220 
there's so much more feedback of course
it's<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.970> know<00:02:18.060> wrapped<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.600> leather<00:02:18.870> suede

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
it's you know wrapped in leather suede

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.949 
it's you know wrapped in leather suede
which<00:02:19.680> leads<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.670> pretty<00:02:20.940> nice<00:02:21.180> touch

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
the thing that's important to know is

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.890 
the thing that's important to know is
the<00:02:26.659> magnetic<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:28.459> they<00:02:29.359> put<00:02:29.659> under

completely changes this car from where

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.120 
completely changes this car from where
it<00:02:47.220> was<00:02:47.460> with<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.810> SS<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.600> it's<00:02:52.130> it's

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it was with the SS to this one it's it's

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.230 
it was with the SS to this one it's it's
actually<00:02:53.430> hard<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:55.020> put<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.160> words<00:02:56.460> no

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
actually hard to put in the words no

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.350 
actually hard to put in the words no
different<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.020> corns<00:02:58.560> and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
different this corns and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.050 
different this corns and
the<00:03:00.840> other<00:03:00.990> important<00:03:01.650> note<00:03:01.800> is<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.400> find<00:03:02.910> that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
the other important note is I find that

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.800 
the other important note is I find that
every<00:03:03.330> time<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:03.840> into<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.260> Cadillac<00:03:04.770> cts-v

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
every time I get into a Cadillac cts-v

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.480 
every time I get into a Cadillac cts-v
even<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.930> ones<00:03:07.110> with<00:03:07.290> manual<00:03:07.740> transmissions

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
even the ones with manual transmissions

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.250 
even the ones with manual transmissions
I<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:09.330> don't<00:03:09.600> think<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.140> they're<00:03:10.500> all<00:03:11.010> that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
I just don't think that they're all that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.430 
I just don't think that they're all that
sure<00:03:13.260> they<00:03:13.470> push<00:03:13.770> into<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.220> scene<00:03:14.580> but<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
sure they push into the scene but the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.760 
sure they push into the scene but the
way<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:17.010> thing<00:03:17.070> gains<00:03:17.820> speed<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
way that this thing gains speed and the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.580 
way that this thing gains speed and the
show<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.490> gets<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.350> whole

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
show that it gets you it's a whole

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.620 
show that it gets you it's a whole
different<00:03:22.980> league<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.640> almost<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.390> you

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
different league it's almost like if you

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.400 
different league it's almost like if you
drive<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.680> cr1

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.110 

it's<00:03:30.410> hard<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.980> wrap<00:03:31.100> your<00:03:31.160> head<00:03:31.370> around<00:03:31.520> how

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
it's hard to wrap your head around how

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.170 
it's hard to wrap your head around how
much<00:03:32.900> order<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.500> car<00:03:33.740> accelerates<00:03:34.490> then

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
much order that car accelerates then

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.380 
much order that car accelerates then
even<00:03:35.540> say<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> zo6<00:03:36.500> will<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.580> wind<00:03:37.970> up<00:03:38.150> being

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
even say a zo6 will this wind up being

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.890 
even say a zo6 will this wind up being
the<00:03:38.810> exact<00:03:39.590> same<00:03:39.890> way

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
the exact same way

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.410 
the exact same way
compared<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:41.960> even<00:03:42.200> like<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.590> cts-v<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.910> just

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
compared to even like a cts-v it just

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.140 
compared to even like a cts-v it just
has<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:46.100> much<00:03:46.310> more<00:03:46.670> grunt

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.910 

oh<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.780> haven't<00:03:52.079> had<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.290> chance<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.620> drive

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
oh you haven't had the chance to drive

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.740 
oh you haven't had the chance to drive
the<00:03:53.340> new<00:03:53.780> gt500<00:03:54.780> yet<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.799> can<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.730> why<00:03:57.239> in

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
the new gt500 yet but I can see why in

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.690 
the new gt500 yet but I can see why in
the<00:03:57.930> comparisons<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.920> thing<00:03:59.189> gives<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.610> a

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
the comparisons this thing gives it a

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.970 
the comparisons this thing gives it a
headache<00:03:59.970> sure<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:03.140> Mustang<00:04:04.140> might<00:04:04.470> have<00:04:04.739> a

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
headache sure that Mustang might have a

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.550 
headache sure that Mustang might have a
little<00:04:05.459> bit<00:04:05.579> more

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
little bit more

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.940 
little bit more
grunt<00:04:07.569> but<00:04:08.569> at<00:04:08.690> low<00:04:08.900> how<00:04:09.080> much<00:04:09.349> more<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.800> could

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
grunt but at low how much more you could

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.339 
grunt but at low how much more you could
actually<00:04:10.130> really<00:04:10.610> put<00:04:10.849> to<00:04:11.000> use<00:04:11.270> and<00:04:11.690> the

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
actually really put to use and the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.320 
actually really put to use and the
suspension<00:04:12.890> tuning<00:04:13.430> that's<00:04:13.670> on<00:04:13.819> this<00:04:14.000> thing

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
suspension tuning that's on this thing

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.190 
suspension tuning that's on this thing
is<00:04:15.639> game-changing<00:04:16.639> I<00:04:16.910> mean<00:04:17.840> just<00:04:18.290> a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
is game-changing I mean just a

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.060 
is game-changing I mean just a
differentiator<00:04:21.200> when<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.590> really<00:04:21.859> get<00:04:22.010> down

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
differentiator when you really get down

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.070 
differentiator when you really get down
to<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:25.000> that's<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.270> other<00:04:26.330> thing<00:04:26.480> that<00:04:26.690> the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
to it that's the other thing that the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.770 
to it that's the other thing that the
Magnetic<00:04:27.620> Ride<00:04:27.650> does<00:04:28.160> is<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:29.090> makes<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.540> so

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
Magnetic Ride does is it makes it so

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.360 
Magnetic Ride does is it makes it so
that<00:04:29.889> hard<00:04:30.889> launches<00:04:31.460> are<00:04:32.330> met<00:04:32.660> with

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
that hard launches are met with

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:45.010 
that hard launches are met with
absolutely<00:04:34.370> no<00:04:34.730> bill

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.060 

it's<00:04:46.909> stunning<00:04:47.909> to<00:04:48.599> think

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
it's stunning to think

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.510 
it's stunning to think
from<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.640> original<00:04:51.270> cts-v<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.890> original

this thing
I<00:05:09.349> didn't<00:05:10.349> think<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.830> was<00:05:10.919> going<00:05:11.099> to<00:05:11.220> be<00:05:11.310> as

I didn't think it was going to be as

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.360 
I didn't think it was going to be as

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
good as it is and I know it's just five

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.279

before<00:05:33.150> driving<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:33.930> would<00:05:34.230> have

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
before driving it I would have

before driving it I would have
absolutely<00:05:35.010> steered<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:35.700> your<00:05:35.820> Ford
