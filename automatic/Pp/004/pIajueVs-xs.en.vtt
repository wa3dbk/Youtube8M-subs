benefits I've always had enlarged pores
I<00:00:18.030> think<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.300> said<00:00:18.450> something<00:00:18.780> that<00:00:18.870> runs<00:00:19.020> in

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
I think it said something that runs in

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.910 
I think it said something that runs in
my<00:00:19.350> family

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
my family

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.000 
my family
I've<00:00:20.310> spent<00:00:20.610> literally<00:00:21.570> hundreds<00:00:22.560> over<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I've spent literally hundreds over the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.430 
I've spent literally hundreds over the
years<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.550> different<00:00:23.820> creams<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.780> skin<00:00:25.110> peels

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
years on different creams and skin peels

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.800 
years on different creams and skin peels
and<00:00:25.830> nothing's<00:00:26.340> ever<00:00:26.460> worked<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.150> quite

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
and nothing's ever worked and quite

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.110 
and nothing's ever worked and quite
frankly<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.290> think<00:00:28.620> that<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.460> time<00:00:29.700> anyway

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 
frankly I think that for the time anyway

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.610 
frankly I think that for the time anyway
there's<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.540> really<00:00:30.840> anything<00:00:31.170> out<00:00:31.410> there

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:31.620 
there's not really anything out there

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.250 
there's not really anything out there
that's<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> fix<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.450> changed

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
that's going to fix it so I changed

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.350 
that's going to fix it so I changed
strategy<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.890> thought<00:00:35.100> okay<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.670> can't<00:00:36.030> get

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
strategy and I thought okay I can't get

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.350 
strategy and I thought okay I can't get
rid<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.540> them<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.960> how<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.530> cover<00:00:37.890> them<00:00:38.040> up

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
rid of them so how can I cover them up

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.500 
rid of them so how can I cover them up
effectively<00:00:39.379> because<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.649> oily<00:00:40.920> skin<00:00:41.510> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
effectively because I have oily skin I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
effectively because I have oily skin I
find<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.260> anything<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.039> tended<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
find that anything I was using tended to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.149 
find that anything I was using tended to
kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.940> slide<00:00:45.239> off<00:00:45.480> later<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.679> day<00:00:46.859> and

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
kind of slide off later in the day and

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.399 
kind of slide off later in the day and
so<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.300> found<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.749> really<00:00:48.839> cool<00:00:49.199> way<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
so I found this really cool way and

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.259 
so I found this really cool way and
simple<00:00:50.219> way<00:00:50.339> of<00:00:50.370> covering<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
simple way of covering them up and I

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.489 
simple way of covering them up and I
thought<00:00:51.420> I'd<00:00:51.510> bring<00:00:51.629> them<00:00:51.749> to<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.109> so<00:00:52.379> the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
from a I can acne scar but I have from

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.580 
from a I can acne scar but I have from
years<00:04:28.830> which<00:04:29.070> is<00:04:29.250> kind<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.520> just<00:04:29.669> there<00:04:30.440> if<00:04:31.440> you

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
years which is kind of just there if you

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.159 
years which is kind of just there if you
can<00:04:31.770> see<00:04:31.880> it's<00:04:32.880> very<00:04:32.910> subtle

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
can see it's very subtle

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.140 
can see it's very subtle
but<00:04:34.710> take<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.069> smallest<00:04:35.520> amount<00:04:35.849> of<00:04:35.939> this

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
but take the smallest amount of this

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.510 
but take the smallest amount of this
product<00:04:36.599> and<00:04:37.259> I<00:04:37.469> say<00:04:37.650> small<00:04:38.009> because<00:04:38.219> it<00:04:38.370> goes

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
product and I say small because it goes

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.890 
product and I say small because it goes
really<00:04:38.789> far<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.419> then<00:04:41.150> my<00:04:42.150> tip<00:04:42.389> for<00:04:42.419> applying

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
really far and then my tip for applying

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.110 
really far and then my tip for applying
it<00:04:43.080> is<00:04:43.199> don't<00:04:43.469> use<00:04:43.650> your<00:04:43.800> fingers<00:04:44.189> unless
