it has shorter bristles to longer
bristles<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.610> are<00:00:41.850> twirls<00:00:42.660> along<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
bristles and they are twirls along the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.260 
bristles and they are twirls along the
one<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:43.980> aren't<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.730> left<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> right

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
one they aren't just from left to right

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.360 
one they aren't just from left to right
and<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.930> between<00:00:46.050> those<00:00:46.559> bristles<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.190> are

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
other bristles that are coming back the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
other bristles that are coming back the
other<00:00:49.379> ways<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:50.190> teeny<00:00:50.430> tiny<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.210> a

other ways that are teeny tiny to a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.420 
other ways that are teeny tiny to a
little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.600> longer<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.070> how<00:00:53.190> they're

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
little bit longer so that is how they're

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.010 
little bit longer so that is how they're
gonna<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.180> corner<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> corner<00:00:54.840> or

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
gonna get that corner to corner or

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
gonna get that corner to corner or
volume<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.710> let's<00:00:55.920> go<00:00:56.039> ahead<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> try<00:00:56.489> this

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
volume so let's go ahead and try this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
volume so let's go ahead and try this
out<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.660> really<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.289> four

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
out and see if we really get four

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.549 
out and see if we really get four
hundred<00:00:58.829> percent<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.850> volume<00:01:00.390> corner<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
hundred percent more volume corner to

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:20.690 
hundred percent more volume corner to
corner

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700

okay<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.500> overall<00:02:48.010> thoughts<00:02:48.340> on<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.910> super

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
okay so overall thoughts on the super

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.440 
okay so overall thoughts on the super
sizer<00:02:49.930> mascara<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.890> will<00:02:51.340> definitely<00:02:51.580> say<00:02:52.150> it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
sizer mascara I will definitely say it

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.680 
sizer mascara I will definitely say it
gives<00:02:52.750> some<00:02:53.020> intense<00:02:53.680> intense<00:02:54.430> volume<00:02:55.060> it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
gives some intense intense volume it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.480 
gives some intense intense volume it
does<00:02:56.110> separate<00:02:56.980> lashes<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.300> well<00:02:58.870> but<00:02:59.680> only<00:03:00.460> on

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
does separate lashes so well but only on

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.000 
does separate lashes so well but only on
that<00:03:00.880> first<00:03:01.180> coat<00:03:01.690> which<00:03:02.320> leads<00:03:02.560> me<00:03:02.680> into<00:03:02.860> my

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
that first coat which leads me into my

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.920 
that first coat which leads me into my
next<00:03:03.310> thing<00:03:03.520> when<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.850> apply<00:03:04.270> that<00:03:04.510> second

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
next thing when you apply that second

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.650 
next thing when you apply that second
coat<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.710> formula<00:03:06.220> starts<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.730> get<00:03:06.850> very<00:03:06.910> very

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
coat the formula starts to get very very

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.800 
coat the formula starts to get very very
clumpy<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.920> didn't<00:03:09.580> see<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.880> need<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.570> use<00:03:10.780> a

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
clumpy I didn't see the need to use a

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.680 
clumpy I didn't see the need to use a
twirling<00:03:11.910> application<00:03:12.910> for<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.210> first<00:03:13.420> coat

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
twirling application for the first coat

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.360 
twirling application for the first coat
because<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.140> was<00:03:14.260> separating<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.220> with

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
because it was separating it with

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.070 
because it was separating it with
lengthening<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:16.000> was<00:03:16.090> add<00:03:16.270> volume<00:03:16.570> for<00:03:16.960> that

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
lengthening it was add volume for that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.830 
lengthening it was add volume for that
first<00:03:17.230> coat<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.130> since<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:19.390> pumped<00:03:19.660> on

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
first coat but since it was so pumped on

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.560 
first coat but since it was so pumped on
that<00:03:19.930> second<00:03:20.440> coat<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.800> did<00:03:21.100> start<00:03:21.490> to<00:03:21.820> twirl<00:03:22.330> it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
that second coat I did start to twirl it

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.010 
that second coat I did start to twirl it
and<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.320> helps<00:03:24.130> decrease<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:25.150> clumping<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.750> it

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
and it helps decrease the clumping is it

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.140 
and it helps decrease the clumping is it
did<00:03:26.230> help<00:03:26.440> start<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.890> separate<00:03:27.370> those<00:03:27.640> washes

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
did help start to separate those washes

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.290 
did help start to separate those washes
so<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:28.990> was<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.140> plus<00:03:29.370> okay<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:31.060> all<00:03:31.240> I

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
so that was a plus okay so all in all I

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.480 
so that was a plus okay so all in all I
think<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:31.960> definitely<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.710> great<00:03:33.130> mascara

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
think it is definitely a great mascara

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.560 
think it is definitely a great mascara
it<00:03:34.030> definitely<00:03:34.960> gives<00:03:35.590> some<00:03:36.070> intense<00:03:36.850> volume

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
it definitely gives some intense volume

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.050 
it definitely gives some intense volume
to<00:03:37.930> your<00:03:37.960> lashes<00:03:38.380> even<00:03:39.070> though<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.220> do<00:03:39.370> believe

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
to your lashes even though I do believe

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.540 
to your lashes even though I do believe
that<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:41.020> know<00:03:41.140> fulfilled<00:03:41.770> its<00:03:42.070> claims

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
that it you know fulfilled its claims

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.060 
that it you know fulfilled its claims
it's<00:03:43.240> just<00:03:43.420> really<00:03:43.630> not<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.930> mascara<00:03:44.350> for<00:03:44.620> me<00:03:44.830> I

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
it's just really not a mascara for me I

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.130 
it's just really not a mascara for me I
like<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.820> apply<00:03:46.150> at<00:03:46.360> least<00:03:46.600> two<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.110> three

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
like to apply at least two to three

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.530 
like to apply at least two to three
coats<00:03:47.530> mascara<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.490> this<00:03:48.910> guy<00:03:49.150> didn't

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
coats mascara and this this guy didn't

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.960 
coats mascara and this this guy didn't
