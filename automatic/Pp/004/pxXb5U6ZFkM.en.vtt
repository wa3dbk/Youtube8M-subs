my<00:04:21.760> Lumia<00:04:22.300> 920<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.260> think<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.800> only<00:04:23.919> thing

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
my Lumia 920 I think the only thing

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.690 
my Lumia 920 I think the only thing
that's<00:04:24.310> laid<00:04:24.639> down<00:04:25.000> is

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
that's laid down is

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.200 
that's laid down is
the<00:04:25.760> lack<00:04:25.940> of<00:04:25.970> apps<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:27.800> hate<00:04:28.640> to<00:04:28.820> say<00:04:29.000> this

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
the lack of apps and I hate to say this

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.630 
the lack of apps and I hate to say this
in<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.720> unboxing<00:04:30.200> video<00:04:30.410> but<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.130> really<00:04:31.490> do

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
in the unboxing video but I really do

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.230 
in the unboxing video but I really do
wish<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.420> Nokia<00:04:32.690> would<00:04:33.620> do<00:04:34.010> Lumia<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.700> put

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
wish that Nokia would do Lumia and put

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.910 
wish that Nokia would do Lumia and put
Google<00:04:35.630> Android<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.590> would<00:04:36.650> be<00:04:36.710> the

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
Google Android on it that would be the

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.100 
Google Android on it that would be the
best<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.520> both<00:04:37.580> worlds<00:04:37.760> because<00:04:38.750> this<00:04:38.930> is

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
best of both worlds because this is

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.770 
best of both worlds because this is
built<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:40.100> nicely<00:04:40.700> this<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:41.090> brilliant<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.750> love

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
the finish on it anyway this is the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.380 
the finish on it anyway this is the
interface<00:04:44.780> this<00:04:45.410> is<00:04:45.530> what<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.920> windows<00:04:46.400> told

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390
