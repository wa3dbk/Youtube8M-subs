00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.729
 roermond 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.419
 walking is not as easy with some people as with others 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.329
 if the rehabilitation doctor wants to know the way you walk 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.159
 could be improved 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.489
 he or she can choose to have a detour image analysis done 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 that happens when the fia rehabilitation in Delft 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
 the way you walk it is viewed very extensively 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.790
 the parents may of course simply be present at this investigation 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.940
 do the annelies while walking 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.490
 this is a special area but what the researchers can still do 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.410
 there is a computer in the room 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 a few cameras 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 the balloon bank 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 now that he has viewed the walkway we can start 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.440
 the research is being done on two people 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 the physical therapist and the movement technology 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.760
 the shoes can sock a book 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.340
 because he underwear we can clearly see the movement that your legs make 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.990
 first do a few exercises 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.990
 to see how much strength and your legs are visible 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 sometimes the exercises aren't that easy but that doesn't matter 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 we just want to see what is possible 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.820
 when the exercises are done 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.660
 you may lie down on the treatment couch 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.650
 the phystiotherapist moving holes in your legs 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.559
 you don't have to do anything 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.559
 here are actually looked at how agile you are 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:18.449
 the movement technology puts a device against your legs to be able to 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:20.479
 measure 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.119
 so you can hips 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.119
 click here for an opportunity 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:32.439
 when we have finished measuring 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.439
 it's almost time to walk 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.230
 if the rehabilitation doctor also wants to know at what time the muscles in your legs 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.609
 Tighten 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.609
 first we have to stick some stickers on your legs 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.849
 we put a dot with a pencil on the place where the stickers are to be placed 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.519
 and we take it to the right 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.519
 so he doesn't get in the way 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.119
 at each point two stickers come with a push button 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:02.379
 cables click on it 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.379
 be connected to the computer via a blue cache 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.639
 we grab the cables and your legs 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.639
 so you can't trip over it 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.719
 the stickers and cables allow no pain 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.089
 now it's time to walk 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:25.089
 this kind of recorded with the video cameras 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.889
 one of the people walks with the camera 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.329
 the other is participating this year 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.329
 you walk in a straight line from one side to the other 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.849
 you can just walk like they always do barefoot 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.949
 so not extra neat not extra slow or fast 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.649
 we always make multiple recordings 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.649
 if you have to walk back and forth a few times 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.569
 if it is checked whether the recordings were successful 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.489
 the cables can be picked up a sticky one 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.449
 if you do your best, you earn a diploma in favorite color 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.449
 the stickers that we used kapoor then as a reminder 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.769
 then you wear shoes and if you have them, shape them 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.949
 With that, a couple of times you walk back and forth 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.900
 we also make video recordings of this 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.370
 the investigation is now ready 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.589
 soon we will watch the video images very well on the computer 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.780
 they can be nicely placed next to each other 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.069
 and compare it easily 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.529
 for example, we can see if you walk differently with bare shoes 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.180
 feet 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.290
 with all the things we have seen from you 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.300
 let's think about whether the way you walk can improve 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.550
 for example through physiotherapy 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.550
 special shoes 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.020
 ghosts 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.949
 or in other ways 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.099
 rehabilitation doctor will discuss the examination with you and you within a few weeks 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.099
 parents 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.889
 and you can go back to school or home now 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:37.779
 No
