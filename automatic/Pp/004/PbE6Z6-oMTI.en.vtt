moisturization before they going put all

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.880 
moisturization before they going put all
these<00:00:51.470> chemicals<00:00:51.530> running<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.650> first

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890

then you got to keep walking like across
look<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> few<00:03:00.240> intersections<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.020> go<00:03:01.170> up<00:03:01.349> the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
look a few intersections and go up the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.070 
look a few intersections and go up the
hill<00:03:01.530> over<00:03:01.980> there<00:03:02.099> Oh

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080
