00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.330
 the bad service of public transport 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.519
 it is increasingly evident in the city 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.830
 of peace has been expressed by some 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.030
 interviewed for mega news then 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.429
 that an accident was recorded 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.160
 vehicular that will involve a 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.380
 public transport indicate that the treatment 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.269
 of the drivers is rude they give wrong 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.400
 service and this seems to play in 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.650
 race tracks this has been a 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.160
 situation for passengers that obliges 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.259
 to not want to use this type of transport 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.320
 third parties take a long time apart 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.719
 all ugly already inside no longer serve or 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.680
 be seated one of the irons and 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.329
 apart demanding and badly not the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.340
 they attend and thanks give one 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.610
 when and when they are lowered and when 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.640
 one goes up on the pc very badly very badly 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.800
 example the next one that happened when 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.629
 will go up in the truck on the sidewalk ni 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.300
 that my lady feels exclusively 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.609
 if you are going to paste a several for the reason 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.860
 trucks the weighers because when one 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.620
 go up 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.130
 people feel many times they go with 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.130
 children 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.170
 at the junction of the streets revolution and 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.360
 September 16 in the heart of the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.400
 city this accident that sees 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.620
 on screen a transport driver 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.080
 public when going down the street revolution 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.700
 suffers an accident causing 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.700
 four vehicles were involved 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.910
 apparently it was due to mechanical failures 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.800
 place had to reach the bodies of 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.200
 ambulance to serve people 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.120
 who suffered blows and injuries a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.520
 female person had to be 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.070
 transferred to an institution of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.290
 health these accidents ensure the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.820
 transport and road management 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.070
 could be avoided if the same drivers 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.050
 of public transport will avoid 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.720
 distract yourself with the user and avoid 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.610
 speak on cell phone say that if it is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.570
 necessary drastic measures will be taken 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.330
 with them they should not continue talking 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.600
 neither distracting with so much with the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.450
 user and also who want to win the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.610
 passage to the other partners and 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.190
 equally in the same way also in 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.040
 occasions that they want to go talking about their 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.410
 cell phone and if there is the need and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.800
 is even withdrawing some 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.590
 units of this service and also of 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.620
 same way to disable drivers that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.870
 they are not considered suitable precisely for 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.810
 be able to drive this type of units what 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.430
 we will do although some users say no 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.030
 have problems with the service 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.000
 others do not think much the same education 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.099
 and stacey stand where you tell them 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.049
 but one must also be aware that 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.760
 you have to ask for the stop one block before 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.040
 where the block starts so they 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.889
 take precautions and be able to stop without 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.700
 that without an accident that gives me 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:58.799
 fear come but what a barbarian is not to me 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.450
 I'm afraid to get on trucks and 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.209
 then I ask you not to stop and go to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.549
 prepare until the other corner or not 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.230
 they do not go as it should be because it is a 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.870
 danger to me is a danger that they have 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.019
 playing career or are they winning road 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.629
 that is they go but with each other and then they 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.950
 they are screaming this accident is not the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.530
 unique that has been presented in the city 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.169
 of peace days before another unit also 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.849
 was involved in another incident the 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.730
 truck was manned by several 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.829
 users the front of the unit 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.280
 was impacted with this vehicle the 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.549
 unit was number 6 42 in the
