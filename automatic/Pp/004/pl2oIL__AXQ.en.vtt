00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.770
 several subscribers who asked me 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.869
 to reproduce on the cloud 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.430
 so that makeup that can be worn 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.599
 as many days as the two evenings 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.180
 is nice is that although the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.730
 technique is altogether classic at 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.870

 then a ball on the whole of the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.890
 mobile and fixed eyelid 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.500
 to find out more about the usefulness of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.790
 pikine base I suggest you customers 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.990

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.550
 the link to a video I made to 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.680
 this subject and in which I you 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.390
 also advise but varas prefer so 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.690
 the excited fort we will start the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.479
 makeup it's the far 397 but it's 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.930
 a lighthouse that is very bright rings 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.759
 lot and it's a kind of pages in the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 finished pearls and we will take a brush 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.450
 in round wood this one is the 305 of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.340
 at sedo d'alex and i'm just going 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.530
 to eradicate doing it all over the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.540
 eyelid moving up to the point and m 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.729
 the next step is to apply 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.590
 a lighthouse that colors cranberry 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.900
 there is cranberry de mac but a 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.049
 nice alternative is the fair fort 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.790
 here it's still called 352 a gloss 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.830
 and I'm going to look for a pay are in shape 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.509
 dome this one the personal definition of 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.240
 in birds and I'm coming this is 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.280
 clara flatter the vintage of the eye so the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.470
 portion where the eye baul 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.340
 they come together and that of 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.340
 semicircle movements 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.420
 sometimes I have small movements towards 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.890
 him to come connect the bottom it's up to 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.690
 the limit do but I like me more 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.040
 strong to describe degraded to the south 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.720
 in order to come a little deeper 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.690
 at the young floods they used the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.910
 lighthouse high which is right here in the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.370
 pallet is that it remains to indicate 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.350
 and kidnapped his two-year-old but 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.190
 this time, it's smaller 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.660
 the actress brush from mary kay and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.760
 Julian really focus on the corner 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.690
 externally directly in the raw like 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.000
 this then I'll take a little 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.519
 precision brush this one this is the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.640
 christ chico brooch and i take the 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.840
 color tolstoÃ¯ade here to start 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.700
 their incredible style and I'm going to 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.580
 forbid the outer corner by taking the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.260
 years at the youth tournament under zero and 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.620
 I do not forget a future connected to the corner 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.620
 external 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.910
 to finalize all I come to work 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.680
 under the eyebrow and I'll take the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.810
 bullet is lÃ¶rrach pro to come 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.380
 look for the sphere that right here it's 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.590
 the far light peak so it's a rose 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.920
 pink it's in pink may that is very 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.070
 talk about a little pale pink that's perfect to 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.600
 use only one element when we have the 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.730
 stays in the makeup that is pretty 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.640

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.500
 maybelline I find that they look like 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.930
 a lot to dog trainers like 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.330
 cheaply that's what I 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.110
 gives once the mascara applied to 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.110
 little one undermines 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.440
 I hope those who give and the voice 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.240

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.010
