00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello friends of 8,000 r closing the 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.750
 sequence of videos on the map page 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.340
 we will see the novelty of version 4.0 called 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.590
 multi maps 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.140
 these are a sequence of maps with 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.420
 different foci and are triggered by 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.940
 in the left center portion or 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.440
 right of the screen carrying the return on 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.440
 respectively. 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.430
 The first map called Triqui View is 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.859
 combination of the top view but the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.569
 profile of the land and serves to make 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.690
 an analysis of the importance we have 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:46.629
 front 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.909
 the second map called late saw us 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.699
 brings information about our goal 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.639
 this shows us planet ramps with 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.489
 nursery and used basis ratio 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:01:03.129
 panes area to achieve the goal 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:07.299
 but the interesting part of this window is the 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.869
 distance from the height of 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.020
 arrival on the safety margin with 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.060
 a drop from 0 to arrival height on 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.060
 the safety margin with a kindergarten 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.670
 discipleship and arrival height 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.549
 on the ground the third map called 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.530
 next space makes analysis of distances 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.710
 between the aircraft and airspace 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.329
 conditioned 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.700
 it is possible to click on the 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.789
 airspace en route to get larger 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.789
 information 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.939
 the fourth map called visual guide is a 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.869
 very interesting tool for the 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.570
 advances in cross country flights 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.399
 it makes an automatic selection of the 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.229
 possible arrival points to our 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.350
 front 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.569
 the horizontal line shows us the arrival 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.830
 with height in 0 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:10.840
 the vertical line to our bow in this case 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.890
 we have the hero of the game of bruno 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.380
 in the ti is to our left and 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.550
 we can reach him 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.460
 with approximately 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.610
 210 meters high over the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.690
 to make this our 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.360
 goal 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:34.030
 just click for an instant on top 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:40.230
 the box with the name of the bridge and after 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:45.820
 we should click go to the fifth window 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.260
 radar only when we have integrated the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.260
 cast 8 thousand 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:55.080
 the equipment called flare this allows 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.300
 on our colleagues' flights 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.300
 demonstrating flight position and condition 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.010
 the commands on the ultimatum window if 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.400
 similarly maintained when the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.770
 maps by clicking on the bottom of the nodes 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.590
 one in the upper part in the 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.600
 we zoomed in 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.959
 there is still the possibility of 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.950
 adjust the size of the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:31.959
 map 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:36.370
 clicking and dragging I can increase up to 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:44.470
 become the only site the view or can 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:47.709
 decrease until only the map remains 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.590
 so I have a map with the terrain 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.330
 The second and last season I have a map 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:59.650
 only with the topology beyond this 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.840
 adjustment of the areas of 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.170
 information 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:09.400
 we still have the possibility of 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:14.950
 use the submenu tools 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:19.930
 display that allows us to activate or 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:24.180
 disable oi points topology terrain 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.610
 airspace or text overlays 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.760
 the adjustments made using vanishing 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.200
 display are not necessary 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.350
 perform again 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.800
 next time and you enter the place and 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.800
 Sunday 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.450
 I imagine you're a little stunned. 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.180
 with the amount of information 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.820
 page we will see in the videos of 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.670
 configurations that all this infinity 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.280
 information can be summarized 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.070
 only to maps of interest making 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.460
 it becomes much easier to use 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.950
 simply turn on and off the fly 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.680
 next video, we will see the 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.360
 numerical data and the interpretation of 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.900
 any of these values 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.900
 until then
