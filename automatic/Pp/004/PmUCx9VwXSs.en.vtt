00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
this is really sort of by eye I want a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.240 
this is really sort of by eye I want a
good<00:02:20.970> layer<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.230> material<00:02:22.800> down<00:02:22.980> there

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
good layer of this material down there

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.770 
good layer of this material down there
and<00:02:23.400> I'm<00:02:23.850> basically<00:02:24.180> gonna<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.420> shallow

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and I'm basically gonna be shallow

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and I'm basically gonna be shallow
frying<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:27.630> really<00:02:27.959> should<00:02:28.470> come<00:02:28.650> out<00:02:28.680> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
frying this it really should come out to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.580 
frying this it really should come out to
the<00:02:28.980> edges<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> pan<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.260> little<00:02:31.470> bit

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the edges of the pan and a little bit

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.100 
the edges of the pan and a little bit
more<00:02:32.600> there<00:02:33.600> we<00:02:33.660> go

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
more there we go

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.070 
more there we go
I<00:02:34.140> am<00:02:34.380> also<00:02:39.380> three<00:02:40.380> tablespoons<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.250> butter

I am also three tablespoons or so butter
this<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.739> really<00:02:44.360> give<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.450> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
this is just to really give it that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.170 
this is just to really give it that
extra<00:02:45.660> little<00:02:46.110> golden<00:02:46.500> color<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:47.040> flavor<00:02:47.180> so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
extra little golden color and flavor so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.600 
extra little golden color and flavor so
we're<00:02:48.300> gonna<00:02:48.390> let<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.780> melt<00:02:49.140> I'm<00:02:49.890> using<00:02:50.280> high

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
we're gonna let that melt I'm using high

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.539 
we're gonna let that melt I'm using high
heat<00:02:50.910> because<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.330> have<00:02:51.690> gas<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:53.310> as

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
heat because I have gas and it's not as

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.310 
heat because I have gas and it's not as
it's<00:02:54.269> just<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.750> as<00:02:55.430> as<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:57.510> hot<00:02:57.720> as<00:02:57.900> electric

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
it's just not as as it's hot as electric

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.610 
it's just not as as it's hot as electric
if<00:02:58.830> you're<00:02:59.010> using<00:02:59.160> an<00:02:59.370> electric<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.230> would

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
if you're using an electric so I would

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.229 
if you're using an electric so I would
definitely<00:03:01.709> do<00:03:02.100> like<00:03:02.130> maybe<00:03:02.519> medium-high

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
definitely do like maybe medium-high

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:03.590 
definitely do like maybe medium-high
heat

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
heat

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.750 
heat
something<00:03:04.140> like<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.320> okay<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.670> gonna

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
something like that okay this is gonna

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.250 
something like that okay this is gonna
heat<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.420> then<00:03:06.570> we're<00:03:06.720> going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.930> start

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
heat up and then we're going to start

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.560 
heat up and then we're going to start
coating<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.370> fish<00:03:08.610> pieces<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.269> we're<00:03:09.420> gonna

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
coating on fish pieces and we're gonna

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.280 
coating on fish pieces and we're gonna
put<00:03:10.230> them<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.470> pan<00:03:11.540> all<00:03:12.540> right<00:03:12.720> as<00:03:12.930> we<00:03:13.080> take

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
put them in the pan all right as we take

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.650 
put them in the pan all right as we take
these<00:03:13.470> fish<00:03:13.739> pieces<00:03:13.950> out

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
these fish pieces out

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.720 
these fish pieces out
make<00:03:15.960> sure<00:03:16.140> there's<00:03:16.320> good<00:03:16.400> coating<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.550> them

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
make sure there's good coating on them

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.380 
make sure there's good coating on them
of<00:03:17.850> egg-drop<00:03:18.060> them<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.900> here<00:03:20.090> give<00:03:21.090> them<00:03:21.270> a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
of egg-drop them in here give them a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.240 
of egg-drop them in here give them a
nice<00:03:21.630> spreading<00:03:22.440> turn<00:03:22.680> them<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.920> couple<00:03:23.130> of

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
nice spreading turn them a couple of

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.960 
nice spreading turn them a couple of
times

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
times

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.920 
times
pick<00:03:24.450> them<00:03:24.600> up<00:03:24.690> shake<00:03:25.260> off<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.620> excess<00:03:26.810> lay<00:03:27.810> it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
pick them up shake off the excess lay it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:40.910 
pick them up shake off the excess lay it
right<00:03:27.960> into<00:03:28.200> your<00:03:28.350> pan<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.070> repeat

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.870 

definitely<00:03:41.920> better<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.250> do<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.490> in<00:03:42.670> batches

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
definitely better to do this in batches

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.270 
definitely better to do this in batches
so<00:03:43.330> I've<00:03:43.960> got<00:03:44.080> about<00:03:44.170> half<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.740> pieces<00:03:44.950> in

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
so I've got about half the pieces in

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.310 
so I've got about half the pieces in
here<00:03:45.490> right<00:03:45.670> now<00:03:45.700> they're<00:03:46.570> frying<00:03:46.840> up<00:03:47.080> nicely

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
here right now they're frying up nicely

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.410 
here right now they're frying up nicely
and<00:03:47.710> really<00:03:48.580> don't<00:03:48.670> want<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.910> crowd<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.210> pan

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
and really don't want to crowd the pan

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.690 
and really don't want to crowd the pan
so<00:03:50.200> we're<00:03:50.410> gonna<00:03:50.500> do<00:03:50.680> these<00:03:50.830> so<00:03:51.130> let's<00:03:51.460> say

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
so we're gonna do these so let's say

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.910 
so we're gonna do these so let's say
three<00:03:52.450> four<00:03:52.480> minutes<00:03:52.780> aside<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.710> then<00:03:53.800> we'll

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
three four minutes aside and then we'll

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.310 
three four minutes aside and then we'll
kind<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.160> check<00:03:54.400> them<00:03:54.520> for<00:03:54.700> doneness<00:03:55.140> we<00:03:56.140> want

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
kind of check them for doneness we want

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.260 
kind of check them for doneness we want
a<00:03:56.350> nice<00:03:56.500> golden<00:03:56.710> brown<00:03:56.890> color<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:58.030> we<00:03:58.090> want

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
a nice golden brown color and we want

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.430 
a nice golden brown color and we want
them<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.450> feel<00:03:58.660> sort<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.260> firm<00:03:59.560> a<00:04:01.260> lot<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.350> make

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
them to feel sort of firm a lot of make

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.350 
them to feel sort of firm a lot of make
clear<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:02.710> I<00:04:03.010> have<00:04:03.220> now<00:04:03.460> turned<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.180> heat

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
clear that I have now turned the heat

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.350 
clear that I have now turned the heat
down<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.690> low<00:04:05.520> since<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.670> temperature<00:04:07.150> is

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
down to low since the temperature is

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.710 
down to low since the temperature is
already<00:04:07.600> pretty<00:04:08.020> hot<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.710> don't<00:04:09.340> want<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:10.300> keep

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
already pretty hot I don't want to keep

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.390
