single note and also burning notes and
they<00:00:54.690> start<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.379> Row<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.000> row

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.630 

there<00:01:03.540> it<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:04.520> and<00:01:05.520> then<00:01:06.390> three<00:01:07.140> draw<00:01:07.640> half

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
there it is and then three draw half

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:35.210 
there it is and then three draw half
step<00:01:09.860> it's<00:01:17.690> for<00:01:18.690> blow<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> next<00:01:34.200> segment<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
step it's for blow the next segment you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
step it's for blow the next segment you
start<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.600> draw<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.470> three<00:01:38.250> draw<00:01:39.350> then

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
start with to draw and three draw then

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:50.300 
start with to draw and three draw then
half<00:01:40.830> step<00:01:41.160> again<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:46.320> draw<00:01:46.970> band<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:50.190> have

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
half step again for draw band you have

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:15.530 
half step again for draw band you have
four<00:01:50.580> draw<00:01:50.820> here<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:03.500> four<00:02:04.500> blow<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:14.550> then

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
four draw here and four blow and then

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.980 
four draw here and four blow and then
back<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.319> first<00:02:16.530> figure<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.880> draw<00:02:18.180> three

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
back to the first figure to draw three

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.170 
back to the first figure to draw three
draw<00:02:20.480> band<00:02:21.480> half<00:02:21.870> step<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.830> four<00:02:23.100> blow

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.410 

and<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:27.300> finish<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:28.400> three<00:02:29.400> draw<00:02:29.730> half

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and then finish with three draw half

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:50.080 
and then finish with three draw half
step<00:02:31.260> better<00:02:31.560> together<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> more

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
step better together and to have a more

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.630 
step better together and to have a more
richer<00:02:51.090> sound<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:54.830> instead<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.220> to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
richer sound you can instead of just to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.949 
richer sound you can instead of just to
draw<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.240> can<00:02:57.420> play<00:02:57.690> one<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.860> draw<00:02:59.959> in

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
draw you can play one and the to draw in

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.510 
draw you can play one and the to draw in
the<00:03:01.080> first<00:03:01.349> segment<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:03.200> yeah

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
the first segment and yeah

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:56.210 
the first segment and yeah
and<00:03:06.520> then<00:03:06.760> three<00:03:07.180> four<00:03:07.540> three<00:03:08.380> three<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.370> four

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.580 

next<00:03:57.220> up<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.820> developed<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:59.170> research

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
next up to developed the research

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.320 
next up to developed the research
further<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.560> instead<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.620> playing<00:04:03.330> three

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
further is to instead of playing three

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:11.820 
further is to instead of playing three
draw<00:04:05.700> than<00:04:06.700> half<00:04:07.030> that<00:04:09.690> we<00:04:10.690> play<00:04:10.960> three<00:04:11.560> and

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
draw than half that we play three and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:26.580 
draw than half that we play three and
four<00:04:12.160> draw<00:04:23.040> it's<00:04:24.040> difficult<00:04:25.140> especially<00:04:26.140> when

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
four draw it's difficult especially when

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:44.520 
four draw it's difficult especially when
the<00:04:26.710> fingers<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:29.290> three<00:04:29.500> or<00:04:43.230> something<00:04:44.230> like

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
the fingers so three or something like

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.720 
the fingers so three or something like
that<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:45.360> then<00:04:46.360> instead<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.140> paying<00:04:47.320> for<00:04:48.220> draw

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
that and then instead of paying for draw

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.379 
that and then instead of paying for draw
band<00:04:49.110> okay

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:17.149 

we<00:04:54.389> pay<00:04:54.659> four<00:04:55.409> and<00:04:55.770> five

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:21.439 

it<00:05:17.939> is<00:05:18.149> that<00:05:18.389> four<00:05:18.869> and<00:05:18.899> five
