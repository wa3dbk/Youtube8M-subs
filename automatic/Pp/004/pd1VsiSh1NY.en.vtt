baffles<00:00:38.399> or<00:00:38.550> anything<00:00:38.879> inside<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
baffles or anything inside it's just a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.740 
baffles or anything inside it's just a
straight<00:00:39.870> pipe<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:41.300> it's<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> two-stroke

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
straight pipe which it's a two-stroke

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.260 
straight pipe which it's a two-stroke
engine<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.530> doesn't<00:00:44.219> make<00:00:44.280> any<00:00:44.340> sense<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
engine it doesn't make any sense so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
engine it doesn't make any sense so
that's<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> change<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.160> then

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that's going to have to change and then

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.799 
that's going to have to change and then
I<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.760> everything<00:00:51.300> else<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.750> I'm
