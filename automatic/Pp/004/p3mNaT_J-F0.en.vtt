the United States right so overall can

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279

you<00:00:29.189> generally<00:00:29.820> say<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.840> seeing<00:00:31.050> or

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you generally say what we're seeing or

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.530 
you generally say what we're seeing or
is<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:31.949> different<00:00:32.820> from<00:00:33.120> region<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
is it really different from region to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.930 
is it really different from region to
region<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:34.110> we're<00:00:34.260> seeing<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.670> some

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
region what we're seeing there are some

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.190 
region what we're seeing there are some
similarities<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> end

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
similarities but I think in the end

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860 
similarities but I think in the end
there<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.680> definitely<00:00:38.280> differences<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.329> think

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
there are definitely differences I think

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.470 
there are definitely differences I think
when<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.230> look<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.590> today's<00:00:41.010> beauty<00:00:41.610> we're

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
when we look at today's beauty we're

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.330 
when we look at today's beauty we're
starting<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.989> incorporate<00:00:43.110> other<00:00:43.860> things

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
starting to incorporate other things

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.369 
starting to incorporate other things
from<00:00:44.610> other<00:00:44.760> cultures<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:45.840> becoming

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
from other cultures that are becoming

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
from other cultures that are becoming
kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.190> somewhat<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> standard<00:00:48.300> so

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
kind of a somewhat of a standard so

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.000 
kind of a somewhat of a standard so
we're<00:00:48.570> seeing<00:00:48.750> some<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.710> South

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
we're seeing some of the the South

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
we're seeing some of the the South
American<00:00:50.460> influence<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> United<00:00:51.300> States

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
American influence the United States

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
American influence the United States
some<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> Asian<00:00:52.410> influences<00:00:52.980> back<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
some of the Asian influences back and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.010 
some of the Asian influences back and
forth<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> still<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.840> they're<00:00:54.989> very

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
forth but I still think they're very

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.529 
forth but I still think they're very
distinct<00:00:56.010> roles<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> beauty<00:00:57.059> okay<00:00:57.360> let's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
distinct roles of beauty okay let's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.779 
distinct roles of beauty okay let's
start<00:00:57.719> first<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.050> Asia<00:00:58.350> there's<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.280> plastic

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
start first with Asia there's a plastic

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
start first with Asia there's a plastic
surgery<00:01:00.120> sort<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> crazed<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.829> on

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
surgery sort of crazed that's going on

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
surgery sort of crazed that's going on
in<00:01:02.399> South<00:01:02.699> Korea<00:01:03.120> tell<00:01:03.420> me<00:01:03.510> about<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.840> well

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
in South Korea tell me about this well

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
in South Korea tell me about this well
it's<00:01:04.409> funny<00:01:04.650> they're<00:01:04.979> trying<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:06.030> it's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it's funny they're trying I think it's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
it's funny they're trying I think it's
more<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.600> some<00:01:07.229> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.530> pop<00:01:07.740> culture

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
more of some kind of pop culture

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.590 
more of some kind of pop culture
phenomenon<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.390> they're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
phenomenon that's going on they're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.149 
phenomenon that's going on they're
trying<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> Western<00:01:10.799> look

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
trying to have more of a Western look

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
trying to have more of a Western look
especially<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> face<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.479> something

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
especially in the face it's something

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
especially in the face it's something
called<00:01:12.930> kpop<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.340> terribly<00:01:14.670> familiar

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
called kpop I'm not terribly familiar

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
called kpop I'm not terribly familiar
with<00:01:15.180> what's<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.320> it's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
with what's going on but I think it's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.100 
with what's going on but I think it's
become<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> cultural<00:01:17.220> phenomenon<00:01:17.659> one<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.840> five

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
become a cultural phenomenon one in five

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.690 
become a cultural phenomenon one in five
women<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.650> South<00:01:19.830> Korea<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.250> having<00:01:20.520> plastic

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
women in South Korea are having plastic

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.910 
women in South Korea are having plastic
surgery<00:01:20.939> versus<00:01:21.689> yeah<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> United<00:01:22.680> States

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
surgery versus yeah the United States

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
surgery versus yeah the United States
which<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.250> normally<00:01:23.790> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.570> center

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
which is normally kind of the the center

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.609 
which is normally kind of the the center
of<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.640> one<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.790> 20<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.409> also

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
of that is one in 20 so what you also

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
of that is one in 20 so what you also
see<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.400> think<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.729> showed<00:01:29.880> some<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
see and I think we showed some of the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
see and I think we showed some of the
pictures<00:01:30.509> there's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.229> calf<00:01:31.920> reduction<00:01:32.790> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
pictures there's a calf reduction is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
pictures there's a calf reduction is
what<00:01:33.210> they're<00:01:33.360> trying<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.780> okay<00:01:34.110> yeah<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
what they're trying to do okay yeah and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.800 
what they're trying to do okay yeah and
traditionally<00:01:35.369> Asians<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> thicker

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
traditionally Asians have a thicker

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.020 
traditionally Asians have a thicker
muscle<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.189> area<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.909> not

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
muscle in that area so it's not

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
muscle in that area so it's not
necessarily<00:01:39.110> fat<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.070> fat<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> do

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
necessarily fat if it is fat you can do

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
muscle down which i think is a very

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.690 
muscle down which i think is a very
dangerous<00:01:54.360> technique<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.560> uh<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
dangerous technique so uh we don't do it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.800 
dangerous technique so uh we don't do it
here<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.939> United<00:01:57.240> States<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.659> it's

seeing I guess that's still a popular
procedure<00:02:13.150> for<00:02:13.690> people<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.230> know<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.950> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
procedure for people you know it is and

procedure for people you know it is and
especially<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.670> South<00:02:15.879> American<00:02:16.239> countries

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
especially in South American countries

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720 
especially in South American countries

in Europe cellulites a natural

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.039 
in Europe cellulites a natural
phenomenon<00:03:14.200> just<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.920> way<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.220> skin<00:03:15.639> is

back<00:03:43.959> there's<00:03:44.440> actually<00:03:44.769> something<00:03:44.980> we<00:03:45.190> have

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
back there's actually something we have

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.949 
back there's actually something we have
in<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> United<00:03:45.790> States<00:03:45.819> called<00:03:46.209> cellulase

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
in the United States called cellulase

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.500 
in the United States called cellulase
which<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.500> yeah<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:48.549> a<00:03:48.700> laser<00:03:49.060> based

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
which is yeah it's a laser based

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.020 
which is yeah it's a laser based
technology<00:03:50.350> that's<00:03:50.560> both<00:03:50.850> liposuction<00:03:51.850> for

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
technology that's both liposuction for

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.460 
technology that's both liposuction for
the<00:03:52.090> areas<00:03:52.389> that<00:03:52.420> are<00:03:52.599> full<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.049> there's<00:03:53.260> kind

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
the areas that are full but there's kind

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.449 
the areas that are full but there's kind
of<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.650> forked<00:03:54.099> little<00:03:54.489> laser<00:03:54.849> prong<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:55.959> cuts

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
of a forked little laser prong that cuts

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.860 
of a forked little laser prong that cuts
internally<00:03:57.459> those<00:03:57.760> little<00:03:58.120> connections<00:03:58.690> that

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
internally those little connections that

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.690 
internally those little connections that
cause<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.440> outside<00:04:00.160> appearance<00:04:00.280> of

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
cause the outside appearance of

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.849 
cause the outside appearance of
cellulite<00:04:00.970> on<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.329> outer<00:04:01.480> thigh<00:04:01.810> or<00:04:02.139> rear<00:04:02.650> end

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
cellulite on the outer thigh or rear end

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.259 
cellulite on the outer thigh or rear end
and<00:04:03.099> so<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:03.459> actually<00:04:03.639> go<00:04:03.910> in<00:04:04.030> there<00:04:04.180> and

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
and so you can actually go in there and

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.940 
and so you can actually go in there and
cut<00:04:04.540> those<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.410> see<00:04:05.560> even<00:04:05.680> in<00:04:05.859> the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
cut those you can see even in the

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.920 
cut those you can see even in the
segment<00:04:06.220> here<00:04:06.489> as<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:06.730> cuts<00:04:06.940> through<00:04:07.090> that

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
segment here as it cuts through that

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.900 
segment here as it cuts through that
releases<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.130> changes<00:04:09.730> that

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
releases it and that changes that

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.789 
releases it and that changes that
external<00:04:10.329> appearance<00:04:10.989> it's<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.560> very

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
external appearance it's a very

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.409 
external appearance it's a very
technically<00:04:12.280> challenging<00:04:12.849> procedure<00:04:13.030> in

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
technically challenging procedure in

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.900 
technically challenging procedure in
terms<00:04:13.599> of<00:04:13.720> very<00:04:13.930> time<00:04:14.230> consuming<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.609> some

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
terms of very time consuming but in some

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.460 
terms of very time consuming but in some
of<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.090> initial<00:04:16.479> studies<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:16.930> reports<00:04:17.049> have

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
of the initial studies and reports have

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.899 
of the initial studies and reports have
actually<00:04:17.769> showed<00:04:17.950> good<00:04:18.130> results<00:04:18.609> with<00:04:18.640> that

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
actually showed good results with that

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.569 
actually showed good results with that
part<00:04:19.419> it's<00:04:19.840> like<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.650> liposuction<00:04:21.130> procedure

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
part it's like a liposuction procedure

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.610 
part it's like a liposuction procedure
so<00:04:21.820> you're<00:04:21.909> doing<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.300> under

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
so you're doing it under

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.590 
so you're doing it under
either<00:04:22.860> general<00:04:23.430> or<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.699> local<00:04:24.060> anesthetic

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
either general or a local anesthetic

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.510 
either general or a local anesthetic
with<00:04:25.020> sedation<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:25.949> not<00:04:26.040> something<00:04:26.250> you

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
with sedation so it's not something you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.890 
with sedation so it's not something you
just<00:04:26.550> kind<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:26.940> come<00:04:27.180> in<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.510> have<00:04:27.660> done
