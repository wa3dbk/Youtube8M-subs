00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.770 
which is what I did this is a very safe
way<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:28.100> be<00:04:29.100> sort<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.580> an<00:04:29.700> undercover<00:04:30.240> doll

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
way to be sort of an undercover doll

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.490 
way to be sort of an undercover doll
person<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:32.400> maybe<00:04:32.670> this<00:04:32.880> makes<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.450> not<00:04:33.840> okay

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
person and maybe this makes it not okay

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.220 
person and maybe this makes it not okay
cuz<00:04:34.920> it's<00:04:35.100> still<00:04:35.460> absolutely<00:04:36.270> not<00:04:36.420> okay<00:04:36.720> but

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
cuz it's still absolutely not okay but

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.010 
cuz it's still absolutely not okay but
it<00:04:37.320> just<00:04:37.440> takes<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.800> lateral<00:04:38.430> move<00:04:39.020> welcome

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
it just takes a lateral move welcome

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:47.370 
it just takes a lateral move welcome
back<00:04:40.170> to<00:04:40.350> just<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.740> tips

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:56.790
