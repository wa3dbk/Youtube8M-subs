00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.800
 of all one of the most important elements 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.960
 doll furniture are magnetic 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.390
 locks here look how they work 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.230
 the door is open and the door leaves 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.300
 closed and does not open itself because 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.879
 what is holding her magnetic locks 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.090
 but all you can do this 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.449
 magnetic lock you can learn with 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.530
 of this video to make 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.920
 magnetic closure 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.520
 we will need a sheet magnet here 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.120
 such 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.370
 where to get it souvenir manufacturers 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.579
 products often use it in 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.180
 items of coin on the fridge for example 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.850
 we still have such a company in Ukraine 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.180
 which produces yogurt often 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.970
 arrange stocks to buy yogurt a 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.050
 gift you can get coins souvenir on 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 refrigerator for example bow silent and here from 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.330
 this souvenir i will show you how to make 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.780
 magnetic lock we still need 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:25.360
 ruler scissors 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:28.390
 glue stick cardboard i will do 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.880
 magnetic lock on the cabinet to Claudine Wolfe 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.690
 how to make the ear itself click on 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.750
 picture and watch the video first 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.789
 need to remove glossy paper from this 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.890
 souvenir 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:46.360
 if you don't do that, then glue is bad 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.729
 glue the magnet and mark it up 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.729
 mid they and cut in half 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.100
 now you need to combine the two halves 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.820
 the monito magnet has a north pole and 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.640
 the south pole of lipolysis is the same then 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.849
 coins repel each other 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.709
 if the poles are different then attract 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.250
 so we need to place two 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:24.940
 halves of magnets so that they are straight 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:27.220
 do not telis among themselves further draw and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:34.900
 cut out the shape that we need 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:37.360
 for the future magnetic lock and 1 part 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.049
 glue on the basis of the product 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:48.160
 and the other on the door and now for an example 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:51.489
 make a magnetic lock on the cabinet take 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.660
 print the lock pasted on a thin cardboard 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.660
 and cut out 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.230
 then you need to pick the same thickness 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:11.970
 cardboard how thick our magnets are 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:15.920
 An example further we surround our castle on this 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.920
 cardboard and cut out 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.320
 then bend this detail in half and 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.320
 glue 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.459
 when the glue is dry glue this cardboard on 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.459
 our castle 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.150
 now it remains to stick a magnet and 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.690
 adjust the lock monitor to the middle 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:02.210
 the castle 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:10.120
 like this, draw around the pen and cut out right away 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:10.120
 two money that's what should happen 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.140
 then glue the magnets on the lock 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.610
 magnetic lock ready 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:46.250
 it remains to glue it to the cabinet and 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:52.129
 wait until the glue dries all 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.370
 works fine so these magnetic 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.000
 locks you can use not only 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.229
 Ukraine furniture 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.120
 but other products are well on business and and 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.120
 to new meetings in the following videos
