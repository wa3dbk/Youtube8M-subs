thermal<00:02:19.140> expansion<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:20.100> think<00:02:21.090> magic<00:02:21.630> bees

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
thermal expansion I think magic bees

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.920 
thermal expansion I think magic bees
just<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.710> handful<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.130> other<00:02:23.310> mods<00:02:23.580> m<00:02:23.940> ffs<00:02:24.420> that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
two for testing and then once they're

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.730
