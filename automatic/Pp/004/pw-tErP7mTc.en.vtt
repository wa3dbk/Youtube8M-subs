00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
fixture obviously it was it was a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.050

lancelin<00:02:01.920> surface<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.400> get<00:02:02.520> back<00:02:02.700> into<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
lancelin surface to get back into it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.420 
lancelin surface to get back into it
twice<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.170> when<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> came<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.980> was<00:02:05.130> starting

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
twice and when I came on I was starting

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.230 
twice and when I came on I was starting
to<00:02:05.550> open<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.150> I've<00:02:06.570> always<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.230> top<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
to open up and I've always on top and it

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.760 
to open up and I've always on top and it
was<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> good<00:02:09.899> game<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> come<00:02:10.350> into<00:02:10.500> obviously

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
was a good game to come into obviously

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.460 
was a good game to come into obviously
we<00:02:11.130> scored<00:02:12.000> against<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.840> make<00:02:12.990> him<00:02:13.110> free<00:02:13.320> to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we scored against it to make him free to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.980 
we scored against it to make him free to
which<00:02:14.030> was<00:02:15.030> good<00:02:15.210> time<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.630> after<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.870> I

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
which was good time and after that I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.510 
which was good time and after that I
think<00:02:16.050> we<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.590> dominated<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.370> our<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:20.280> should

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
think we we dominated and our we should

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.580 
think we we dominated and our we should
have<00:02:20.640> scored<00:02:20.880> again<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> was<00:02:21.450> obviously<00:02:22.290> at<00:02:22.470> the
