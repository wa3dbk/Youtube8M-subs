00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.680
 good guys today I bring you 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.950
 a super easy recipe economically and very 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.170
 rich what I'm going to show you 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.160
 ingredients first of all let's go to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.810
 need chicken that this chicken that I 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.390
 I have here 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.300
 this crazy and crazy and just a little 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.710
 which is a medium term because 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 because I do not like to put it raw and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 worship then so do I get you 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.720
 what can be raw we are also going to 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 need crushed corn flakes 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.530
 we are going to do this so that a 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.280
 little more 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:02.120
 I forget ok so are the corn floors 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 normal without sugar are these 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.130
 and that you can use another brand 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.690
 but that do not contain sugar 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.940
 ok we also occupy 2 eggs 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:19.390
 flour and this is what I am and 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.370
 right now when we're also going to need 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.370
 a little pepper salt 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.390
 garlic ground ok onion ground too 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.750
 and let's start with the recipe 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.170
 well now here we have our flour 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.450
 to this we are going to add 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.259
 Pepper 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.100
 and we will also add a little 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.100
 of garlic salt 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.580
 and we are going to add salt 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.390
 and then let's mix well 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.390
 become old 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.749
 what 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.400
 so many 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:26.049
 our chicken and I when I put it on 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:30.430
 He put salt on a piece of onion and 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:33.180
 a garlic as I told you to leave 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.470
 average chicken or if you like 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.410
 use it raw if it is well commented 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.340
 that since all this was going to 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.340
 mix the eggs 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.709
 and you have the figure so much better 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.160
 but not because it can be commented better 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.299
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.890
 since it 's like this we're going to take our 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.190
 piece of chicken 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.610
 and with the whole foot we're going to put it in the 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.610
 flour 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.310
 because the 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.239
 that covers well 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.080
 get after we're going to go through the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.080
 egg 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.159
 ah 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.040
 and finally we are going to put it in the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.470
 leaflets 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.220
 and we are not going to put peoples over 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.320
 for 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.500
 that these are foreseen by seeing our 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.500
 chicken 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.740
 let's push a little 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.740
 esteban well 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.959
 5 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.069
 and after that we're going to put it in a 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.069
 fret separately all the pieces 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.680
 and good now in a pan and let's 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.470
 put let's put it to heat already and you 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.160
 let's put enough oil as 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.700
 to put our chicken pieces 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.820
 now let's take the piece of chicken and 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.470
 we are going to put it 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.470
 with hot oil 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.659
 we have done a piece 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.770
 and if we put the piece more 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.699
 let's wait for this to be ready 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.300
 and we will continue stopping sites in your 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.300

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.380
 good that is the chicken I put it in 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.920
 this plate with some napkins so that 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.370
 the oil is absolved but this is how 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.370
 remains 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.890
 and what 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.750
 It is quite golden and good I hope
