00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
each trip has a name but we don't really

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
each trip has a name but we don't really
care<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> name<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.729> care<00:01:11.970> about<00:01:12.000> is

care about the name all we care about is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.649 
care about the name all we care about is
the<00:01:12.510> color<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.710> number<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:15.030> six

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the color and the number there are six

the color and the number there are six
different<00:01:15.810> colors<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> numbers<00:01:16.920> go<00:01:17.070> from

different colors and the numbers go from
1<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.640> 10<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.240> players<00:01:19.200> will<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.590> doing

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
1 to 10 and so players will be doing

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.179 
1 to 10 and so players will be doing
their<00:01:20.280> best<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:21.299> control<00:01:22.259> each<00:01:22.500> flag<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
way you do that is on your turn you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800 
way you do that is on your turn you
simply<00:01:25.770> play<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> card<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> flag<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> then

simply play a card at a flag and then

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
simply play a card at a flag and then
you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.140> draw<00:01:28.380> another<00:01:28.770> troop<00:01:29.130> card<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.610> you

explain Technic cards in a bit let's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
explain Technic cards in a bit let's
just<00:01:35.970> deal<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.210> troop<00:01:36.600> cards<00:01:36.890> players<00:01:37.890> are

just deal with troop cards players are

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
just deal with troop cards players are
playing<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.490> troop<00:01:38.850> cards<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.450> both<00:01:39.810> sides

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
playing these troop cards on both sides

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
playing these troop cards on both sides
of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.640> flags<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.009> when<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.399> player<00:01:44.670> has

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
of the flags and when one player has

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600 
of the flags and when one player has
three<00:01:45.600> cards<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> flag<00:01:46.439> he<00:01:46.950> cannot<00:01:47.369> play

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
three cards and a flag he cannot play

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.770 
three cards and a flag he cannot play
any<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:48.210> flags<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.409> section<00:01:50.479> there<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
any more flags to that section there is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.920 
any more flags to that section there is
basically<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.430> order<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.540> play<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
basically the order of how you play the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.420 
basically the order of how you play the
cards<00:01:55.200> doesn't<00:01:55.500> matter<00:01:55.649> at<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.310> you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
cards doesn't matter at all so if you

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.450 
cards doesn't matter at all so if you
play<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:57.259> 10-9<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.710> an<00:01:58.799> 8<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.219> still

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
play a 10-9 and then an 8 that still

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
also do that let's say I put down three

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.530 
also do that let's say I put down three
cards<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.380> my<00:02:19.530> opponent<00:02:20.100> has<00:02:20.610> only<00:02:20.910> two<00:02:21.150> cards

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
cards and my opponent has only two cards

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.360 
cards and my opponent has only two cards
but<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:22.050> prove<00:02:22.320> using<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> other<00:02:22.920> cards<00:02:23.280> on

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
but I can prove using the other cards on

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.460 
but I can prove using the other cards on
the<00:02:23.430> table<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.210> there<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.600> no<00:02:24.900> possible<00:02:25.410> way

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the table that there is no possible way

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.570 
the table that there is no possible way
that<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.040> beat<00:02:26.220> me

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
that they can beat me

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.860 
that they can beat me
I<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:27.150> also<00:02:27.360> claim<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.230> flag<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:30.150> which

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
I can also claim that flag now which

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.410 
I can also claim that flag now which
cards<00:02:31.380> can<00:02:31.770> beat<00:02:32.010> which<00:02:32.280> cards<00:02:32.760> well<00:02:33.240> let's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
cards can beat which cards well let's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.680 
cards can beat which cards well let's
take<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.840> closer<00:02:34.260> look<00:02:34.440> at<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:35.540> first<00:02:36.540> of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
take a closer look at that now first of

goes up against the ten seven and a five
or<00:02:50.100> different<00:02:50.640> colors<00:02:51.000> they<00:02:51.540> don't<00:02:51.720> really

4 5 will be any host does it matter how

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.530 
4 5 will be any host does it matter how
high<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.590> host<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.280> if<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:39.030> happen<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.390> have

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
high the host is if you happen to have

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.350 
high the host is if you happen to have
two<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.590> these<00:03:41.160> going<00:03:41.760> up<00:03:41.910> against<00:03:42.120> each<00:03:42.239> other

two of these going up against each other

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.000 
two of these going up against each other
by<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.660> way<00:03:42.720> these<00:03:42.900> are<00:03:43.079> called<00:03:43.290> skirmish

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
by the way these are called skirmish

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.729 
by the way these are called skirmish
lines<00:03:44.360> then<00:03:45.360> obviously<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.170> higher<00:03:46.380> number

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
lines then obviously the higher number

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.170 
lines then obviously the higher number
will<00:03:46.890> win<00:03:47.040> 7<00:03:47.340> 6<00:03:47.549> 5<00:03:47.700> B<00:03:48.299> 2<00:03:48.510> 5<00:03:48.750> 4<00:03:49.200> 3<00:03:49.579> but<00:03:50.579> better<00:03:51.090> than

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
will win 7 6 5 B 2 5 4 3 but better than

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.900 
will win 7 6 5 B 2 5 4 3 but better than
that<00:03:51.360> is<00:03:51.989> simply<00:03:52.530> three<00:03:53.070> cards<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.880> same

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
that is simply three cards of the same

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.340 
that is simply three cards of the same
color<00:03:54.680> 2<00:03:55.680> 5<00:03:55.950> &amp;<00:03:56.190> 3<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.880> is<00:03:57.120> called<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.630> pataga<00:03:57.959> in

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
color 2 5 &amp; 3 this is called a pataga in

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.250 
color 2 5 &amp; 3 this is called a pataga in
order<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:59.040> will<00:03:59.250> beat<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.670> 765<00:04:00.450> however

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
order and that will beat the 765 however

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.160 
order and that will beat the 765 however
again<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:03.000> higher<00:04:03.209> number<00:04:03.570> beats<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.140> a

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
again the higher number beats it so a

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.170 
again the higher number beats it so a
10-8<00:04:04.620> 4<00:04:04.890> will<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.640> 2<00:04:05.790> 3<00:04:06.060> 5<00:04:06.299> 2<00:04:07.670> better<00:04:08.670> than<00:04:08.970> that

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
10-8 4 will be 2 3 5 2 better than that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.840 
10-8 4 will be 2 3 5 2 better than that
though<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.720> three<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.709> kind<00:04:10.739> three<00:04:11.549> numbers

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
though is three of a kind three numbers

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.080 
though is three of a kind three numbers
that<00:04:11.880> are<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.269> same<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:13.320> we<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.739> 6<00:04:14.430> 6<00:04:14.640> 6<00:04:14.820> here

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
that are the same so we have 6 6 6 here

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.420 
that are the same so we have 6 6 6 here
beats<00:04:15.480> 3<00:04:15.900> cards<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.380> same<00:04:16.410> color<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:17.280> would

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
beats 3 cards of the same color it would

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.840 
beats 3 cards of the same color it would
also<00:04:17.579> be<00:04:17.940> as<00:04:18.120> we<00:04:18.690> continue<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.229> say<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.620> 1<00:04:20.400> 1<00:04:20.609> 1

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
also be as we continue to say a 1 1 1

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.110 
also be as we continue to say a 1 1 1
because<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.959> higher<00:04:22.169> numbers<00:04:22.560> win<00:04:23.000> but<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
because the higher numbers win but the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.089 
because the higher numbers win but the
highest<00:04:24.479> thing<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.780> all<00:04:24.900> which<00:04:25.530> beats<00:04:25.890> the

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
highest thing of all which beats the

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.750 
highest thing of all which beats the
phalanx<00:04:26.520> which

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
phalanx which

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.480 
phalanx which
just<00:04:27.000> saw<00:04:27.180> is<00:04:27.530> three<00:04:28.530> cards<00:04:28.950> of<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.250> same

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
just saw is three cards of the same

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.600 
just saw is three cards of the same
color<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.600> numeric<00:04:30.780> order<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:32.010> five<00:04:32.340> six

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
color and a numeric order the five six

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.370 
color and a numeric order the five six
seven<00:04:32.970> here<00:04:33.180> on<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.780> one<00:04:33.960> side<00:04:34.140> this<00:04:34.320> is

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
seven here on the one side this is

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.040 
seven here on the one side this is
called<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.740> wedge<00:04:34.980> will<00:04:35.700> beat<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.000> phalanx<00:04:36.450> but

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
called a wedge will beat the phalanx but

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.990 
called a wedge will beat the phalanx but
then<00:04:37.200> again<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:38.340> have<00:04:38.430> done<00:04:38.580> this<00:04:38.850> is<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
then again you have done this is the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.490 
then again you have done this is the
highest<00:04:39.180> combination<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.930> possibly<00:04:40.290> have<00:04:40.470> in

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
highest combination you possibly have in

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500 
highest combination you possibly have in
the<00:04:40.650> game<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.010> that's<00:04:41.520> an<00:04:41.700> eight<00:04:41.820> nine<00:04:42.030> ten<00:04:42.330> of

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
the game and that's an eight nine ten of

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.190 
the game and that's an eight nine ten of
one<00:04:43.140> color<00:04:44.420> again<00:04:45.420> you<00:04:45.570> continue<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.050> play

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
one color again you continue to play

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.100 
one color again you continue to play
until<00:04:46.530> one<00:04:46.590> players<00:04:46.890> gain<00:04:47.190> three<00:04:47.430> flags<00:04:47.670> or

three fives next to each other or five

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.460 
three fives next to each other or five
flags<00:04:50.820> total<00:04:51.360> but<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:51.840> didn't<00:04:52.110> mention<00:04:52.260> these

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
flags total but I didn't mention these

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.470 
flags total but I didn't mention these
tactic<00:04:52.980> cards<00:04:53.310> these<00:04:53.430> tactic<00:04:53.820> cards<00:04:54.120> these

tactic cards these tactic cards these

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.790 
tactic cards these tactic cards these
are<00:04:54.600> interesting<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.140> can<00:04:55.260> draw<00:04:55.470> these<00:04:55.650> in

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
are interesting you can draw these in

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.500 
are interesting you can draw these in
your<00:04:55.920> hand<00:04:56.130> if<00:04:56.280> you<00:04:56.370> want<00:04:56.580> but<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.120> can<00:04:57.360> only

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
your hand if you want but you can only

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.170 
your hand if you want but you can only
ever<00:04:57.840> play<00:04:58.170> one<00:04:58.830> more<00:04:59.160> than<00:04:59.430> your<00:04:59.610> opponent

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
ever play one more than your opponent

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.480 
ever play one more than your opponent
has<00:05:00.360> played<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:01.200> if<00:05:01.350> I<00:05:01.470> play<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.740> tactic<00:05:02.220> card

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
has played so if I play a tactic card

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.880 
has played so if I play a tactic card
and<00:05:02.760> my<00:05:03.210> opponent<00:05:03.660> never<00:05:03.840> plays<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.170> tactic

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
and my opponent never plays a tactic

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.080 
and my opponent never plays a tactic
card<00:05:05.100> during<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.370> course<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.730> a<00:05:05.760> game

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
card during the course of a game

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.120 
card during the course of a game
I<00:05:06.120> can<00:05:06.540> only<00:05:06.630> play<00:05:06.900> one<00:05:07.200> but<00:05:07.830> if<00:05:07.920> he<00:05:08.010> plays

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
I can only play one but if he plays

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.440 
I can only play one but if he plays
another<00:05:08.370> one<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:08.760> could<00:05:08.820> play<00:05:09.030> too

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
another one that I could play too

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.000 
another one that I could play too
and<00:05:09.540> that<00:05:09.900> goes<00:05:10.080> on<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:10.440> if<00:05:10.530> you<00:05:10.590> don't<00:05:10.770> like

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
and that goes on so if you don't like

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.980 
and that goes on so if you don't like
tack<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.400> cards<00:05:11.730> you<00:05:12.240> can<00:05:12.390> really<00:05:12.660> hold<00:05:12.840> your

tactic<00:05:18.240> cards<00:05:18.600> can<00:05:18.750> do<00:05:18.870> anything<00:05:19.170> you<00:05:19.470> want

tactic cards can do anything you want
for<00:05:20.730> example<00:05:21.150> but<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:21.690> mean<00:05:21.900> they<00:05:22.140> can<00:05:22.530> change

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
for example but I mean they can change

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.120 
for example but I mean they can change
the<00:05:23.580> game<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.940> game<00:05:24.090> is<00:05:24.120> perfectly<00:05:24.840> fits<00:05:25.830> in

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
the game the game is perfectly fits in

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.710 
the game the game is perfectly fits in
with<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.430> deck<00:05:26.580> of<00:05:26.760> cards<00:05:27.060> but<00:05:27.120> these<00:05:27.330> tactic

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
with the deck of cards but these tactic

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.690 
with the deck of cards but these tactic
cards<00:05:27.990> can<00:05:28.140> change<00:05:28.440> things<00:05:28.650> up<00:05:28.890> for<00:05:29.550> example

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
cards can change things up for example

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.670 
cards can change things up for example
this<00:05:30.000> one<00:05:30.150> says<00:05:30.330> play<00:05:30.570> this<00:05:30.720> card<00:05:31.320> like<00:05:31.500> any

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
value not larger than three so this is a

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.930

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
purple in my hand I now know that he

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.760 
purple in my hand I now know that he
cannot<00:06:48.030> complete<00:06:48.300> that<00:06:48.720> one<00:06:49.020> way<00:06:49.200> but<00:06:49.650> he

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
cannot complete that one way but he

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.860 
cannot complete that one way but he
still<00:06:50.010> might<00:06:50.190> have<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:50.550> ten<00:06:50.790> purple<00:06:51.210> but<00:06:51.780> if

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
still might have that ten purple but if

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.540 
still might have that ten purple but if
I<00:06:51.960> see<00:06:52.140> that<00:06:52.170> ten<00:06:52.500> purple<00:06:52.890> somewhere<00:06:53.190> else

I see that ten purple somewhere else
I<00:06:53.580> now<00:06:54.120> know<00:06:54.390> that<00:06:54.600> the<00:06:54.720> best<00:06:55.020> he<00:06:55.200> can<00:06:55.380> get<00:06:55.680> is

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
I now know that the best he can get is

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.310 
I now know that the best he can get is
three<00:06:56.760> in<00:06:56.910> a<00:06:57.000> row<00:06:57.030> numerically<00:06:57.870> but<00:06:58.050> not<00:06:58.200> at

three in a row numerically but not at
the<00:06:58.410> same<00:06:58.440> color<00:06:58.950> and<00:06:59.220> it's<00:06:59.820> that<00:07:00.360> is<00:07:00.540> just

the same color and it's that is just

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.020 
the same color and it's that is just
what<00:07:01.080> fascinates<00:07:01.800> me<00:07:01.890> about<00:07:02.010> the<00:07:02.310> game<00:07:02.520> trying
