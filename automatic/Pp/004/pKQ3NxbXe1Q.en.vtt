00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.880 
hey this is Dave again
from<00:00:03.120> metal<00:00:03.360> pedals<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.929> thought<00:00:04.589> I'd<00:00:04.710> take<00:00:04.830> a

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
from metal pedals I thought I'd take a

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.800 
from metal pedals I thought I'd take a
couple<00:00:05.160> minutes<00:00:05.490> here<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.759> go<00:00:06.420> through<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
couple minutes here to go through the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.049 
couple minutes here to go through the
bombshell<00:00:07.440> with<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> different<00:00:08.519> camera<00:00:08.700> trying

bombshell with a different camera trying
to<00:00:09.150> capture<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.540> little<00:00:09.750> better<00:00:09.900> audio<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
to capture a little better audio on the

idea<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.820> our<00:00:15.410> bombshell<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:17.130> got<00:00:17.279> volume<00:00:17.520> tone

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
idea of our bombshell we got volume tone

idea of our bombshell we got volume tone
high<00:00:18.119> gain<00:00:18.439> and<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.529> high<00:00:19.710> control<00:00:20.130> right

high gain and a high control right
control<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.930> pad<00:00:22.109> will<00:00:22.230> give<00:00:22.350> us<00:00:22.470> anywhere

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
control this pad will give us anywhere

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.150 
control this pad will give us anywhere
from<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.850> crunch<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.480> heavy<00:00:25.289> distortion<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
from like crunch to heavy distortion and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.700 
from like crunch to heavy distortion and
it<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.789> features<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.330> noise<00:00:27.599> reduction<00:00:27.900> which

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it also features a noise reduction which

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.919 
it also features a noise reduction which
helps<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> high<00:00:29.340> gain<00:00:29.400> settings<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
helps with the high gain settings just

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.380 
helps with the high gain settings just
to<00:00:30.990> give<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.260> idea<00:00:31.669> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.059> our<00:00:33.180> amp

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
to give you an idea this is our amp

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:44.529 
to give you an idea this is our amp
clean<00:00:33.840> channel<00:00:39.140> in<00:00:40.140> our<00:00:40.290> light<00:00:40.559> crunch<00:00:41.309> mode

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:01:08.240 

myself<00:00:47.180> pretty<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.710> overdrive

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.190 

give<00:01:08.820> me<00:01:08.880> an<00:01:08.940> ice<00:01:09.060> pack<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.540> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> tone<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
give me an ice pack you kind of tone you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
give me an ice pack you kind of tone you
could<00:01:10.320> roll<00:01:10.470> off<00:01:10.500> even<00:01:10.950> more<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.550> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
could roll off even more on that if you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:35.260 
could roll off even more on that if you
want<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> clean<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.120> up<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.480> bit<00:01:12.630> more

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.660 

this<00:01:36.270> pedal<00:01:36.570> also<00:01:36.870> can<00:01:37.050> get<00:01:37.230> some<00:01:37.410> nice<00:01:37.670> higher

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
this pedal also can get some nice higher

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.340 
this pedal also can get some nice higher
gain<00:01:38.910> settings<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.600> by<00:01:39.780> cranking<00:01:40.080> up<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
gain settings just by cranking up the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.890 
gain settings just by cranking up the
distortion<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.980> little<00:01:41.160> bit

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.630 

we<00:01:49.900> can<00:01:49.990> get<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.170> all<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.410> way<00:01:50.530> up<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.460> use

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
we can get it all the way up and we use

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.920 
we can get it all the way up and we use
the<00:01:51.730> noise<00:01:51.910> reduction<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.450> can<00:01:52.480> get<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.750> hum

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
the noise reduction you can get the hum

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.800 
the noise reduction you can get the hum
go<00:01:53.890> away<00:01:54.100> that's<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.910> real<00:01:55.060> nice<00:01:55.210> feature<00:01:55.540> and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
go away that's a real nice feature and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.780 
go away that's a real nice feature and
this<00:01:56.260> noise<00:01:56.410> reduction<00:01:56.740> doesn't<00:01:57.340> change<00:01:57.520> your

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
this noise reduction doesn't change your

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.630 
this noise reduction doesn't change your
tone<00:02:01.800> affected<00:02:02.800> in<00:02:02.890> any<00:02:02.950> way<00:02:03.190> other<00:02:03.490> than

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
tone affected in any way other than

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.910 
tone affected in any way other than
taking<00:02:04.090> noise<00:02:04.240> out<00:02:04.540> that's<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.470> nice<00:02:05.650> cake

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
taking noise out that's a nice cake

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:17.710 
taking noise out that's a nice cake
review<00:02:06.840> notes<00:02:07.840> don't<00:02:08.110> drop<00:02:08.380> off

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:32.290

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
and you can play around with your EQ

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.520 
and you can play around with your EQ
here<00:02:34.860> bring<00:02:35.730> up<00:02:35.850> more<00:02:36.030> high<00:02:36.210> end<00:02:36.450> if<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.660> want

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.230 

with<00:03:02.210> this<00:03:02.330> pedal<00:03:02.980> works<00:03:03.980> nice<00:03:04.250> for<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.580> country

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
with this pedal works nice for a country

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.920 
with this pedal works nice for a country

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
want to dive into on it you can get a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.160 
want to dive into on it you can get a
lot<00:03:10.850> of<00:03:11.030> different<00:03:12.020> tones<00:03:12.440> out<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:14.170> lately

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
lot of different tones out of it lately

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.780 
lot of different tones out of it lately
I've<00:03:15.410> been<00:03:15.500> using<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.830> for<00:03:15.860> some<00:03:16.460> country

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
I've been using it for some country

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.450 
I've been using it for some country
stuff<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:24.320> that's<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.620> bumps<00:03:24.890> y'all<00:03:25.070> so

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
stuff and that's the bumps y'all so

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.700 
stuff and that's the bumps y'all so
hopefully<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.150> can<00:03:26.210> pick<00:03:26.510> one<00:03:26.660> up<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.930> check

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
hopefully you can pick one up and check

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.190 
hopefully you can pick one up and check
it<00:03:27.740> out<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.400> what<00:03:28.520> you<00:03:28.640> think<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.880> that
