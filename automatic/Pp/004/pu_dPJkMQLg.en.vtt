okay<00:00:00.930> what<00:00:01.199> we're<00:00:01.380> doing<00:00:01.680> here<00:00:01.829> today<00:00:01.949> for

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
okay what we're doing here today for

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.550 
okay what we're doing here today for
demonstrational<00:00:03.060> purposes<00:00:03.170> is<00:00:04.170> we're<00:00:04.410> going

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
demonstrational purposes is we're going

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.940 
demonstrational purposes is we're going
to<00:00:04.680> apply<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.540> film<00:00:06.540> I've<00:00:06.899> diluted<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.649> half

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
to apply a film I've diluted it half

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.820 
to apply a film I've diluted it half
water<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.639> half<00:00:09.090> p<00:00:09.840> grease<00:00:10.110> your<00:00:10.320> solution

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
water and half p grease your solution

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.129 
water and half p grease your solution
and<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.610> reason<00:00:12.000> why<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.599> use<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.840> little

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
and the reason why I use a little

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.849 
and the reason why I use a little
stronger<00:00:13.380> because<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.070> blood<00:00:14.570> from<00:00:15.859> from

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
stronger because this is blood from from

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.599 
stronger because this is blood from from
deer<00:00:17.100> from<00:00:17.850> last<00:00:18.060> fall<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.980> it<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.130> stay<00:00:20.430> on

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
deer from last fall and it is stay on

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.370 
deer from last fall and it is stay on
this<00:00:20.699> concrete<00:00:21.000> now<00:00:21.330> since<00:00:21.660> fall<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.230> it's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
this concrete now since fall and it's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.970 
this concrete now since fall and it's
April<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:24.660> we're<00:00:24.990> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.410> put<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> little<00:00:25.859> bit

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
April so we're going to put a little bit

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.470 
April so we're going to put a little bit
the<00:00:26.130> degreaser<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.090> spread<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the degreaser on here and spread it

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.670 
the degreaser on here and spread it
around<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.900> give<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.289> time<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
around and give it a little time to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
around and give it a little time to
react<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> show<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.420> what<00:00:30.630> I

react and I'm going to show you what I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.310 
react and I'm going to show you what I
do<00:00:32.329> like<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> say<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.460> diluted<00:00:35.780> solution

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.620 

I'm<00:00:40.310> gonna<00:00:40.489> take<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:40.700> now<00:00:40.880> and<00:00:41.090> spread<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:41.510> with

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
I'm gonna take it now and spread it with

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.810 
I'm gonna take it now and spread it with
the<00:00:41.840> little<00:00:42.560> bristled<00:00:43.010> broom<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.550> get<00:00:43.670> it

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
the little bristled broom to get it

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.619 
the little bristled broom to get it
really<00:00:44.000> evenly<00:00:44.440> spread<00:00:45.440> on<00:00:45.739> here<00:00:46.040> I<00:00:46.480> may<00:00:47.480> not

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
really evenly spread on here I may not

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.200 
really evenly spread on here I may not
stay<00:00:47.840> completely<00:00:48.290> within<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.620> lines<00:00:49.210> for

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
stay completely within the lines for

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.140 
stay completely within the lines for
demo<00:00:50.510> purposes<00:00:51.050> we<00:00:51.230> are<00:00:52.930> just<00:00:53.930> fine<00:00:54.260> I'm<00:00:54.530> sure

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
demo purposes we are just fine I'm sure

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.250 
demo purposes we are just fine I'm sure
okay<00:00:56.150> we're<00:00:56.330> going<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.570> give<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:56.690> just<00:00:57.080> a

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
okay we're going to give that just a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.790 
okay we're going to give that just a
little<00:00:57.440> bit<00:00:57.680> of<00:00:57.920> reaction<00:00:58.820> time<00:00:59.590> probably<00:01:00.590> a

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
little bit of reaction time probably a

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.520 
little bit of reaction time probably a
couple<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.190> minutes<00:01:02.199> we're<00:01:03.199> going<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:03.410> see

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
couple of minutes we're going to see

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.299 
couple of minutes we're going to see
what<00:01:03.680> she'll<00:01:03.920> do

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
what she'll do

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.520 
what she'll do
okay<00:01:05.239> we've<00:01:05.449> given<00:01:05.690> this<00:01:05.840> about<00:01:06.110> two<00:01:06.320> minutes

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
okay we've given this about two minutes

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.249 
okay we've given this about two minutes
reaction<00:01:07.160> time<00:01:07.400> with<00:01:07.670> our<00:01:07.930> half<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.110> half

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
reaction time with our half and half

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.320 
reaction time with our half and half
descaler<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:09.860> water<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.369> what<00:01:11.030> I'm<00:01:11.119> going<00:01:11.240> to

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
descaler of water and what I'm going to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.400 
descaler of water and what I'm going to
do<00:01:11.420> now<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:11.780> I'm<00:01:11.899> just<00:01:12.020> going<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.170> take<00:01:12.289> the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
do now is I'm just going to take the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.800 
do now is I'm just going to take the
brush<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:12.680> kind<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.070> rub<00:01:13.250> over<00:01:13.399> it<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.880> see<00:01:14.720> if

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
brush and kind of rub over it and see if

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.109 
brush and kind of rub over it and see if
she's<00:01:14.960> D<00:01:15.110> bonded<00:01:21.070> I'm<00:01:22.070> not<00:01:22.310> putting<00:01:22.789> just<00:01:23.000> a

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
she's D bonded I'm not putting just a

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.770 
she's D bonded I'm not putting just a
light<00:01:23.270> pressure<00:01:23.570> on<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:24.020> we'll<00:01:24.710> get<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.780> light

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
light pressure on it we'll get the light

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.930 
light pressure on it we'll get the light
stuff<00:01:27.080> first<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.649> then<00:01:27.800> we<00:01:27.950> are<00:01:28.070> give<00:01:28.759> her<00:01:28.850> a

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
stuff first and then we are give her a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.190 
stuff first and then we are give her a
little<00:01:29.090> more<00:01:29.300> pressure<00:01:29.539> for<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.960> heavily

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
little more pressure for the heavily

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.410 
little more pressure for the heavily
coated<00:01:30.500> stuff<00:01:30.890> like<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:31.610> said<00:01:31.880> we've<00:01:32.060> only<00:01:32.210> let

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
coated stuff like I said we've only let

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.060 
coated stuff like I said we've only let
this<00:01:32.570> set<00:01:32.810> approximately<00:01:33.380> two<00:01:33.590> minutes<00:01:36.070> but

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
this set approximately two minutes but

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.330 
this set approximately two minutes but
this<00:01:37.250> blood<00:01:37.850> has<00:01:38.179> been<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.539> here<00:01:38.840> since<00:01:39.340> last

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
this blood has been on here since last

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.060 
this blood has been on here since last
November<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:41.570> they<00:01:41.690> clean<00:01:41.929> their<00:01:42.110> beard<00:01:42.350> as

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
November when they clean their beard as

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.620 
November when they clean their beard as
you<00:01:43.190> can<00:01:43.369> see<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.259> deep<00:01:45.259> bonding<00:01:45.710> this<00:01:46.630> and

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
you can see it is deep bonding this and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.859 
you can see it is deep bonding this and
in<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.560> case<00:01:48.799> like<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:49.040> where<00:01:49.520> it's<00:01:49.640> really

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
in a case like this where it's really

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.480 
in a case like this where it's really
the<00:01:50.869> spots<00:01:51.200> that's<00:01:51.409> really<00:01:51.710> driving<00:01:52.009> that

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
the spots that's really driving that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.789 
the spots that's really driving that
blood<00:01:53.479> enzyme<00:01:53.900> index<00:01:54.259> down<00:01:54.470> into<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
blood enzyme index down into the

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.249 
blood enzyme index down into the
concrete<00:01:55.130> will<00:01:55.509> let<00:01:56.509> some<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:56.810> those<00:01:56.900> spots

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
concrete will let some of those spots

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.179 
concrete will let some of those spots
set<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.619> there<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.829> little<00:01:58.009> longer<00:01:59.920> it's<00:02:00.920> more

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
set on there a little longer it's more

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.990 
set on there a little longer it's more
of<00:02:01.310> our<00:02:01.430> chemical<00:02:01.729> back<00:02:02.030> up<00:02:02.240> here<00:02:02.450> on<00:02:04.000> this

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
of our chemical back up here on this

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.210 
of our chemical back up here on this
touch<00:02:05.299> spot

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.600 

now<00:02:13.220> we'll<00:02:13.610> just<00:02:13.850> let<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.209> settle<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.690> mama

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
now we'll just let that settle it mama

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.330 
now we'll just let that settle it mama
okay<00:02:16.610> we<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.270> now<00:02:17.450> let<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.750> sit<00:02:18.080> all<00:02:18.740> probably

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340
