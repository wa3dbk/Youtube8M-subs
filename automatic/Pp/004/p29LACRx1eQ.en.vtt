00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.580 
go either way and I think that is
supposed<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.890> be<00:02:42.040> fire<00:02:42.400> Chi<00:02:42.790> power<00:02:43.000> mode<00:02:43.590> so

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
supposed to be fire Chi power mode so

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.030 
supposed to be fire Chi power mode so
kind<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.160> interesting<00:02:45.700> also<00:02:46.540> back<00:02:46.959> here

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
kind of interesting also back here

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.470 
kind of interesting also back here
you've<00:02:48.040> got<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.370> little<00:02:48.670> clip<00:02:49.120> on<00:02:49.299> this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
you've got this little clip on this

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.720 
you've got this little clip on this
piece<00:02:49.750> right<00:02:49.989> here<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.470> then<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.370> manual

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
piece right here and then the manual

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.370 
piece right here and then the manual
doesn't<00:02:51.940> show<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.540> clip<00:02:52.750> his<00:02:52.930> weapon<00:02:53.290> on

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
doesn't show you to clip his weapon on

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.650 
doesn't show you to clip his weapon on
there<00:02:53.620> but<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.250> think<00:02:54.850> it's<00:02:54.970> pretty<00:02:55.090> handy<00:02:55.540> to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
there but I think it's pretty handy to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.770 
there but I think it's pretty handy to
do<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.739> that<00:02:56.950> he<00:02:57.100> can<00:02:57.280> drive<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.330> vehicle

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
do that so that he can drive the vehicle

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.410 
do that so that he can drive the vehicle
so<00:02:59.590> anyway<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.400> went<00:03:00.730> ahead<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.090> did<00:03:01.209> that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
so anyway I went ahead and did that

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.350 
so anyway I went ahead and did that
anyway<00:03:02.010> there's<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.220> top<00:03:03.580> view<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.060> do<00:03:04.180> have

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
anyway there's the top view you do have

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.140 
anyway there's the top view you do have
a<00:03:04.390> piece<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.780> Chi<00:03:05.049> there<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.400> here<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:07.000> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
a piece of Chi there so here is the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.449 
a piece of Chi there so here is the
whole<00:03:07.420> set

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
whole set

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.339 
whole set
and<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.879> first<00:03:09.150> thing<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.629> notice<00:03:10.170> on

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
and the first thing that I notice on

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.349 
and the first thing that I notice on
this<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:10.680> least<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.609> only<00:03:11.849> thing<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.239> has

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
this at least is the only thing that has

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.449 
this at least is the only thing that has
different<00:03:12.780> color<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.859> up<00:03:14.069> here<00:03:14.280> this

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
different color is this up here this

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.520 
different color is this up here this
Sabretooth<00:03:14.969> head<00:03:15.209> which<00:03:15.450> actually<00:03:16.019> converts

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
Sabretooth head which actually converts

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.119 
Sabretooth head which actually converts
into<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:17.099> saber-tooth<00:03:17.909> flier<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.950> way<00:03:20.069> you

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
into a saber-tooth flier and the way you

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.860 
into a saber-tooth flier and the way you
do<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.730> fold<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.239> part<00:03:21.480> out<00:03:21.599> and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
do it is you just fold that part out and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.199 
do it is you just fold that part out and
you<00:03:22.680> would<00:03:22.829> put<00:03:23.189> them<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> figure<00:03:23.819> in<00:03:23.969> then

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
you would put them in a figure in then

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.209 
you would put them in a figure in then
but<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.900> already<00:03:25.049> put<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.409> in<00:03:25.530> obviously<00:03:25.920> and

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:26.219 
but I already put it in obviously and

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.539 
but I already put it in obviously and
then<00:03:26.909> these<00:03:27.239> fold<00:03:27.659> out<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.379> all<00:03:29.069> that<00:03:29.099> back

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
then these fold out and all that back

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.649 
then these fold out and all that back
and<00:03:29.849> there's<00:03:30.389> your<00:03:30.650> saber-tooth<00:03:31.650> flier<00:03:32.129> I

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
and there's your saber-tooth flier I

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.059 
and there's your saber-tooth flier I
think<00:03:33.659> it's<00:03:33.750> kind<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.109> cool<00:03:34.349> kind<00:03:34.920> of

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
think it's kind of cool kind of

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.199 
think it's kind of cool kind of
interesting<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:37.139> as<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.859> probably<00:03:38.280> saw<00:03:38.730> it

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
interesting and as you probably saw it

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.089 
interesting and as you probably saw it
doesn't<00:03:39.569> really<00:03:39.689> attach<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.439> the<00:03:40.560> Senate<00:03:40.919> it

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
doesn't really attach to the Senate it

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.149 
doesn't really attach to the Senate it
just<00:03:41.849> fits<00:03:42.209> right<00:03:42.359> inside<00:03:42.689> there<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.560> this

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
just fits right inside there on this

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.690 
just fits right inside there on this
piece<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.200> that's<00:03:46.200> how<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.530> works<00:03:46.950> pretty

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
piece so that's how that works pretty

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.179 
piece so that's how that works pretty
cool<00:03:48.030> little<00:03:48.209> part<00:03:48.540> though<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.859> like<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:50.069> they

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
cool little part though I like that they

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.440 
cool little part though I like that they
included<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:52.049> then<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:53.969> the<00:03:54.239> rest

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
included that and then you have the rest

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.119 
included that and then you have the rest
of<00:03:54.689> the<00:03:55.650> set<00:03:55.950> here<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.900> as<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.739> see<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.040> a

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
of the set here and as you see it a

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.729 
of the set here and as you see it a
little<00:03:59.250> bit<00:03:59.459> closer<00:03:59.760> you<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.260> lot<00:04:01.709> of

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
little bit closer you have a lot of

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.589 
little bit closer you have a lot of
different<00:04:02.250> stuff<00:04:02.459> going<00:04:02.489> on<00:04:02.969> in<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.329> set

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
different stuff going on in this set

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.589 
different stuff going on in this set
you've<00:04:04.379> got<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:05.219> that<00:04:05.519> fires<00:04:05.849> right<00:04:06.269> here

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
you've got this that fires right here

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.050 
you've got this that fires right here
and<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.530> can<00:04:07.709> move<00:04:08.159> this<00:04:08.370> all<00:04:08.609> around

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
and you can move this all around

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.119 
and you can move this all around
anywhere<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.719> want<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.230> pretty<00:04:10.980> much

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
anywhere you want and pretty much

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.080 
anywhere you want and pretty much
anywhere<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:13.650> guys<00:04:13.829> know<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.129> fire<00:04:14.729> this

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
anywhere and you guys know to fire this

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.589 
anywhere and you guys know to fire this
you<00:04:15.299> just<00:04:15.479> push<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:15.989> together<00:04:17.060> like<00:04:18.060> that

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
you just push this together like that

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.259 
you just push this together like that
and<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.799> fit<00:04:20.099> all<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.549> way<00:04:20.609> across<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.090> room

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
and it fit all the way across the room

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.080 
and it fit all the way across the room
putting<00:04:22.079> anyway<00:04:22.409> a<00:04:22.979> pretty<00:04:23.550> cool<00:04:23.880> little

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
putting anyway a pretty cool little

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.420 
putting anyway a pretty cool little
thing<00:04:24.419> you're<00:04:25.169> also<00:04:25.470> down<00:04:25.800> here<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.220> have

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
thing you're also down here you have

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.620 
thing you're also down here you have
this<00:04:26.610> ice<00:04:26.880> prison<00:04:27.630> which<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.560> like<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.889> lot<00:04:29.039> and

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
this ice prison which I like a lot and

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.080 
this ice prison which I like a lot and
it<00:04:30.630> folds<00:04:31.110> open<00:04:31.260> right<00:04:31.740> here<00:04:32.039> so<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:32.699> can<00:04:32.849> see

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
it folds open right here so you can see

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.990 
it folds open right here so you can see
how<00:04:33.690> he<00:04:33.750> fits<00:04:34.139> in<00:04:34.320> there<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.460> release<00:04:35.729> him

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
how he fits in there and to release him

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.020 
how he fits in there and to release him
you<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.389> push<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:36.990> down<00:04:37.259> and<00:04:37.759> then<00:04:38.759> you<00:04:38.880> can

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
you just push this down and then you can

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.749 
you just push this down and then you can
pull<00:04:39.270> him<00:04:39.449> out<00:04:39.630> really<00:04:39.870> easily<00:04:40.250> but<00:04:41.250> this<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.550> a

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
pull him out really easily but this is a

actually I know I said that but it

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.350 
actually I know I said that but it
prevents<00:06:54.070> them<00:06:54.280> from<00:06:54.340> getting<00:06:54.669> to<00:06:55.030> the<00:06:55.150> bridge

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
prevents them from getting to the bridge

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.430 
prevents them from getting to the bridge
is<00:06:55.630> actually<00:06:56.550> the<00:06:57.550> point<00:06:58.330> of<00:06:58.570> that<00:06:58.690> not<00:06:59.229> really

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
is actually the point of that not really

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.439 
is actually the point of that not really
dropping<00:06:59.650> it<00:06:59.889> but<00:07:00.070> you<00:07:00.190> can<00:07:00.460> easily<00:07:01.090> take<00:07:01.300> the

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
dropping it but you can easily take the

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.930 
dropping it but you can easily take the
bridge<00:07:01.660> off<00:07:01.930> too<00:07:02.289> just<00:07:02.919> like<00:07:02.979> that<00:07:03.250> it<00:07:03.729> just

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
bridge off too just like that it just

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.089 
bridge off too just like that it just
slides<00:07:04.180> onto<00:07:04.419> that<00:07:04.660> piece<00:07:04.900> right<00:07:05.020> there<00:07:05.139> so

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
slides onto that piece right there so

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:09.540 
slides onto that piece right there so
you<00:07:06.190> can<00:07:06.460> drop<00:07:06.789> it<00:07:07.139> but<00:07:08.139> I<00:07:08.440> think<00:07:08.919> this<00:07:09.130> is<00:07:09.340> a

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
you can drop it but I think this is a

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.670 
you can drop it but I think this is a
really<00:07:09.940> cool<00:07:10.120> set<00:07:10.389> there's<00:07:10.690> as<00:07:11.169> you<00:07:11.229> saw

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
really cool set there's as you saw

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.890 
really cool set there's as you saw
there's<00:07:11.979> a<00:07:12.039> lot<00:07:12.280> of<00:07:12.430> features<00:07:12.640> on<00:07:12.880> it

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
there's a lot of features on it

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.689 
there's a lot of features on it
I<00:07:13.990> think<00:07:14.710> my<00:07:14.860> favorite<00:07:15.220> part<00:07:15.250> is<00:07:15.520> actually

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
I think my favorite part is actually

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:18.210 
I think my favorite part is actually
just<00:07:16.060> the<00:07:16.270> bridge<00:07:16.509> and<00:07:16.900> that's<00:07:17.410> thrown<00:07:17.860> back

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220 
just the bridge and that's thrown back

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.300 
just the bridge and that's thrown back
they're<00:07:18.460> really<00:07:19.270> awesome<00:07:19.449> but<00:07:20.380> anyway<00:07:20.889> I<00:07:20.919> hope

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
they're really awesome but anyway I hope

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.370 
they're really awesome but anyway I hope
