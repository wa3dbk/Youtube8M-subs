bottom to reach the top so now that cell
has<00:00:36.070> had<00:00:36.249> to<00:00:36.399> do<00:00:36.519> its<00:00:36.730> job<00:00:36.999> for<00:00:37.449> many<00:00:37.749> more<00:00:37.960> days

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
has had to do its job for many more days

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.139 
has had to do its job for many more days
and<00:00:38.589> it's<00:00:38.890> much<00:00:39.100> more<00:00:39.280> worn<00:00:39.609> out<00:00:39.760> by<00:00:39.999> the<00:00:40.030> time

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
and it's much more worn out by the time

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.660 
and it's much more worn out by the time
it<00:00:40.510> reaches<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.839> surface<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:42.190> usually

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
it reaches the surface this usually

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.819 
it reaches the surface this usually
means<00:00:42.879> that<00:00:43.059> it's<00:00:43.179> curling<00:00:44.050> up<00:00:44.170> at<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.440> edges

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
means that it's curling up at the edges

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.189 
means that it's curling up at the edges
and<00:00:44.980> not<00:00:45.670> fitting<00:00:46.179> well<00:00:46.329> with<00:00:46.600> its<00:00:46.780> neighbors

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
and not fitting well with its neighbors

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.009 
and not fitting well with its neighbors
that<00:00:47.829> creates<00:00:48.190> an<00:00:48.339> irregular<00:00:48.850> surface<00:00:49.059> which

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
that creates an irregular surface which

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.380 
that creates an irregular surface which
reflects<00:00:50.499> light<00:00:50.800> irregularly<00:00:51.579> and<00:00:51.789> we<00:00:52.149> see

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
reflects light irregularly and we see

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.590 
reflects light irregularly and we see
that<00:00:52.569> as<00:00:52.780> dullness<00:00:53.609> my<00:00:54.609> advice<00:00:54.969> is<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.569> use

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
that as dullness my advice is to use

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.399 
that as dullness my advice is to use
sunscreens<00:00:56.559> all<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.460> time<00:00:57.729> on<00:00:58.050> hot<00:00:59.050> summer

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
sunscreens all the time on hot summer

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.399 
sunscreens all the time on hot summer
