glued which is like a really thick paste
it's<00:03:48.230> almost<00:03:48.410> like<00:03:48.560> glue<00:03:48.710> I'm<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.100> gonna

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
it's almost like glue I'm just gonna

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.950 
it's almost like glue I'm just gonna
check<00:03:49.370> how<00:03:49.490> much<00:03:49.580> time<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.820> have

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.950 

okay<00:03:53.960> so<00:03:54.470> some<00:03:54.920> time<00:03:55.240> and<00:03:56.240> I<00:03:56.420> just<00:03:56.630> used<00:03:56.840> that

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
okay so some time and I just used that

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.480 
okay so some time and I just used that
and<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.380> just<00:03:57.440> like<00:03:57.740> I<00:03:57.920> don't<00:03:58.010> know<00:03:58.130> put<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.400> all

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
and I just like I don't know put it all

like that like it's a hairspray and you

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.450 
like that like it's a hairspray and you
just<00:04:24.170> put<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.500> like<00:04:24.800> make<00:04:25.160> sure<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.310> will

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
just put that in like make sure you will

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.800 
just put that in like make sure you will
fire<00:04:25.790> away<00:04:25.970> because<00:04:26.180> if<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.360> put<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.600> close

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
fire away because if you put it close

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.260 
fire away because if you put it close
makes<00:04:27.110> all<00:04:27.200> particles<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:28.070> like<00:04:28.640> then<00:04:29.180> it

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
makes all particles and like then it

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.790 
makes all particles and like then it
falls<00:04:29.510> over<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.110> have<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.230> lot<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.650> whole

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
falls over and you have a lot so a whole

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.470 
falls over and you have a lot so a whole
it<00:04:30.920> far<00:04:31.100> away<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.460> like<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.820> missed<00:04:32.090> it

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
it far away and just like you missed it

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.290 
it far away and just like you missed it
and<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.840> makes<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.080> pretty<00:04:33.230> pretty<00:04:34.180> hold<00:04:35.180> it

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
and it makes it pretty pretty hold it

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.440 
and it makes it pretty pretty hold it
pretty<00:04:35.420> well<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:37.190> yeah<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:38.030> guess<00:04:38.420> that's
