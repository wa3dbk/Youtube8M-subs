00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
pressure and it just blends right out

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.600

motion<00:01:39.049> even<00:01:40.070> brush<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> back<00:01:41.579> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
motion even brush all in the back of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.060 
motion even brush all in the back of
your<00:01:41.880> hand<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.380> looks<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
your hand and now it just looks like we

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.760 
your hand and now it just looks like we
have<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.549> very<00:01:44.990> clean<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> neutral<00:01:46.500> lid<00:01:46.649> to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.830 

so<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.830> next<00:01:51.070> step<00:01:51.400> is<00:01:51.580> going<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.970> be<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
so the next step is going to be the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.490 
so the next step is going to be the
black<00:01:53.170> hat<00:01:53.740> liquid<00:01:54.670> liner<00:01:54.910> she<00:01:55.660> already<00:01:55.810> has<00:01:56.140> a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
dark brown liner to define her lashline

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.590

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
the concealer that we just put on but

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.249 
the concealer that we just put on but
it's<00:04:39.940> also<00:04:40.090> going<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.419> pull<00:04:40.630> off<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.050> black

it's also going to pull off the black

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.760 
it's also going to pull off the black
liner<00:04:41.560> so<00:04:43.650> that<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:45.099> you<00:04:45.639> have<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:45.849> kind<00:04:46.210> of

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
liner so that and you have to kind of

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.499 
liner so that and you have to kind of
twist<00:04:47.770> as<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.849> pull<00:04:49.030> out<00:04:49.349> and<00:04:51.240> do<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> little

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.360 
twist as you pull out and do a little
bit<00:04:52.660> more<00:04:52.690> concealer<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:53.919> that's<00:04:54.099> why<00:04:54.220> we

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
brush off because if it doesn't remove

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.140 
brush off because if it doesn't remove
it<00:04:58.990> in<00:04:59.110> one<00:04:59.289> do<00:04:59.979> it<00:05:00.099> one<00:05:00.250> more<00:05:00.280> time<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:01.060> get

like I said we're just going right on

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.580 
like I said we're just going right on
top<00:05:35.380> of<00:05:35.409> your<00:05:35.919> brown<00:05:36.340> liner<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:36.909> you<00:05:37.030> have

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
top of your brown liner that you have

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.730 
top of your brown liner that you have
dashes<00:05:38.639> flattening<00:05:39.639> over<00:05:39.970> there<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:40.750> so

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
dashes flattening over there and so

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.210 
dashes flattening over there and so
there's<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.669> black<00:05:42.880> liner<00:05:43.440> what<00:05:44.440> we're<00:05:44.889> going

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
there's the black liner what we're going

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.550 
there's the black liner what we're going
to<00:05:45.490> just<00:05:45.789> take<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.330> little<00:05:46.810> bit<00:05:46.990> into<00:05:47.440> the

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
corner is a black pencil because the

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.740 
corner is a black pencil because the
liquid<00:05:51.400> liner<00:05:51.580> can<00:05:51.880> move<00:05:52.090> around<00:05:52.210> when<00:05:52.659> you
