okay<00:00:00.989> today<00:00:01.319> we<00:00:01.500> are<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.860> learn<00:00:02.040> about

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
okay today we are going to learn about

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.889 
okay today we are going to learn about
how<00:00:02.730> photosynthesis<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.840> cellular

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
how photosynthesis and cellular

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.230 
how photosynthesis and cellular
respiration<00:00:04.609> interact<00:00:05.609> with<00:00:05.759> one<00:00:05.940> another<00:00:05.970> in

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
respiration interact with one another in

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.500 
respiration interact with one another in
a<00:00:06.390> plant<00:00:06.690> so<00:00:07.529> here<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.890> have<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.280> solution<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
a plant so here I have a solution it's a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.320 
a plant so here I have a solution it's a
dye<00:00:09.690> called<00:00:09.990> bromothymol<00:00:10.559> blue<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.370> as<00:00:12.179> you

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
dye called bromothymol blue and as you

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.039 
dye called bromothymol blue and as you
can<00:00:12.480> see<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:13.110> kind<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.590> blue<00:00:14.809> what<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.929> are

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
can see it's kind of blue what we are

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.570 
can see it's kind of blue what we are
going<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.920> are<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> add<00:00:17.369> some

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
going to do is we are going to add some

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.910 
going to do is we are going to add some
carbon<00:00:17.910> dioxide<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.500> how<00:00:19.650> I'm<00:00:19.740> going

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
carbon dioxide to this so how I'm going

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.080 
carbon dioxide to this so how I'm going
to<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.939> take<00:00:21.060> a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
to do this is I'm just going to take a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.650 
to do this is I'm just going to take a
straw<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> blow<00:00:22.020> my<00:00:22.769> carbon<00:00:23.220> dioxide<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:24.000> my

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
straw and blow my carbon dioxide from my

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
straw and blow my carbon dioxide from my
exhale<00:00:25.410> into<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> bromothymol<00:00:26.699> blue<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
exhale into the bromothymol blue and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:50.290 
exhale into the bromothymol blue and
you'll<00:00:28.080> see<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.500> happens

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:32.420 

as<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.780> starting<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.109> turn<00:00:52.289> green

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:41.270 

taking<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> while

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.740 

all<00:01:42.280> right<00:01:42.490> well<00:01:42.670> as<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:42.939> can<00:01:43.149> see<00:01:43.210> it's<00:01:43.479> kind

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
all right well as you can see it's kind

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.940 
all right well as you can see it's kind
of<00:01:43.840> yellowish<00:01:44.289> brown<00:01:44.649> but<00:01:45.429> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:47.649> note<00:01:47.799> that

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
of yellowish brown but you can note that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.289 
of yellowish brown but you can note that
there<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.189> color<00:01:48.490> change<00:01:48.850> because<00:01:49.179> I'm

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
there is a color change because I'm

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.819 
there is a color change because I'm
adding<00:01:49.570> carbon<00:01:49.780> dioxide<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.469> bromothymol

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
adding carbon dioxide to the bromothymol

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.429 
adding carbon dioxide to the bromothymol
blue<00:01:54.569> so<00:01:55.569> what<00:01:55.689> we're<00:01:55.810> going<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.020> do<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.289> we're

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
blue so what we're going to do is we're

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.209 
blue so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:56.469> to<00:01:56.619> add<00:01:56.799> this<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:59.049> yellowish<00:01:59.950> brown

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.169 
bromothymol blue to the test tube's
let's<00:02:03.340> see<00:02:03.399> if<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.549> can<00:02:03.670> get<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.880> little<00:02:04.090> more

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
let's see if I can get it a little more

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:15.470 
let's see if I can get it a little more
yellow<00:02:11.250> all<00:02:12.250> right<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:13.989> order<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.620> compare

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
yellow all right but in order to compare

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.370 
yellow all right but in order to compare
how<00:02:16.480> photosynthesis<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.319> cellular

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
how photosynthesis and cellular

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.380 
how photosynthesis and cellular
respiration<00:02:17.620> interact<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> test
