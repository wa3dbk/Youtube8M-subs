00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.570
 the knife is a fundamental accessory 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.040
 for the fisherman in black want infinite 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.510
 uses ranging from the killing of 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.850
 fish to the cut of a line but 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.100
 above all it is a very useful accessory 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.290
 safety as it serves to draw 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.509
 embarrassment fishing turin opens in the case 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.580
 that you end up in a thickness of 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.470
 net or maybe a clumsy abandoned one 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.390
 so it is essential that the knife 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.970
 is always easily accessible and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.200
 the identifiable placements more 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.899
 widespread are three the first is the calf 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.039
 can go outside or inside the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.840
 calf 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.879
 this type of positioning was a lot 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.519
 used in the past especially when i 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.559
 knives were all very large for 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.289
 which did not make different possible 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.789
 placing the main advantage of 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.530
 this type of positioning is that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.470
 actually the knife is enough 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.960
 easy to reach the cons and that the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.640
 curtains inside tend to bump 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 against another leg during the wiener 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.130
 java and the outside is practically 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.690
 a source of constant support for the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.060
 silhouette of the ball or even the line 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.950
 difficult when we know what it is here 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.960
 quite a nuisance let's say that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.680
 a type of positioning that was a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.650
 over time the second that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.420
 today it is very common is the knife to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.130
 center of the belt more or less 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.540
 normally it makes sure that the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.829
 knife is in the center of the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.079
 back in a way that gives less discomfort 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.659
 possible and be reachable with 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.909
 both hands an advantage of this 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.350
 positioning and certainly not 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.909
 is likely to forget it because precisely 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.430
 always attached a belt of leads 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.140
 meeting the ground by unhooking the belt 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.079
 in case of emergency, yes 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.610
 also loses the knife and above all 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.060
 that with a heavy lead belt 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.810
 crowded or out of hands with gloves on 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.310
 etc 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.250
 we say that behind the back does not 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.409
 seeing it is not really easy a 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.509
 times 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.880
 in apulia and store it carefully 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.289
 in the holster with the appropriate and then 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.150
 you can risk losing it on 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.920
 positioning that is spreading by 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.379
 more but have no knives become 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.180
 the funds are smaller and less studied 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.489
 the one on the arm is normally used 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.049
 put it on the arm contrary to that 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.840
 dominant then on the left arm 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.120
 for the right and the right arm beli 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.709
 the advantages of this are missing 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.780
 positioning is that the knife 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.140
 basically it is always visible and 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.940
 therefore easily reachable 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.049
 when it is unhooked the belt of 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.000
 profiles we always have it to 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.610
 arrangement and can be seen exactly 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.450
 when it is placed that stops in short 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.760
 keep it in perfect position is the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.470
 positioning that I normally use and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.510
 of course your contribution two 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.930
 one that I use for all the knives 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.099
 various operations such as finishing fish or 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.379
 clean them etc. and it is the knife that 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.180
 I keep on my belt and that other one destined 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.640
 I wear only safety 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.019
 always on the arm is always essential 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.700
 that the knife remained in 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.930
 perfect efficiency so that the blade 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.930
 is always very sharp
