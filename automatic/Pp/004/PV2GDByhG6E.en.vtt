quartz slab over another two up

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
quartz slab over another two up
basically<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> form<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.140> block<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070

then<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.490> over<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.030> form<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> little

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
then one over to form that little

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.640 
then one over to form that little
basically<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.659> modern<00:01:15.659> seven<00:01:16.320> whatever

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.359 
want to build glass straight up so that
it's<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.840> half<00:01:25.020> slab<00:01:25.380> over<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.250> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
it's like just a half slab over if you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's like just a half slab over if you
know<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> mean

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.550 
bring it all the way to the back and
drop<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.850> down<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.200> shape

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
drop it down so now you have this shape

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.980 
drop it down so now you have this shape
of<00:01:31.829> glass<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:33.180> gonna<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.479> looking<00:01:33.750> really

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
of glass it's gonna be looking really

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.620 
of glass it's gonna be looking really
beautiful<00:01:34.310> right<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> beach<00:01:36.240> and

beautiful right here on the beach and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.170 
beautiful right here on the beach and
then<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:38.009> design<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.670> well<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:39.150> ahead

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
then this little design as well go ahead

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.109 
then this little design as well go ahead
and<00:01:39.450> add<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.720> door<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> inside

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

and add your door in or on the inside
here<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.899> recommend<00:01:43.170> doing<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
here I recommend doing it in there just

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550 
here I recommend doing it in there just
because<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> adds<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> texture<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.229> you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
because it adds more of a texture if you

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.270 
because it adds more of a texture if you
guys<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> mean<00:01:48.409> go<00:01:49.409> ahead<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.920> bring

a<00:01:50.869> spruce<00:01:51.869> wood<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.460> place<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:54.409> quartz<00:01:55.409> slabs

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
a spruce wood up place a quartz slabs

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.179 
a spruce wood up place a quartz slabs
out<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:58.200> spruce<00:01:58.649> wood<00:01:58.890> up

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
out like this and then spruce wood up

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.120 
out like this and then spruce wood up
like<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.880> too<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:01.320> drop<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.770> around

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
heading with this upside-down quartz

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.840 
heading with this upside-down quartz
because<00:04:05.590> then<00:04:05.890> we<00:04:06.010> can<00:04:06.130> go<00:04:06.250> ahead<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.580> place<00:04:06.820> a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850

because then we can go ahead and place a
chest<00:04:07.770> this<00:04:08.770> is<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.950> cool<00:04:09.160> design<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.490> really

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
chest this is a cool design I really

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.980 
chest this is a cool design I really
like<00:04:10.060> not

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990

trapped a normal chest so now with the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.190 
trapped a normal chest so now with the
same<00:04:15.520> feature<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:16.150> having<00:04:16.480> a<00:04:16.540> floor<00:04:16.870> we<00:04:17.170> can

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
same feature of having a floor we can

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.650 
same feature of having a floor we can
also<00:04:17.440> open<00:04:17.980> this<00:04:18.100> chest<00:04:18.489> here<00:04:18.940> as<00:04:19.300> it<00:04:19.450> will<00:04:19.540> go

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
also open this chest here as it will go

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.960 
also open this chest here as it will go
through<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.959> stairs<00:04:20.440> at<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:20.920> so<00:04:21.640> let's<00:04:21.820> go

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
through the stairs at that so let's go

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.260 
through the stairs at that so let's go
ahead<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.330> get<00:04:22.510> some<00:04:22.900> nice<00:04:23.440> little<00:04:24.270> ladders

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
ahead and get some nice little ladders

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.970 
ahead and get some nice little ladders
we<00:04:25.960> don't<00:04:26.110> need<00:04:26.260> this<00:04:26.470> anymore

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
we don't need this anymore

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.880 
we don't need this anymore
let's<00:04:27.730> go<00:04:27.880> ahead<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.150> bring<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.480> up<00:04:28.890> like

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
let's go ahead and bring this up like

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.950 
let's go ahead and bring this up like
that<00:04:30.130> we<00:04:30.220> can<00:04:30.370> go<00:04:30.490> at<00:04:30.610> an<00:04:30.760> adequate<00:04:31.210> trapdoor

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
that we can go at an adequate trapdoor

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.510 
that we can go at an adequate trapdoor
but<00:04:32.290> it's<00:04:32.500> not<00:04:32.650> really<00:04:32.890> necessary

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
but it's not really necessary

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.550 
but it's not really necessary
and<00:04:33.640> then<00:04:34.090> down<00:04:34.360> here<00:04:34.720> we<00:04:34.840> can<00:04:34.990> remove<00:04:35.320> this

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
and then down here we can remove this

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.800 
and then down here we can remove this
because<00:04:35.710> we<00:04:36.010> do<00:04:36.160> not<00:04:36.310> need<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:36.970> add<00:04:37.510> a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
because we do not need that and add a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.960 
because we do not need that and add a
half<00:04:38.230> slab<00:04:38.470> there<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.370> can<00:04:39.520> come<00:04:39.700> actually
