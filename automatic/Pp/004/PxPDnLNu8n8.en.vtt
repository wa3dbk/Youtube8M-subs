00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.220
 Yes 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.330
 You will not receive it. 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.029
 lee 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.769
 I do not think so. 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:34.280
 This time, the sub-control-and-fast economy in Bali 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.290
 Tell you about why this method has been used to lead the economy out of the tactical 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.550
 I'll start the line. 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:45.230
 If you see a recent mother's professional tennis match on the sub-and-Bali 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:49.640
 Well, I do not have to specialize in game stories we so often are laying 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.479
 What baseline Le presentation will lead to a lot of games I mainly Nuba stroke 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.890
 It's a modern 10s shareholder to go out and certify. 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:01.309
 But now, so players have got to let the game out yet sub 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.500
 And there's a case where I'm forcing Bali again. 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:11.119
 Sometimes I do not score directly, but I also try sub and bali 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.350
 Another words you can use to cause quite a variety of opponents mistakes again 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.350
 What is faster than most basic 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.200
 Xu fire that mountain is Hert Air Yes 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.369
 Try your server on a course where you can play well , 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.450
 Approaching 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:33.140
 So I go into the sseobol as you can do best with the course 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.829
 When you receive your opponent , 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.250
 There is no reason to go to port harbor to Israel. 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:44.509
 In its place, even entering ankkaji Israel sseup you are crazy 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.530
 I stand fast in the first place, then the sooner we have a gown Course 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.830
 So if you want to go first , 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.060
 After you put your western well 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:01.189
 The base is not going according to what day how you have to try quick 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:05.360
 It's different, but the first one is the other side. 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:09.590
 It is important to send the goal deeply . It is now the first sub and volley 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:14.209
 When you try to use it, you'll be cached . 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.140
 Even if you go back to normal , the goal is that you 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.459
 Courses available 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:24.859
 It is very important to leave the other end - endo cursor behind 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.670
 Why is the band likely to be weaker than the end- to -end? 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.940
 It's high. 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.959
 Everybody, especially you guys , it looks a lot bigger. 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.840
 B is already the amount of fans placed side you are 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.590
 It is very important to try sub and bali 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.590
 After that, if you are somewhat skilled now, 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:48.319
 That 's why . 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.590
 If you do not put the slice serve or do not do anything to the center, 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:57.720
 After spelling the other party and sending it to Leather Court 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:02.160
 Whether you are part of this it inde The important thing is you mwonyamyeon 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.319
 And I've quickly as the angle to the teeth Li said he flies first and then suck 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.040
 Can you go you have to reduce the angle 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.040
 Goalkeeper 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.900
 When you have the other 51 would have been one less each going out ttokgatahyo 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.909
 So you will spend fly naeneunde toward the fall line, such operations are 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.390
 It's very important. 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:26.299
 I put the server &amp; file and write it on your ad 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.599
 In accordance with the direction once described how should this city 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.599
 I will. 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.580
 5 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.580
 U 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.510
 no 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.510
 Please 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.739
 As I said before, 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:56.319
 The service is a bit of a free baseline moment 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:04:00.280
 Now here 's 02 What is it like to ride a nomenz Renderer so selected 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:03.400
 Death Now I'm in some mountain 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:08.230
 But when you add up the server to the ballet in this Shelby Serra 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:12.310
 It's not easy to get wide spread so you hypnotize your server 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.439
 The next time you hit your opponent's meter, 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.609
 Select seupeuriseu in place, 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:21.629
 My wife, who was quick to receive it, 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:26.460
 Canvas Bali La throw and you have the corresponding 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:30.750
 Once the cutter is opened against the opponent 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:34.050
 It's a good idea to practice today and send the ball 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.860
 Again, you have to reduce the angle again 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.960
 I have never come out taesik established relationships ought only to keep it repeatedly 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:46.099
 But the next step is 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.099
 You can control servers and development, so I think you will try Ducky 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.720
 too 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.750
 222 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.820
 222 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.160
 222 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.160
 Eia 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.970
 Oh 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.110
 5 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.860
 co 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.960
 Yes. 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.950
 Importantly, 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:00.340
 Depending on how successful you are and entering your server, you have 02 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:04.540
 If you hug me, it's fine in the middle of the day. 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:08.500
 Then you said that it is not so easy to reach the service line now . 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.610
 It's also 02 when you walk. Do not overdo it. It's really good. 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.860
 Perl 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:18.580
 If not then praise will come to easily send and have, for example, the twenty 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.770
 If I give each issue a special feature on your way to summer, the next step 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.270
 It is very important to learn. 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:28.660
 In the case of athletes, I can confidently make summer because I am confident 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:32.980
 Obama is not the rudimentary steps that serve-and-volley mwonyamyeon 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:37.420
 Once you give a kiss, and then connect the feeling to give Bo Summer deulinji in the next step 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:39.400
 When I come into the service and sell it to a certain degree, 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.540
 Can I attack you for the ball 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.470
 The Sams should now try them in those areas, and now sub and bali 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.210
 After 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:51.340
 There you are also the first ballet of the hands Step 3 so what better faster 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.210
 Can be put and variously 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:59.080
 If it is constant, the other side can paddle the advantage to the left and right in mind. 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.900
 So in the next stage of the entry- level phase, 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:06.100
 Technology is needed but the most basic 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.760
 First, the exact server to cut that you can play well 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.500
 After you leave it, you write it and you have to practice to dash it forward. 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.830
 So when you guys 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.400
 Air purification by fasting you are outrageous results 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:22.700
 Something like that happens in a moment when the other party is controversial. 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:27.350
 So that people can fly so that you can earn points danghage have made 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:31.250
 Because you try to be important , you must try 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:34.700
 I have to try and get into the front of 4 and keep trying the grass. 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:38.030
 Now how to play some of what is there for him in 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:41.870
 You will realize that you will develop yourself 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:44.020
 So I hope you will lead a healthy and happy life through Zenith. 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.020
 Thank you
