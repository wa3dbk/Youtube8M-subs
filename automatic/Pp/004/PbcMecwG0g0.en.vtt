feature<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.460> guess<00:01:14.760> where<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.570> turn<00:01:15.780> on

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
feature I guess where you can turn on

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
feature I guess where you can turn on
lights<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.920> prior<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.210> walking

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
lights when prior to you know walking

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.499 
lights when prior to you know walking
into<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> home<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.240> it's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
into the home so that's all it is it's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.870 
into the home so that's all it is it's
just<00:01:21.720> simply<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> remote<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.770> comes<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
just simply a remote it comes with a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.170 
just simply a remote it comes with a
little<00:01:24.259> wall<00:01:25.259> socket<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.340> plug<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
little wall socket that you plug in and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
little wall socket that you plug in and
then<00:01:27.659> pray<00:01:27.840> basically<00:01:28.500> anything<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
then pray basically anything that you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.030 
then pray basically anything that you
plug<00:01:29.490> into<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> little<00:01:30.240> socket<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> what<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
plug into that little socket is what you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
plug into that little socket is what you
can<00:01:32.250> control<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.540> remote<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.140> I

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
can control with the remote so I

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350 
can control with the remote so I
actually<00:01:34.590> turn<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.100> vanity<00:01:35.579> light<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.299> off

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
the fact that it does autofocus by

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.879 
the fact that it does autofocus by
itself<00:03:48.509> I<00:03:48.780> don't<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.259> worry<00:03:49.439> about<00:03:49.560> that

great as well but with the DSLR I always

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.289 
great as well but with the DSLR I always
use<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.739> like<00:04:11.129> a<00:04:11.280> manual<00:04:11.519> mode<00:04:11.879> so

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
yourself and when the different light

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.480 
yourself and when the different light
times<00:04:21.299> would<00:04:21.900> change<00:04:22.169> like<00:04:22.590> especially<00:04:23.219> with

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
times would change like especially with

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.279 
times would change like especially with
my<00:04:23.580> makeup<00:04:23.789> tutorials<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.539> noticed<00:04:24.900> with<00:04:25.050> that

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
my makeup tutorials I noticed with that

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.720 
my makeup tutorials I noticed with that
if<00:04:26.279> the<00:04:26.430> Sun

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
if the Sun

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.310 
if the Sun
was<00:04:26.820> going<00:04:27.090> down<00:04:27.270> my<00:04:27.570> lighting<00:04:27.900> would<00:04:27.990> change

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
was going down my lighting would change

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.990 
was going down my lighting would change
which<00:04:28.620> was<00:04:28.800> one<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> main<00:04:29.460> reasons<00:04:29.850> why<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
which was one of the main reasons why I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.660 
which was one of the main reasons why I
was<00:04:30.240> in<00:04:30.420> dire<00:04:30.630> need<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.410> ring<00:04:31.680> light<00:04:31.890> so

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
was in dire need of a ring light so

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.330 
was in dire need of a ring light so
that's<00:04:33.090> pretty<00:04:33.420> much<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:34.020> for<00:04:34.500> my<00:04:34.770> filming

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340
