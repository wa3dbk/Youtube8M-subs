that we created a dog that needs care
from<00:03:24.079> their<00:03:24.290> companions<00:03:25.069> from<00:03:25.340> humans<00:03:25.819> and

people and when we don't give them that

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.440 
people and when we don't give them that
then<00:03:29.720> it's<00:03:30.230> like<00:03:30.739> we<00:03:31.040> made<00:03:31.250> an<00:03:31.489> accident<00:03:32.120> and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450
