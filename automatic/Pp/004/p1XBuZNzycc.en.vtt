shuttle lady works itself what we did is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.510 
shuttle lady works itself what we did is
we<00:01:03.600> download<00:01:04.050> software<00:01:04.620> before<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.100> left<00:01:05.250> on

ireland's I believe there's more or as
well<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.690> free<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> what's<00:01:14.250> really

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
well and it's free and what's really

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.030 
well and it's free and what's really
good<00:01:14.880> about<00:01:14.910> it<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.900> does<00:01:16.140> basically<00:01:16.530> what

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
good about it is it does basically what

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.770 
good about it is it does basically what
the<00:01:17.160> teacher<00:01:17.370> does<00:01:17.760> you<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> pay

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the teacher does you don't have to pay

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
the teacher does you don't have to pay
for<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.350> based<00:01:19.620> on<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.800> trembling<00:01:20.130> look

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
for it so based on your trembling look

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.760 
for it so based on your trembling look
out<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.480> it<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.110> quite<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> big<00:01:22.530> download

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
out for that it was quite a big download

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.460 
out for that it was quite a big download
it<00:01:23.070> was<00:01:23.190> over<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> gigabyte<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> US<00:01:24.600> UK

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it was over a gigabyte for the US UK

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.700 
it was over a gigabyte for the US UK
while<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> about<00:01:27.020> 300-350<00:01:28.020> megabytes

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
while i think is about 300-350 megabytes

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
while i think is about 300-350 megabytes
but<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.370> really<00:01:29.640> does<00:01:29.880> work<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.150> well<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
but it really does work really well I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.110 
but it really does work really well I
think<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.230> stand<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:31.620> turn<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
think you can stand my turn to you

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.530 
think you can stand my turn to you
telling<00:01:33.510> you<00:01:33.660> where<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.410> go<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> that's<00:01:36.360> just

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
telling you where to go so that's just

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.150 
telling you where to go so that's just
one<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.080> things<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.560> know<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.770> coming<00:01:37.950> up

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
one of the things i know is coming up
