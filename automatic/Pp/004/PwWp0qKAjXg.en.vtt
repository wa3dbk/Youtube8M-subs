00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.669
 hello how about very good guys 

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:06.979
 Welcome to this new gameplay of 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.950
 I play lego the hobbit and we are with a 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.540
 new character unlocking now 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.980
 same then let's unlock a 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.540
 character that they have been asking me for 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.540
 you in the comments 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.110
 where we have it 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.410
 It is not here 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.600
 ok here we have it this is for 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.180
 armor so we select the 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.400
 destination towards him and we have to go up 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.400
 this area that is the top of the winds 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.840
 so now we're going to put on a 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.110
 horse 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.230
 so we will get faster to the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.100
 character that we want to unlock 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.810
 we just have to follow the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.810
 trail of yellow coins 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.770

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.020
 our horse to pass over 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.659
 the door 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.780

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.140

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.620
 lego moneditas 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.770

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.220

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.119
