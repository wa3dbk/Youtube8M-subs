but after a while its softened up and it
might<00:02:35.260> look<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:35.500> dag<00:02:35.890> splits<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.310> lot<00:02:36.520> slicker

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
might look like dag splits a lot slicker

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.000 
might look like dag splits a lot slicker
than<00:02:37.090> dex<00:02:37.740> it's<00:02:38.740> much<00:02:39.040> softer<00:02:40.530> moulds<00:02:41.530> easily

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
than dex it's much softer moulds easily

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.199 
than dex it's much softer moulds easily
into<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.250> hand<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.520> just<00:02:45.670> goes<00:02:45.850> on<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:46.060> lot

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
into the hand and it just goes on a lot

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.510 
into the hand and it just goes on a lot
easier<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.860> good<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.160> know<00:02:48.280> they're

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
easier and it's good to know they're

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.470 
easier and it's good to know they're
washes<00:02:48.970> out<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> lot<00:02:49.540> easier<00:02:49.870> than<00:02:49.959> Dax<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:51.480> if

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
washes out a lot easier than Dax so if

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.550 
washes out a lot easier than Dax so if
you<00:02:52.690> had<00:02:52.870> some<00:02:53.200> trouble<00:02:53.709> with<00:02:53.890> Dax<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:55.560> you're

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
you had some trouble with Dax and you're

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.040 
you had some trouble with Dax and you're
a<00:02:56.590> bit<00:02:56.860> nervous<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.700> use<00:02:57.910> stronger<00:02:58.540> pomades

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050
