00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.360 
all matters now because this one's done
this<00:03:25.120> one's<00:03:25.330> behind<00:03:25.630> us<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.860> now<00:03:26.950> we<00:03:27.100> have<00:03:27.250> to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
this one's behind us and now we have to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.400 
this one's behind us and now we have to
just<00:03:27.550> get<00:03:27.670> ready<00:03:27.760> for<00:03:27.910> Minnesota<00:03:28.270> we<00:03:29.140> wanted

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
just get ready for Minnesota we wanted

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.530 
just get ready for Minnesota we wanted
to<00:03:29.590> build<00:03:29.950> momentum<00:03:30.190> as<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.790> season<00:03:31.300> went<00:03:31.450> on

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
to build momentum as the season went on

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.850 
to build momentum as the season went on
and<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.959> think<00:03:32.140> we've<00:03:32.260> done<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.410> little<00:03:32.560> bit<00:03:32.709> of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
and I think we've done a little bit of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.250 
and I think we've done a little bit of
that<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.250> each<00:03:34.000> weeks<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.360> new<00:03:34.480> week<00:03:34.690> right<00:03:34.989> so

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
that but each weeks a new week right so

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.100 
that but each weeks a new week right so
once<00:03:35.560> we<00:03:35.739> kick<00:03:36.580> off<00:03:36.700> next<00:03:36.760> week<00:03:37.180> what<00:03:37.900> happened

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
once we kick off next week what happened

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.600 
once we kick off next week what happened
in<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.260> past<00:03:38.410> won't<00:03:38.709> really<00:03:38.860> matter<00:03:39.130> right<00:03:39.340> I

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
in the past won't really matter right I

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.220
