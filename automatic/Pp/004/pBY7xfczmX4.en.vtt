spiderman figure now this is probably

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.249 
spiderman figure now this is probably
the<00:00:24.259> most<00:00:24.680> similar<00:00:25.669> to<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:26.509> animated<00:00:27.020> series

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
the most similar to the animated series

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.900 
the most similar to the animated series
from<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:27.710> 90s<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:28.369> if<00:00:28.460> that's<00:00:28.640> what<00:00:28.790> you're

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
from the 90s so if that's what you're

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.700 
from the 90s so if that's what you're
looking<00:00:29.180> for<00:00:29.390> this<00:00:29.570> is<00:00:29.630> probably<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.529> one

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
looking for this is probably the one

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.799 
looking for this is probably the one
you're<00:00:31.309> going<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.610> want<00:00:31.669> to<00:00:31.849> get<00:00:32.029> all<00:00:32.239> the

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
you're going to want to get all the

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.240 
you're going to want to get all the
lines<00:00:33.050> are<00:00:33.260> just<00:00:33.350> painted<00:00:33.770> on<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.130> it's

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
lines are just painted on so it's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.100 
lines are just painted on so it's
reminiscent<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.120> older<00:00:35.570> spider-man

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
shares at least some I think all of the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.170 
shares at least some I think all of the
body<00:00:51.860> not<00:00:52.070> counting<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.490> hands<00:00:52.700> and<00:00:52.910> head<00:00:53.060> of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.069 
body not counting the hands and head of
course<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:54.160> electro<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:56.300> good<00:00:56.450> electro<00:00:56.900> that

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
course of electro the good electro that

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.470 
course of electro the good electro that
I<00:00:57.110> reviewed<00:00:57.470> recently<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.280> also<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:59.360> think

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
I reviewed recently and also I think

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.080 
I reviewed recently and also I think
there's<00:00:59.870> also<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.560> Reed<00:01:01.130> Richards<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.760> uses

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
there's also a Reed Richards that uses

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.410 
there's also a Reed Richards that uses
this<00:01:02.270> body<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.050> I<00:01:03.140> think<00:01:03.759> part<00:01:04.759> maybe<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
this body and I think part maybe the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.560 
this body and I think part maybe the
feet<00:01:05.810> are<00:01:06.079> angel<00:01:06.799> maybe<00:01:07.670> maybe<00:01:08.090> they're<00:01:08.299> not<00:01:08.360> I

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
feet are angel maybe maybe they're not I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.030 
feet are angel maybe maybe they're not I
remember<00:01:08.930> maybe<00:01:09.079> angels<00:01:09.530> had<00:01:09.649> in<00:01:09.799> there<00:01:09.920> at

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
remember maybe angels had in there at

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.300 
remember maybe angels had in there at

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
all

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.649 
all
I<00:01:10.340> thought<00:01:10.640> he<00:01:10.790> was<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.119> other<00:01:11.210> day<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:11.479> I

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
I thought he was the other day but I

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.749 
I thought he was the other day but I
don't<00:01:11.840> think<00:01:11.990> he<00:01:12.079> is<00:01:12.110> no<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:13.340> funny<00:01:13.520> thing

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
don't think he is no the funny thing

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.270 
don't think he is no the funny thing
about<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:14.299> because<00:01:14.720> uh<00:01:15.069> when<00:01:16.069> I<00:01:16.100> would

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
about that is because uh when I would

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
did the electro review I made a note of

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.919 
did the electro review I made a note of
how<00:01:18.289> good<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.740> butterfly<00:01:19.130> joint<00:01:19.429> is<00:01:19.689> why<00:01:20.689> do<00:01:20.749> I

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
how good the butterfly joint is why do I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:21.999 
how good the butterfly joint is why do I
keep<00:01:21.139> doing<00:01:21.409> that

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
keep doing that

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.050 
keep doing that
every<00:01:22.219> time<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:22.429> look<00:01:22.579> at<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.789> figures

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
every time I look at the figures

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.580 
every time I look at the figures
butterfly<00:01:23.539> joint<00:01:23.810> they<00:01:23.960> go<00:01:24.079> flying<00:01:24.319> off<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
butterfly joint they go flying off the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.849 
butterfly joint they go flying off the
table<00:01:24.859> his<00:01:25.670> butterfly<00:01:26.149> joint<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.659> no<00:01:27.020> bueno<00:01:27.409> it

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
table his butterfly joint is no bueno it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.499 
table his butterfly joint is no bueno it
doesn't<00:01:28.219> work<00:01:28.369> at<00:01:28.609> all<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:29.090> one's<00:01:29.299> all

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
doesn't work at all this one's all

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.899 
doesn't work at all this one's all
gunked<00:01:29.929> up<00:01:30.049> can't<00:01:30.590> use<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.219> that's<00:01:31.579> weird

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
gunked up can't use it so that's weird

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.160 
gunked up can't use it so that's weird
that<00:01:31.969> it<00:01:32.179> worked<00:01:32.329> for<00:01:32.539> one<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.810> not<00:01:32.899> for<00:01:33.079> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
that it worked for one and not for the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.469 
that it worked for one and not for the
other<00:01:33.289> it<00:01:34.009> is<00:01:34.189> still<00:01:34.609> a<00:01:34.639> really<00:01:34.880> nice<00:01:35.090> sculpt

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
other it is still a really nice sculpt

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.270 
other it is still a really nice sculpt
all<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.020> musculature<00:01:36.469> though<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
all the musculature though the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.469 
all the musculature though the
proportions<00:01:37.819> are<00:01:37.939> off<00:01:38.090> due<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.329> the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
proportions are off due to the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.779 
proportions are off due to the
articulation<00:01:38.749> the<00:01:39.679> musculature<00:01:40.219> is<00:01:40.520> really

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
articulation the musculature is really

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.489 
articulation the musculature is really
organic<00:01:41.270> looking<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:41.719> do<00:01:41.840> appreciate<00:01:42.200> that

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
organic looking so I do appreciate that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:45.099 
organic looking so I do appreciate that
he<00:01:43.369> stands<00:01:43.759> just<00:01:43.969> about<00:01:44.450> 6<00:01:44.749> and<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:44.929> quarter

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
he stands just about 6 and a quarter

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.959 
he stands just about 6 and a quarter
inches<00:01:45.499> tall<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:45.829> I<00:01:46.039> guess<00:01:46.219> that's<00:01:46.429> ok<00:01:46.759> for

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
inches tall so I guess that's ok for

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.599 
inches tall so I guess that's ok for
spider-man<00:01:47.270> maybe<00:01:47.600> just<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:48.049> hair<00:01:48.799> too<00:01:49.069> tall<00:01:49.340> I

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
spider-man maybe just a hair too tall I

that he only has web-shooter hands so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.810

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
his pose ability is limited which is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.900 
his pose ability is limited which is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.370 
web-shooter hands so i can't complain
too<00:02:39.950> much<00:02:40.280> my<00:02:40.580> complaint<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.390> in<00:02:42.170> order

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
too much my complaint is that in order

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.830 
too much my complaint is that in order
to<00:02:42.590> line<00:02:42.830> up<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.280> musculature<00:02:43.850> for<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.450> arms

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
to line up the musculature for the arms

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.630 
to line up the musculature for the arms
the<00:02:45.590> hands<00:02:45.860> point<00:02:46.220> in<00:02:46.310> different<00:02:46.400> directions

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the hands point in different directions

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.270 
the hands point in different directions
kind<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.990> would<00:02:48.380> have<00:02:48.470> preferred<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.100> a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
kind of so I would have preferred just a

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.370 
kind of so I would have preferred just a
standard<00:02:49.760> flip<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.750> they're<00:02:50.900> both<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
standard flip so they're both in the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.750 
standard flip so they're both in the
same<00:02:51.560> direction<00:02:51.740> but<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.280> can<00:02:52.430> just<00:02:52.610> rotate

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
same direction but you can just rotate

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.550 
same direction but you can just rotate
it<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.240> that's<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.660> being<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.050> little<00:02:54.410> bit

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
it so that's just being a little bit

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.720 
it so that's just being a little bit
picky<00:02:55.010> but<00:02:55.850> that's<00:02:56.300> what<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.660> review<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:57.050> for

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
picky but that's what the review is for

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.130 
picky but that's what the review is for
so<00:02:58.730> now<00:02:58.850> we<00:02:58.910> have<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.239> ab<00:02:59.360> crunch<00:02:59.390> which<00:02:59.900> works

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
so now we have the ab crunch which works

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.930 
so now we have the ab crunch which works
really<00:03:00.260> well<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.980> they<00:03:01.100> painted<00:03:01.459> all<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.820> way

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
really well and they painted all the way

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.479 
really well and they painted all the way
through<00:03:02.330> on<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:03.140> front<00:03:03.470> on<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.709> back<00:03:04.340> they

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
through on the front on the back they

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.190 
through on the front on the back they
didn't<00:03:04.730> have<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:05.330> that's<00:03:05.480> okay<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.080> ab

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
didn't have to but that's okay the ab

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.190 
didn't have to but that's okay the ab
crunch<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.770> great<00:03:07.160> sculpt<00:03:08.120> wise<00:03:08.330> articulation

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
crunch is great sculpt wise articulation

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.340 
crunch is great sculpt wise articulation
wise<00:03:09.350> paint<00:03:09.770> wise<00:03:09.980> no<00:03:10.790> complaints<00:03:11.450> at<00:03:11.630> all<00:03:11.690> we

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
wise paint wise no complaints at all we

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.650 
wise paint wise no complaints at all we
have<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.470> waist<00:03:12.739> swivel<00:03:13.040> here<00:03:13.430> T<00:03:14.030> jointed<00:03:14.420> hips

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
have a waist swivel here T jointed hips

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.650 
have a waist swivel here T jointed hips
they<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.260> have<00:03:15.680> kind<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.100> small<00:03:16.610> ball<00:03:17.180> hinges

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
they do have kind of small ball hinges

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.270 
they do have kind of small ball hinges
if<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.230> ball<00:03:18.440> hinge<00:03:18.680> was<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.860> little<00:03:19.160> bit

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
if the ball hinge was a little bit

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.680 
if the ball hinge was a little bit
bigger<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.640> think<00:03:20.120> we<00:03:20.239> would<00:03:20.390> have<00:03:20.480> been<00:03:20.570> able

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
bigger I think we would have been able

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.940 
bigger I think we would have been able
to<00:03:20.750> get<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.930> little<00:03:21.110> bit<00:03:21.320> better<00:03:21.530> range<00:03:21.830> of

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
to get a little bit better range of

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.670 
to get a little bit better range of
motion<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.880> side<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.300> side<00:03:23.510> no<00:03:23.750> problem<00:03:24.230> it's

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
motion but side to side no problem it's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.470 
motion but side to side no problem it's
just<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.010> little<00:03:25.310> bit<00:03:25.430> limited<00:03:25.820> going<00:03:25.970> forward

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
just a little bit limited going forward

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.840 
just a little bit limited going forward
we<00:03:26.630> can't<00:03:26.840> even<00:03:27.020> go<00:03:27.400> perfectly<00:03:28.400> straight<00:03:28.670> out

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
we can't even go perfectly straight out

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.229 
we can't even go perfectly straight out
again<00:03:29.239> it's<00:03:29.810> being<00:03:30.110> picky<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:31.180> compared<00:03:32.180> to

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
again it's being picky but compared to

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.270 
again it's being picky but compared to
the<00:03:32.570> current<00:03:32.810> spider-man<00:03:33.380> figure<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:33.920> it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
the current spider-man figure it is it
