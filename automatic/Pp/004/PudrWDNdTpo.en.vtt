you<00:00:44.149> would<00:00:44.270> call<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.899> modern<00:00:45.199> Explorer

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
you would call a modern Explorer

whenever<00:00:47.110> whenever<00:00:48.110> we<00:00:48.470> travel<00:00:48.829> he's<00:00:49.310> always

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
whenever whenever we travel he's always

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.970 
whenever whenever we travel he's always
always<00:00:49.940> always<00:00:50.420> looking<00:00:50.960> for<00:00:51.200> some<00:00:51.380> rock

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
always always looking for some rock

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.930 
always always looking for some rock
always<00:00:53.230> going<00:00:54.230> for<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.560> little<00:00:54.649> cave<00:00:55.100> always

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
always going for the little cave always

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.350 
always going for the little cave always
making<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.450> extra<00:00:56.720> effort<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:58.180> discovery<00:00:59.180> and

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
making the extra effort of discovery and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.330 
making the extra effort of discovery and
exploration<00:00:59.480> even<00:01:00.200> if<00:01:00.829> it's<00:01:00.980> going<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.250> be

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
exploration even if it's going to be

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.929 
exploration even if it's going to be
absolutely<00:01:02.230> uninteresting<00:01:03.230> but<00:01:03.790> because<00:01:04.790> of

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
absolutely uninteresting but because of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.219 
absolutely uninteresting but because of
that<00:01:05.170> sometimes<00:01:06.340> it<00:01:07.340> gets<00:01:07.399> to<00:01:07.670> find<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.229> little

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
that sometimes it gets to find a little

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.760 
that sometimes it gets to find a little
extracting<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:11.079> that's<00:01:12.079> how<00:01:12.259> we<00:01:12.320> found<00:01:12.649> they

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
extracting so that's how we found they

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.310 
extracting so that's how we found they
we<00:01:12.860> need<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.100> somehow<00:01:13.670> he<00:01:13.909> got<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.869> info

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
we need you somehow he got the info

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.550 
we need you somehow he got the info
about<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:15.829> place<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.689> somehow<00:01:17.689> we<00:01:18.229> wanted

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
about this place and somehow we wanted

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.129 
about this place and somehow we wanted
to<00:01:18.679> drive<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.950> little<00:01:19.399> bit<00:01:19.520> more<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.990> we

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
to drive a little bit more so we

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.779 
to drive a little bit more so we
actually<00:01:21.530> found<00:01:21.679> a<00:01:21.829> sector<00:01:22.249> and<00:01:23.259> then<00:01:24.259> and

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
actually found a sector and then and

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.300 
actually found a sector and then and
then<00:01:25.789> he's<00:01:26.240> got<00:01:26.450> as<00:01:26.569> well<00:01:26.719> this<00:01:26.990> this<00:01:27.799> thing

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
then he's got as well this this thing

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.569 
then he's got as well this this thing
that<00:01:28.340> people<00:01:28.729> don't<00:01:29.090> have<00:01:29.270> sometimes<00:01:30.020> it's

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
that people don't have sometimes it's

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.519 
that people don't have sometimes it's
not<00:01:31.579> only<00:01:31.819> you<00:01:32.090> have<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.270> find<00:01:32.749> but<00:01:33.109> then<00:01:33.319> you

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:33.529 
not only you have to find but then you

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:38.109 
not only you have to find but then you
have<00:01:33.649> to<00:01:33.950> exploit<00:01:34.789> and<00:01:36.639> when<00:01:37.639> he's<00:01:37.789> got<00:01:37.969> an

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
have to exploit and when he's got an

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.940 
have to exploit and when he's got an
idea<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:38.509> his<00:01:38.600> head<00:01:38.659> is<00:01:39.049> not<00:01:39.109> going<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.770> leave

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
idea in his head is not going to leave

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.899 
idea in his head is not going to leave
it<00:01:40.069> go<00:01:40.249> so<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:42.590> bolted<00:01:42.799> like<00:01:43.009> animals<00:01:43.700> for

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
it go so we bolted like animals for

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.209 
it go so we bolted like animals for
seven<00:01:44.240> days<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.659> James<00:01:45.259> would<00:01:45.469> wake<00:01:45.679> me<00:01:45.920> up<00:01:46.039> at

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
seven days and James would wake me up at

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:47.889 
seven days and James would wake me up at
six<00:01:46.490> o<00:01:46.609> clock<00:01:46.639> because<00:01:47.060> he<00:01:47.329> wanted<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.749> go

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
six o clock because he wanted to go

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.629 
six o clock because he wanted to go
bolting<00:01:48.289> he<00:01:48.560> didn't<00:01:48.829> want<00:01:49.039> to<00:01:49.159> stop<00:01:49.369> for<00:01:49.549> a

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
bolting he didn't want to stop for a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:53.379 
bolting he didn't want to stop for a
coffee<00:01:49.849> made<00:01:50.659> me<00:01:50.840> angry<00:01:51.259> but<00:01:51.999> well<00:01:52.999> it<00:01:53.240> made

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:53.389 
coffee made me angry but well it made

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:56.620 
coffee made me angry but well it made
the<00:01:53.569> sector<00:01:53.959> I<00:01:54.369> wasn't<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.520> seven<00:01:56.119> more

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the sector I wasn't really seven more

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.480 
the sector I wasn't really seven more
like<00:01:56.810> four<00:01:57.139> but<00:01:58.099> Carolyn<00:01:58.789> has<00:01:58.969> a<00:01:58.999> habit<00:01:59.240> of

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
like four but Carolyn has a habit of

she's<00:02:03.850> tired<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.680> don't<00:02:05.680> know<00:02:05.770> why<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.010> happens

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
she's tired I don't know why it happens

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.609 
she's tired I don't know why it happens
but<00:02:06.670> sometimes<00:02:07.479> when<00:02:07.810> you're<00:02:07.990> when<00:02:08.470> you're

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
traveling when you leave things open to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.930 
traveling when you leave things open to
chance<00:02:12.330> fate<00:02:13.330> has<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> habit<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.670> sending<00:02:15.670> you

when<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:18.610> drive<00:02:18.880> through<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.300> village<00:02:19.569> and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
when you drive through the village and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.720 
when you drive through the village and
out<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.140> other<00:02:20.170> side<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:21.190> really<00:02:21.310> takes<00:02:21.610> your

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
breath away

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.510 
breath away
it's<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:24.010> endless<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> things<00:02:27.400> I've

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
it's just endless one of the things I've

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.400 
it's just endless one of the things I've
always<00:02:27.640> been<00:02:27.940> taken<00:02:28.300> by<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.900> climbing<00:02:29.290> is

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
always been taken by and climbing is

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.580 
always been taken by and climbing is
doing<00:02:29.680> new<00:02:29.830> routes<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.780> creating<00:02:32.290> something

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
doing new routes but creating something

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.380 
doing new routes but creating something
from<00:02:32.830> nothing<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.459> a<00:02:33.790> process<00:02:34.209> that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
from nothing it's a process that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.830 
from nothing it's a process that
inspires<00:02:35.260> me<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.470> lot<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.910> when<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.239> when<00:02:37.810> I

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
inspires me a lot and when this when I

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.810 
inspires me a lot and when this when I
moved<00:02:38.110> on<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.320> sport<00:02:38.590> climbing<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:39.100> started<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
moved on to sport climbing I started to

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.850 
moved on to sport climbing I started to
devolve<00:02:40.360> roots<00:02:40.630> rather<00:02:41.290> than<00:02:41.410> search<00:02:41.650> out<00:02:41.830> new

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
devolve roots rather than search out new

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.370 
devolve roots rather than search out new
tread<00:02:42.190> lines<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.720> for<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.750> long<00:02:43.870> time<00:02:44.080> now<00:02:44.260> I've

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
tread lines and for a long time now I've

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.500 
tread lines and for a long time now I've
been<00:02:44.410> dreaming<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.950> finding<00:02:45.160> not<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.360> new

line<00:02:46.750> but<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.290> new<00:02:47.620> area<00:02:48.300> developing<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.390> whole

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
line but a a new area developing a whole

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.810 
line but a a new area developing a whole
sector<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.440> well<00:02:50.620> that's<00:02:50.890> that's<00:02:51.430> exactly

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
sector and well that's that's exactly

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.750 
sector and well that's that's exactly
what<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:52.030> could<00:02:52.150> doing<00:02:52.390> Leanne<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.690> do<00:02:53.519> we<00:02:54.519> spend

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
what we could doing Leanne I do we spend

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.600 
what we could doing Leanne I do we spend
the<00:02:54.850> first<00:02:55.000> day<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.450> driving<00:02:55.840> around

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the first day just driving around

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.370

what<00:03:02.590> would<00:03:02.709> work<00:03:02.860> best<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:04.600> end<00:03:04.750> we<00:03:05.079> chose

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
what would work best in the end we chose

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.699 
what would work best in the end we chose

band of red rock an old water boiler I

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.220 
band of red rock an old water boiler I
imagine<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.489> underneath<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.420> some<00:03:13.690> older

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230

goats

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.970 

it's<00:03:19.970> always<00:03:20.150> difficult<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.659> imagine<00:03:20.989> how

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
it's always difficult to imagine how

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.550 
it's always difficult to imagine how
something<00:03:22.280> will<00:03:22.549> be<00:03:22.670> after<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:23.390> equipped<00:03:23.780> to

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
something will be after it's equipped to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.890 
something will be after it's equipped to
this<00:03:25.250> vision<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.730> where<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> lines<00:03:26.329> go<00:03:26.689> and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
this vision of where the lines go and

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.869 
this vision of where the lines go and
what<00:03:27.379> will<00:03:27.530> work<00:03:27.709> what<00:03:28.069> we<00:03:28.189> were<00:03:28.280> not<00:03:28.459> working

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
what will work what we were not working

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:44.400 
what will work what we were not working
what<00:03:29.269> will<00:03:29.390> be<00:03:29.510> good<00:03:29.659> and<00:03:29.840> what<00:03:30.170> we<00:03:30.319> bad

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.800 

so<00:03:45.410> yesterday<00:03:45.620> we<00:03:45.980> started<00:03:46.450> with<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.600> first

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
so yesterday we started with the first

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.680 
so yesterday we started with the first
three<00:03:48.530> words<00:03:49.150> voting<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:51.160> today<00:03:52.160> is<00:03:52.370> a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
three words voting and today is a

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:04.680 
three words voting and today is a
climbing<00:03:53.690> time

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.600 

I<00:04:04.720> think<00:04:05.440> more<00:04:05.590> than<00:04:05.620> anything<00:04:05.920> we<00:04:06.130> got<00:04:06.280> super

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
I think more than anything we got super

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.340 
I think more than anything we got super
lucky<00:04:06.640> they're<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.660> Rockies<00:04:07.990> generally

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
lucky they're the Rockies generally

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.530 
lucky they're the Rockies generally
great<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:09.070> lines<00:04:09.280> are<00:04:09.430> quite<00:04:09.520> evident<00:04:09.880> and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
great the lines are quite evident and

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.020 
great the lines are quite evident and
after<00:04:10.930> four<00:04:11.290> days<00:04:11.470> work<00:04:11.740> we<00:04:12.460> finished<00:04:12.790> with

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
after four days work we finished with

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.590 
after four days work we finished with
seven<00:04:13.690> new<00:04:13.810> routes<00:04:14.050> up<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.740> well<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:16.360> hardest

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
seven new routes up to well the hardest

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.870 
seven new routes up to well the hardest
to<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:16.870> couldn't<00:04:17.709> finish<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:18.130> remain<00:04:18.459> projects

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
to I couldn't finish the remain projects

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.290 
to I couldn't finish the remain projects
but<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:20.650> going<00:04:20.920> to<00:04:20.980> be<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.130> yeah<00:04:21.700> they're

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
but it's going to be a yeah they're

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.650 
but it's going to be a yeah they're
going<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.450> be<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.570> good<00:04:22.720> level<00:04:22.900> I'm<00:04:23.170> sure

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
going to be a good level I'm sure

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.180 
going to be a good level I'm sure
that's<00:04:25.660> more<00:04:25.840> important<00:04:26.260> than<00:04:26.290> that<00:04:26.500> is<00:04:26.740> the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
that's more important than that is the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.060 
that's more important than that is the
quality<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.790> routes<00:04:28.770> it's<00:04:29.770> maybe<00:04:29.980> a

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
quality of the routes it's maybe a

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.560 
quality of the routes it's maybe a
little<00:04:30.100> arrogant<00:04:30.670> to<00:04:30.790> say<00:04:31.000> because<00:04:31.360> there

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
little arrogant to say because there

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.300 
little arrogant to say because there
there<00:04:31.780> are<00:04:31.930> routes<00:04:32.170> but<00:04:32.410> there<00:04:32.980> are<00:04:33.040> only<00:04:33.100> some

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
there are routes but there are only some

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.010 
there are routes but there are only some
of<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.460> better<00:04:33.670> spore<00:04:34.330> routes<00:04:34.510> I've<00:04:34.630> climbed

lean idea was the the end of the trip
but<00:05:10.290> it's<00:05:10.440> really<00:05:10.560> not<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.830> end<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.100> story
