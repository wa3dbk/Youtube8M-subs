00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.730
 hi everyone welcome immediately 2 the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:14.280
 video channel without editing and the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.970
 low definition and today perhaps every 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.140
 day who I know I will read to you 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:25.890
 asked for bizarre news noise 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:30.230
 taken from various sites quietly a little 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:35.480
 inspired me on a long, crazy spy 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.980
 I'm not good at commenting on him 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 you would n't like this news 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.789
 read then find them for the network e 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:52.620
 share them with then then this is it 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:57.539
 talks about a sex simulator for the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 distant pairs and taken from the site 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.769
 news point of the world. keep a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.540
 long distance relationship is known can be 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.680
 difficult to see little and lose of 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.369
 intimacy 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 technology sometimes tries to fill 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.049
 some of the difficulties that couples 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.900
 meet when they are far away 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.750
 I personally do n't know yet I don't have 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.430
 read the article I read it with you me 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.150
 seems a little bullshit because 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.020
 anyway 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.670
 in these things the fundamental is 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 presence, in short, I find inconceivable 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:49.540
 a report of the constantly to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:53.160
 distance maybe maybe somewhere 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.290
 neighbors and spend time at the computer 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.660
 that is, to relate not hano instead 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.760
 you have to see if it's one thing 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:06.300
 in short, the so-called fundamental 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.850
 sexting I hope I have pronounced 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.530
 correctly a widespread practice too 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.530
 if sometimes to some contraindication 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.930
 let's see let's see together then now had 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.330
 a Taiwanese company has developed a 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.530
 device to allow partners 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.440
 which are currency to prove themselves 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.440
 physically their love 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.930
 it is actually a pair of 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.900
 devices called zeus and was the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.180
 whose use is certainly not needed 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.300
 in short we explain we understand 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.720
 the peculiarity is that zeus and was yes 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.120
 connect to an app on smartphones e 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.760
 they are able to transmit movements 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.550
 and the pressure they suffer at 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.580
 twin device at the other end of the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.640
 video call sincerely a thing of the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.290
 It had occurred to me many years 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.220
 ago however it is an idea that I rejected with o 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.760
 rejected in departure for the lovers who 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.730
 they want to make an unusual gift there 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.320
 also a limited edition version of the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.440
 gold-plated devices during 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.269
 10 thousand dollars despite the producers 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.510
 define the new idea 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.150
 the most fascinating invention for iphone 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.879
 but it was 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.790
 realized so far apparently have 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.890
 had some difficulty a 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.360
 publicize it decree in short gold but 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.189
 already for me it is something useless that is a 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.349
 just a curiosity 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:53.840
 let alone gold-plated so far 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.129
 so far they apparently have had 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.409
 some difficulty in publicizing it 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:04.970
 at least in the normal channels of the 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.440
 accessories and smartphone apps that 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.879
 sometimes they would have difficulties to 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.470
 accept a red light accessory 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:18.280
 the article the article is finished and meanwhile 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.739
 before closing I invite you to 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.039

 company unpublished songs on 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.210
 measure low soundtracks do not go up 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.909
 customized commercials 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.830
 radio documentaries speaking in 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.590
 positioned video audio video for 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.690
 in other words artists for some else 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.510
 hundred is etc. 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:10.520
 this could be an idea that of 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:12.289
 end the video with with these 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.620
 information 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:18.979
 I know he can give us for those he finds 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.780
 these videos are by chance though they are 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.100
 of vehicles that 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.930
 always lead to roads to 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.920
 main streets and things that I do 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.970
 affect 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.910
 who knows that in addition to videos in real life 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.630
 to the so - called company videos 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:44.750
 can't read you any more 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:48.139
 most interesting curious that set 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.300
 a bit arouse mainly mine 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.500
 caution 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.690
 now another one is coming to mind 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.690
 things why you always look not 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:03.770
 the goal is never the screen because I am 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.520
 being spontaneous videos therefore not 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.740
 not absolutely tiring about it 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.690
 shields because it finds me more finds 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:18.080
 however st 1 december they were 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:20.810
 saying, in short, we go 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.650
 attention to videos and the channel 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.479
 Main things that interest me 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.910
 more and maybe I hope to tell you about 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:38.300
 news reports that I skip it 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:41.419
 jump to the eyes video is prudent vi 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:45.530
 I arrange an appointment with you at 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:50.060
 next video I'm thinking a little about her 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.020
 how I like the thing to tell you about the 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.150
 my thoughts 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.670
 when they come to me even if it does n't matter 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:00.460
 nothing this reminds me of 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.410
 it is absolutely a very ugly copy 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.020
 we said crazy naked but also a 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.720
 youtube act that talks about the news that 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.820
 it's also a way to advertise too 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.620
 if they don't need to which they don't 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.840
 need advertising prof 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.090
 maybe there is someone who does not recognize from 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.360
 a crazy side he knows he comments on 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:23.810
 news in a fun way and on the other 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.420
 dry side shooter ezio i think i have 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:29.230
 pronounced right they waste suter ezio 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:35.080
 that he goes well makes a real tg 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:40.370
 well well done absolutely 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:43.850
 fantastic nothing is inspired by it now 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:48.140
 quietly not important copy is 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:51.680
 always have fun and in everything you do 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:54.340
 face distorted health hair 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.340
 of aversa
