1:11<00:00:18.980> I'm<00:00:19.130> gonna<00:00:19.610> compare<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:20.210> contrast<00:00:20.300> the

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
1:11 I'm gonna compare and contrast the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.660 
1:11 I'm gonna compare and contrast the
sounds<00:00:21.140> with<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:21.259> regular<00:00:21.680> dynamic<00:00:22.160> microphone

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
sounds with a regular dynamic microphone

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.939 
sounds with a regular dynamic microphone
and<00:00:22.880> see<00:00:23.330> what<00:00:23.449> you<00:00:23.570> guys<00:00:23.720> think<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.590> lamp<00:00:24.800> of

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
and see what you guys think the lamp of

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.120 
and see what you guys think the lamp of
fire<00:00:25.100> 111<00:00:25.760> has<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:26.150> built-in<00:00:26.779> compressor<00:00:27.680> and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
fire 111 has a built-in compressor and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
and I've never been a vocalist like that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.220

did that I always just used a regular
dynamic<00:00:52.820> microphone<00:00:53.570> live<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.489> took<00:00:55.489> the

dynamic microphone live and took the

gave<00:00:58.850> me<00:00:59.180> so<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.809> was<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.050> little<00:01:00.320> bit<00:01:00.410> at<00:01:00.500> their

now<00:01:01.489> I'm<00:01:01.640> an<00:01:01.730> audiophile<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:02.780> do<00:01:02.840> like<00:01:03.170> to

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
now I'm an audiophile and I do like to

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.320 
now I'm an audiophile and I do like to
record<00:01:03.590> my<00:01:04.009> own<00:01:04.039> vocals<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.820> like<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.089> record

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
record my own vocals I like to record

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.650 
record my own vocals I like to record
bands<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.950> when<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.190> found<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.210> lamp<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.539> fire

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.029 
bands and when I found the lamp of fire
microphone<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:09.110> was<00:01:09.289> very<00:01:09.440> intrigued<00:01:09.740> because

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
microphone I was very intrigued because

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.359 
microphone I was very intrigued because
it<00:01:10.909> came<00:01:11.299> with<00:01:11.689> a<00:01:11.720> fully<00:01:12.350> built-in<00:01:12.950> compressor

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
it came with a fully built-in compressor

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.539 
it came with a fully built-in compressor
and<00:01:13.790> noise<00:01:13.970> gate<00:01:14.299> in<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.200> handle<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.310> I<00:01:16.369> could

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
and noise gate in the handle and I could

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.490 
and noise gate in the handle and I could
take<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.760> apart<00:01:17.090> put<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.510> back<00:01:17.600> together<00:01:17.810> pick

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
take it apart put it back together pick

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.960 
take it apart put it back together pick
my<00:01:18.680> own<00:01:18.799> settings<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.520> have<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:19.850> sound

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
my own settings and have it sound

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.570 
my own settings and have it sound
exactly<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.479> way<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.630> wanted<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.049> right<00:01:22.040> now<00:01:22.250> I

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
exactly the way I wanted to right now I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.090 
exactly the way I wanted to right now I
have<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:23.000> compressor<00:01:23.600> set<00:01:23.869> at<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.080> minus<00:01:24.740> 20

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
have this compressor set at a minus 20

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.880 
have this compressor set at a minus 20
DB<00:01:25.460> threshold<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.600> I'm<00:01:27.350> gonna<00:01:27.439> be<00:01:27.619> adding<00:01:27.830> a

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
DB threshold and I'm gonna be adding a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.460 
DB threshold and I'm gonna be adding a
pop<00:01:28.130> filter<00:01:28.369> later<00:01:28.790> for<00:01:29.180> singing<00:01:29.689> I'm<00:01:29.960> also

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
pop filter later for singing I'm also

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.710 
pop filter later for singing I'm also
going<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.979> tell<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.790> that<00:01:31.970> my<00:01:32.090> noise<00:01:32.360> gate

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
going to tell you that my noise gate

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.399 
going to tell you that my noise gate
setting<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.380> at<00:01:34.189> a<00:01:34.580> minus<00:01:35.420> 20<00:01:35.869> decimal

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.800 
setting is at a minus 20 decimal
threshold<00:01:37.009> as<00:01:37.159> well<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.520> actually<00:01:38.360> adjusted

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
threshold as well I actually adjusted

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.240 
threshold as well I actually adjusted
these<00:01:38.930> for<00:01:39.140> my<00:01:39.229> live<00:01:39.439> settings<00:01:39.860> my<00:01:40.040> live

these for my live settings my live

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.640 
these for my live settings my live
settings<00:01:40.670> were<00:01:40.820> much<00:01:41.000> much<00:01:41.240> higher<00:01:41.570> my<00:01:42.290> nose

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
settings were much much higher my nose

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.370 
settings were much much higher my nose
gate<00:01:42.979> was<00:01:43.159> at<00:01:43.310> minus<00:01:43.700> 8<00:01:43.970> DB<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:44.960> my

gate was at minus 8 DB and my

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.609 
gate was at minus 8 DB and my

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
compression threshold was at minus 24 DB

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.460 
compression threshold was at minus 24 DB
which<00:01:49.159> was<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> little<00:01:49.610> bit<00:01:49.729> higher<00:01:50.320> right<00:01:51.320> now

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
which was a little bit higher right now

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.200 
which was a little bit higher right now
I<00:01:51.500> brought<00:01:51.829> it<00:01:51.979> back<00:01:52.100> down<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.340> minus<00:01:52.759> 20<00:01:53.060> DB

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
I brought it back down to minus 20 DB

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.330 
I brought it back down to minus 20 DB
for<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.600> compression<00:01:54.100> threshold<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.220> I've

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
for the compression threshold and I've

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.370 
for the compression threshold and I've
way<00:01:55.670> brought<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.329> noise<00:01:56.479> gate<00:01:56.689> down<00:01:56.930> because

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.590 
way brought the noise gate down because
it<00:01:57.560> wasn't<00:01:57.740> picking<00:01:58.040> up<00:01:58.220> my<00:01:58.369> speaking<00:01:58.700> when

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
you're playing with a metal band this

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.490 
you're playing with a metal band this
microphone<00:02:01.189> is<00:02:01.399> ideal<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:03.320> noise

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
microphone is ideal because the noise

gate being able to be adjusted you can

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.109 
gate being able to be adjusted you can
turn<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:07.070> really<00:02:07.280> high<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:07.909> you're

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
turn it up really high so that you're

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
I really like a high compression setting

who are wondering what's the compression

ratio according to lamp afire it's a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.800 
ratio according to lamp afire it's a
variable<00:02:24.860> compression<00:02:25.370> ratio<00:02:26.060> depending<00:02:26.690> on

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
the volume coming in softer sounds they

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.140 
the volume coming in softer sounds they
tend<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:30.020> give<00:02:30.230> more<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.550> two-to-one

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
tend to give more of a two-to-one

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.980 
tend to give more of a two-to-one

to<00:02:36.020> 1<00:02:36.410> at<00:02:36.710> your<00:02:36.860> loudest<00:02:37.130> sounds<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.000> it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
to 1 at your loudest sounds so it

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.410 
to 1 at your loudest sounds so it
adjusts<00:02:39.260> itself<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:41.030> set<00:02:41.240> the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
adjusts itself and you just set the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.170 
adjusts itself and you just set the
threshold<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.290> like<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.100> 6<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.760> 1<00:02:43.880> compression

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
threshold I like a 6 to 1 compression

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.400 
threshold I like a 6 to 1 compression
ratios<00:02:44.900> typically<00:02:45.700> however<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:47.360> found<00:02:48.230> that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
ratios typically however I found that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.190 
ratios typically however I found that
this<00:02:48.620> microphone<00:02:49.370> serves<00:02:50.209> my<00:02:50.450> needs<00:02:50.690> very

guys could actually replicate this at

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.630 
guys could actually replicate this at
home<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.360> test<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.230> sound<00:03:18.440> yourself<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:19.160> did

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
home and test the sound yourself I did

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.910 
home and test the sound yourself I did
not<00:03:20.030> using<00:03:20.360> any<00:03:20.480> outboard<00:03:21.050> signal<00:03:21.470> processing

being<00:03:25.010> recorded<00:03:25.340> with<00:03:25.549> GarageBand<00:03:26.030> so<00:03:26.989> this

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
being recorded with GarageBand so this

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.570 
being recorded with GarageBand so this
