 Gamers Review: Hyrule Warriors 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.400
 Hyrules is in danger again. The Darkness 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.549
 comes above the fields that Princess Zelda has sworn to protect. 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.400
 A mysterious young man, who seems only a beginner, dresses in a mythical green cloak. The fight against evil was reborn 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.440
 and, this time, you will have to resort to several universes and timelines to 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 evil that escapes the portal of souls. This is the premise of Hyrule Warriors, a title 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.150
 which takes the well-known characters from The Legend of Zelda to a different territory 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.150
 to which the fans are accustomed. Omega Force, creators of the Dynasty Warriors series, 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.250
 has built a project that blends his most successful franchise with the legendary Nintendo saga. 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.220
 The same creators of Link insisted on bringing the most faithful possible experience 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.700
 of combat in the old orient to the game, although luckily we are in front of several looks 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.020
 for the original series. Characters like Impa, Link, Zelda, Ganondorf 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.950
 and Sheik, among others, appear to fight hundreds and hundreds of enemies in a field 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.560
 in which we must capture and defend positions on the ground to fulfill missions. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.299
 Okay, if you listen very interesting on paper and could even look like a 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.659
 strategy. Just press the "Y" button again and again to make pieces 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.659
 the enemy wave. There are many skills, and even variety 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.480
 weapons such as bombs, boomerangs or even the Wind Waker, while 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.810
 each character is very much in line with his style. Although, this does not change 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.810
 button to move forward. We will see iconic enemies like Dodongo and 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.010
 Argorok, or new ones like Valga. While this is a very interesting detail, this does not 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.060
 that most of the waves you will face, including bosses, pose 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.790
 a very reduced artificial intelligence. You'll see your character piece the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.790
 rows of opponents with almost no damage. Although the scenarios look like passages 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.819
 interesting, you will find repetitive maps that only served as background for the massacre 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.310
 of enemies. Their only contribution are doors or obstacles that mark some objectives 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 to fulfill, the more outside it does not bring much interests to its exploration. 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.379
 These failures are a real shame. Because, throughout the game, we will see continuous 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:21.310
 and interesting tributes to the series. As characters you will see of Ocarina Of Time, 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.090
 Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, up to items, weapons or details between missions. All 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.680
 demarcated in a fairly coherent story, which even reaches exciting levels 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.250
 in cinematic very well done despite lacking voices. 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.250
 The lack of online multiplayer makes us expect a large local multiplayer, which simply 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.129
 it's just fighting one-player missions. Which, simply, is not enough. Will not 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:02.129
 further away from the main experience. To give life to the game, we have a way 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.080
 of challenges that will put us in the throes of several challenges. The free mode will allow the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.810
 player to pass the level of their preference when they want. In addition, in the adventure mode, 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.309
 we passed a map based on the first Zelda to overcome challenges, with the prize to unlock 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:28.309
 objects by exceeding those levels. Hyrule Warriors is a game that does homage 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.689
 for The Legend of Zelda series in a more than sincere way on the part of its creators, 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:40.569
 and it's just where it shines. Although, it does not leave the problematic that has persecuted the games 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.749
 the Dynasty Warriors series and the spin offs based on it over the years. If you 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:52.180
 not accustomed to this type of games, it can be that the repetitive of the gameplay and the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.289
 even despaired, even earlier than you'd expect. More in 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.100
 If these details do not bother you, you will certainly find valuable references 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.500
 and more than interesting details. 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.500
 I'm Alexandra Vicencio, and the triforce is waiting for us, though not with the expected brilliance. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Did you join me in this new adventure?
