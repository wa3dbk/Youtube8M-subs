enemy's flag or you grab an enemy's flag
from<00:00:29.160> their<00:00:29.369> base<00:00:29.550> you'll<00:00:30.060> grab<00:00:30.330> it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
from their base you'll grab it

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.479 
from their base you'll grab it
instantaneously<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.619> run<00:00:31.800> by<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
instantaneously so if you run by it you

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.010 
instantaneously so if you run by it you
grab<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.969> you're<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.600> able<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.840> have

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
grab it you're going to be able to have

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.479 
grab it you're going to be able to have
that<00:00:34.050> right<00:00:34.469> off<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.680> bat<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> can

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that right off the bat and then you can

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.830 
that right off the bat and then you can
start<00:00:35.700> heading<00:00:35.790> back<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.480> base<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
start heading back to your base and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.600 
start heading back to your base and
hopefully<00:00:37.110> capturing<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.739> yourself<00:00:38.100> but

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
hopefully capturing it for yourself but

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
hopefully capturing it for yourself but
let's<00:00:38.820> say<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.840> an<00:00:39.960> enemy<00:00:40.079> who<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
let's say you take out an enemy who is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
let's say you take out an enemy who is
running<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.579> your<00:00:41.969> own<00:00:42.120> flag<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> you're

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
running with your own flag and you're

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.569 
running with your own flag and you're
trying<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> take<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> back<00:00:43.559> well<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
trying to take it back well you can you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.889 
trying to take it back well you can you
could<00:00:44.760> kill<00:00:44.940> them<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.300> need<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.570> kill<00:00:45.750> them

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
could kill them you need to kill them

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.900 
could kill them you need to kill them
and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.010> try<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.280> retrieve<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and then when you try to retrieve it

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
and then when you try to retrieve it
it's<00:00:48.059> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.600> act<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's going to kind of act like a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.770 
it's going to kind of act like a
conquest<00:00:49.980> game<00:00:50.280> mode<00:00:50.520> where<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.149> need<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
conquest game mode where you need to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.510 
conquest game mode where you need to
stay<00:00:51.989> around<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> set<00:00:53.070> period<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.460> time

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
stay around it for a set period of time

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.069 
stay around it for a set period of time
and<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> more<00:00:54.090> people<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.510> around<00:00:54.660> at

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and the more people you have around at

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.420 
and the more people you have around at
the<00:00:55.170> faster<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> capture<00:00:56.219> back

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the faster it's going to capture back

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
the faster it's going to capture back
but<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> take<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> while<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
but it's going to take a while for you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.340 
but it's going to take a while for you
to<00:00:58.789> capture<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.079> because

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
to capture it and I like this because

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
to capture it and I like this because
it's<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.789> game<00:01:03.000> mode<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> lot

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
it's going to make the game mode a lot

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.060 
it's going to make the game mode a lot
more<00:01:03.780> tactical<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:04.920> into<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
more tactical because if you get into a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.460 
more tactical because if you get into a
situation<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.909> let's<00:01:06.420> say<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:06.810> buddy<00:01:07.080> your

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
situation or let's say your buddy your

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.429 
situation or let's say your buddy your
ally<00:01:07.890> dies<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> flag<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:10.320> out

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
ally dies and if the flag is right out

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.289 
ally dies and if the flag is right out
in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> open<00:01:10.680> well<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> enemy<00:01:11.820> team<00:01:12.000> has

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
in the open well then the enemy team has

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.690 
in the open well then the enemy team has
to<00:01:12.479> stay<00:01:12.689> out<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> open<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.740> capture<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to stay out in the open to capture that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
to stay out in the open to capture that
and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> background

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and then if you are in the background

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.719 
and then if you are in the background
and<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> were<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> only<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.490> stayed

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and you were the only one that stayed

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.999 
and you were the only one that stayed
alive<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.240> your<00:01:18.360> squad<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.409> kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.710> take

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
alive in your squad you can kind of take

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
alive in your squad you can kind of take
people<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.759> well<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.299> much<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.840> can

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
people out as well as much as you can

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.810 
people out as well as much as you can
but<00:01:22.619> stay<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> background<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.580> let<00:01:23.729> your

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
but stay in the background and let your

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.550 
but stay in the background and let your
allies<00:01:24.210> spawn<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.170> hopefully

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
allies spawn on you and then hopefully

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350 
allies spawn on you and then hopefully
suppress<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> enemy<00:01:26.100> team<00:01:26.430> enough<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
suppress the enemy team enough so that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
suppress the enemy team enough so that
all<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.500> run<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> take<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
all you have to do is run up and take it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.819 
all you have to do is run up and take it
instantaneously<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.229> hopefully<00:01:31.680> get

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
instantaneously and then hopefully get

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.609 
instantaneously and then hopefully get
back<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.280> base<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.570> thing<00:01:33.869> I'm<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
back to your base the one thing I'm a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.770 
back to your base the one thing I'm a
little<00:01:35.250> nervous<00:01:35.430> about<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.540> could

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
little nervous about is that it could

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.069 
little nervous about is that it could
result<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.970> extensive<00:01:39.540> base

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
result in some really extensive base

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.649 
result in some really extensive base
camping<00:01:40.650> we're<00:01:41.250> both<00:01:41.610> teams<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
camping we're both teams have the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.620 
camping we're both teams have the
opposing<00:01:43.049> teams<00:01:43.229> flag<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.890> no<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.180> can

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
opposing teams flag and no one can

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.600 
opposing teams flag and no one can
capture<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.110> enemy's<00:01:46.350> flag<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
capture the enemy's flag because the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.190 
capture the enemy's flag because the
only<00:01:47.880> way<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.990> enough

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
only way to do so is to get enough

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.530 
only way to do so is to get enough
people<00:01:49.590> into<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> enemy<00:01:50.640> teams<00:01:50.909> base<00:01:51.210> kill

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
people into the enemy teams base kill

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
people into the enemy teams base kill
the<00:01:51.659> person<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.990> has<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:52.890> sit<00:01:53.189> on

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the person that has it and then sit on

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
the person that has it and then sit on
the<00:01:53.399> flag<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.939> set<00:01:54.210> period<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.570> time<00:01:54.659> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the flag for a set period of time to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.530 
the flag for a set period of time to
capture<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.710> back<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.490> while<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.119> enemy

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
capture it back all the while the enemy

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.990 
capture it back all the while the enemy
is<00:01:57.930> swarming<00:01:58.409> around<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> is

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
is swarming around you and if that is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.030 
is swarming around you and if that is
the<00:02:00.149> case<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:01.049> could<00:02:01.170> result<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.770> some

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the case then it could result in some

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.730 
the case then it could result in some
really<00:02:02.700> long<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> prolong<00:02:03.689> stalemate<00:02:04.439> games

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
really long and prolong stalemate games

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.350 
really long and prolong stalemate games
that<00:02:04.979> probably<00:02:05.399> wouldn't<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.820> very<00:02:06.119> enjoyable

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that probably wouldn't be very enjoyable

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.540 
that probably wouldn't be very enjoyable
so<00:02:07.049> hopefully<00:02:07.530> dice<00:02:07.829> has<00:02:08.039> taken<00:02:08.340> us<00:02:08.459> into

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
so hopefully dice has taken us into

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.119 
so hopefully dice has taken us into
consideration<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.810> i'm<00:02:10.200> not<00:02:10.259> really

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
consideration it's not i'm not really

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.410 
consideration it's not i'm not really
really<00:02:11.550> worried<00:02:11.790> about<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.300> it's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
really worried about it but it's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.820 
really worried about it but it's
something<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> thought<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
something that I thought of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.890 
something that I thought of
DICE<00:02:14.130> has<00:02:14.160> also<00:02:14.730> gone<00:02:15.030> out<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.420> confirmed

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
DICE has also gone out and confirmed

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.800 
DICE has also gone out and confirmed
that<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.620> use<00:02:16.800> any<00:02:17.130> vehicle<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.000> run<00:02:18.660> with

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
that you can use any vehicle to run with

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.780 
that you can use any vehicle to run with
a<00:02:18.840> flag<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.800> want<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.160> go<00:02:20.310> really<00:02:20.460> fast

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
a flag so if you want to go really fast

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.580 
a flag so if you want to go really fast
you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.210> use<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> motorcycle<00:02:22.020> or<00:02:22.350> if<00:02:22.500> you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
you can use the motorcycle or if you

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.110 
you can use the motorcycle or if you
want<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> be<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.160> completely<00:02:23.670> other<00:02:23.820> end

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
want to be on the completely other end

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.840 
want to be on the completely other end
of<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.300> spectrum<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.900> use<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> slow-moving

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
of the spectrum and use a slow-moving

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.580 
of the spectrum and use a slow-moving
heavy-duty<00:02:26.850> tank<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.600> can<00:02:27.780> also<00:02:27.930> do<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.410> as

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
heavy-duty tank you can also do so as

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.380 
heavy-duty tank you can also do so as
well<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.310> cool<00:02:29.520> because<00:02:29.730> each<00:02:30.180> of

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
well and this is cool because each of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.690 
well and this is cool because each of
them<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.810> their<00:02:31.010> strengths<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.130> weaknesses

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
them have their strengths and weaknesses

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.210 
them have their strengths and weaknesses
of<00:02:32.730> course<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:34.200> tanks<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.800> Jeep<00:02:35.040> are

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
of course the the tanks and the Jeep are

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.190 
of course the the tanks and the Jeep are
going<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.210> little<00:02:36.390> bit<00:02:36.480> more<00:02:36.750> heavy-duty

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
going to be a little bit more heavy-duty

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200 
going to be a little bit more heavy-duty
they<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.800> take<00:02:37.950> more<00:02:38.190> shots<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.120> going

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
they can take more shots but it's going

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.180 
they can take more shots but it's going
to<00:02:39.270> take<00:02:39.330> them<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.690> lot<00:02:39.990> longer<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:41.010> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
to take them a lot longer to get in and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.520 
to take them a lot longer to get in and
out<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.520> enemy<00:02:41.850> base<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.290> leave

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
out of the enemy base and that can leave

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.770 
out of the enemy base and that can leave
you<00:02:43.650> very<00:02:43.860> exposed<00:02:44.310> on<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> other<00:02:45.270> hand<00:02:45.480> you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
you very exposed on the other hand you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.450 
you very exposed on the other hand you
can<00:02:45.960> use<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.410> motorcycle<00:02:47.010> which<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.250> very

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
can use the motorcycle which is very

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.610 
can use the motorcycle which is very
quick<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.940> nimble<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.690> can<00:02:48.840> get<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.140> very

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
quick and nimble you can get in very

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.740 
quick and nimble you can get in very
fast<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.520> at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.700> same<00:02:50.910> time<00:02:51.180> you're<00:02:51.420> leaving

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
fast but at the same time you're leaving

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.590 
fast but at the same time you're leaving
yourself<00:02:51.840> very<00:02:52.380> exposed<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.340> enemy<00:02:53.790> fire<00:02:54.030> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
yourself very exposed to enemy fire and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.560 
yourself very exposed to enemy fire and
not<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.410> RPGs<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.400> also<00:02:56.610> bullets<00:02:57.330> because

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
not just RPGs but also bullets because

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.210 
not just RPGs but also bullets because
it's<00:02:57.840> going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.020> be<00:02:58.110> probably<00:02:58.440> very<00:02:58.770> easy<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it's going to be probably very easy to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.730 
it's going to be probably very easy to
shoot<00:02:59.400> people<00:02:59.580> out<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.530> motorcycles<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.680> I

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
shoot people out of motorcycles and I

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.220 
shoot people out of motorcycles and I
like<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.880> design<00:03:03.270> decision<00:03:03.780> from<00:03:03.990> dice

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
like that that design decision from dice

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.570 
like that that design decision from dice
because<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.860> make<00:03:05.040> for<00:03:05.100> some<00:03:05.550> very

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
because it's going to make for some very

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.360 
because it's going to make for some very
interesting<00:03:06.560> decisions<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.920> battlefield

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
interesting decisions on the battlefield

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.220 
interesting decisions on the battlefield
should<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.700> roll<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.150> with<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.360> tank<00:03:09.720> should<00:03:10.170> I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
should I roll in with a tank should I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.590 
should I roll in with a tank should I
take<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.650> chance<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.190> rolling<00:03:11.640> in<00:03:11.910> with<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
take the chance of rolling in with the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.600 
take the chance of rolling in with the
motorcycle<00:03:13.020> where<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.890> could<00:03:14.220> die<00:03:14.400> very

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
motorcycle where I could die very

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.520 
motorcycle where I could die very
quickly<00:03:14.700> but<00:03:15.180> also<00:03:15.330> have<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.630> quick<00:03:15.930> reward<00:03:16.290> of

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
quickly but also have a quick reward of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.320 
quickly but also have a quick reward of
getting<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:16.860> back<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.130> my<00:03:17.250> base<00:03:17.550> quickly<00:03:17.880> I

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
getting it back to my base quickly I

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.870 
getting it back to my base quickly I
like<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.860> designed<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.519> design

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
like that I like that designed a design

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.509 
like that I like that designed a design
decision<00:03:21.140> as<00:03:22.140> for<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.980> maps<00:03:23.340> themselves

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
decision as for the maps themselves

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.520 
decision as for the maps themselves
apparently<00:03:24.390> they're<00:03:24.600> going<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.050> resemble<00:03:25.410> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
apparently they're going to resemble the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.290 
apparently they're going to resemble the
same<00:03:25.769> size<00:03:26.070> as<00:03:26.400> caspian<00:03:26.910> border<00:03:26.940> and

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
same size as caspian border and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.210 
same size as caspian border and
operation<00:03:27.720> firestorm<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.860> capture

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
operation firestorm but the capture

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.650 
operation firestorm but the capture
points<00:03:29.519> are<00:03:29.580> going<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.760> be<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.850> lot<00:03:30.090> more<00:03:30.120> spread

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
points are going to be a lot more spread

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.770 
points are going to be a lot more spread
out<00:03:30.690> kind<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.350> like<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.739> armored<00:03:32.100> kill<00:03:32.280> dlc

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
out kind of like the armored kill dlc

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.720 
out kind of like the armored kill dlc
caspian<00:03:33.780> border<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.110> operation<00:03:34.470> firestorm

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
caspian border and operation firestorm

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.550 
caspian border and operation firestorm
really<00:03:35.730> fun<00:03:35.940> love<00:03:36.330> those<00:03:36.540> maps<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.140> they<00:03:37.410> are

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
really fun love those maps but they are

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.259 
really fun love those maps but they are
very<00:03:37.590> condensed<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.519> action<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.060> all<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
very condensed the action and all the

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.550 
very condensed the action and all the
capture<00:03:39.600> points<00:03:39.900> are<00:03:39.989> in<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.110> center<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
capture points are in the center of the

capture points are in the center of the
map<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.950> while<00:03:41.400> they<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:42.150> lot<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.420> open

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
map and while they have a lot of open

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.330 
map and while they have a lot of open
field<00:03:43.019> around<00:03:43.200> them<00:03:43.530> which<00:03:43.739> makes<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.130> maps

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
field around them which makes the maps

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.640 
field around them which makes the maps
very<00:03:44.700> large<00:03:45.090> no<00:03:45.720> one<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.170> ventures<00:03:46.470> out

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
very large no one really ventures out

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.530 
very large no one really ventures out
there<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.010> less<00:03:47.160> their<00:03:47.400> plane<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.120> tank<00:03:48.390> or

around but the vast majority the action

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.050 
around but the vast majority the action
is<00:03:52.230> very<00:03:52.530> central<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.190> maps<00:03:53.430> which<00:03:53.850> makes

is very central to the maps which makes

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.060 
is very central to the maps which makes
very<00:03:54.300> everything<00:03:54.780> very<00:03:54.959> fast-paced<00:03:55.380> but<00:03:56.010> I

very everything very fast-paced but I

Battlefield games especially like
battlefield<00:04:01.560> 2<00:04:01.800> didn't<00:04:02.519> really<00:04:02.730> like<00:04:02.910> it

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
battlefield 2 didn't really like it

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.190 
battlefield 2 didn't really like it
because<00:04:03.150> they<00:04:03.420> felt<00:04:03.600> like<00:04:03.780> everything<00:04:04.050> was

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
because they felt like everything was

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.870 
because they felt like everything was
way<00:04:04.470> too<00:04:04.530> condensed<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.280> they<00:04:05.400> wanted<00:04:05.670> things

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
way too condensed and they wanted things

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.580 
way too condensed and they wanted things
to<00:04:05.940> be<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.120> little<00:04:06.269> bit<00:04:06.360> more<00:04:06.510> spread<00:04:06.810> out<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.440> it

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
to be a little bit more spread out so it

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.170 
to be a little bit more spread out so it
sounds<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.250> maps<00:04:08.459> aren't<00:04:08.700> going<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.060> be

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
sounds like the maps aren't going to be

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.150 
sounds like the maps aren't going to be
as<00:04:09.209> crazy<00:04:09.600> large<00:04:10.019> as<00:04:10.260> they<00:04:10.470> were<00:04:10.530> for<00:04:10.890> armored

next one is keas our railroads this one
has<00:05:51.419> a<00:05:51.450> lot<00:05:51.870> more<00:05:52.080> trees<00:05:52.500> it's<00:05:52.860> got<00:05:53.040> a<00:05:53.070> logging

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520

it's got a lot more it's got a lot more
obstacles<00:06:01.530> in<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:01.800> way<00:06:01.830> so<00:06:02.040> it<00:06:02.550> looks<00:06:03.180> like

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
obstacles in the way so it looks like

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.520 
obstacles in the way so it looks like
it's<00:06:03.390> going<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.540> lend<00:06:03.690> itself<00:06:03.930> more<00:06:04.229> to

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
it's going to lend itself more to

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.350 
it's going to lend itself more to
infantry<00:06:05.010> based<00:06:05.310> combat<00:06:05.610> I'm<00:06:05.940> sure<00:06:06.120> there's

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
infantry based combat I'm sure there's

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.969 
infantry based combat I'm sure there's
going<00:06:06.390> to<00:06:06.540> be<00:06:06.570> plenty<00:06:06.780> of<00:06:07.050> vehicles<00:06:07.470> but<00:06:07.860> this

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
going to be plenty of vehicles but this

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.590 
going to be plenty of vehicles but this
one<00:06:08.220> seems<00:06:08.490> like<00:06:08.700> it's<00:06:08.850> going<00:06:08.970> to<00:06:09.000> be<00:06:09.150> more<00:06:09.390> of

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
one seems like it's going to be more of

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.260 
one seems like it's going to be more of
a<00:06:09.690> mixture<00:06:10.020> of<00:06:10.140> the<00:06:10.410> two<00:06:10.440> and<00:06:10.890> dices<00:06:11.610> also<00:06:12.030> said

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
a mixture of the two and dices also said

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.820 
a mixture of the two and dices also said
that<00:06:12.300> this<00:06:12.630> is<00:06:12.810> going<00:06:13.020> to<00:06:13.110> be<00:06:13.320> another<00:06:13.560> of

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
that this is going to be another of

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.740 
that this is going to be another of
another<00:06:14.430> one<00:06:14.700> where<00:06:15.300> you're<00:06:15.419> going<00:06:15.540> to<00:06:15.600> get<00:06:15.720> a

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
another one where you're going to get a

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.530 
another one where you're going to get a
lot<00:06:15.810> of<00:06:16.110> big<00:06:16.650> air<00:06:16.890> on<00:06:17.180> motorcycles<00:06:18.180> but<00:06:18.360> it's

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
lot of big air on motorcycles but it's

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.890 
lot of big air on motorcycles but it's
not<00:06:18.660> going<00:06:18.810> to<00:06:18.900> be<00:06:19.050> as<00:06:19.290> a<00:06:19.350> parent<00:06:20.280> as<00:06:20.900> Operation

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
not going to be as a parent as Operation

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.200 
not going to be as a parent as Operation

Riverside operation Riverside the ramps
are<00:06:24.350> kind<00:06:25.350> of<00:06:25.410> obvious<00:06:25.950> on<00:06:26.130> on<00:06:26.370> this<00:06:26.580> one<00:06:26.850> they

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
are kind of obvious on on this one they

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.060

to those type of types of environments

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.840 
to those type of types of environments
which<00:06:53.500> is<00:06:53.620> kind<00:06:53.889> of<00:06:53.979> surprising<00:06:54.070> because<00:06:54.550> you

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
which is kind of surprising because you

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.010 
which is kind of surprising because you
would<00:06:54.970> have<00:06:55.060> assumed<00:06:55.300> they<00:06:55.690> would<00:06:55.870> have

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
battlefield 3 but the pipeline is going

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.430 
battlefield 3 but the pipeline is going
to<00:07:00.490> be<00:07:00.639> completely<00:07:01.419> covered<00:07:01.690> in<00:07:01.900> snow<00:07:02.169> it's

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
to be completely covered in snow it's

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.219 
to be completely covered in snow it's
going<00:07:02.889> to<00:07:02.919> be<00:07:03.130> kind<00:07:03.340> of<00:07:03.520> a<00:07:03.610> mixture<00:07:03.970> between

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
going to be kind of a mixture between

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:06.780 
going to be kind of a mixture between
vehicle<00:07:05.229> and<00:07:05.410> infantry<00:07:05.919> combat<00:07:06.190> where

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.449 
of room for vehicles to kind of maneuver

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.219
