00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.449 

now<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.560> got<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.800> screw<00:03:17.099> out<00:03:17.280> it's

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
now that I got that screw out it's

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.940 
now that I got that screw out it's
picking<00:03:18.150> right<00:03:18.270> up<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.230> slides<00:03:19.470> out<00:03:19.709> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
bottom tabs slide out flip it over we

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.330 
bottom tabs slide out flip it over we
get<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.349> small<00:03:25.770> ribbon<00:03:25.890> already<00:03:26.130> disconnected

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
get a small ribbon already disconnected

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.020 
get a small ribbon already disconnected
there<00:03:27.000> we<00:03:27.090> go<00:03:27.470> old<00:03:28.470> keyboard<00:03:29.010> up<00:03:29.190> kind<00:03:29.849> of<00:03:29.910> put

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
there we go old keyboard up kind of put

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.240 
there we go old keyboard up kind of put
a<00:03:30.060> new<00:03:30.150> one<00:03:30.270> in<00:03:33.800> so<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.890> reason<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.160> might

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
a new one in so the reason you might

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.040 
a new one in so the reason you might
want<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.430> do<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:35.849> if<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.300> happen<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.900> have

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
want to do this is if you happen to have

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.449 
want to do this is if you happen to have
gotten<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.319> defector<00:03:37.739> keyboard<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.400> a

gotten a defector keyboard you get a

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.520 
gotten a defector keyboard you get a
replacement<00:03:38.930> but<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.080> other<00:03:40.230> thing<00:03:40.410> I'm

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
replacement but the other thing I'm

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.050 
replacement but the other thing I'm
thinking<00:03:40.830> about<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.069> some<00:03:41.610> people<00:03:41.880> might

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
thinking about is some people might

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.009 
thinking about is some people might
actually<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:44.209> one<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.390> nine<00:03:45.569> backlit

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
actually have one of the nine backlit

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.570 
actually have one of the nine backlit
model<00:03:46.319> keyboards<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.130> might<00:03:47.310> just<00:03:47.489> be

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
model keyboards and it might just be

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.570 
model keyboards and it might just be
compatible<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:49.140> backlight<00:03:52.430> all<00:03:53.430> right

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
compatible with the backlight all right

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.979 
compatible with the backlight all right
it's<00:03:53.670> going<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.880> get<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.299> at<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.569> 90<00:03:54.959> degree

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
it's going to get this at a 90 degree

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:06.130 
it's going to get this at a 90 degree
angle<00:03:55.700> that's<00:03:56.700> going<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:56.940> be<00:03:57.030> fun

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.570
