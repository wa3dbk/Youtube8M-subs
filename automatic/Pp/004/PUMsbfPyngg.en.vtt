00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
anything I mean a lot of them have been

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.240 
anything I mean a lot of them have been
glad<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.579> guys<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> room<00:00:42.980> have<00:00:43.980> been

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
glad that guys in the room have been

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
glad that guys in the room have been
here<00:00:44.430> again<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.030> lost<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> carries

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
here again you lost a lot of carries

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.049 
here again you lost a lot of carries
last<00:00:46.649> year<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.640> guys<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.000> are

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
last year and got in the guys that are

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.990 
last year and got in the guys that are
no<00:00:48.329> longer<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.840> sideline<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.350> me<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.649> now

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
no longer on sideline with me right now

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
no longer on sideline with me right now
so<00:00:51.000> that's<00:00:51.149> fun<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.690> growing

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
so that's fun because it's growing

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.779 
so that's fun because it's growing
they've<00:00:52.829> done<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> good<00:00:53.219> job<00:00:53.280> every<00:00:53.579> day<00:00:53.610> they

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
they've done a good job every day they

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.860 
they've done a good job every day they
come<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> work<00:00:54.239> they're<00:00:54.510> doing<00:00:54.539> they're

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
come out to work they're doing they're

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
come out to work they're doing they're
doing<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.260> thing<00:00:55.460> one<00:00:56.460> or<00:00:56.550> two<00:00:56.670> things<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
doing one thing one or two things a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:57.889 
doing one thing one or two things a
little<00:00:57.090> bit<00:00:57.210> better<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.539> they<00:00:57.690> did<00:00:57.780> before

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
little bit better than they did before

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
little bit better than they did before
and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.250> need<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> ask<00:00:59.609> all

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and I think that's what need to ask all

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.900 
and I think that's what need to ask all
of<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.930> we're<00:01:01.260> demanding

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
of them and that's what we're demanding

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.130 
of them and that's what we're demanding
being<00:01:02.910> tough<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.120> physical<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.809> big<00:01:03.960> part

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
being tough and physical is a big part

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.090 
being tough and physical is a big part
of<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.650> room<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.949> were

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
of what we do in our room we were

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.859 
of what we do in our room we were
emphasizing<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.729> they've<00:01:06.479> done<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> good<00:01:06.810> job

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
emphasizing and they've done a good job

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.620 
emphasizing and they've done a good job
with<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.850> each<00:01:08.970> guy<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
with that and each guy I think is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.850 
with that and each guy I think is
developed<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.290> bit<00:01:10.470> more<00:01:10.590> every<00:01:10.650> day

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
developed a little bit more every day

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740 
developed a little bit more every day
there's<00:01:11.189> obviously<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.820> small<00:01:12.570> little

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
there's obviously all the small little

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.289 
there's obviously all the small little
things<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.580> need<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.700> better<00:01:14.820> at<00:01:14.939> before

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
things that need to get better at before

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.910 
things that need to get better at before
that<00:01:15.479> first<00:01:15.659> game<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.770> we're

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that first game and I think that's we're

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
that first game and I think that's we're
gonna<00:01:17.040> work<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.570> each<00:01:18.570> practice<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.990> get<00:01:19.110> left

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
gonna work on each practice we get left

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.570 
gonna work on each practice we get left
which<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.040> Wednesday<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
which is going to be one Wednesday and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.679 
which is going to be one Wednesday and
then<00:01:20.670> spring<00:01:20.909> game<00:01:21.030> Friday<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.330> try<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> get

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
then spring game Friday and try to get

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.499 
then spring game Friday and try to get
chance<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> hone<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.920> those<00:01:23.040> details<00:01:23.509> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
chance to hone up those details you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.789 
chance to hone up those details you
think<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> end<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.140> being<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.650> guy

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
think it's going to end up being one guy

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.929 
think it's going to end up being one guy
that<00:01:25.830> gets<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> bulk<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> carries<00:01:26.520> or

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that gets the bulk of the carries or

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:27.830 
that gets the bulk of the carries or
