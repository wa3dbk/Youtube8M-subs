00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
like that or I don't really know how the

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.999

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
ranks work read through some forums

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.919 
ranks work read through some forums
online<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.759> seems<00:01:33.940> like<00:01:34.179> nobody<00:01:34.420> really

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
online and it seems like nobody really

online and it seems like nobody really
has<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.110> clear<00:01:35.710> idea<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.310> exactly<00:01:36.640> how<00:01:36.940> that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
has a clear idea of exactly how that

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.969 
has a clear idea of exactly how that
works<00:01:37.360> but<00:01:37.720> yeah<00:01:38.170> those<00:01:38.590> are<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.830> major

are<00:01:48.610> exactly<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.179> same<00:01:49.420> as<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.750> other<00:01:49.899> so<00:01:50.200> you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
are exactly the same as the other so you

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.900 
are exactly the same as the other so you
know<00:01:50.830> there's<00:01:51.039> always<00:01:51.340> kind<00:01:51.640> of<00:01:51.729> some

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
know there's always kind of some

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.130 
know there's always kind of some
randomness<00:01:52.509> going<00:01:52.869> on

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
randomness going on

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.480 
randomness going on
so<00:01:53.229> let's<00:01:53.410> take<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.590> quick<00:01:53.800> look<00:01:54.009> at<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.220> paint

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
so let's take a quick look at the paint

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.529 
so let's take a quick look at the paint
or<00:01:54.670> it'll<00:01:54.850> actually<00:01:54.970> let's<00:01:55.270> look<00:01:55.390> at<00:01:55.479> the

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
or it'll actually let's look at the

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.969 
or it'll actually let's look at the
weapons<00:01:55.720> over<00:01:56.080> here<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:56.319> is<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.440> same<00:01:56.619> exact

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
weapons over here this is the same exact

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.550 
weapons over here this is the same exact

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.180 
thing going on it has this nice silver
drybrushing<00:02:01.690> going<00:02:02.020> through<00:02:02.289> here<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.679> like

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
drybrushing going through here I like

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.090 
drybrushing going through here I like
that<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.880> then<00:02:04.030> he<00:02:04.240> has<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.360> blaster<00:02:05.100> same

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
that and then he has a blaster same

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.469 
that and then he has a blaster same
stormtrooper<00:02:06.670> blaster<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.060> were<00:02:07.240> used<00:02:07.420> to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
stormtrooper blaster that were used to

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.839 
stormtrooper blaster that were used to
seeing<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:08.289> he<00:02:08.380> has<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.950> know<00:02:09.160> this<00:02:09.459> giant

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.370 
seeing and he has this I know this giant
cannon<00:02:10.300> thing<00:02:10.660> we<00:02:10.840> did<00:02:10.959> some<00:02:11.110> gold<00:02:11.319> paint

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
cannon thing we did some gold paint

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.380 
cannon thing we did some gold paint
right<00:02:11.709> over<00:02:11.740> here<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.370> think<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.030> sculpted

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
right over here I think it's sculpted

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.150 
right over here I think it's sculpted
really<00:02:13.599> well<00:02:13.750> too<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.440> has<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.709> peg<00:02:14.950> that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
really well too it has this peg that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.589 
really well too it has this peg that
sticks<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.849> doesn't<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.240> anything<00:02:16.480> to

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
sticks out that doesn't have anything to

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.720 
sticks out that doesn't have anything to
peg<00:02:16.870> into<00:02:17.170> that's<00:02:17.349> still<00:02:17.650> frustrating<00:02:18.310> just

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
peg into that's still frustrating just

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.010 
peg into that's still frustrating just
like<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.000> other<00:02:19.120> one<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.360> backpack<00:02:19.780> is

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
like the other one the backpack is

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.990 
like the other one the backpack is
removable<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.920> pauldron<00:02:21.520> itself<00:02:21.849> is

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
removable and the pauldron itself is

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.309 
removable and the pauldron itself is
removable<00:02:22.330> if<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.630> want<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> do<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.110> there

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
removable if you want to do that there

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.600 
removable if you want to do that there
are<00:02:23.349> some<00:02:23.470> sand<00:02:23.920> troopers<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.459> no

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
are some sand troopers that have no

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.339 
are some sand troopers that have no
pauldron<00:02:25.060> at<00:02:25.150> all<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.569> can<00:02:25.780> get<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.110> kind

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
pauldron at all so you can get that kind

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.199 
pauldron at all so you can get that kind
of<00:02:26.380> look<00:02:26.530> going<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:26.890> if<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.099> want<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.430> there

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
of look going on if you want to there

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.620 
of look going on if you want to there
you<00:02:28.330> go

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
you go

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.790 
you go
again<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.200> first<00:02:29.319> one<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.620> get<00:02:29.740> a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
again like the first one we get a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.650 
again like the first one we get a
variety<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.250> paint<00:02:30.580> on<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.000> head<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.420> think

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
variety of paint on the head I think

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.880 
variety of paint on the head I think
that's<00:02:31.840> pretty<00:02:31.990> cool<00:02:32.140> or<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> helmet

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
that's pretty cool or on the helmet

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.350 
that's pretty cool or on the helmet
anyway<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:33.640> think<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:33.939> looks<00:02:34.120> pretty

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
anyway and I think that looks pretty

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.330 
anyway and I think that looks pretty
nice<00:02:34.599> again<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.409> that<00:02:35.620> tanned<00:02:36.129> brown<00:02:36.610> wash

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
nice again I like that tanned brown wash

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.650 
nice again I like that tanned brown wash
we<00:02:37.400> get<00:02:37.610> throughout<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:37.970> figure<00:02:38.239> just<00:02:38.450> think

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
we get throughout the figure just think

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.570 
we get throughout the figure just think
it<00:02:38.750> looks<00:02:38.930> really<00:02:39.170> really<00:02:39.290> cool<00:02:39.470> even<00:02:40.340> see<00:02:40.519> it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.210 
right there on the back this head really
makes<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.349> look<00:02:42.410> he's<00:02:42.739> been<00:02:42.890> through<00:02:43.069> some

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220
