00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.660 
you can use to put on your foundation
like<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.360> also<00:01:36.630> has<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.320> rounded<00:01:37.770> edges

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
like that it also has the rounded edges

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.060 
like that it also has the rounded edges
around<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> also<00:01:40.079> has<00:01:40.470> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
around it and then it also has this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
around it and then it also has this
pointed<00:01:41.549> end<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
pointed end right there just like the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.260 
pointed end right there just like the
beauty<00:01:43.799> blender<00:01:43.950> has<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.119> has<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
beauty blender has so it just has a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.300 
beauty blender has so it just has a
little<00:01:45.540> bit<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
little bit more going on with it the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.850 
little bit more going on with it the
Real<00:01:47.460> Techniques<00:01:47.490> sponge<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.689> only<00:01:49.439> six

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
Real Techniques sponge is only six

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.429 
Real Techniques sponge is only six
dollars<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.030> significantly<00:01:52.020> lower

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
dollars so it is significantly lower

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.260 
dollars so it is significantly lower
then<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.280> Beauty<00:01:53.610> Blender<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.060> Beauty

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
then the Beauty Blender the Beauty

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.109 
then the Beauty Blender the Beauty

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
Blender is $20 so if you wanted to try a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.600 
Blender is $20 so if you wanted to try a
sponge<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.920> didn't<00:01:59.189> want<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> shell

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
sponge out and you didn't want to shell

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.249

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
out the $20 that you do get with the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
out the $20 that you do get with the
Beauty<00:02:01.500> Blender<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.070> highly<00:02:02.969> recommend<00:02:03.420> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
Beauty Blender I highly recommend this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.270 
Beauty Blender I highly recommend this
one<00:02:03.570> cuz<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:03.990> pretty<00:02:04.229> much<00:02:04.380> exact<00:02:04.799> same<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.219> do

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
one cuz it's pretty much exact same I do

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.800 
one cuz it's pretty much exact same I do
want<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> say<00:02:05.969> though<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.259> squeeze

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
want to say though that if you squeeze

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.900 
want to say though that if you squeeze
them<00:02:07.930> both<00:02:08.200> down<00:02:08.500> like<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
them both down like this the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.580 
them both down like this the
Beautyblender<00:02:10.209> it<00:02:10.599> just<00:02:10.780> bounces<00:02:11.140> back<00:02:11.380> a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
Beautyblender it just bounces back a

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.470 
Beautyblender it just bounces back a
little<00:02:11.950> bit<00:02:12.099> faster<00:02:12.640> as<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.849> can<00:02:13.060> see<00:02:13.270> it's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
little bit faster as you can see it's

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.900 
little bit faster as you can see it's
still<00:02:13.690> kind<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.160> trying<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.310> find<00:02:15.520> its<00:02:15.700> shape

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
still kind of trying to find its shape

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.270 
still kind of trying to find its shape
I'll<00:02:16.090> do<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.390> way<00:02:16.569> too<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:17.590> just<00:02:17.650> bounces

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
I'll do it this way too it just bounces

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.040 
I'll do it this way too it just bounces
back<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.849> just<00:02:18.910> kind<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.330> takes<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.630> little<00:02:19.930> bit

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
back it just kind of takes a little bit

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.460 
back it just kind of takes a little bit
longer<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.470> bounce<00:02:20.650> back<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.459> I'm<00:02:21.730> not<00:02:21.880> sure<00:02:21.940> if

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
longer to bounce back so I'm not sure if

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.050 
longer to bounce back so I'm not sure if
it<00:02:23.470> also<00:02:23.590> does<00:02:23.890> feel<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.130> little<00:02:24.430> bit<00:02:24.550> thicker

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
it also does feel a little bit thicker

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.729 
it also does feel a little bit thicker
if<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.599> makes<00:02:25.810> sense<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.290> just<00:02:26.440> feels<00:02:26.620> like

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
if that makes sense it just feels like

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.380 
if that makes sense it just feels like
there's<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.040> bit<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.250> umph

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
there's a little bit more umph

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.240 
there's a little bit more umph
inside<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:29.230> they're<00:02:29.410> both<00:02:29.590> still<00:02:29.920> very

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
inside of it but they're both still very

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.970 
inside of it but they're both still very
squishy<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.870> one<00:02:32.050> just<00:02:32.260> seems<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.769> little<00:02:32.860> bit

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
squishy this one just seems a little bit

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.940 
squishy this one just seems a little bit
more<00:02:33.190> bouncy<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:33.849> an<00:02:34.060> area<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.380> well<00:02:35.709> I'm

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
more bouncy or an area in it as well I'm

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.680 
more bouncy or an area in it as well I'm
not<00:02:36.130> too<00:02:36.430> sure<00:02:36.670> if<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.300> Real<00:02:37.660> Techniques

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
not too sure if the Real Techniques

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.900 
not too sure if the Real Techniques
sponge<00:02:38.170> will<00:02:38.620> last<00:02:38.950> as<00:02:39.220> long<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
sponge will last as long as the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.020 
sponge will last as long as the
Beautyblender<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.630> haven't<00:02:41.200> had<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.680> long

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
Beautyblender I haven't had it that long

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.789

to<00:02:43.030> see<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.510> lasting<00:02:43.989> power<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.709> do

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
to see the lasting power of it but I do

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.590

really<00:02:45.430> think<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.209> an<00:02:46.360> awesome
