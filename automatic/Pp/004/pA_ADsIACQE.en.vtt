00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.330

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.119
 moisturizes she smooths her hair, that's right 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.360
 smoothes the hair as long as it does not leave in a 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.000
 untyped list the progressive meal only 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.640
 leaves the hair more softly like that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.400
 More Levezinhos knows why I have 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.280
 some ripples in my hair because 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
 then progressively I do from time to time 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.930
 It was with some ripples. 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.229
 but when I did this hydration I 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.979
 I dried with dryer only if I found 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.350
 because you brush and I know that this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.350

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.290

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.690

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.280

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.780
 little when he has more or less 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.880
 warm you put there will do the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.850
 The process that I'm going to do now is ready 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.890
 People now that he's done, you're welcome. 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.590
 Your moisturizing cream I use this 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.670
 here dhabi stage i paid three euros 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.610
 in him 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.610
 He is very cheap, you get it. 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.230
 two spoons of cream for my hair 2 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.980
 spoons and if you have more hair or more 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.790
 long 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.970
 There you get one more. 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.230
 I'm going to use some olive oil there. 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.230
 extra virgin olive 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.110
 I go in the eye even people put a 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:07.070
 bit so I see that it's good and 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.980
 I'll use it too is almond oil 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.200
 100% pure 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:19.910
 I also go about a spoon and 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:25.040
 half but you can use coconut oil 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:38.050
 or the oil you had yagan I 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:41.570
 I started to mix everything is is after that 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:46.970
 You may have dry hair though. 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:50.419
 he has it there and I will dry it so I 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.220
 in fact there he comes and I pass the dryer 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.140
 but you can also do with the hair 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:02.360
 wet only how I put the child 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:06.080
 in oil on the recipe so I guess 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.850
 in dry hair oil penetrates more than 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.030
 in portugal and wet because you know 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.390
 right oil and water do not join 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.480
 so I always do this, I always 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:21.560
 century before when I add oil I 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.620
 I know how much is in the middle and now I 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.030
 add more scene is but is not 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.630
 pussy I did 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:34.070
 it's a lot of people make half a fuse 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.320
 but I'll get it all like this, I'll go 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.280
 to distribute in the hair is all but you 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.760
 who know 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.760
 functional 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:41.229
 people around you ready only after 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:47.169

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:49.900
 Aerial dinha and leaves well for 30 minutes 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.169
 leave it for 30 minutes then it is 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:57.419
 just wash my hair with shampoo I wash with 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:59.830
 shampoo because I added oil and 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:02.050
 How did I tell you? 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.570
 my hair is very valuable so it's good 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.349
 I always take shampoo after I do 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.349

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.740
