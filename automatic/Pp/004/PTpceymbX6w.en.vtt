primary focus for this video is to
showcase<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> ballistics<00:00:31.439> would<00:00:31.560> look

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
showcase what the ballistics would look

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.080 
showcase what the ballistics would look
like<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.099> use<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.399> ammo<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.969> home

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
like if you use this ammo for home

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
like if you use this ammo for home
defense<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.840> I'll<00:00:33.960> be<00:00:34.050> shooting<00:00:34.320> 10<00:00:34.500> yards<00:00:34.739> out

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.990 
the direct impact on it and the pedals
fit<00:02:17.900> back<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.740> dispersed<00:02:19.520> out<00:02:19.730> pretty

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
fit back in and dispersed out pretty

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.120 
fit back in and dispersed out pretty
nice<00:02:20.270> there<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.780> have<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.050> all<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.040> way

back here but for this one I don't know
if<00:02:24.590> there<00:02:24.770> was<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.150> drywall<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.330> got<00:02:26.510> caught

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
if there was a drywall that got caught

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.380 
if there was a drywall that got caught
up<00:02:26.960> in<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.410> kept<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.400> from<00:02:28.730> peeling

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
up in it and kept it from peeling

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.900 
up in it and kept it from peeling
everything<00:02:29.960> back<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:31.220> can<00:02:31.340> look<00:02:31.550> here

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
you can see all the spiraling through

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.550 
you can see all the spiraling through
there<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> pedals<00:02:34.550> are<00:02:34.730> still<00:02:35.000> attached

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
there and the pedals are still attached

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.140 
there and the pedals are still attached
come<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.830> other<00:02:36.980> side<00:02:37.280> here<00:02:37.670> yeah

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
come on the other side here yeah

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.510 
come on the other side here yeah
actually<00:02:38.900> if<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.440> look<00:02:39.590> up<00:02:39.740> underneath<00:02:40.250> there

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
actually if you look up underneath there

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.090 
actually if you look up underneath there
in<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.880> cavity<00:02:41.330> there<00:02:41.540> there's<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.320> bunch<00:02:42.950> of

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
in the cavity there there's a bunch of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.250 
in the cavity there there's a bunch of
drywall<00:02:43.340> still<00:02:43.820> in<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.360> for<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:45.200> next

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
drywall still in it so for this next

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.960 
drywall still in it so for this next
shot<00:02:45.620> what<00:02:45.800> I'll<00:02:45.890> do<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.070> I'll<00:02:46.220> I'll<00:02:46.670> raise

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
shot what I'll do is I'll I'll raise

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.610 
shot what I'll do is I'll I'll raise
this<00:02:47.180> up<00:02:47.390> just<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.720> little<00:02:47.750> bit<00:02:47.960> higher<00:02:48.320> and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
this up just a little bit higher and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.320 
this up just a little bit higher and
then<00:02:49.010> I'll<00:02:49.100> take<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.430> I'll<00:02:49.550> put<00:02:50.150> some

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
then I'll take and I'll put some

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.820 
then I'll take and I'll put some
insulation<00:02:50.660> in<00:02:51.170> there<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.410> see<00:02:51.530> if<00:02:51.620> that

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
insulation in there and see if that

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.890 
insulation in there and see if that
helps<00:02:52.220> with<00:02:52.430> breaking<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.330> up<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.570> little<00:02:53.690> bit

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
helps with breaking it up a little bit

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.840 
helps with breaking it up a little bit
so<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.560> petals<00:02:54.920> peel<00:02:55.160> back<00:02:55.340> off<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.730> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
so that the petals peel back off of the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:55.660 
so that the petals peel back off of the
base<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.240> hollow<00:02:56.570> point<00:02:56.870> there

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.160 

again<00:03:56.670> looking<00:03:57.030> at<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.360> here<00:03:57.629> it<00:03:57.780> looks<00:03:58.019> like

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
again looking at this here it looks like

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.020 
again looking at this here it looks like
there's<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.470> lot<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.890> drywall<00:03:59.430> up<00:03:59.610> in<00:03:59.879> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
there's a lot of drywall up in the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.420 
there's a lot of drywall up in the
cavity<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.629> that<00:04:00.780> hollow<00:04:01.050> point<00:04:01.440> there<00:04:01.769> you

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
cavity of that hollow point there you

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.150 
cavity of that hollow point there you
can<00:04:02.550> see<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.730> little<00:04:03.269> bit<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.110> inside<00:04:04.890> the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
can see a little bit of it inside the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.790 
can see a little bit of it inside the
the<00:04:06.090> wound<00:04:06.300> Channel<00:04:06.720> right<00:04:06.840> there<00:04:07.110> but<00:04:07.500> it

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
the wound Channel right there but it

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.670 
the wound Channel right there but it
does<00:04:08.040> look<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.849> couple<00:04:09.569> of<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.810> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
does look like a couple of the the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.430 
does look like a couple of the the
pedals<00:04:11.069> broke<00:04:11.370> off<00:04:11.580> here<00:04:12.090> pull<00:04:12.840> on<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.170> side

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
pedals broke off here pull on the side

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.969 
pedals broke off here pull on the side
so<00:04:14.599> it<00:04:15.599> looks<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.989> direct<00:04:16.290> hit<00:04:16.530> peddled

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
so it looks like the direct hit peddled

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.920 
so it looks like the direct hit peddled
off<00:04:17.100> all<00:04:17.340> nice<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.970> clean<00:04:18.239> right<00:04:18.450> there<00:04:18.690> and

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
off all nice and clean right there and

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.020 
off all nice and clean right there and
it<00:04:19.769> penetrated<00:04:20.250> really<00:04:20.459> well<00:04:20.639> on<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.880> back

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
it penetrated really well on the back

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.600 
it penetrated really well on the back
end<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:22.019> hollow<00:04:22.410> points<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.040> for<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
end of the the hollow points but for the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.100 
end of the the hollow points but for the
drywall<00:04:24.090> stuff<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.510> looks<00:04:24.660> like<00:04:24.780> it's<00:04:24.960> not

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
drywall stuff that looks like it's not

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.040 
drywall stuff that looks like it's not
expanding<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.400> way<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.820> should<00:04:27.050> maybe

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
expanding the way that it should maybe

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.719 
expanding the way that it should maybe
it<00:04:28.229> is<00:04:28.500> supposed<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.919> work<00:04:28.979> like<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.460> don't

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
it is supposed to work like that I don't

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.330 
it is supposed to work like that I don't
know<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.479> a<00:04:30.900> lot<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.470> concerns<00:04:31.950> from<00:04:32.220> people

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
know so a lot of concerns from people

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.969 
know so a lot of concerns from people
work<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:33.240> if<00:04:33.780> they<00:04:34.020> were<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.229> shoot

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
work that if they were to shoot

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.740 
work that if they were to shoot
something<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:36.000> could<00:04:36.150> go<00:04:36.240> through<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.479> wall

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
something it could go through the wall

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.900 
something it could go through the wall
and<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:37.410> have<00:04:37.440> like<00:04:37.830> fragments<00:04:38.250> going<00:04:38.790> all

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
and you have like fragments going all

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.240 
and you have like fragments going all
over<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.120> place<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.600> mean<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.229> two<00:04:40.410> really

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
over the place I mean this is two really

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.940 
over the place I mean this is two really
consistent<00:04:41.790> shots<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.419> neither<00:04:43.260> one<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.650> them

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
consistent shots and neither one of them

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.030 
consistent shots and neither one of them
broke<00:04:44.790> apart<00:04:45.150> like<00:04:45.419> everyone<00:04:46.260> might<00:04:46.770> have

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
broke apart like everyone might have

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.469 
broke apart like everyone might have
thought<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:47.700> just<00:04:47.850> going<00:04:47.970> to<00:04:48.030> scatter

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
thought that it's just going to scatter

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.980 
thought that it's just going to scatter
scatter<00:04:49.410> copper<00:04:50.040> everywhere<00:04:50.630> so<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.840> looks

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
scatter copper everywhere so it looks

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.060 
scatter copper everywhere so it looks
like<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.260> looks<00:04:52.410> like<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.740> did<00:04:52.860> what<00:04:52.950> it's

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
like it looks like it did what it's

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.640 
like it looks like it did what it's
supposed<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.430> on<00:04:53.639> that<00:04:53.820> but<00:04:54.200> that<00:04:55.200> first<00:04:55.380> shot

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
supposed to on that but that first shot

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.770 
supposed to on that but that first shot
still<00:04:55.950> looks<00:04:56.160> wicked<00:04:56.370> now<00:04:57.270> there's<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.630> light

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
still looks wicked now there's a light

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.330 
still looks wicked now there's a light
sprinkle<00:04:58.260> today<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.770> there's<00:04:58.889> a<00:04:58.950> ton<00:04:59.310> of

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
sprinkle today and there's a ton of

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.830 
sprinkle today and there's a ton of
cloud<00:04:59.610> cover<00:04:59.910> so<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.180> wasn't<00:05:00.450> able<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.660> get<00:05:00.780> the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
cloud cover so I wasn't able to get the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.840 
cloud cover so I wasn't able to get the
frame<00:05:01.110> right<00:05:01.320> up<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:01.650> fifty<00:05:02.160> hundred<00:05:02.340> thousand

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
frame rates that I normally like so I'll

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.200 
frame rates that I normally like so I'll
probably<00:05:04.979> be<00:05:05.250> doing<00:05:05.370> some<00:05:05.490> more<00:05:05.760> tests<00:05:06.060> later
