00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.600
 this election owes a little bit of the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.540
 accents already explained in videos 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.190
 previous that the accents are not other 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.280
 thing that strong blows 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:39.670
 of greater volume that emerge in a sea 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:42.170
 of soft strokes ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.780
 they are accents 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.659
 the accents can be done with both 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.820
 hands if the strong touches right will be 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.440
 right if the strong touches left will be 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.539
 left because our order of hands 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.879
 it's always right to left but this 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.729
 case today we do not work the accents today 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.289
 with one hand the accents with hand 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.780
 right on principles assuming that 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.519
 we are skillful then what I will do 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.100
 I will follow a figure that will later be seen in 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.180
 the video and that figure first I do it in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.760
 box 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.760
 ta ta ta ta ta 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.720
 ah 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.720
 ah 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.470
 and I will always try to make 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.630
 differentiation be clear is to say the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.869
 right hand will make strong blows in the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.240
 timbal 3 and the left hand will make hits 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.680
 soft in the box and that contrast and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.350
 Mint be there our melody will be 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.670
 clear and then instead of the base timbal 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.670
 he will take it to kids 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.220
 although the melody lasts 8 sixteenths in 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.090
 a compass of 4 x 4 we will have a re 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.830
 my fa 2 of my fa those eight blows 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.570
 they are half a compass 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.120
 how the compass I'm going to make is whole 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.190
 logically the first half beat what 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.620
 I will make between charles and box right hand 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.200
 strong in charles left hand soft 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.930
 in the box and in the second half I will do what 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.800
 exactly same but the first of 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.480
 the eight blows the eight second blows 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.690
 it will be box in such a way that in the background 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.600
 I will have a back beat a strong blow from 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.120
 box in pulse 3 which brings us to 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.110
 those rhythms of ballad or fusion or of 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.110
 documentary if you want 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.760
 so I'll try to walk all that 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.769
 after having walked in charles 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.200
 I will try to walk it along the ride 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.670
 filling in the soft ones with left hand 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.469
 in the box but this time in the charles 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.469
 since the strong right is in ride 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.990
 and another variant that I will do is also 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.670
 take out strong blows from the hand 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.920
 right by the timbales on a tour 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.320
 such that timbal kettledrum kettledrum 1 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.320
 timbal box 1 timbal 2 tipal 3 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.920
 and then also add to the seen one 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.330
 semicorcheas layer of double hype 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.400
 under double a bun low 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.100
 will always give 1 and 1 regardless of 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.620
 our hands go doing 1 2 2 1 what 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.940
 that is double or my feet in the hype 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.290
 Always be left right right 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.290
 left continuously 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.000
 ah 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.200
 thank you very much and until another
