 call of duty advance an amphora so 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.930
 today from friends present you a 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.090
 glitch to arrive on a huge spots 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.739
 on the greenburg map I know you 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.420
 forget everything is achievable on next-gen 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.090
 by cons I'm really not sure 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.830
 they walk on the water jean says my 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.269
 comment it would really make me 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.970
 pleasure it would be really very 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.280
 interesting for a leasing itx that's 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.140
 very simple just to go to the same 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.020
 place that me in the video I would have 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.489
 just invented on the small wall car 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.820
 this little wall would just like to make a 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.860
 little more to get to the middle of the goal 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.950
 paris 2012 would just have to bring you the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.690
 shield then do not ask that you have 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.789
 laid your goal is just to do the 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.220
 double this so as to arise at 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.630
 above the shield once you are laid 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.520
 above the shield just want 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.800
 enough a double duel then serves a dash 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.970
 forward then you will see that 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.149
 you will be on a huge 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.660
 snow on top of that big better than 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.450
 you see and once on this big 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.979
 help to be the enemies 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.899
 where the allies are like you want 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.899
 case I think this glyph could 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.969
 still too many people 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.009
 on call of duty and the death and black 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.329
 this is the end of this video 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.360
 I hope she will want more 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.049
 not to let go of light it does 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.939
 always happy 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.380
 why not come to subscribe machine 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.740
 which is missing in the description of the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.929
 video 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.610

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.100

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.909
 chain you all that will need everything 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.799
 just go soft on twitter I 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.080
 am really very active on twitter if 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.250
 you ask me questions and so on and 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.560
 so that's the end of this video 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.099

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.099
