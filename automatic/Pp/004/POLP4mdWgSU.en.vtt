00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
you live in a Mac urja pan you consume

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.530 
you live in a Mac urja pan you consume
on<00:02:22.370> average<00:02:22.730> as<00:02:23.210> much<00:02:23.720> stuff<00:02:24.530> as<00:02:24.940> 32<00:02:25.940> Kenyan<00:02:26.360> so

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
on average as much stuff as 32 Kenyan so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.330 
on average as much stuff as 32 Kenyan so
basically<00:02:27.050> it's<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.320> problem<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.800> consumption

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
basically it's a problem of consumption

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.220 
basically it's a problem of consumption
people<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.090> developed<00:02:29.570> countries<00:02:29.600> like<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
people in developed countries like the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.110 
people in developed countries like the
United<00:02:30.470> States<00:02:30.800> Australia<00:02:31.040> Canada<00:02:31.610> all<00:02:31.910> that

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
United States Australia Canada all that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.860 
United States Australia Canada all that
kind<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> stuff<00:02:32.450> they<00:02:33.140> consume<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.920> lot<00:02:34.280> of

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
kind of stuff they consume a lot of

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.110 
kind of stuff they consume a lot of
products<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.020> lot<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.290> things<00:02:36.650> per<00:02:37.340> person<00:02:37.940> so

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
products a lot of things per person so

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.210 
products a lot of things per person so
what<00:02:38.300> we're<00:02:38.450> doing<00:02:38.810> by<00:02:38.990> having<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.470> larger

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
what we're doing by having a larger

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.160 
what we're doing by having a larger
population<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.270> developed<00:02:41.720> world's<00:02:42.050> is

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
population in the developed world's is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.440 
population in the developed world's is
increasing<00:02:42.830> consumption<00:02:43.450> exponentially

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
increasing consumption exponentially

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.820 
increasing consumption exponentially
compared<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.050> these<00:02:45.140> developing<00:02:45.770> countries

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
compared to these developing countries

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.590 
compared to these developing countries
now<00:02:46.670> while<00:02:46.880> these<00:02:47.060> developing<00:02:47.540> countries

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
now while these developing countries

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.780 
now while these developing countries
certainly<00:02:48.530> do<00:02:48.710> not<00:02:48.860> need<00:02:49.070> more<00:02:49.310> population

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
certainly do not need more population

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.510 
certainly do not need more population
either<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.720> lot<00:02:50.930> worse<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.680> developed

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
either it's a lot worse in developed

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.430 
either it's a lot worse in developed
countries<00:02:52.600> because<00:02:53.600> there's<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.020> much<00:02:54.200> more

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
countries because there's so much more

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.900 
countries because there's so much more
consumption<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.340> what<00:02:55.490> does<00:02:55.610> all<00:02:55.760> this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
consumption so what does all this

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.820 
consumption so what does all this
consumption<00:02:56.420> lead<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.350> leads<00:02:57.650> to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
consumption lead to it leads to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.130 
consumption lead to it leads to
increased<00:02:58.280> global<00:02:58.760> warming<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.990> also

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
increased global warming and it also

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.560 
increased global warming and it also
leads<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.710> extinction<00:03:01.460> of<00:03:01.760> species<00:03:02.090> I'll

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
leads to extinction of species I'll
