00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
actually doing this at a time there was

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.999 
actually doing this at a time there was
so<00:01:45.000> many<00:01:45.180> people<00:01:45.540> doing<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.009> unfortunately

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
so many people doing this unfortunately

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
so many people doing this unfortunately
guys<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.369> isn't<00:01:47.520> work<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.390> think

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
guys it isn't work now I don't think

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.929 
guys it isn't work now I don't think
because<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> market<00:01:49.409> crash<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.799> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.189> gone

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
because the market crash is kind of gone

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.850 
because the market crash is kind of gone
ish<00:01:51.270> obviously<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> prices<00:01:52.380> are<00:01:52.500> still<00:01:52.649> quite

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
ish obviously the prices are still quite

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.800 
ish obviously the prices are still quite
low<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.090> find<00:01:54.240> players<00:01:54.600> like

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
low because I really find players like

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.300 
low because I really find players like
this<00:01:54.990> anymore<00:01:55.290> because<00:01:55.560> people<00:01:56.009> aren't

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
this anymore because people aren't

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.039 
this anymore because people aren't
listening<00:01:56.610> their<00:01:56.880> players<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.479> 150
