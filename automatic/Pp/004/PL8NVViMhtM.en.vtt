you<00:03:06.170> can<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.470> pick<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.980> depends<00:03:07.580> on<00:03:07.610> the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
you can just pick it depends on the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.360 
you can just pick it depends on the
software<00:03:08.000> again<00:03:08.950> sometimes<00:03:09.950> they'll<00:03:10.100> let<00:03:10.220> you

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
software again sometimes they'll let you

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.810 
software again sometimes they'll let you
make<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> moving<00:03:11.510> background<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:12.200> video

make a moving background a video

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.530 
make a moving background a video
background<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:13.970> was<00:03:14.209> just<00:03:14.239> actually

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
background so that was just actually

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.090 
background so that was just actually
you're<00:03:14.870> just<00:03:15.080> adding<00:03:15.230> another<00:03:15.530> video<00:03:15.860> file

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100

you're just adding another video file
which<00:03:16.370> plays<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.940> background<00:03:17.420> but<00:03:17.780> for

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
which plays in the background but for

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.180 
which plays in the background but for
here<00:03:18.170> it's<00:03:18.320> just<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.560> picture<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.010> they've<00:03:19.160> got

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
here it's just a picture and they've got

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.640 
here it's just a picture and they've got
a<00:03:19.370> default<00:03:19.820> one<00:03:20.000> here<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.870> same<00:03:21.440> with<00:03:21.470> the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
a default one here and same with the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.979 
a default one here and same with the
menu<00:03:22.610> audio<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.570> would<00:03:23.660> be<00:03:23.780> like<00:03:23.959> a

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
menu audio just that would be like a

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.990 
menu audio just that would be like a
little<00:03:24.290> song<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.220> would<00:03:25.280> be<00:03:25.430> on<00:03:25.519> loop<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:25.940> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
little song that would be on loop in the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.440 
little song that would be on loop in the
menu<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:27.700> what<00:03:28.700> pretty<00:03:29.150> much<00:03:29.269> all

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
menu so what pretty much all

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.180 
menu so what pretty much all
applications<00:03:30.260> do<00:03:30.380> include<00:03:30.680> as<00:03:30.799> well<00:03:30.980> though

a little while to go that's just the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.979 
a little while to go that's just the

clip so it's playing and then I want to
go<00:03:54.079> back<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.350> menu<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:54.799> I<00:03:54.860> hit<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.160> menu

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
go back to the menu so I hit the menu

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.650 
go back to the menu so I hit the menu
button<00:03:55.780> I'm<00:03:56.780> back<00:03:57.049> on<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.230> menu<00:03:57.549> so<00:04:01.420> yeah<00:04:02.420> it

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
button I'm back on the menu so yeah it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.539 
button I'm back on the menu so yeah it
depends<00:04:02.930> on<00:04:03.019> what<00:04:03.230> software<00:04:03.530> using<00:04:04.040> but

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
depends on what software using but

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.920 
depends on what software using but
that's<00:04:04.820> the<00:04:05.000> gist<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.390> menu<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.840> is

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
that's the gist of the menu and this is

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.120 
that's the gist of the menu and this is
a<00:04:05.989> pretty<00:04:06.140> simplistic<00:04:06.530> software<00:04:07.040> they<00:04:07.100> can

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
a pretty simplistic software they can

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.280 
a pretty simplistic software they can
get<00:04:07.340> really<00:04:07.549> complex<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.780> can<00:04:08.930> add<00:04:09.109> all

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
get really complex and you can add all

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.370 
get really complex and you can add all
this<00:04:09.470> fancy<00:04:09.980> moving<00:04:10.670> path<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.150> everything<00:04:12.880> so

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
this fancy moving path and everything so

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.990 
this fancy moving path and everything so
I'm<00:04:15.380> going<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.709> move<00:04:16.130> on<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.549> next<00:04:16.609> step

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
I'm going to move on to the next step

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.500 
I'm going to move on to the next step
and<00:04:18.039> this<00:04:19.039> is<00:04:19.190> when<00:04:19.340> we're<00:04:19.519> actually<00:04:19.700> making

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
and this is when we're actually making

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.260 
and this is when we're actually making
the<00:04:20.780> DVD<00:04:20.930> burning<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:22.099> it<00:04:22.460> has<00:04:22.700> new<00:04:22.940> volume

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
the DVD burning it so it has new volume

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.830 
the DVD burning it so it has new volume
as<00:04:23.419> default<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:24.050> i'll<00:04:24.200> just<00:04:24.410> say

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
as default and i'll just say

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.129 
as default and i'll just say
oops<00:04:27.030> family<00:04:28.199> videos<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.510> that'll<00:04:32.020> be<00:04:32.110> the

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
oops family videos and that'll be the

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.689 
oops family videos and that'll be the
label<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.620> you'll<00:04:32.800> see<00:04:32.980> if<00:04:33.250> you<00:04:33.340> popped<00:04:33.580> it

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
label that you'll see if you popped it

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.610 
label that you'll see if you popped it
into<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.910> computer<00:04:34.240> will<00:04:34.449> come<00:04:34.630> up<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.380> and

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
into a computer will come up is that and

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.650 
into a computer will come up is that and
you<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:35.889> select<00:04:36.340> how<00:04:36.520> many<00:04:36.580> copies<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.540> can

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
you can select how many copies you can

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.510 
you can select how many copies you can
always<00:04:37.780> make<00:04:37.960> more<00:04:38.139> copies<00:04:38.320> later<00:04:38.650> though<00:04:38.919> cuz

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
always make more copies later though cuz

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.500 
always make more copies later though cuz
it'll<00:04:39.760> save<00:04:40.000> your<00:04:40.150> files<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:42.330> that's<00:04:43.330> pretty

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
it'll save your files and that's pretty

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.060 
it'll save your files and that's pretty
much<00:04:43.600> it<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:43.990> then<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.229> would<00:04:44.350> go<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:44.770> you

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
much it and then you would go and you

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.990 
much it and then you would go and you
would<00:04:45.280> burn<00:04:45.520> it<00:04:45.699> so<00:04:47.550> pretty<00:04:48.550> much<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.790> have<00:04:48.880> to

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
would burn it so pretty much you have to

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.990 
would burn it so pretty much you have to
feel<00:04:49.210> out<00:04:49.449> of<00:04:49.710> what<00:04:50.710> your<00:04:51.010> piece<00:04:51.610> of<00:04:51.639> software

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
feel out of what your piece of software

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.620 
feel out of what your piece of software
using<00:04:52.419> can<00:04:52.570> do<00:04:52.770> but<00:04:53.770> for<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.130> most<00:04:54.340> part

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
using can do but for the most part

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.180 
using can do but for the most part
you're<00:04:55.630> just<00:04:55.810> going<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.020> import<00:04:56.320> footage<00:04:56.560> make

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
you're just going to import footage make

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.330 
you're just going to import footage make
a<00:04:57.220> menu<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.880> then<00:04:58.720> burn<00:04:59.650> it<00:04:59.680> and<00:04:59.979> it<00:05:00.100> should<00:05:00.130> do

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
a menu and then burn it and it should do

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.639 
a menu and then burn it and it should do
the<00:05:00.460> rest
