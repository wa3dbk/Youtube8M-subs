 I realized that I was going to get to the first team of El Madrid when I was 12 or 13 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.200
 years. People see what there is now, but I remember very well what I was doing and 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.300
 what I had to suffer for that, or my parents had to suffer. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.960
 [music] 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.949
 Well, I had to make an announcement with teammates that I had when 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.369
 I had, I do not know, 13 years. Then I said: "Well, fuck, why not, we have it easier, 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.890
 If you want to look for that side, why do not I take it and tell all my friends and what 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.079
 do we do? "And well, at the end of that, I told my friends. 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.969

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.890
 there are all my friends. Here is someone responsible for Mahou who says how many beers 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.390
 were they taken in the ad? 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.190
 [music] 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.960
 I consider myself, first, a privileged one. I do what I like. Since I was little 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.840
 I have fought to be the goalkeeper of Real Madrid, I have achieved it. I fought to be the goalkeeper 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.890
 of the National Team, I have achieved it, and I do what I like. Luckily I have friends, 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.370
 Then I know what it is that my friends have problems. I know what it is that my family, inside 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.310
 of the family, I have family that also has problems. I live with it every 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.720
 day, I know what there is. I consider myself privileged; As I consider myself privileged, I do what I 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.250
 I like it, I know it and I value it. 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.000
 [music] 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 What would you change about Iker? 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.240
 I equip this year's Madrid, male, that yellow ... 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.570
 Do not like yellow? Fuck, I've chosen it, let's go [laughs]. 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.830
 The bride [laughs] 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.430
 By which? 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.690
 For her [laughs]. 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.340
 [music] 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.450
 I'm telling you, I'm not wearing a mask of any kind. I am here happy, 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.990
 really. I'm comfortable, I'm fine, I come as I am. 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.290
 [music] 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.480
 And when you want, we stay again, even if you have to get up at two 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.380
 in the morning. 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.280
 We repeat 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.420
 For many of us it is a dream to be here today. Thank Mahou and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.200
 especially you, for wanting to be here with us.
