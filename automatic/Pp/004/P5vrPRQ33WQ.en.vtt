 five tasks that will be performed 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.560
 no need or anything in the cache 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:20.990

 put your apps on the go 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:06.119
 for memory card and brightness 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.640
 so to improve performance and management 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.940
 of optimized systems 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.640
 he is going to carry 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.920
 it will end up cleaning some files 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.680
 here when selena you go and ingestion 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.450
 of application of the spine 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 applications you have opened in the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.840
 moment on your mobile 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.730
 for example I want to close this 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.380
 application I selected clicked the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:41.160
 finished application released released three 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.850
 mega memory quite the management of 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.740
 cache 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:51.120
 you can eliminate the cache that memory 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:55.320
 who does not have cell phone needs her 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.739
 eliminating the cache of google maps is 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.040
 it's a bad performance a boy one more 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.209
 a second of speed then it is already 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.610
 quite something 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.420
 some other functions in the same 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.270
 application as in to the story with 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.050
 history of various things and decreases 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:18.420
 enough memory is to generate enough of 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.959
 speed you can 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.010
 lower the brightness setting nor do this 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.560
 helps a lot in battery saving 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.920
 The less brightness but the battery you 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.590
 can save money is also a tip 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:42.870
 that settings android you can 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.580
 is and here you can can 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.070
 change some fun to the version 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.810
 android but a whole are fine 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.420
 Similar do not know can fall no 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.459
 animation will also ensure a good 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:00.000
 performance on your phone also has the 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.519
 duration of the background light while the lowest 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.060
 dilute duration background more battery you 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.940
 can save money 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.600
 one last tip that would be the antivirus 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.850
 huh 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.519
 they take up a lot of memory but I 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:19.140
 I recommend letting them make you lose 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.780
 It's a bit of a performance, but if you 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.710
 get the virus right on your cell phone 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.640
 It can be a lot worse then it's always good 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:32.280
 It is also logical to open the virus as 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.460
 The final tip I'll leave here for you 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.530
 not good, huh? 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:43.680
 to use what is not good to use is 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.540
 bottom is that they move 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.790
 this disrupts the performance of the 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.830
 cell phone 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.380
 you also can not install many 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.850
 applications on your phone 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.800
 It's good to always uninstall what you 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:04.920
 not using help much to clean 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:08.850
 and wait for the storage is and I hope 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.070
