00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.519
 To be honest, when it came out 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.969
 The launch was still configured 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.740
 go back dynamo believed hoped that 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.150
 will you hurt that team with 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.489
 which is signed by you urgent 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.259
 contract or was willing to stay in 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:22.739
 wings and if so folded 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.300
 circumstances were ready for a long time 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.579
 principle i was ready nato ready 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.800
 explaining why because how would 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.259
 principle i am returning dynamo could 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.739
 only decide the current leadership there and 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.910
 coaches they want me not though yes and how 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.859
 would i basically have no 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.550
 there was no information when I was on vacation 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.719
 how will she really therefore in 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.760
 Basically, you know what I have here 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.039
 January 28th contract 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.670
 It turned out that I must necessarily 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.510
 was supposed to come here I came as 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.780
 would be two days 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.480
 too with me none of the leadership dynamo 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.719
 nobody called me said nothing 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.730
 Basically, I was already tuned 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.549
 leave for the gathering team here and but here 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.240
 Just two days ago, called the tube 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:13.030
 Samara first and said that it is necessary 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.590
 come back you talked 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.990
 directly from the petresque ie 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.240
 said that before going to the interested 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 play or while you go to the gathering and not 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.920
 it is possible that we will still see you 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.780
 I haven't talked to him like that yet 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.759
 the phone got literally two words he 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.430
 just didn't say what I said 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.170
 the leadership that they wrapped and we you 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.170
 waiting here is the only word that 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.909
 spoke to him specifically about 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.219
 something i am likely to be now 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.530
 on on collecting in spain myself like when i 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:49.719
 I will go only positive emotions because 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.200
 that here are beautiful people are beautiful 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:56.289
 fans are wonderful people who 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.810
 Samara Football Club works 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.960
 and thank you very much thank you all 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.100
 who have been working since the cleaners 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.579
 quite quite 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.530
 who are in the kitchen in with all the people 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.150
 who work for this club and 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.000
 many thanks to the fans 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.860
 supported the team until the very end 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.800
 despite the fact that there may be a result 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.110
 we are not very good in this life 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.770
 all possible full will not 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.930
 I guess I say that everything is possible I 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:35.140
 I don't know how anyone will know, but this 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:37.210
 only time will tell more for the year itself 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.870
 vivid memory of what that Samara 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.570
 You can highlight the principle is not in general 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.090
 I liked everything and everything is fine as once 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.600
 I say I didnâ€™t like everything 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.510
 good people are well-wisher so this 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.430
 the most important thing in life when 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.570
 people support each other not even 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.570
 very good stats
