00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
we'll have to adjust for it so take the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.680 
we'll have to adjust for it so take the
ruler<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> straight<00:00:50.820> line<00:00:50.850> across<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
ruler make a straight line across and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.380 
ruler make a straight line across and
that's<00:00:51.870> where<00:00:52.110> you're<00:00:52.230> gonna<00:00:52.410> cut<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.390> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that's where you're gonna cut it at so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.110 
that's where you're gonna cut it at so
first<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.379> at<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> top<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:56.969> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
first we do that at the top and then of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
first we do that at the top and then of
course<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.570> also<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
course we also have to do that on the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.819 
course we also have to do that on the
sides<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.660> make<00:01:00.809> sure<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.620> back

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
sides so we have to make sure the back

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
sides so we have to make sure the back
part<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> front<00:01:02.730> part<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.329> exactly<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
part and the front part are exactly the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.530 
part and the front part are exactly the
same<00:01:04.049> size<00:01:04.640> now<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> sides<00:01:07.040> and

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
same size now we do it on the sides and

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.929 
same size now we do it on the sides and
measure<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:10.020> long<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.040> pillow<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
measure how long the pillow is going to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.060 
measure how long the pillow is going to
be<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.360> big<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
be or how big it is going to be it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.530 
be or how big it is going to be it
really<00:01:14.310> did<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.939> depends<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.509> kind

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
really did really depends on what kind

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840 
really did really depends on what kind
of<00:01:15.780> pillow<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> use<00:01:16.799> later<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.310> for

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.889 
or glue it if you don't want to so you
can<00:01:50.939> also<00:01:51.119> glue<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> now<00:01:54.240> make<00:01:54.420> sure<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
can also glue it so now make sure you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.950 
can also glue it so now make sure you
pin<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.290> together<00:01:56.390> on<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> different

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
pin it together on all the different

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.520 
pin it together on all the different
sides<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.969> now<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.479> sew<00:02:00.810> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
sides and now we have to sew so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.810 
sides and now we have to sew so
basically<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.159> you're<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.610> is

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
basically what you're going to do is

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.229 
basically what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> sew<00:02:03.840> around<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.490> pillow

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.350 

just<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.420> close<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.379> each<00:02:11.009> side

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
just to close it up on each side

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.220 
just to close it up on each side
and<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:14.410> can<00:02:14.560> slow<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.830> all<00:02:15.190> around<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.990> it's

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
and you can slow it all around so it's

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.590 
and you can slow it all around so it's
completely<00:02:17.890> shut<00:02:18.370> because<00:02:19.180> then<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.480> can

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
completely shut because then you can

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.010 
completely shut because then you can
turn<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.990> back<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.980> right<00:02:21.130> way<00:02:21.190> by<00:02:22.060> using<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
turn it back the right way by using the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.420 
turn it back the right way by using the
opening<00:02:23.530> with<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.860> buttons<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> front

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
opening with the buttons in the front

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.860 
opening with the buttons in the front

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
and do this for all four sides now we're

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.660 
and do this for all four sides now we're
going<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.050> turn<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.380> back<00:02:32.410> inside<00:02:33.040> out<00:02:33.250> so
