it starts to warm up again then this

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.460 
it starts to warm up again then this
thing<00:02:12.220> will<00:02:12.250> rain<00:02:12.760> down<00:02:13.180> on<00:02:13.540> here<00:02:14.049> and<00:02:14.290> it's

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
thing will rain down on here and it's

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.150 
thing will rain down on here and it's
really<00:02:14.709> it's<00:02:15.579> recycling<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.599> moisture<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.349> in

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
really it's recycling the moisture in in

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.839 
really it's recycling the moisture in in
this<00:02:18.489> little<00:02:18.849> area<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.190> that's<00:02:21.640> what

this little area and so that's what

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.630 
this little area and so that's what
we're<00:02:22.030> seeing<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.690> hearing<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:24.370> rains

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
we're seeing and hearing is the rains

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.420 
we're seeing and hearing is the rains

water<00:02:27.730> coming<00:02:28.150> off<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.390> plastic<00:02:29.049> acting<00:02:29.980> like

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
water coming off the plastic acting like

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.660 
water coming off the plastic acting like
rain<00:02:31.140> back<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.319> these<00:02:32.470> crops<00:02:32.829> to<00:02:33.160> water<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
rain back to these crops to water the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.819 
rain back to these crops to water the
plants<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.239> his<00:02:34.510> high<00:02:34.720> tunnel<00:02:35.200> Brandi

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
plants in his high tunnel Brandi

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.059 
plants in his high tunnel Brandi
installed<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.640> micro<00:02:37.180> irrigation<00:02:37.470> system<00:02:38.470> what

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
installed a micro irrigation system what

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.890 
installed a micro irrigation system what
we<00:02:39.220> did<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.549> we<00:02:39.579> put<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.940> micro<00:02:40.540> irrigation

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
we did is we put a micro irrigation

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.069 
we did is we put a micro irrigation
system<00:02:41.889> into<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.209> we<00:02:43.359> got<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.720> drip

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
system into this so we got this drip

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.420 
system into this so we got this drip
tape<00:02:44.319> right<00:02:45.099> here<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:46.150> here's<00:02:46.720> an<00:02:46.900> emitter

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
tape right here and here's an emitter

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.490 
tape right here and here's an emitter
and<00:02:48.430> these<00:02:48.730> things<00:02:49.060> are<00:02:49.239> spaced<00:02:49.630> every<00:02:50.200> 12

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
and these things are spaced every 12

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.039 
and these things are spaced every 12
inches<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.700> there's<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.970> drop<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.359> water<00:02:52.690> that

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
inches so there's a drop of water that

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.979 
inches so there's a drop of water that
comes<00:02:53.260> out<00:02:53.530> every<00:02:53.799> 12<00:02:54.519> inches<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.750> let<00:02:55.900> it

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
comes out every 12 inches and you let it

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.990 
comes out every 12 inches and you let it
run<00:02:56.139> for<00:02:56.440> about<00:02:56.650> an<00:02:56.859> hour<00:02:57.069> or<00:02:57.280> half<00:02:57.700> an<00:02:57.880> hour

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
run for about an hour or half an hour

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.569 
run for about an hour or half an hour
and<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.019> get<00:02:59.169> enough<00:02:59.530> water<00:02:59.829> down<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.190> grow

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
and you get enough water down to grow

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.930 
and you get enough water down to grow
these<00:03:00.730> plants<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.709> we<00:03:03.160> put<00:03:03.459> these<00:03:03.669> in

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
these plants and so we put these in

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.789 
these plants and so we put these in
every<00:03:04.120> row<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:04.750> planted<00:03:05.139> something<00:03:05.530> and

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
every row that we planted something and

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.550 
every row that we planted something and
that's<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.130> 2<00:03:06.310> foot<00:03:06.519> spacing<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.840> provide<00:03:08.200> easy

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
that's a 2 foot spacing to provide easy

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.680 
that's a 2 foot spacing to provide easy
access<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.400> his<00:03:09.579> high<00:03:09.760> tunnel<00:03:10.209> Randy

we<00:03:46.040> gotta<00:03:46.250> crank<00:03:46.580> these<00:03:46.849> things<00:03:47.239> open<00:03:47.690> up<00:03:47.810> a

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
we gotta crank these things open up a

we gotta crank these things open up a
window

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.110

Randee also placed a composter with an
easy-access<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:59.410> high<00:03:59.620> tunnel<00:04:00.040> take<00:04:00.340> all<00:04:00.520> the

easy-access of high tunnel take all the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:19.500 
easy-access of high tunnel take all the
greens<00:04:17.609> Randy<00:04:18.609> says<00:04:18.820> there<00:04:19.090> is<00:04:19.239> some

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
greens Randy says there is some

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.539 
greens Randy says there is some
additional<00:04:20.019> Corrections<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:20.859> may<00:04:21.160> have<00:04:21.370> to

additional Corrections that may have to

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.700 
additional Corrections that may have to
be<00:04:21.670> made<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.940> really<00:04:22.810> don't<00:04:22.990> have<00:04:23.200> much<00:04:23.470> to

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
be made that really don't have much to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.620 
be made that really don't have much to
do<00:04:23.830> with<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.130> structure<00:04:24.610> itself<00:04:25.030> it's<00:04:25.360> more

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
do with the structure itself it's more

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.420 
do with the structure itself it's more
about<00:04:25.930> wind<00:04:26.350> direction

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
about wind direction

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.730 
about wind direction
I<00:04:27.460> believe<00:04:28.440> Tomatoes<00:04:29.440> included<00:04:30.130> corn<00:04:30.540> beans

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
I believe Tomatoes included corn beans

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.880 
I believe Tomatoes included corn beans
especially<00:04:32.740> need<00:04:33.400> wind<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.770> movement<00:04:35.770> of

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
especially need wind and movement of

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.770 
especially need wind and movement of
these<00:04:36.070> crops<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:37.210> pollinate<00:04:37.750> themselves<00:04:37.990> and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
these crops to pollinate themselves and

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.620 
these crops to pollinate themselves and
because<00:04:40.780> of<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.020> orientation<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.630> high

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
because of the orientation of this high

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.250 
because of the orientation of this high
tunnel

our<00:04:44.740> main<00:04:44.980> wind<00:04:45.310> comes<00:04:45.610> from<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.820> doors<00:04:46.210> the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
our main wind comes from the doors the

our main wind comes from the doors the
big<00:04:46.990> doors<00:04:47.260> in<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:48.370> direction<00:04:48.720> well<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:50.050> kept

big doors in that direction well I kept

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.140 
big doors in that direction well I kept
those<00:04:50.770> closed<00:04:51.250> down<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.030> wouldn't

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
those closed down so I wouldn't

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.140 
those closed down so I wouldn't

introduce bugs that would be detrimental

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.670 
introduce bugs that would be detrimental
to<00:04:55.630> this<00:04:55.960> high<00:04:56.200> tunnel<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:56.820> we<00:04:57.820> kept<00:04:58.090> besides

regulating the temperatures however
because<00:05:02.710> we<00:05:02.740> didn't<00:05:03.370> get<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.790> good<00:05:04.060> winds

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
because we didn't get the good winds

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.800 
because we didn't get the good winds
coming<00:05:05.380> through<00:05:05.620> here<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:06.540> believe<00:05:07.540> the

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
coming through here I believe the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.370 
coming through here I believe the
pollination<00:05:08.320> didn't<00:05:08.800> happen<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:09.340> because<00:05:10.380> we

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
pollination didn't happen and because we

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.880 
pollination didn't happen and because we
had<00:05:11.650> lots<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.820> flowers<00:05:13.510> on<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:13.810> beans<00:05:14.050> we<00:05:14.620> had

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
had lots of flowers on the beans we had

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.240 
had lots of flowers on the beans we had
not<00:05:15.160> one<00:05:15.490> bean<00:05:15.820> show<00:05:16.180> up<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.780> that's<00:05:17.440> why<00:05:17.680> it'd

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
not one bean show up and that's why it'd

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.100 
not one bean show up and that's why it'd
be<00:05:18.460> nice<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:18.970> talk<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.360> other<00:05:19.510> people<00:05:19.930> that

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
be nice to talk to other people that

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.590 
be nice to talk to other people that
have<00:05:20.169> these<00:05:20.650> high<00:05:20.860> tunnels<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.970> see<00:05:22.180> what<00:05:22.360> kind

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
have these high tunnels to see what kind

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.230 
have these high tunnels to see what kind
of<00:05:22.720> issues<00:05:23.140> they<00:05:23.380> come<00:05:23.860> up<00:05:24.010> with<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.850> are<00:05:25.090> the

then any bug that crawls won't be able

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.270 
then any bug that crawls won't be able
