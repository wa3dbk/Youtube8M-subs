00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
for auction I got them so let's say we

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.110 
for auction I got them so let's say we
get<00:00:35.640> from<00:00:35.790> these<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:37.700> think<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
get from these I think this is like the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
get from these I think this is like the
first<00:00:39.329> picture<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:39.899> got<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:40.379> like

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
first picture that we got that was like

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.170 
first picture that we got that was like
all<00:00:40.890> holographic<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.790> believe<00:00:42.030> this

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
all holographic because I believe this

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
all holographic because I believe this
is<00:00:42.239> before<00:00:43.020> hitting<00:00:43.230> Arsenal<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.800> everything

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
is before hitting Arsenal and everything

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
is before hitting Arsenal and everything
to<00:00:44.309> correct<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.090> I'm<00:00:45.180> wrong<00:00:45.210> no<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> think

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to correct me if I'm wrong no I think

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
to correct me if I'm wrong no I think
that's<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:47.640> not<00:00:47.879> 100%<00:00:48.390> sure<00:00:48.660> on

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that's right but I'm not 100% sure on

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.600 
that's right but I'm not 100% sure on
that<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> don't<00:00:50.129> wanna<00:00:50.250> mess<00:00:50.370> up<00:00:50.399> these
