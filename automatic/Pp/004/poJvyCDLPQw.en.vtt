00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.440
 now you are our guest to know the porterias galleries of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.300
 pictures of companies on the web 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.960
 the best thing is that you do not even need the special glasses to check 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:25.889
 c tribes if one thinks that the images in 3d were invented recently by means of 

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:29.130
 of super advanced tools know that you are mistaken 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.000
 the first registers experiments with three-dimensional photos appeared in 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.879
 1840 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.409
 the tactic used by the inventor was to photograph the same object with 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.260
 two cameras simultaneously and view the photos very closely with 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.949
 a kind of special binocular the binoculars makes each eye see 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.529
 only one image and the result this feeling of depth 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.600
 this technique is called mirror copy computer use she won the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.840
 movement in a more convincing format the binoculars of yesteryear were 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.970
 retired and now a certain one containing the two overlapping images 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.829
 can fool the brain easily 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.679
 this process is the illusion of a 3D image from a couple of 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.330
 two dimensions 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.940
 this site here for example gathers several old photographs of japan 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.240
 that were transformed into 3d 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.360
 although simple the effect really gives the feeling of depth of the images 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.570
 and there are many other examples published on various web sites by the photo of the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.240
 Boy playing swing is one of the most well made we found 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.960
 another image that draws attention by the degree of realism is the pull the movement 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.760
 stereoscopy gives the impression that the pool water really is 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.660
 exhaling to the sides 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.410
 If you liked this type of photo access now look digital dot com 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.610
 point br and that in that matter that is highlighted in the bag there you find 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.340
 the links to the site that we show and we also separate a video in which 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.850
 teach you how to make an animated steak if interested then jump there
