00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.470 
a cardboard box there's no window box
you<00:02:19.799> can't<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.220> what<00:02:20.459> actually<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.269> there

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
you can't see what actually is in there

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.910 
you can't see what actually is in there
of<00:02:21.629> course<00:02:22.049> you'll<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.440> who's<00:02:22.680> inside

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
of course you'll know who's inside

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.039 
of course you'll know who's inside
because<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.640> box<00:02:23.849> arm<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.720> won't<00:02:24.900> be

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
because of the box arm but you won't be

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.380 
because of the box arm but you won't be
able<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.379> actually<00:02:25.590> check<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.360> a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
able to actually check you know for a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.930 
able to actually check you know for a
little<00:02:27.690> paint<00:02:28.019> application<00:02:28.860> defects<00:02:29.700> or

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
little paint application defects or

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.360 
little paint application defects or
flaws<00:02:30.180> or<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.620> little<00:02:31.890> things<00:02:32.099> like<00:02:32.220> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
flaws or or just little things like that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.490 
flaws or or just little things like that
so<00:02:32.879> that's<00:02:33.420> kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.840> odd<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.470> would

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
so that's kind of odd that they would

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.979 
so that's kind of odd that they would
start<00:02:34.890> doing<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.280> because<00:02:35.579> collectors<00:02:36.569> do

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
start doing that because collectors do

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.289 
start doing that because collectors do
want<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.950> check<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:38.790> they're<00:02:39.000> getting

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
want to just check if they're getting

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.420 
want to just check if they're getting
the<00:02:39.540> best<00:02:39.750> version<00:02:40.079> of<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.470> toy<00:02:40.680> because<00:02:41.040> they

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the best version of the toy because they

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.860 
the best version of the toy because they
want<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.879> make<00:02:42.000> sure<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.480> paint<00:02:42.690> apps

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
want to make sure that the paint apps

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.720 
want to make sure that the paint apps
are<00:02:43.049> looking<00:02:43.379> good<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.769> that's<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.700> a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
are looking good and that's actually a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.099 
are looking good and that's actually a
very<00:02:44.790> normal<00:02:45.329> thing<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.629> don't<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:45.959> it's

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
very normal thing I don't think it's

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.229 
very normal thing I don't think it's
hardcore<00:02:46.410> nerdy<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.190> any<00:02:47.370> way<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:47.910> that's<00:02:48.090> what

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
hardcore nerdy in any way so that's what

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.009 
hardcore nerdy in any way so that's what
it's<00:02:48.329> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> look<00:02:48.569> like<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:48.959> the

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019
