00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.290
 intermediate friends as they are I am 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.030
 luis key of good now that in Mexico 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.459
 we are talking a lot about the selection 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.530
 of football on this whole issue of 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.509
 lava world wrote a very movie 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.250
 interesting about it I'm 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.960
 referring to the movie metegol a 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.090
 animation movie that the time that 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.949
 she is very well qualified she speaks very 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.689
 well of this movie there is talk that there 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.820
 an important budget and that 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.130
 Surely it will give a lot to talk about 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.619
 for everything we accomplished everything well done 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.750
 that this film is made in that 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.879
 meaning we talk with poncho herrera e 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.280
 irene adze that they lent their 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.270
 voices for this movie so let's go to 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.270
 see what they told us 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.350
 I love you can not think of a future if 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.350
 you spend it playing at the metegol 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.630
 this is a nightmare after I go to 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.560
 wake up and everything will be fine the bar 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.560
 he hits me 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.340
 had for me was 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.470
 a privilege because it 's a movie 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 Latin American from a very director 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.330
 recognized that as is campanela with 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.340
 endearing characters with companions 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.700
 also work endearing 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.610
 companions in this endearing case 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.829
 and then I'm very happy to finally 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.899
 be here in front of a camera and invite 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.210
 to people to cheer up and go with 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.860
 the whole family to the cinemas not because it 's 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.350
 a very good option to go as a family 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.119
 I think the children are going to enjoy it 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.270
 those who do not have enough dads 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.149
 even though one may think that it is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.259
 football is not necessarily football 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.479
 everything I think there are some values 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.759
 universal pretty pretty parents that 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.469
 Children can understand and family 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.920
 as well 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.899
 Yes, of course it's me for 3,724 games 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.530
 unbeaten together you and me since I to the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.530
 face of my son 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.630
 now we can still flip the game 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.800
 let's find the boys who are 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.330
 from land where nothing I do not know me in 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.810
 of the meteor I know every inch 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.940
 since it was good time for me 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.490
 he talked to me they talked about the universal for 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.760
 to invite me and the first images 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.670
 that I saw from the movie I found 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.160
 really beautiful and of really good quality 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.260
 awesome and I think the dubbing for 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.010
 the actors is always a challenge because 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.460
 because it is an exercise that coexists 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.980
 technical with the plausible does not have to 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.549
 sound plausible but for that you have to 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.879
 grab certain tools 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.829
 techniques that I good is not the first 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.709
 I do dubbing but I do not do it 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.390
 I feel totally familiar with him 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.340
 then it was an incredible challenge and 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.569
 inevitable to say no compensation 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.920
 football game seriously 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.680
 keep loving do not come back in the village and 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.540
 the rest would stop with an 11-0 eleven 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.720
 hanging on the crossbar if it does not reach us 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.620
 kill 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.900
 and right now 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.810
 as you say when you know that a 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.700
 single option 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.379
 it is said partial 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.569
 If I think 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:34.210
 especially it comes at a very 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.250
 very important very peculiar 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.260
 I believe that the message of metegol that 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.270
 I think all Mexicans could 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.210
 grab beyond just football 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.570
 is to make equipment both within the 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.980
 court as off the court trying 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.100
 to get the best out of ourselves 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.840
 leave a little bit of that insecurity that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.870
 suddenly everyone has because all 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.450
 at some point we can be like amadeo 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.520
 that we are like inside of 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.210
 this insecurity and try to take what 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.710
 best of ourselves and that too 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.960
 it is implies he 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.180
 surround yourself with the right people in 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.530
 this case laura the character that 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.470
 interprets irene was a great catalyst 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.880
 so that in this case he loves others 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.880
 I could get the best out of himself 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.770
 ideas but it does not make everyone seem 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.770
 what a lot 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.910
 they do not realize that what unites us is 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.910
 much more than what separates us 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:53.979
 I think it 's a movie that 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.919
 they have the characteristics to be able to 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.349
 compete with the big ones and it's one of the 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.830
 things that make us more proud 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.949
 to be part of a competing project 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:10.649
 with the great animation studios and 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.649
 that comes from Latin America 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.900
 because there they have it the time that if not the 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.360
 have seen run to see this movie 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.979
 It's really worth it for the moment I 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.419
 I say let us your comments 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.270
 write us on twitter 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.360
