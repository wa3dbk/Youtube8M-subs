the<00:00:40.129> twin<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.549> blue<00:00:40.850> that's<00:00:41.659> better<00:00:41.930> yeah<00:00:42.530> I

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
the twin to blue that's better yeah I

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.680 
the twin to blue that's better yeah I
think<00:00:42.860> it's<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.129> good<00:00:43.280> choice<00:00:43.460> now<00:00:44.269> this<00:00:44.479> is<00:00:44.659> a

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
think it's a good choice now this is a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.799 
think it's a good choice now this is a
tube<00:00:45.129> petal<00:00:46.129> like<00:00:46.580> the<00:00:46.760> twin<00:00:47.000> tube<00:00:47.180> classic

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
tube petal like the twin tube classic

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.140 
tube petal like the twin tube classic
they<00:00:48.470> look<00:00:48.680> very<00:00:48.710> similar<00:00:49.339> but<00:00:49.369> what<00:00:49.760> what's

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
they look very similar but what what's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.460 
they look very similar but what what's
ideally<00:00:50.659> what's<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.930> difference<00:00:51.320> between

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
ideally what's the difference between

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.039 
ideally what's the difference between
the<00:00:51.769> two<00:00:51.920> petals<00:00:52.299> basically<00:00:53.299> the<00:00:53.659> twin<00:00:53.869> tube

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
the two petals basically the twin tube

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.100 
the two petals basically the twin tube
blue<00:00:54.260> has<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.589> lower<00:00:54.979> gain<00:00:55.309> -<00:00:55.580> mm-hmm<00:00:56.150> and<00:00:56.269> it's

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
blue has a lower gain - mm-hmm and it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.950 
blue has a lower gain - mm-hmm and it's
a<00:00:57.170> 6111<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.820> gain<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.180> dropped<00:00:59.449> down<00:00:59.659> but

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
a 6111 so the gain is dropped down but

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.140 
a 6111 so the gain is dropped down but
at<00:01:00.049> the<00:01:00.140> same<00:01:00.379> time<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:00.890> opened<00:01:01.309> up<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.670> highs

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
at the same time we opened up the highs

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.850 
at the same time we opened up the highs
and<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.629> lows<00:01:02.869> we're<00:01:03.080> open<00:01:03.290> up<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.500> top<00:01:03.710> and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
and the lows we're open up the top and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.179 
and the lows we're open up the top and
the<00:01:03.920> bottom<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:04.939> it<00:01:05.059> became<00:01:05.420> this<00:01:05.630> really<00:01:06.380> kind

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
the bottom so it became this really kind

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.599 
the bottom so it became this really kind

and then just a little bit of grit on
the<00:01:51.710> lead<00:01:51.950> channel<00:01:52.219> you<00:01:52.399> could<00:01:52.520> do<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.700> of

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
the lead channel you could do that of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.209 
the lead channel you could do that of
course<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.960> got<00:01:54.079> tons<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.649> room<00:01:54.799> tons<00:01:55.130> of
