was at the water park all day and that's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.140 
was at the water park all day and that's
how<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> got<00:00:23.600> this<00:00:24.600> beautiful<00:00:25.500> summer<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.340> I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
how I got this beautiful summer and I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.779 
how I got this beautiful summer and I
also<00:00:27.300> got<00:00:27.599> green<00:00:27.930> hair<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> great

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
also got green hair so it was a great

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.389 
also got green hair so it was a great
day<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:31.080> last<00:00:31.349> time<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:31.949> was<00:00:32.099> Green<00:00:32.369> I

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
day the last time I here was Green I

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
day the last time I here was Green I
ended<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.000> having<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.510> diet<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.290> reddish-brown

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
ended up having to diet a reddish-brown

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.340 
ended up having to diet a reddish-brown
so<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> could<00:00:35.700> cancel<00:00:35.880> out<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> green<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
so it could cancel out the green but I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.840 
so it could cancel out the green but I
want<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> avoid<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.550> I've<00:00:38.700> already

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
want to avoid that because I've already

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.700 
want to avoid that because I've already
dyed<00:00:39.120> my<00:00:39.300> hair<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.750> much<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.350> didn't<00:00:40.590> want

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
dyed my hair so much and I didn't want

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.709 
dyed my hair so much and I didn't want
to<00:00:40.800> kill<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> anymore<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.300> thinking

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
to kill it anymore so I was thinking

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.100 
to kill it anymore so I was thinking
purple<00:00:43.530> shampoo<00:00:44.129> cancels<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.149> yellow<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
purple shampoo cancels out yellow so

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.740 
purple shampoo cancels out yellow so
some<00:00:46.559> sort<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> red<00:00:47.219> substance<00:00:47.579> should<00:00:48.059> cancel

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
some sort of red substance should cancel

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.389 
some sort of red substance should cancel
out<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> green<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.160> thought

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
out the green and then I thought

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.830 
out the green and then I thought
ketchups<00:00:51.120> red<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.020> yes<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.920> put<00:00:53.550> ketchup<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.570> my

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
ketchups red so yes I put ketchup in my

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
ketchups red so yes I put ketchup in my
hair<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.410> gross<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.460> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
hair you and it was really gross but it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.790 
hair you and it was really gross but it
worked<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.449> that's<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.170> matters

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
worked and that's all that matters

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830 
worked and that's all that matters
basically<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> did<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.539> put<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
basically what I did was I put the
