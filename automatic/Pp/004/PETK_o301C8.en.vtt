run<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:34.340> think<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> way<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.329> were

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
run I think just the way that we were
able<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> play<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> team<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.010> was

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
really it probably didn't seem like a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.280 
really it probably didn't seem like a
tough<00:00:41.670> road<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.030> everybody<00:00:42.719> else<00:00:42.989> getting

personal I think you know it had to be

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.690 
personal I think you know it had to be
somewhere<00:02:55.960> in<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.320> freshman<00:02:56.830> season<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.550> was

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
somewhere in the freshman season it was

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.030 
somewhere in the freshman season it was
up<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.030> down<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.480> then<00:02:58.570> kind<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.110> figured<00:02:59.950> out

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
up and down and then kind of figured out

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.980 
up and down and then kind of figured out
that<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:01.000> know<00:03:01.120> me<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:01.360> coach<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> same

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
page and and you know we had a great

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.970 
page and and you know we had a great
postseason<00:03:04.030> after<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.780> what's<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.710> best

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
postseason after that what's the best

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.680

thing<00:03:06.160> playing<00:03:06.520> for<00:03:06.730> gianopolous<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:13.600> is

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
thing playing for gianopolous that is

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.770 
thing playing for gianopolous that is
not<00:03:13.840> what<00:03:14.280> stands<00:03:15.280> out<00:03:15.550> or<00:03:15.580> separates<00:03:16.180> the

best thing yeah I guess they probably

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.860 
best thing yeah I guess they probably
would<00:03:20.020> be<00:03:20.170> his<00:03:20.320> intensity<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.100> how<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:22.720> know

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
would be his intensity and how you know

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.190 
would be his intensity and how you know
into<00:03:23.680> every<00:03:24.340> single<00:03:24.820> thing<00:03:25.090> he<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.780> whether

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
into every single thing he is whether

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.730 
into every single thing he is whether
it's<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.370> court<00:03:27.400> whether<00:03:28.440> we're<00:03:29.440> out<00:03:29.560> to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
it's on the court whether we're out to

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.920 
it's on the court whether we're out to
dinner<00:03:29.910> he<00:03:30.910> literally<00:03:31.420> probably<00:03:31.540> has<00:03:31.810> an

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
dinner he literally probably has an

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.230 
dinner he literally probably has an
intensity<00:03:32.230> about<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:33.100> wine<00:03:33.340> he<00:03:33.550> drinks<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
intensity about the wine he drinks the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.330 
intensity about the wine he drinks the
food<00:03:34.480> he<00:03:34.690> eats<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.500> basketball<00:03:36.070> play<00:03:37.080> kalenna

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
food he eats the basketball play kalenna

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.040 
food he eats the basketball play kalenna
obviously<00:03:39.340> Breanna<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.240> gonna<00:03:40.420> be<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.690> focus

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
obviously Breanna is gonna be the focus

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.540

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
projected by many to be the number one

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.830
