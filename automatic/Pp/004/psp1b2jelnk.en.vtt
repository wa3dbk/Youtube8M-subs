stove itself nothing really fancy or

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.119 
stove itself nothing really fancy or
complicated<00:02:33.879> about<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.620> what<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.860> done

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129

with<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.900> actually<00:02:37.900> before<00:02:38.140> we<00:02:38.230> get<00:02:38.319> into

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
with it is actually before we get into

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.650 
with it is actually before we get into
that<00:02:38.739> let<00:02:38.950> me<00:02:38.980> show<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.280> something<00:02:39.700> here<00:02:39.730> this

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
that let me show you something here this

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.440 
that let me show you something here this
is<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> typical<00:02:41.220> aluminum<00:02:42.220> bottle<00:02:42.790> stove<00:02:43.090> okay

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
is a typical aluminum bottle stove okay

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.690 
is a typical aluminum bottle stove okay
and<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:44.230> notice<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.829> size<00:02:45.010> difference<00:02:45.489> there

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
and you notice the size difference there

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.890 
and you notice the size difference there
it's<00:02:46.030> pretty<00:02:46.569> extreme<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:49.030> alone<00:02:49.420> says<00:02:49.870> a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
it's pretty extreme so that alone says a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.550 
it's pretty extreme so that alone says a
lot<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:51.299> made<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.329> couple<00:02:52.599> modifications<00:02:52.930> to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
lot so made a couple modifications to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.949 
lot so made a couple modifications to
this<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:53.950> we've<00:02:54.099> done<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.730> we've<00:02:55.599> actually

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
this what we've done is we've actually

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.949 
this what we've done is we've actually
used<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.280> thirty-seconds<00:02:58.120> drill<00:02:58.480> bit<00:02:58.720> on

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
used a one thirty-seconds drill bit on

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.960 
used a one thirty-seconds drill bit on
the<00:02:59.290> Jets<00:02:59.650> here<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.129> actually<00:03:00.400> increase<00:03:00.549> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
the Jets here and actually increase the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.759 
the Jets here and actually increase the
number<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.209> jets<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:02.140> what<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.470> did<00:03:02.739> was

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
number of jets and what that did was

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.920 
number of jets and what that did was
tighten<00:03:03.519> up<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.879> flame<00:03:04.150> pattern<00:03:04.420> on<00:03:04.750> this

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
tighten up the flame pattern on this

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.500 
tighten up the flame pattern on this
quite<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> bit<00:03:05.319> which<00:03:05.970> allows<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.239> work

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
quite a bit which allows it to work

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.440 
quite a bit which allows it to work
really<00:03:07.840> well<00:03:08.109> with<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.980> water<00:03:09.639> bottle<00:03:09.880> and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
really well with the water bottle and

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.900 
really well with the water bottle and
let<00:03:10.599> me<00:03:10.720> get<00:03:10.840> my<00:03:10.930> whole<00:03:11.079> setup<00:03:11.380> here<00:03:11.530> in<00:03:12.280> that

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
let me get my whole setup here in that

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.839 
let me get my whole setup here in that
water<00:03:13.780> bottle<00:03:14.170> holder<00:03:14.530> one<00:03:14.859> thing<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.220> carry

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
water bottle holder one thing I carry

underneath the whole set up just up the
stove<00:03:19.329> frame<00:03:19.569> a<00:03:19.599> little<00:03:19.750> faster<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.290> just<00:03:20.470> a

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
stove frame a little faster is just a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.370 
stove frame a little faster is just a
little<00:03:20.739> piece<00:03:20.889> of<00:03:21.160> tinfoil<00:03:22.000> here<00:03:22.329> so<00:03:22.750> we're

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
little piece of tinfoil here so we're

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.659 
little piece of tinfoil here so we're
actually<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.859> get<00:03:23.919> that<00:03:24.069> set<00:03:24.340> up<00:03:24.459> under

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
actually going to get that set up under

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:30.659 
actually going to get that set up under
the<00:03:24.700> stove<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:27.480> that's<00:03:28.480> about<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:29.340> next<00:03:30.340> is

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
the stove and that's about that next is

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.740 
the stove and that's about that next is
we<00:03:31.180> will<00:03:31.209> go<00:03:31.450> ahead<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:32.019> add<00:03:32.200> about<00:03:32.470> Oh<00:03:33.599> 3/4<00:03:34.599> of

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
we will go ahead and add about Oh 3/4 of

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.159 
we will go ahead and add about Oh 3/4 of
an<00:03:34.870> ounce<00:03:34.989> alcohol<00:03:35.620> or<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:37.090> that's<00:03:37.989> what<00:03:38.139> I

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
an ounce alcohol or so and that's what I

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.520 
an ounce alcohol or so and that's what I
found<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.590> be<00:03:38.940> fairly<00:03:39.940> efficient<00:03:40.450> in<00:03:40.810> getting

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
found to be fairly efficient in getting

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.250 
found to be fairly efficient in getting
about<00:03:42.340> 16<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:42.940> 20<00:03:43.209> ounces<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.599> water<00:03:43.750> boiling

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
about 16 to 20 ounces of water boiling

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.470 
about 16 to 20 ounces of water boiling
on<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.709> Stanley<00:03:44.980> mug<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.940> we'll<00:03:46.060> go<00:03:46.150> ahead<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
on the Stanley mug so we'll go ahead and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.819 
on the Stanley mug so we'll go ahead and
light<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:49.049> priming<00:03:50.049> pan<00:03:50.260> if<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:50.650> get<00:03:50.739> my

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
light that priming pan if I can get my

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.089 
light that priming pan if I can get my
lighter<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.250> work<00:03:51.400> here<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.500> go<00:03:53.709> ahead<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:53.980> get

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
lighter to work here so go ahead and get

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.629 
lighter to work here so go ahead and get
that<00:03:54.250> priming<00:03:54.730> pan<00:03:54.910> lit<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:56.459> with<00:03:57.459> the

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
that priming pan lit and with the

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.119 
that priming pan lit and with the
smaller<00:03:57.940> jets<00:03:58.359> on<00:03:58.599> this<00:03:58.810> actually<00:03:59.410> takes<00:04:00.010> them

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
smaller jets on this actually takes them

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.550 
smaller jets on this actually takes them
a<00:04:00.220> little<00:04:00.400> bit<00:04:00.940> longer<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.599> prime<00:04:01.959> if<00:04:02.379> you're

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
a little bit longer to prime if you're

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.710 
a little bit longer to prime if you're
just<00:04:02.829> using<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.700> stove<00:04:04.000> but<00:04:04.239> I've<00:04:04.359> noticed

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
just using the stove but I've noticed

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.750 
just using the stove but I've noticed
with<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.989> priming<00:04:05.379> pan<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:06.370> really<00:04:06.609> get<00:04:06.730> a

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
with the priming pan you really get a

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.020 
with the priming pan you really get a
bloom<00:04:07.120> really<00:04:07.690> quickly<00:04:08.280> this<00:04:09.280> way<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:09.519> that's

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
bloom really quickly this way so that's

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.909 
bloom really quickly this way so that's
what<00:04:10.239> we're<00:04:10.329> gonna<00:04:10.449> be<00:04:10.600> doing<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:11.049> now

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
what we're gonna be doing that now

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.830 
what we're gonna be doing that now
next<00:04:12.430> we'll<00:04:12.609> just<00:04:12.789> go<00:04:12.910> ahead<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.359> take<00:04:13.570> off

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840

our
top<00:04:16.390> portion<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.880> I've<00:04:18.880> got<00:04:19.000> about<00:04:19.180> 20<00:04:19.510> ounces

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
top portion and I've got about 20 ounces

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.150 
top portion and I've got about 20 ounces
of<00:04:19.870> water<00:04:20.019> in<00:04:20.230> here<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:20.620> I'm<00:04:20.709> actually<00:04:20.890> going

increase efficiency a little bit and see

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.700 
increase efficiency a little bit and see
how<00:04:43.540> fast<00:04:43.720> we<00:04:43.870> can<00:04:44.020> get<00:04:44.080> some<00:04:44.230> water<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.530> boil

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
see we've got some boiling water so that

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.750 
see we've got some boiling water so that
ain't<00:04:56.980> too<00:04:57.130> shabby<00:04:59.070> well<00:05:00.070> there<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.580> go
