00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to all so today I 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.980
 come back with a sam outfit of the day was 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.080
 enormously asked since my last 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.069
 video hall 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.420
 that's where I'll show a little bit 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.160
 that I had what I had to find 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.170
 during the sales so there today 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.849
 I wanted to show you how I 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.400
 wearing my hide-and-seek pants on 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.170
 high waist pants a game like it 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.340
 a lot I will try to see if he 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.900
 is always available in burgundy and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 I pass me a banner for 15 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.449
 euros frankly me why deprive myself 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.010
 so here I'll start from the top 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.720
 it's going to be easier because it's 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 a galley not possible for me 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 movies and outfits of the day 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.489
 I have too small tripod that is what is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
 quite complicated so I stay by the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.460
 hairstyle then at the level of the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.350
 hair to be honest I went 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.300
 at the hairdresser there just now a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.250
 early afternoon 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.930
 so here I just do not have too much 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 touching the length I just cut 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.489
 the pointers and I remake a little the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.539
 Sail degrading to restructure a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.129
 little bit of all because that 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.910
 was starting to look more like ariel 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.530
 about the color because they tell me 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.719
 often ask before me the color I 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.960
 always do it at my hairdresser's 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.700
 am never risky to make a color 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.049
 cross supermarkets I 'm too 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.040
 philippe is simply 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.630
 I would be afraid to do anything 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.130
 passes before doing it but the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.330
 last hand the very last color 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.360
 that I did so last month 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.000
 it was an icy chestnut but then he 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.740
 started a little bit to disgorge the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.270
 color that I had before starts to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.159
 learn a little bit about it 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.890
 so I'm going back there by fifteen 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.590
 days to redo the color the color 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.070
 glossy brown which is the color more 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.439
 darker than what you can see the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.270
 that's it for the color then regarding 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.369
 accessories and everything so loops 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.189
 from the hall to the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.810
 shoes or clothes that I have them 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.040
 purchased during sales for 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.500
 2 euros 2 euros 50 years I get closer 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.939
 the eye makeup is a 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 makeup that I realized with the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.469
 nude palette of clinical at the very 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.930
 last collection there they took out 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.790
 the palette is just gorgeous 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.350
 so if I put you a little bit on 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.170
 the eyes here and about the red to 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.540
 lips so I wear the lipstick 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.980
 mayor of mac that's so it was a red 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.650
 lipstick that java added there may be 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.630
 a man in a half and a half there was 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.550
 a collection that came out I had it 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.020
 bought but the good news is a 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.489
 lipstick that is finally available 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.660
 in the permanent collection so 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.730
 how there is a color that you 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.200
 please do not hesitate, you can 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.370
 find it easily now 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.050
 it was in pink a matt rosewood 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.700
 here and I really like this 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.200
 color so now we'll go to 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.830
 the outfit if I can fit 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.319
 correctly then at the pub level so 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.610
 it is a sweater of the Sahara brand that 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.280
 I bought it I think it was 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.769
 last fall so you can 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.030
 maybe there to meet you so it's a 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.709
 little that I like very much because it is 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.840
 it is shorter to sell an aria 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.200
 as can be seen at the level of 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.500
 cows these are lancome matches is 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.040
 wide enough 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.900
 here and then the colors go on 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.030
 this page and my faith is quite short 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.459
 a talent I find to see so here is 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.280
 the pants the hide-and-seek pants 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.489
 tall steles of embarrassment enormously I 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.760
 find that who is doing well that sees there 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.010
 the pretty he falls well then nancy 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.459
 that's how they and how he 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.470
 is doing so he is very very good 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.030
 cut his paws before it's a sim 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.160
 embodied shoes so the same I 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.530
 showed them in my role on 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.700
 shoes at home gemo I think you 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.489
 can still find them for a 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.720
 fifteen euros which we see in which 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.670
 really very healthy sense the same I 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.420
 finds that it fits pretty well 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.519
 with this outfit 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.530
 though sanaa the bag honestly nothing 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.430

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.829

 I was looking for the mark and that's nothing 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.400
