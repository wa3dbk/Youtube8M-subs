where<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.049> click<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> play<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
bongos like at the right time and so you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
bongos like at the right time and so you
can<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.759> hardly<00:01:39.000> ever<00:01:39.150> hitting

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
can you can see it's hardly ever hitting

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.730

him<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.659> hit<00:01:39.960> him<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.170> pretty<00:01:40.350> sure<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> got<00:01:40.560> like

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
him I hit him I'm pretty sure I got like

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350

one<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.790> hit<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> him

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
one good hit on him

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
hopefully burn know that missed go Diddy

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
hopefully burn know that missed go Diddy
Kong<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.320> probably<00:01:49.530> gonna<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.740> like

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
Kong so this is probably gonna be like

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.359 
Kong so this is probably gonna be like
one<00:01:50.340> side<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.820> as<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:52.470> considering

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
one side as as as all considering

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.560 
one side as as as all considering
it's<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.810> 2<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.409> friggin<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.579> even

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it's like 2 on to friggin one even

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.209 
it's like 2 on to friggin one even
though<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.750> thought<00:01:58.229> you'd<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
though you thought you'd think that

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.850 
though you thought you'd think that
Bowser<00:01:59.640> could<00:02:00.000> hold<00:02:00.180> his<00:02:00.299> own<00:02:00.420> against<00:02:00.899> two

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
Bowser could hold his own against two

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.070 
Bowser could hold his own against two
chimpanzees<00:02:02.820> or

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
chimpanzees or

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.250 
chimpanzees or
chimpanzee<00:02:05.010> knee<00:02:05.160> and<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.550> gorilla<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> slip

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.830 
have to go into sudden death or some
other<00:03:19.489> shenanigan<00:03:20.489> note<00:03:21.270> but<00:03:21.480> without<00:03:21.630> going

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
other shenanigan note but without going

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.110

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
that's like negative negative 3 2 + 3 or

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.380 
that's like negative negative 3 2 + 3 or
4<00:03:34.140> kills<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.560> us<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.310> I'm<00:03:35.400> pretty<00:03:35.489> sure<00:03:35.730> that
