00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.939 
better this time we'll see same kappas
last<00:00:27.390> time<00:00:27.630> same<00:00:27.960> kind<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> cap<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.680> actually

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
last time same kind of cap it's actually

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.099 
last time same kind of cap it's actually
a<00:00:29.010> pretty<00:00:29.160> cool<00:00:29.250> cap<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.000> don't<00:00:30.750> want<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> tilt

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
a pretty cool cap I don't want to tilt

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.380 
a pretty cool cap I don't want to tilt
this<00:00:31.289> quite<00:00:31.619> yet<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.880> know<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
this quite yet because you know this is

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.060 
this quite yet because you know this is
bottle<00:00:33.780> conditioned<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.590> add<00:00:34.800> some

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
bottle conditioned and they add some

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.740 
bottle conditioned and they add some
yeast<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> therefore<00:00:35.880> bottle<00:00:36.210> conditioning

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
yeast and therefore bottle conditioning

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.500 
yeast and therefore bottle conditioning
so<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.500> tilt<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:39.390> know

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
actually see some of that yeast floating

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.280 
actually see some of that yeast floating
around<00:01:55.440> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> beer<00:01:56.210> color<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.540> typical

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.600 
around in the beer color is typical
wheat<00:01:58.440> beer<00:01:58.650> color<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.950> probably<00:01:59.220> went<00:01:59.550> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
wheat beer color I probably went a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.070 
wheat beer color I probably went a
little<00:01:59.729> more<00:01:59.910> aggressive<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.390> porch<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.810 
little more aggressive on the porch of a
bigger<00:02:01.260> head<00:02:01.470> than<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.770> when<00:02:02.370> I<00:02:02.400> can<00:02:02.610> smell

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
bigger head than that when I can smell

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.570 
bigger head than that when I can smell
from<00:02:02.970> here<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:04.830> smells<00:02:05.070> good<00:02:06.350> like<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.470> said

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
from here it smells good like I said

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.120 
from here it smells good like I said

but it looks good it smells I really get

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.000 
but it looks good it smells I really get
the<00:02:20.820> hops<00:02:21.030> which<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.780> know<00:02:21.900> from<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.709> lot<00:02:22.890> of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the hops which you know from a lot of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.830 
the hops which you know from a lot of
wheat<00:02:23.160> beers<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.550> had<00:02:23.580> there's<00:02:24.000> not<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.510> whole

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
wheat beers I had there's not a whole

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.350 
wheat beers I had there's not a whole
lot<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.260> hops<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.740> wheat<00:02:25.920> beer<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.030> half<00:02:27.209> of

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
lot of hops in a wheat beer the half of

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.080 
lot of hops in a wheat beer the half of
ice<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.780> things<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.320> just<00:02:29.060> not<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
ice and things like that just not a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.150 
ice and things like that just not a
whole<00:02:30.209> lot<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.450> hops<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> nose<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.980> this

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
whole lot of hops to the nose but this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.670 
whole lot of hops to the nose but this
is<00:02:32.280> very<00:02:32.340> hoppy<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> nose<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.690> little<00:02:34.470> bit

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
is very hoppy to the nose a little bit

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960 
is very hoppy to the nose a little bit
of<00:02:34.800> sweetness<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.400> there<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> little<00:02:35.700> bit<00:02:35.850> of

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
of sweetness in there a little bit of

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.300 
of sweetness in there a little bit of
Tang<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:37.260> think<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.650> tang<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.040> probably

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
Tang and I think that tang is probably

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.479 
Tang and I think that tang is probably
coming<00:02:38.520> from<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.700> lemon<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.890> did<00:02:40.890> say<00:02:41.070> lemon

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
coming from that lemon I did say lemon

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.930 
coming from that lemon I did say lemon
right<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:43.140> lemony<00:02:43.500> finish<00:02:43.860> on<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.730> has<00:02:44.910> a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
right the lemony finish on it has a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.300 
right the lemony finish on it has a
little<00:02:45.120> bit<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.390> tame<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.840> smell<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:50.100> smells

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
little bit of a tame the smell it smells

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.539 
little bit of a tame the smell it smells
very<00:02:50.489> good<00:02:50.610> good<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.330> little<00:02:52.110> swirl<00:02:52.380> here<00:02:52.769> I'm
