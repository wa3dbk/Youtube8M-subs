don't<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.540> many<00:01:27.689> people<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.170> that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
one so all this basically does is it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.910 
one so all this basically does is it
bypasses<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.960> 3.5<00:01:33.960> millimeter<00:01:34.170> jack<00:01:34.409> by

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
bypasses the 3.5 millimeter jack by

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.350 
bypasses the 3.5 millimeter jack by
plugging<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.549> straight<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> bottom

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
plugging it in straight to the bottom

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.280 
plugging it in straight to the bottom
the<00:01:36.840> 30-pin<00:01:37.170> adapter<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:39.240> sends<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> music

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the 30-pin adapter and it sends a music

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.630 
the 30-pin adapter and it sends a music
straight<00:01:40.470> through<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> cable

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
straight through here and do the cable

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.539 
straight through here and do the cable
into<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.770> portable<00:01:43.770> amp<00:01:44.009> whatever<00:01:44.369> you're

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
into your portable amp whatever you're

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.700 
into your portable amp whatever you're
going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> use<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.299> better<00:01:45.509> sound<00:01:45.750> quality

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.749 

there's<00:01:49.710> no<00:01:49.890> clips<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> side<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> press

there's no clips on the side to press
you<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.030> pull<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.320> fits<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.159> my

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you just pull it out it fits with my

you just pull it out it fits with my
case<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.759> don't<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.030> it'll<00:01:54.149> fit<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.390> no

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
case I don't know if it'll fit with no

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.200 
case I don't know if it'll fit with no
cases<00:01:54.990> most<00:01:55.409> cases<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.159> thin<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
cases most cases is pretty thin it's

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990 
cases most cases is pretty thin it's
about<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.659> size<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.049> regular<00:01:58.820> I'm<00:01:59.820> gonna

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
about the size of a regular I'm gonna

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.280 
about the size of a regular I'm gonna
show<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.600> about<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> size<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
show you it's about the size of a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
see but not much I haven't tested it out

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.410 
see but not much I haven't tested it out
yet<00:02:13.190> but<00:02:13.370> i'll<00:02:13.550> be<00:02:13.670> doing<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> little<00:02:14.209> bit

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420

a lot of people say if you have an ipod
to<00:02:16.730> use<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.060> instead<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:18.410> know<00:02:18.440> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
to use this instead of you know the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.720 
to use this instead of you know the
standard<00:02:19.130> auxiliary<00:02:19.970> 2.5<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> 3.5<00:02:20.630> cord<00:02:21.730> it'll

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
standard auxiliary 2.5 to 3.5 cord it'll

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.830 
standard auxiliary 2.5 to 3.5 cord it'll
you<00:02:23.569> know<00:02:23.599> work<00:02:24.170> better<00:02:25.180> sturdier<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.660> you

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
you know work better sturdier and it you

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.259 
you know work better sturdier and it you
know<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.870> might<00:02:30.019> even<00:02:31.000> fold<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.120> together

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
know you might even fold up together

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.720 
know you might even fold up together
better<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:33.170> just<00:02:33.380> fold<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.310> backwards

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
better you can just fold this backwards

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.330 
better you can just fold this backwards
like<00:02:34.819> this<00:02:35.440> plug<00:02:36.440> into<00:02:36.560> music<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.160> can

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
like this plug into music and you can

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.949 
like this plug into music and you can

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
you know rubber band it together or

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.170 
you know rubber band it together or
whatever<00:02:39.530> gonna<00:02:39.709> do<00:02:39.860> that's<00:02:40.489> nice<00:02:40.850> little

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
touch that's about it the cable feels
