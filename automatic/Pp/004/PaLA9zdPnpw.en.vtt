shop<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.880> come<00:00:12.000> with<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> nice<00:00:12.450> platform<00:00:12.840> to

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
shop to come with a nice platform to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.950 
shop to come with a nice platform to
track<00:00:13.889> base<00:00:14.190> kit<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.389> received<00:00:15.509> it

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
track base kit and we just received it

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.200 
track base kit and we just received it
came<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.650> box<00:00:16.920> they<00:00:17.670> sent<00:00:17.850> us<00:00:17.940> additional

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
came in this box they sent us additional

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.929 
came in this box they sent us additional
things<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.900> believe<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.260> an<00:00:19.410> IR<00:00:19.650> sensor<00:00:20.100> cable

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
things I believe this an IR sensor cable

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.380 
things I believe this an IR sensor cable
and<00:00:21.810> ir<00:00:21.930> sensor<00:00:22.380> mounted<00:00:22.529> some<00:00:22.920> shorts<00:00:23.390> let's

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and ir sensor mounted some shorts let's

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.370 
and ir sensor mounted some shorts let's
see<00:00:24.539> sure<00:00:24.810> enough<00:00:25.019> yeah<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
see sure enough yeah it's a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.009 
see sure enough yeah it's a
multi-purpose<00:00:25.650> sensor<00:00:26.189> housing<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> one's

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
multi-purpose sensor housing this one's

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.259 
multi-purpose sensor housing this one's
actually<00:00:28.199> from<00:00:28.500> lynxmotion<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
actually from lynxmotion and this is the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.959 
actually from lynxmotion and this is the
packing<00:00:30.660> slip<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.340> just<00:00:32.340> put<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.669> off<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
packing slip so just put that off to the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.900 
packing slip so just put that off to the
side<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.270> now<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.920> let's<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.460> started<00:00:35.790> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
side for now and let's get started and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.940 
side for now and let's get started and
see<00:00:36.000> what's<00:00:36.149> inside<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.020> again<00:00:37.770> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
see what's inside of it so again this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.110 
see what's inside of it so again this
going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.430> our<00:00:38.579> other<00:00:38.610> reviews

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
going to be just like our other reviews

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
going to be just like our other reviews
we<00:00:39.660> start<00:00:39.840> off<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> simple<00:00:40.469> what's<00:00:41.040> inside

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
we start off with a simple what's inside

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.130 
we start off with a simple what's inside
the<00:00:41.460> box<00:00:41.489> type<00:00:41.940> thing<00:00:42.239> kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.750> through<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the box type thing kind of go through it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.110 
the box type thing kind of go through it
and<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.129> go<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.670> our<00:00:44.789> follow-up

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and then we actually go in our follow-up

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.510 
and then we actually go in our follow-up
reviews<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.750> videos<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.920> actually<00:00:47.100> start

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
reviews or videos and we actually start

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.630 
reviews or videos and we actually start
building<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> unit<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> we've<00:00:50.489> already

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
building the unit out so we've already

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.270 
building the unit out so we've already
talked<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.510> IR<00:00:52.079> sensor<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.770> basic

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
talked about the IR sensor this is basic

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.319 
talked about the IR sensor this is basic
sharp<00:00:54.030> ir<00:00:54.360> sensor<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:55.379> its<00:00:55.559> cabling<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
sharp ir sensor with its cabling and

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.540 
sharp ir sensor with its cabling and
this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> lynxmotion<00:00:57.899> general-purpose

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
this is a lynxmotion general-purpose

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.830 
this is a lynxmotion general-purpose
mount<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.300> big<00:01:00.449> plastic<00:01:02.210> bag<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.719> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
mount the big plastic bag just for this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.230 
mount the big plastic bag just for this
little<00:01:03.989> thing<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.260> that's<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.240> put

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
little thing but that's what it is put

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
little thing but that's what it is put
that<00:01:06.330> off<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:07.110> let's<00:01:07.920> start<00:01:08.159> off<00:01:08.310> by

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that off the side now let's start off by

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.330 
that off the side now let's start off by
saying<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.060> first<00:01:09.299> part<00:01:09.799> now<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.010> looks

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
saying the first part now this looks

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
saying the first part now this looks
like<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.420> dip<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.439> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
like it's going to be the dip this is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.800 
like it's going to be the dip this is
the<00:01:13.680> robot<00:01:14.040> controller<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> DF

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the robot controller this is the DF

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.490 
the robot controller this is the DF

robot shop Rover robot controller now I

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
robot shop Rover robot controller now I
haven't<00:01:19.740> actually<00:01:19.950> looked<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> check

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
haven't actually looked up on the check

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.810 
haven't actually looked up on the check
this<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.840> online<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.310> but

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this out online or see what it is but

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
this out online or see what it is but
from<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> picture<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.200> makes<00:01:25.409> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
from the picture I know this makes it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.230 
from the picture I know this makes it
the<00:01:25.619> top<00:01:25.799> base<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.460> bet<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> anything<00:01:26.909> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the top base and I bet you anything it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
the top base and I bet you anything it's
Arduino<00:01:27.869> based<00:01:28.460> platform<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.640> find<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
Arduino based platform will find that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.359 
Arduino based platform will find that
out<00:01:30.060> soon<00:01:30.210> enough<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> battery

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
out soon enough and with a battery

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
out soon enough and with a battery
housing<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.939> some<00:01:36.540> screws<00:01:36.890> okay<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> let's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
switch additional power and a USB cable

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.510 
switch additional power and a USB cable
connector<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:57.960> alright<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.280> i'm<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
connector there alright so i'm going to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.330 
connector there alright so i'm going to
put<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.820> back<00:02:00.090> inside<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> cape

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.290 

while<00:02:04.340> we<00:02:04.490> go<00:02:04.640> through<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.940> rest<00:02:05.120> of<00:02:05.210> the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
while we go through the rest of the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.410 
while we go through the rest of the
components<00:02:05.620> come<00:02:06.620> in<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.830> hit<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:10.420> things

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
components come in the hit have things

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.220 
components come in the hit have things
here<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.650> they<00:02:12.770> actually<00:02:13.220> included<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.230> lipo

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
here so they actually included a lipo

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.730 
here so they actually included a lipo
battery<00:02:15.590> cell<00:02:15.890> from<00:02:16.160> seed<00:02:16.400> studio<00:02:16.790> right<00:02:17.480> here

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
battery cell from seed studio right here

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.980 
battery cell from seed studio right here
and<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:19.460> believe<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:19.850> will<00:02:19.910> make<00:02:20.150> up<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.420> base

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
and I believe this will make up the base

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.200 
and I believe this will make up the base
of<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.560> unit<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:22.490> is<00:02:22.610> called<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> rover

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
of the unit this is called the rover

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.140 
of the unit this is called the rover
frame<00:02:23.510> hardware<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.160> see<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.900> cable<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.170> two

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
frame hardware so I see a cable and two

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.520 
frame hardware so I see a cable and two
aluminum<00:02:29.150> pieces<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> bunch<00:02:29.960> of<00:02:30.020> screws

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.770 

else<00:02:33.530> do<00:02:33.710> we<00:02:33.770> have<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:35.270> looks<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
else do we have here this looks like a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.040 
else do we have here this looks like a
seed<00:02:36.380> studio<00:02:36.800> solar<00:02:37.130> charger<00:02:37.640> shield<00:02:38.050> so

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
seed studio solar charger shield so

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.950 
seed studio solar charger shield so
let's<00:02:39.230> check<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.560> out<00:02:40.360> we've<00:02:41.360> worked<00:02:41.630> in<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
let's check that out we've worked in the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.290 
let's check that out we've worked in the
past<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.650> see<00:02:43.130> studios<00:02:43.640> products<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.210> we're

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
past to see studios products and we're

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.930 
past to see studios products and we're
really<00:02:44.360> good<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:45.890> fact<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.340> are<00:02:46.550> working

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
really good and in fact you are working

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.690 
really good and in fact you are working
on<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.290> review<00:02:48.290> for<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.100> seats<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.640> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
on a review for the seats to the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.430 
on a review for the seats to the
electronic<00:02:50.120> brick<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:53.380> boxing<00:02:54.380> a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
electronic brick so this is a boxing a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.740 
electronic brick so this is a boxing a
solar<00:02:54.680> panel<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.640> solar<00:02:55.940> charger<00:02:56.480> shield

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
solar panel is the solar charger shield

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.880 
solar panel is the solar charger shield
for<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.020> Arduino<00:02:57.790> let's<00:02:58.790> see<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.500> guess<00:03:00.500> this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
for the Arduino let's see I guess this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.290 
for the Arduino let's see I guess this
is<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> shield<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.790> guess<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:02.030> might<00:03:02.150> have

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
is a shield and I guess we might have

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.420 
is a shield and I guess we might have
another<00:03:02.390> piece<00:03:02.810> for<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.550> solar<00:03:04.550> part<00:03:06.430> not

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
another piece for the solar part not

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.430 
another piece for the solar part not
sure<00:03:07.670> how<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.910> work<00:03:08.360> but<00:03:08.570> let's<00:03:08.690> see<00:03:08.900> there's

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
sure how to work but let's see there's

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.180 
sure how to work but let's see there's
more<00:03:09.500> components<00:03:10.100> inside<00:03:10.570> now<00:03:11.570> we<00:03:11.630> have<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
more components inside now we have the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.420 
more components inside now we have the
Tamiya<00:03:13.190> twin<00:03:13.670> motor<00:03:13.880> gearbox<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.830> just<00:03:16.220> looks

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
Tamiya twin motor gearbox it just looks

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.970 
Tamiya twin motor gearbox it just looks
like<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.820> as<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:16.970> some<00:03:17.750> motors<00:03:18.110> in<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.440> actual

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
like it as a some motors in the actual

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.190 
like it as a some motors in the actual
gearbox<00:03:19.370> for<00:03:19.550> all<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.840> axles<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:20.930> whatnot

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
gearbox for all the axles and whatnot

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.460 
gearbox for all the axles and whatnot
where<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.530> tracks<00:03:22.400> will<00:03:22.519> be<00:03:22.580> connected<00:03:22.970> to

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
where the tracks will be connected to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.750 
where the tracks will be connected to
and<00:03:24.470> here<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:24.650> have<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.130> track<00:03:25.519> wheelset

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
and here we have the track wheelset

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.530 
and here we have the track wheelset
leave<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.630> also<00:03:26.959> tamiya<00:03:27.670> I'm<00:03:28.670> okay<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.330> we've

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
leave is also tamiya I'm okay so we've

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.000 
leave is also tamiya I'm okay so we've
got<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.750> build<00:03:29.840> some<00:03:30.050> tracks<00:03:30.380> hope<00:03:30.650> this<00:03:30.830> is<00:03:30.980> a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
got to build some tracks hope this is a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.270 
got to build some tracks hope this is a
lot<00:03:31.220> easier<00:03:31.250> than<00:03:31.940> we've<00:03:32.600> had<00:03:32.720> our<00:03:33.100> hands<00:03:34.100> on

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
lot easier than we've had our hands on

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.590 
lot easier than we've had our hands on
four<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:35.060> robot<00:03:35.420> shot<00:03:35.690> pen<00:03:36.040> very<00:03:37.040> cool<00:03:37.600> ok

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
four and a robot shot pen very cool ok

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.050 
four and a robot shot pen very cool ok
so<00:03:39.170> that's<00:03:39.320> pretty<00:03:39.620> much<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.830> look<00:03:40.700> waiting<00:03:41.000> to

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
so that's pretty much it look waiting to

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.340 
so that's pretty much it look waiting to
take<00:03:41.239> very<00:03:41.420> long<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.660> actually<00:03:41.840> put<00:03:42.230> this

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
take very long to actually put this

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.930 
take very long to actually put this
together<00:03:42.560> i<00:03:42.830> would<00:03:43.160> imagine<00:03:43.250> it's<00:03:43.730> probably

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
together i would imagine it's probably

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.970 
together i would imagine it's probably
gonna<00:03:44.180> take<00:03:44.239> me<00:03:44.450> about<00:03:44.600> an<00:03:44.750> hour<00:03:44.810> show<00:03:45.260> at<00:03:45.709> most

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
gonna take me about an hour show at most

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.890 
gonna take me about an hour show at most
but<00:03:46.790> we'll<00:03:46.970> find<00:03:47.239> out<00:03:47.450> when<00:03:47.570> we<00:03:47.630> start

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
but we'll find out when we start

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.489 
but we'll find out when we start
building<00:03:48.200> check<00:03:48.830> out<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.040> next<00:03:49.160> videos
