00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 I'll show you that not always 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.090
 an electronic injection indicating a 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.429
 defect in lambda probes the problem is the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.290
 lambda probe I will simulate that one 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.460
 defect in the car I go with a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 centralizer 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 I'm going to eliminate a candle. 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.109
 this car this engine will stay 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.340
 working with three cylinders or 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.760
 therefore a cylinder will not be 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.939
 automatically burning fuel I 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.790
 I will enrich the mixture the probe will 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.940
 accusing the rich mix and not 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.610
 will correct this defect and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.739
 to help I'll turn off the sensor 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.620
 water temperature 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.590
 automatically it will accuse less 40 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.950
 degrees in the injection system and the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.289
 will enrich the blend as well. 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.890
 adding the two I'm going to make the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.289
 probe work always accusing mixing 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.770
 rich as the injection will not 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.830
 correct this to this mixture it goes 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.770
 end up causing a lambda probe to defect 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.439
 we always panel luis and go 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.630
 accusing the lambda probe is the case that 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.509
 many workshops take place there 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.830
 person will exchange lambda probe and not 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.720
 Solve the problem 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.100
 the problem will be in a favela and a 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.500
 temperature sensor 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.110
 Let's follow, so here we go. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.229
 now the two car probes 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.650
 working perfectly working 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.759
 between rich and poor mix , right? 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.090
 right now and we're going to simulate a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.939
 the engine of the car to make the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.369
 mix gets rich and the waves always 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.320
 indicate a rich mix of the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.380
 injection 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.140
 now the two waves always close to one 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.689
 rich volts they can not 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 work the injection more perfectly 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.210
 can not fix the problem in the light 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.750
 the injection has already lit up and we will 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.729
 the device in the accusation of the UN in this case 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.000
 we simulate a sensor defect 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.130
 water temperature and a candle a 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.390
 problem 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.610
 and the device has lambda probe if you 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.030
 had to change the lambda probe to the defect 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.150
 is to persist and accuse it again then the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.650
 right is a diagnosis a reading of the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.340
 equipment 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.440
 the defect may be before sony or 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.560
 It's always there, I hope they have 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.640
 liked to join our channel 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.500
 watch our videos 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.500
 until the next shaw
