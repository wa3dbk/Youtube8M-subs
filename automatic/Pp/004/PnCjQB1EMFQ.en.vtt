we're<00:01:07.659> using<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.990> byproduct<00:01:08.500> in<00:01:08.920> place<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.340> a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
we're using a byproduct in place of a

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.640 
we're using a byproduct in place of a
other<00:01:09.700> standard<00:01:10.150> material<00:01:10.689> we<00:01:11.200> also<00:01:11.229> do

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
other standard material we also do

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.950 
other standard material we also do
things<00:01:11.829> such<00:01:12.040> as<00:01:12.070> use<00:01:12.280> natural<00:01:12.850> sunlight<00:01:13.090> we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
things such as use natural sunlight we

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.600 
things such as use natural sunlight we
use<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.140> shade<00:01:14.500> system<00:01:15.009> in<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.189> house<00:01:15.400> that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
use a shade system in the house that

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.120 
use a shade system in the house that
helps<00:01:15.880> capture<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.420> heat<00:01:16.680> inside<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.920> house

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
helps capture the heat inside the house

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.730 
helps capture the heat inside the house
and<00:01:18.460> also<00:01:19.060> block<00:01:19.600> sunlight<00:01:19.960> when<00:01:20.290> we<00:01:20.380> have<00:01:20.530> too

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
and also block sunlight when we have too

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.830 
and also block sunlight when we have too
much<00:01:20.920> we<00:01:21.369> have<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.520> trolley<00:01:21.820> system<00:01:22.210> that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
much we have a trolley system that

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.960 
much we have a trolley system that
sweeps<00:01:23.320> back<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.920> forth<00:01:24.159> over<00:01:24.369> our<00:01:24.579> plants

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
sweeps back and forth over our plants

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.149 
sweeps back and forth over our plants
during<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.329> day<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.750> there's<00:01:26.590> rubber<00:01:26.799> flaps

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
during the day and there's rubber flaps

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.100 
during the day and there's rubber flaps
that<00:01:27.430> hang<00:01:27.640> off<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.850> that<00:01:28.119> system<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.990> what

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
that hang off of that system and what

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.690 
that hang off of that system and what
that<00:01:29.290> does<00:01:29.469> is<00:01:29.649> it<00:01:29.770> lightly<00:01:30.070> brushes<00:01:30.579> the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
that does is it lightly brushes the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.240 
that does is it lightly brushes the
plants<00:01:31.090> all<00:01:31.270> day<00:01:31.479> long<00:01:31.689> and<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.860> helps<00:01:33.219> keep

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
plants all day long and that helps keep

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.880 
plants all day long and that helps keep
the<00:01:33.549> plants<00:01:33.880> strong<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:35.170> strengthens<00:01:35.740> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
the plants strong it strengthens the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.580 
the plants strong it strengthens the
stem<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.430> ultimately<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.329> simulates<00:01:37.869> wind<00:01:38.170> at

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
stem and ultimately it simulates wind at

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.010 
stem and ultimately it simulates wind at
the<00:01:38.799> same<00:01:39.009> time<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.579> disturbs<00:01:39.969> any<00:01:40.240> harmful

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
the same time it disturbs any harmful

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.600 
the same time it disturbs any harmful
