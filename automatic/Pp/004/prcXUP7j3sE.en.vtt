00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.619 

and<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:07.680> would<00:02:07.830> be<00:02:08.010> it<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.370> in<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.820> name

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.670 

yeah<00:02:21.810> it'd<00:02:21.959> be<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.110> four<00:02:22.319> five<00:02:22.440> hundred

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
yeah it'd be like four five hundred

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.070 
yeah it'd be like four five hundred
dollars

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
dollars

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.170 
dollars
what<00:02:24.530> we<00:02:24.650> did

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.280 

put<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.900> my<00:02:27.989> dad's<00:02:28.260> name

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.960 

I<00:02:34.319> think<00:02:34.830> we're

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.210 

I'm<00:02:38.450> only<00:02:38.630> paying<00:02:38.960> I<00:02:39.350> give<00:02:39.560> him<00:02:39.740> at<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.010> end<00:02:40.100> of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
I'm only paying I give him at the end of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.660 
I'm only paying I give him at the end of
like<00:02:40.370> each<00:02:40.820> one

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.770 

a<00:02:43.760> hundred<00:02:44.390> and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
a hundred and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.190 
a hundred and
50<00:02:46.290> i<00:02:46.320> want<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> say<00:02:46.740> i<00:02:47.270> wanna<00:02:48.270> say<00:02:48.420> i<00:02:48.480> give<00:02:48.630> 150

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
50 i want to say i wanna say i give 150

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.350 
50 i want to say i wanna say i give 150
for

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.620 

I<00:02:51.390> know<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.170> either<00:02:52.320> 150<00:02:52.980> or<00:02:53.100> less<00:02:53.630> it's

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
I know it's either 150 or less it's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.720 
I know it's either 150 or less it's
actually<00:02:54.930> very<00:02:55.140> cheap

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.110 

and<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.300> it's<00:02:58.510> like<00:02:58.690> if<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.110> can<00:03:00.120> convince

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
and so it's like if you can convince

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.280 
and so it's like if you can convince
your<00:03:01.300> parents<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.750> let<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.080> do<00:03:02.230> that

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
your parents to let you do that

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.899 
your parents to let you do that
that<00:03:03.469> is<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.739> way<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.890> go<00:03:04.129> especially<00:03:04.489> if

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
that is the way to go especially if

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:15.660 
that is the way to go especially if
you're<00:03:04.939> under<00:03:05.599> 25

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.000 

so<00:03:15.970> much<00:03:16.300> cheaper<00:03:16.770> especially<00:03:17.770> if<00:03:17.860> you're<00:03:17.950> on

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
so much cheaper especially if you're on

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.750 
so much cheaper especially if you're on
a<00:03:18.069> Super<00:03:18.400> Sport

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
a Super Sport

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.890 
a Super Sport
the<00:03:18.910> Super<00:03:19.150> Sport<00:03:19.240> they<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.599> want<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.780> rape

the Super Sport they just want to rape

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.120 
the Super Sport they just want to rape
you<00:03:20.050> with<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> insurance

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130
