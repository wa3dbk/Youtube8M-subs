this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.410> proton<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.970> board

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
this is the proton this is the board

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.450 
this is the proton this is the board
that<00:00:06.420> I've<00:00:07.020> worked<00:00:07.200> with<00:00:07.350> Dane<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.859> when<00:00:08.340> he

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
that I've worked with Dane on when he

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.870 
that I've worked with Dane on when he
qualified<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> CT<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> Q<00:00:11.730> s

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
qualified for the for the CT in the Q s

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.140 
qualified for the for the CT in the Q s
series<00:00:12.620> the<00:00:13.620> board<00:00:13.860> he<00:00:14.040> he<00:00:14.429> rode<00:00:14.639> most<00:00:14.910> that

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
series the board he he rode most that

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.970 
series the board he he rode most that
year<00:00:15.480> he<00:00:15.990> likes<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.379> ride<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.800> most

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
year he likes to ride it in most

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.160 
year he likes to ride it in most
conditions<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> board<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.050> think

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
conditions it's really a board I think

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.019 
conditions it's really a board I think
for<00:00:19.590> advanced<00:00:19.920> surfers<00:00:25.519> probably<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.699> would

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
for advanced surfers probably I would

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.929 
for advanced surfers probably I would
say<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.720> most<00:00:28.439> unique<00:00:28.800> designs<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
say one of the most unique designs that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.250 
say one of the most unique designs that
I've<00:00:30.060> been<00:00:30.210> involved<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.660> my<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.230> my

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I've been involved with my with my

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860 
I've been involved with my with my
surfers<00:00:31.890> most<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> bend<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.329> board<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
surfers most of the bend in this board a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.840 
surfers most of the bend in this board a
rocker<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.530> bottom<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> board<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
rocker in the bottom of the board is is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.360 
rocker in the bottom of the board is is
based<00:00:36.239> more<00:00:36.960> towards<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.620> center<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
based more towards the center and it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450 
based more towards the center and it
bends<00:00:38.640> both<00:00:39.329> ways<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:41.219> real

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
bends both ways from there and it's real

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450 
bends both ways from there and it's real

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
evident when you look at it and it's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.490

lot of my designs that's it's wider than

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
in the center of the board so it's able

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
in the center of the board so it's able
to<00:01:11.310> carry<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.479> more<00:01:12.689> volume<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.229> little

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to carry a little more volume a little

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.380 
to carry a little more volume a little
more<00:01:13.560> front<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> type<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.670> surfer<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
more front for the type of the surfer I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.230 
more front for the type of the surfer I
consider<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> board<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.650> board<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.310> better

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
consider the board on board for better

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
consider the board on board for better
waves<00:01:18.570> or<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:21.000> normal<00:01:21.990> short<00:01:22.259> board<00:01:22.470> type

waves or for a normal short board type

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.429 
waves or for a normal short board type
of<00:01:22.860> wave<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.759> into<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.659> even<00:01:25.170> double

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
of wave up into you know even double

00:01:25.439 --> 00:02:04.750 
of wave up into you know even double
overhead<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:25.979> times

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.260 

proton<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.930> think<00:02:06.860> it's<00:02:07.010> it<00:02:07.550> would<00:02:07.760> be<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.030> really

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
proton I think it's it would be a really

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.490 
proton I think it's it would be a really
fun<00:02:08.630> board<00:02:08.840> for<00:02:08.990> anyone<00:02:11.920> that's<00:02:12.920> an<00:02:13.130> expert
