really incredible just what a difference

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.850 
really incredible just what a difference
it<00:00:36.030> makes<00:00:36.240> when<00:00:36.810> we<00:00:37.020> start<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> understand

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it makes when we start to understand

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.350 
it makes when we start to understand
that<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.490> have<00:00:38.520> got<00:00:38.730> these<00:00:39.030> different

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that we have got these different

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.330 
that we have got these different
frequencies<00:00:39.900> that<00:00:40.080> we<00:00:40.170> already<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.950> able<00:00:41.310> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
frequencies that we already are able to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.640 
frequencies that we already are able to
vibrate<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.360> into<00:00:42.570> tune<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> when

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
vibrate and get into tune with and when

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.410 
vibrate and get into tune with and when
we<00:00:43.740> really<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.220> that<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.880> have<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.120> ability

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we really get that we have this ability

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.140 
we really get that we have this ability
to<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.900> able<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.470> get<00:00:46.620> refocused<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
to be able to just get refocused at the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.000 
to be able to just get refocused at the
other<00:00:48.480> person<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> we're<00:00:49.380> working<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
other person that we're working with in

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
other person that we're working with in
a<00:00:50.370> way<00:00:50.490> that<00:00:50.670> allows<00:00:50.880> us<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.330> able<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> tap

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
a way that allows us to be able to tap

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.050 
a way that allows us to be able to tap
into<00:00:51.900> their<00:00:52.230> energy<00:00:52.410> their<00:00:53.160> essence<00:00:53.580> and<00:00:53.700> the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
into their energy their essence and the

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.000 
into their energy their essence and the
genius<00:00:54.240> of<00:00:54.450> who<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.200> so<00:00:55.740> why<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:55.950> we

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
genius of who they are so why do we

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
genius of who they are so why do we
always<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.550> wrong<00:00:56.580> why<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.360> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
always get it so wrong why is it so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
always get it so wrong why is it so
difficult<00:00:57.720> to<00:00:58.050> actually<00:00:58.770> start<00:00:59.040> looking

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
difficult to actually start looking

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.770 
difficult to actually start looking
through<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> eyes<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.030> someone<00:01:00.390> instead<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
through the eyes of someone instead of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
through the eyes of someone instead of
us<00:01:00.870> constantly<00:01:01.650> judging<00:01:01.980> things<00:01:02.340> from<00:01:02.580> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
us constantly judging things from the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.980 
us constantly judging things from the
point<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.910> view<00:01:02.970> of<00:01:03.120> ourselves<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.900> a

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
point of view of ourselves it's a

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.719 
point of view of ourselves it's a
natural<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.159> often<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> becomes

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
natural thing but often it becomes

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.100 
natural thing but often it becomes
because<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> language<00:01:06.720> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
because we don't have the language in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.170 
because we don't have the language in
the<00:01:07.170> structure<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:07.710> allows<00:01:07.830> us<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:09.000> able

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the structure which allows us to be able

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.030 
the structure which allows us to be able
to<00:01:09.270> actually<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.750> into<00:01:09.870> tune<00:01:10.230> with<00:01:10.860> those

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
to actually get into tune with those

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830 
to actually get into tune with those
around<00:01:11.310> us<00:01:11.550> so<00:01:12.060> what<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:12.300> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.480> do<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.750> I'm

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
around us so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
around us so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:13.020> share<00:01:13.230> how<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> four<00:01:14.370> different

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
going to share how the four different

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.690 
going to share how the four different
geniuses<00:01:15.350> allow<00:01:16.350> us<00:01:16.620> to<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.040> far<00:01:17.490> better

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
geniuses allow us to get a far better

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.340 
geniuses allow us to get a far better
understanding<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.480> how<00:01:18.660> different<00:01:18.690> people

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
understanding of how different people

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.020 
understanding of how different people
are<00:01:19.440> different<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.710> us<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.760> it<00:01:20.940> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
are different from us what is it that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.330 
are different from us what is it that
allows<00:01:21.180> us<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> actually<00:01:21.870> get<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.830> tuned

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
allows us to actually get really tuned

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.640 
allows us to actually get really tuned
in<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.510> experience<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.260> someone<00:01:25.440> else

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
in to the experience that someone else

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
in to the experience that someone else
is<00:01:25.680> having<00:01:26.010> in<00:01:26.100> life<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.460> they<00:01:26.550> are

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
is having in life because they are

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
is having in life because they are
looking<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.330> different<00:01:27.630> way<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> how

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
looking at in different way and how

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
looking at in different way and how
these<00:01:28.680> four<00:01:29.100> geniuses<00:01:29.400> also<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.450> could

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
these four geniuses also you could

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.110 
these four geniuses also you could
almost<00:01:30.960> sense<00:01:31.890> based<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.550> four<00:01:32.760> different

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
almost sense based on the four different

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.420 
almost sense based on the four different
energies<00:01:33.480> that<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.350> got<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.100> mentioned

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
energies that we have got as I mentioned

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
energies that we have got as I mentioned
with<00:01:35.550> dynamo<00:01:35.940> genius<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.480> some<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.200> our<00:01:37.260> other

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
with dynamo genius in some of our other

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.700 
with dynamo genius in some of our other
videos<00:01:37.620> this<00:01:38.580> idea<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.060> spring<00:01:39.450> energy<00:01:39.710> where

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
videos this idea of spring energy where

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
videos this idea of spring energy where
they<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.310> love<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.880> idea<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.330> starting<00:01:42.570> new

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
they just love this idea of starting new

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.210 
they just love this idea of starting new
things<00:01:42.870> all<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.350> time<00:01:43.530> we'll<00:01:43.740> come<00:01:43.890> back<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
things all the time we'll come back to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.740 
things all the time we'll come back to
that<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> moment<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.300> that's<00:01:45.479> very

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that in a moment but that's very

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
that in a moment but that's very
different<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.140> summer<00:01:46.560> energy<00:01:46.920> even<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
different from summer energy even if you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.360 
different from summer energy even if you
think<00:01:48.000> about<00:01:48.180> how<00:01:48.650> crops<00:01:49.650> are<00:01:49.830> grown<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
think about how crops are grown if you

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.820 
think about how crops are grown if you
think<00:01:50.550> about<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:50.940> flowers<00:01:51.450> bloom<00:01:51.740> there's<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
think about how flowers bloom there's a

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.530 
think about how flowers bloom there's a
certain<00:01:53.159> season<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.729> which<00:01:53.940> it's<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
certain season in which it's the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.390 
certain season in which it's the
appropriate<00:01:54.930> time<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.680> planting<00:01:56.220> a

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
appropriate time to be planting a

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.130 
appropriate time to be planting a
certain<00:01:56.909> season<00:01:57.420> where<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.900> appropriate

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
certain season where it's appropriate

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.570 
certain season where it's appropriate
time<00:01:58.590> where<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.920> actually<00:01:59.159> find<00:01:59.400> things

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
time where you actually find things

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.580 
time where you actually find things
blooming<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.870> exactly<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> same

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
blooming and this is exactly the same

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.899 
blooming and this is exactly the same
when<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.830> comes<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.100> relationships<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.760> well

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
when it comes to relationships as well

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.399 
when it comes to relationships as well
and<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:03.450> comes<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> different<00:02:03.960> types<00:02:04.290> of

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
and it comes to different types of

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.260 
and it comes to different types of
people<00:02:04.470> you'll<00:02:05.220> find<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.580> from<00:02:05.790> spring<00:02:06.120> we

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
people you'll find that from spring we

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.270 
people you'll find that from spring we
get<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> summer<00:02:06.780> which<00:02:07.260> is<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.440> blaze<00:02:07.799> genius

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
get to summer which is a blaze genius

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.780 
get to summer which is a blaze genius
from<00:02:08.909> summer<00:02:09.269> will<00:02:09.599> then<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.289> tempo<00:02:11.280> which

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
from summer will then get to tempo which

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.960 
from summer will then get to tempo which
is<00:02:11.970> our<00:02:12.120> autumn<00:02:12.569> genius<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.580> these<00:02:14.580> linked

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
is our autumn genius and these linked

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.860 
is our autumn genius and these linked
into

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
into

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.420 
into
the<00:02:16.200> kind<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.530> environment<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> kind<00:02:17.400> of

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the kind of environment and the kind of

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.400 
the kind of environment and the kind of
relationship<00:02:17.940> which<00:02:18.150> actually<00:02:18.450> gives<00:02:18.690> us<00:02:18.840> by

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
relationship which actually gives us by

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.010 
relationship which actually gives us by
far<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.310> very<00:02:20.640> very<00:02:20.850> best<00:02:21.180> fulfillment<00:02:21.930> in

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
far the very very best fulfillment in

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.230 
far the very very best fulfillment in
what<00:02:22.650> we're<00:02:22.890> looking<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.819> be<00:02:23.970> able<00:02:24.150> to

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
what we're looking to to be able to

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.880 
what we're looking to to be able to
actually<00:02:24.390> tap<00:02:24.780> into<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.140> genius<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.530> who<00:02:25.680> we

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
actually tap into the genius of who we

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.970 
actually tap into the genius of who we
are<00:02:26.069> from<00:02:26.640> tempo<00:02:27.060> we<00:02:27.209> get<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.480> steal<00:02:27.750> which<00:02:28.740> is

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
are from tempo we get to steal which is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.449 
are from tempo we get to steal which is
our<00:02:29.819> winter<00:02:30.180> genius<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:32.069> can<00:02:32.310> actually

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
our winter genius and I can actually

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.830 
our winter genius and I can actually
take<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.120> something<00:02:33.360> which<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.510> actually

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
take this to something which is actually

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.110 
take this to something which is actually
probably<00:02:33.959> far<00:02:34.260> more<00:02:34.290> intuitive<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:36.030> you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
probably far more intuitive have you

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.080 
probably far more intuitive have you
ever<00:02:36.270> played<00:02:36.510> with<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> pack<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.319> playing<00:02:37.709> cards

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
ever played with a pack of playing cards

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.520 
ever played with a pack of playing cards
it's<00:02:39.090> really<00:02:39.300> interesting<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.470> you

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
it's really interesting because if you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.690 
it's really interesting because if you
actually<00:02:40.650> go<00:02:40.860> back<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.160> orange<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.580> we're

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
actually go back the orange and we're

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.160 
actually go back the orange and we're
playing<00:02:41.910> cards<00:02:42.120> came<00:02:42.390> from<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.810> actually

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
playing cards came from and actually

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.930 
playing cards came from and actually
came<00:02:43.319> from<00:02:43.350> out<00:02:43.560> east<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.010> all<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.819> this

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
came from out east and all of this

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.580 
came from out east and all of this
information<00:02:45.270> on<00:02:45.569> giving<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.959> as<00:02:46.230> you'll<00:02:46.380> see

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
information on giving you as you'll see

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.020 
information on giving you as you'll see
from<00:02:46.680> some<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.010> other<00:02:47.130> videos<00:02:47.400> goes<00:02:47.850> all

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
from some of the other videos goes all

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.580 
from some of the other videos goes all
the<00:02:48.060> way<00:02:48.120> back<00:02:48.180> 5,000<00:02:48.900> years<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.350> Eastern

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the way back 5,000 years to the Eastern

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.960 
the way back 5,000 years to the Eastern
philosophies<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.250> you'll<00:02:50.670> find<00:02:50.850> that

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
philosophies that you'll find that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.520 
philosophies that you'll find that
playing<00:02:51.480> cards<00:02:51.750> actually<00:02:51.840> linked<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.410> these

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
playing cards actually linked to these

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.470 
playing cards actually linked to these
four<00:02:52.800> sides<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.220> well<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:54.030> we<00:02:54.120> actually<00:02:54.239> have

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
four sides as well that we actually have

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.670 
four sides as well that we actually have
something<00:02:54.870> which<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.050> head<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.470> clouds

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
something which is head in the clouds

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.400 
something which is head in the clouds
which<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.209> idea<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.480> clubs<00:02:57.810> which<00:02:58.290> I'll

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
which is the idea of clubs which I'll

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.290 
which is the idea of clubs which I'll
put<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.709> top<00:02:58.830> here<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.430> here's<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.060> club

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
put at the top here so here's a club

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.660 
put at the top here so here's a club
site<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> symbol<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.410> using<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> symbol<00:03:02.550> here

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
site the symbol and using a symbol here

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.890 
site the symbol and using a symbol here
is<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.940> help<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.330> moment<00:03:03.690> as<00:03:03.810> you're

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
is going to help in a moment as you're

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.059 
is going to help in a moment as you're
going<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.080> see<00:03:04.200> by<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.380> kind<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> energy<00:03:04.920> we

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
going to see by the kind of energy we

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.949 
going to see by the kind of energy we
have<00:03:05.250> which<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.060> opposite<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.630> something

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
have which is the opposite of something

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.490 
have which is the opposite of something
which<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.110> earth<00:03:07.500> Spade<00:03:08.069> which<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.180> here<00:03:09.569> which

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
which is earth Spade which is here which

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000 
which is earth Spade which is here which
is<00:03:10.530> feet<00:03:10.860> an<00:03:11.010> ear<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> ground<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:12.510> have<00:03:12.720> got

is feet an ear to the ground we have got

this all relationships as well as the

even with our kids with our husband wife
or<00:06:02.580> relationships<00:06:03.419> they<00:06:03.870> all<00:06:04.080> go<00:06:04.289> through

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
or relationships they all go through

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.680 
or relationships they all go through
cycles<00:06:04.710> just<00:06:05.669> as<00:06:05.849> all<00:06:06.090> things<00:06:06.360> go<00:06:06.539> through

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
cycles just as all things go through

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.870 
cycles just as all things go through
cycles<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.319> so<00:06:08.009> for<00:06:08.190> example<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:08.610> always

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
cycles and so for example you always

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.309 
cycles and so for example you always
notice<00:06:09.029> that<00:06:09.300> in<00:06:09.419> a<00:06:09.509> new<00:06:09.659> relationship<00:06:09.810> they

notice that in a new relationship they
say<00:06:10.440> for<00:06:10.590> example<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:11.009> boyfriend/girlfriend

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
say for example a boyfriend/girlfriend

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.730 
say for example a boyfriend/girlfriend
it<00:06:12.060> always<00:06:12.270> starts<00:06:12.750> in<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.020> spring<00:06:13.110> spring

it always starts in the spring spring
