at<00:01:00.590> e75<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.280> bit<00:01:02.400> of<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> departure

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
at e75 is a little bit of a departure

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.310 
at e75 is a little bit of a departure
from<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.780> regular<00:01:04.110> German<00:01:04.650> heavy<00:01:04.770> line<00:01:05.070> as

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
from the regular German heavy line as

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.140 
from the regular German heavy line as
the<00:01:07.320> cannon<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.550> not<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.990> accurate<00:01:10.790> but<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the cannon is not very accurate but it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.380 
the cannon is not very accurate but it
does<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.540> fortran<00:01:12.870> ideal<00:01:13.230> for<00:01:13.440> damage<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
does have fortran ideal for damage and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.320 
does have fortran ideal for damage and
it<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:16.250> heavily<00:01:17.250> armored<00:01:17.730> in<00:01:19.880> all<00:01:20.880> at<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
it is heavily armored in all at the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.710 
it is heavily armored in all at the
front<00:01:22.040> tiger<00:01:23.040> 2<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.400> slightly<00:01:24.150> armored<00:01:24.570> as

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
front tiger 2 is slightly armored as

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.469 
front tiger 2 is slightly armored as
well<00:01:26.150> but<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.380> thing<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:29.210> kind<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
well but this thing is kind of like a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.740 
well but this thing is kind of like a
brick<00:01:30.810> wall<00:01:31.050> sometimes<00:01:32.030> depends<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.210> who<00:01:33.570> your

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
brick wall sometimes depends on who your

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.640 
brick wall sometimes depends on who your
face<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:35.509> t54e1<00:01:36.509> could<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> load<00:01:37.500> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
face but t54e1 could have a load of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190 
face but t54e1 could have a load of
trouble<00:01:38.180> obviously<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.450> tank<00:01:39.690> destroyers

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
trouble obviously your tank destroyers

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.480 
trouble obviously your tank destroyers
won't

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.370 

and<00:01:46.030> looking<00:01:46.390> at<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.540> team<00:01:46.720> list<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.170> looks

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
and looking at the team list it looks

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.060 
and looking at the team list it looks
like<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:49.450> about<00:01:49.659> it<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.320> two<00:01:50.740> tank

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
like that's about it the two tank

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.460 
like that's about it the two tank
destroyers<00:01:51.549> on<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.759> t-34<00:01:52.630> are<00:01:52.960> probably<00:01:53.290> good

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
destroyers on the t-34 are probably good

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.800 
destroyers on the t-34 are probably good
all<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:54.009> ours<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.340> will<00:01:54.880> reliably<00:01:55.330> goes

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
all of ours that will reliably goes

through my armor is three we'll have a
little<00:01:59.259> bit<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.470> problem<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.570> course

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
little bit of problem but of course

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.590 
little bit of problem but of course
anything<00:02:02.740> firing<00:02:03.640> into<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.060> commander's

actually<00:02:12.099> backing<00:02:12.550> off<00:02:12.760> over<00:02:13.030> here<00:02:13.180> because

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
actually backing off over here because

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.229 
actually backing off over here because
that<00:02:14.319> Water<00:02:14.560> Tribe<00:02:14.830> depends<00:02:15.130> for<00:02:15.430> was<00:02:15.730> spotted

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
that Water Tribe depends for was spotted

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.800 
that Water Tribe depends for was spotted
crossing<00:02:16.750> at<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.380> h1<00:02:18.190> area<00:02:18.519> I<00:02:18.730> was<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.420> h1

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
crossing at the h1 area I was in the h1

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.650 
crossing at the h1 area I was in the h1
area<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.260> he<00:02:20.380> could<00:02:20.620> pop<00:02:20.860> out<00:02:21.360> over<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> hill

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
area so he could pop out over the hill

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.610 
area so he could pop out over the hill
and<00:02:22.900> take<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> few<00:02:23.890> potshots<00:02:24.130> at<00:02:24.549> me

just<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.310> little<00:02:40.580> bit<00:02:40.819> worried<00:02:41.240> that<00:02:42.080> he's

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
just a little bit worried that he's

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.809 
just a little bit worried that he's
going<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.410> come<00:02:42.560> over<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.800> hill<00:02:43.069> but<00:02:43.430> doesn't

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
going to come over that hill but doesn't

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.040 
going to come over that hill but doesn't
look<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:46.459> I'm<00:02:46.550> going<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.790> slowly<00:02:47.780> move
