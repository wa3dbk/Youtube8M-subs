00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.009
 observe the reference torque 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.599
 you found that after the right turn he executes our new figure 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.159
 exchange right rear 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.679
 then return to the left 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.780
 the traded back 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780
 a turn on the left 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.720
 and we start again 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.030
 but turn right 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.390
 exchange rate 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 She turns 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 the center back right 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 and turn left 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.650
 work in detail our new target 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.890
 work well says that displacements 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.010
 to begin our new figure must have executed a half-turn 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.110
 in law 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 the reference torque runs a half turn to the right 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
 then the couple moves backwards the corpse 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.820
 the couple moves backwards hen 4 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.820
 as a result we run a late turn left to get back in the league 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.580
 to finish we run a turn to the left to get back into the mine 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660
 let's go by liquidating the cadets not the rider 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.200
 left foot in ariege 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.290
 right foot from side slightly behind 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.480
 left foot 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.770
 we start again 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.720
 left behind 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.010
 right to quote slightly back 2 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.010
 left assembled 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.380
 let's take a look at the footsteps of the Canadian 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.840
 right forward 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.039
 besides the slightly upstream side 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.039
 why assembly 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.589
 we start right forward 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.819
 besides the slightly ahead side 2 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.819
 right assembly 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.149
 seeing the detail of the proposed structure 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:32.909
 we run a turn and a half to the right to finish other moves 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.299
 following we execute our right back change 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.309
 then al 2000 laps left in china and on a complete turn the left 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.549
 and finally a left front change as usual to be able to start again 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.489

 47 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.309
 it's quite rare 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.139
 my husband and m 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.499
 3 end of turn on the left 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.219
 back to the left 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.299
 because it's his sale purchase of 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.249
 3 I recommend 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.249
