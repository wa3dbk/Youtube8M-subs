00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 And, folks, beauty and I'll make a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:11.190
 test with sony xperia m2 camera is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.309
 an 8-megapixel rear camera and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.289
 a vga front then has some modes 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.289
 of ash here is in automatic mode 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.740
 this is the auto mode above 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 auto top is automatic 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.349
 he is very good too and here is 1 who takes 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.570
 very fast photo 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.829
 this is what he basically takes 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.270
 in a second he takes 30 photos is he 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.789
 gets caught in the previous 15 and 15 after 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.730
 Press I chose this environment here 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.320
 in the room closed with white walls 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.230
 and with the white light because there is not much 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.379
 interference from the environment then 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.680
 for you to compare with other videos that 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.180
 I will do 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.119
 so let's go to the test 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.020
 and here folks here is a recording test 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.760
 the 8 megapixel rear camera 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.760
 xperia m2 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.470
 it is auto focus but the adjustment is 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:29.159
 automatically not adjusting when clicking 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 on the screen is good to think that it is the test without 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.470
 to be in hd is tape 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.470
 the previous one was hdr 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:48.590
 this one is in the normal automatic format 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.590
 of focus 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.650
 here is a recording test with the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:08.100
 flash on 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:12.420
 Okay, people here recording the camera. 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.690
 recording at vga resolution is the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.200
 back I forgot to talk, it's up to full 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.200
 hd 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.250
 Good, I hope it gives you both a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.799
 The notion of quality here is to watch over 0.3 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.799
 very simple megapixels
