00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
in his air defense especially from

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.949 
in his air defense especially from
booting<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.730> ball<00:02:36.910> out<00:02:37.090> when<00:02:37.240> oh<00:02:37.360> yeah<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.720> we

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
booting the ball out when oh yeah and we

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.420 
booting the ball out when oh yeah and we
took<00:02:38.080> advantage<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.830> in<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.040> 40th

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.949 
took advantage of that in the 40th
minute<00:02:39.459> with<00:02:39.850> closer<00:02:40.120> wouldn't<00:02:40.600> on<00:02:40.690> through

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
minute with closer wouldn't on through

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.660 
minute with closer wouldn't on through
and<00:02:41.110> obviously<00:02:42.040> he's<00:02:42.220> not<00:02:42.250> going<00:02:42.490> to<00:02:42.550> miss

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
and obviously he's not going to miss

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.040 
and obviously he's not going to miss
from<00:02:42.820> there<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> nice<00:02:43.240> finesse<00:02:43.600> past<00:02:43.959> the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
from there a nice finesse past the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.110 
from there a nice finesse past the
goalkeeper<00:02:44.230> makes<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.370> nils<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.790> puts<00:02:46.030> a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
goalkeeper makes it to nils that puts a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.930 
goalkeeper makes it to nils that puts a
100k<00:02:46.660> in<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.020> bank<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.470> that's<00:02:48.340> exactly<00:02:48.520> what

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
100k in the bank and that's exactly what

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.449 
100k in the bank and that's exactly what
we<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:49.270> need<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> keep<00:02:49.900> more<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.800> in<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.040> 45th

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
we do need to keep more and in the 45th

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.880 
we do need to keep more and in the 45th
minute<00:02:51.550> he<00:02:52.150> does<00:02:52.450> leave<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> massive<00:02:53.350> gap<00:02:53.560> again

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
minute he does leave a massive gap again

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.949 
minute he does leave a massive gap again
doesn't<00:02:54.520> seem<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.790> run<00:02:54.940> back<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.209> close<00:02:55.690> over

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
doesn't seem to run back and close over

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.000 
doesn't seem to run back and close over
and<00:02:56.110> I'm<00:02:56.170> through<00:02:56.410> but<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.680> time<00:02:56.860> he<00:02:56.980> is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
and I'm through but this time he is

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.190 
and I'm through but this time he is
caught<00:02:57.370> by<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> defender<00:02:57.880> but<00:02:58.420> decided<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.020> go<00:02:59.170> a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
caught by a defender but decided to go a

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.890 
caught by a defender but decided to go a
different<00:02:59.380> route<00:03:00.160> away<00:03:00.730> from<00:03:01.120> his<00:03:01.330> defenders

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
different route away from his defenders

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.080 
different route away from his defenders
now<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.410> lag<00:03:02.800> was<00:03:03.010> there<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.459> was<00:03:03.580> an<00:03:03.730> annoying

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
now the lag was there it was an annoying

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.810 
now the lag was there it was an annoying
game<00:03:04.390> but<00:03:04.630> we<00:03:04.720> did<00:03:04.930> go<00:03:05.140> 150<00:03:05.890> k<00:03:06.220> into<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.640> bank

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
game but we did go 150 k into the bank

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.479 
game but we did go 150 k into the bank
in<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.120> 45th<00:03:07.989> minute<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.860> in<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.100> second

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
in the 45th minute but in the second

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.190
