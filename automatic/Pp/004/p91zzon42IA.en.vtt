it<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:29.300> its<00:00:30.300> focus<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.410> there<00:00:32.329> as<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.690> see

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it in its focus on there as you can see

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.410 
it in its focus on there as you can see

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
it has a capacity of 3,000 mhh which is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.830 
it has a capacity of 3,000 mhh which is
the<00:00:39.420> iphone<00:00:39.570> has<00:00:40.820> 1900<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.440> better

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
the iphone has 1900 so it's a lot better

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.529 
the iphone has 1900 so it's a lot better
its<00:00:45.840> output<00:00:46.170> has<00:00:47.270> 700ma<00:00:48.270> max<00:00:49.460> um<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
its output has 700ma max um so this is a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.959 
its output has 700ma max um so this is a
really<00:00:51.870> good<00:00:52.260> option<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.190> battery<00:00:53.699> goes

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
really good option if your battery goes

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.700 
really good option if your battery goes
um<00:00:54.739> way<00:00:55.739> too<00:00:55.800> fast<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:57.230> way<00:00:58.230> too<00:00:58.289> fast<00:00:58.469> and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
um way too fast up way too fast and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.009 
um way too fast up way too fast and
actually<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.129> doesn't<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.329> lay<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
actually it doesn't have a lay on the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.630 
actually it doesn't have a lay on the
table<00:01:04.049> design<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:06.170> think<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.950> lot

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
table design which is I think it's a lot

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.190 
table design which is I think it's a lot
for<00:01:09.030> them<00:01:10.189> because<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:12.780> want<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> protect

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
for them because you want to protect

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.640 
for them because you want to protect
your<00:01:13.799> iphone<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.450> really<00:01:15.450> good<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
your iphone is really good so if it
