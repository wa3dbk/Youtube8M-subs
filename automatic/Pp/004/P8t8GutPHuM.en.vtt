GT<00:00:51.270> oh<00:00:51.390> man<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.170> garages<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.949> store<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
GT oh man we have garages to store and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
GT oh man we have garages to store and
cars<00:00:53.820> where<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.600> pick<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.140> tank

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
cars where we can pick them all up tank

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.350 
cars where we can pick them all up tank
our<00:00:55.800> garages<00:00:56.250> which<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> awesome<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.030> also

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
our garages which is awesome I also

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.849 
our garages which is awesome I also
think<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.870> should<00:00:58.109> maybe<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.500> our<00:00:58.649> own

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
think we should maybe have our own

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.220 
think we should maybe have our own
hangar<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.300> could<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> our<00:01:00.780> hangar

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
hangar so like we could go to our hangar

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
hangar so like we could go to our hangar
it<00:01:01.379> could<00:01:01.530> store<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.070> 10<00:01:02.340> different<00:01:02.730> planes

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it could store up to 10 different planes

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
it could store up to 10 different planes
in<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.329> maybe<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:04.019> small<00:01:04.290> ones<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.739> ones

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
in there maybe just small ones not ones

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.380 
in there maybe just small ones not ones
like<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> Titan<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> would<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.240> too

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
like the Titan because that would be too

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.179 
like the Titan because that would be too
big<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.320> our<00:01:07.470> very<00:01:07.650> own<00:01:07.799> hangar

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
big but I think our very own hangar

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
big but I think our very own hangar
would<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.549> good<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:08.850> yes<00:01:09.090> our<00:01:09.630> very<00:01:09.960> own<00:01:10.049> dr.

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
would be good but yes our very own dr.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
would be good but yes our very own dr.
parker<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> boats<00:01:11.460> would<00:01:11.640> also<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.270> very<00:01:12.450> good

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
parker and boats would also be very good

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
parker and boats would also be very good
I'd<00:01:12.780> definitely<00:01:13.229> go<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.650> purchase<00:01:14.159> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
I'd definitely go out and purchase that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.340 
I'd definitely go out and purchase that
maybe<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.090> dock<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.540> could<00:01:15.659> store<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.080> 10

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
maybe in one dock we could store like 10

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
maybe in one dock we could store like 10
of<00:01:16.380> her<00:01:16.560> own<00:01:16.680> boats<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.640> that'd<00:01:17.759> be

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
of her own boats I think that'd be

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.850 
of her own boats I think that'd be
really<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.360> cool<00:01:18.630> Breeden<00:01:19.290> lynn<00:01:19.470> said<00:01:19.680> be

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
money in GTA 5 because we definitely

need money but but I think working at
the<00:01:57.540> gas<00:01:57.689> station<00:01:58.049> would<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.350> pretty<00:01:58.619> cool

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
maybe they could like implement many

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.270 
maybe they could like implement many
games<00:02:00.450> into<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.079> maybe<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.740> stacking

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
games into it so maybe like stacking

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.889 
games into it so maybe like stacking
shelves<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.090> Tetris<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.810> you'd

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
shelves would be like Tetris and you'd

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.630 
shelves would be like Tetris and you'd
have<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> play<00:02:04.320> something<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.040> kind<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
have to play something like that kind of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.429 
have to play something like that kind of
minigames<00:02:06.060> into<00:02:06.509> stuff<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.079> think<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
minigames into stuff like I think that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.499 
minigames into stuff like I think that
would<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.399> cool<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.149> moving<00:02:09.420> on

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
could easily just quickly sink

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370 
could easily just quickly sink
underground<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:06.600> could<00:03:06.750> go<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.140> fast

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
underground and you could go so fast

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.780 
underground and you could go so fast
underwater<00:03:07.980> as<00:03:08.220> well<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.490> not<00:03:08.550> like<00:03:08.730> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
underwater as well it's not like a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.120 
underwater as well it's not like a
normal<00:03:09.150> submarine<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:09.990> would<00:03:10.140> be<00:03:10.230> slow<00:03:10.470> this

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
normal submarine they would be slow this

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.830 
normal submarine they would be slow this
Dollfuss<00:03:11.550> submarine<00:03:11.970> seems<00:03:12.360> really<00:03:12.720> really

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
Dollfuss submarine seems really really

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.270 
Dollfuss submarine seems really really
cool<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.200> again<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.620> got<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.800> dolphin

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
cool and again it's got a dolphin

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.340 
cool and again it's got a dolphin
camouflage<00:03:14.760> on<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.300> think<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.050> really

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
camouflage on it I think this be really

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
camouflage on it I think this be really
really<00:03:16.590> cool<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:16.830> it'd<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.070> very<00:03:17.100> interesting

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
really cool and it'd be very interesting

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.160 
really cool and it'd be very interesting
for<00:03:17.910> them<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.239> add<00:03:18.390> into<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.810> game<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.020> don't

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
for them to add into the game but don't

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.660 
for them to add into the game but don't
think<00:03:19.290> we've<00:03:19.440> had<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.590> water<00:03:19.920> themed

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
think we've had a water themed

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.720 
think we've had a water themed
DLC<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.480> GTA<00:03:22.050> 5<00:03:22.320> yes<00:03:22.800> we've<00:03:23.040> had<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
DLC in GTA 5 yes we've had like the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.520 
DLC in GTA 5 yes we've had like the
beach<00:03:23.940> bomb<00:03:24.239> update<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:25.020> we<00:03:25.110> haven't<00:03:25.260> had<00:03:25.500> a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
beach bomb update but we haven't had a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.370 
beach bomb update but we haven't had a
water<00:03:25.860> theme<00:03:26.220> DLC<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.120> think<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.600> dolphin

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
water theme DLC so I think the dolphin

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.229 
water theme DLC so I think the dolphin
submarine<00:03:28.860> along<00:03:29.220> with<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> new<00:03:29.640> jet<00:03:29.940> ski<00:03:30.209> or

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
submarine along with a new jet ski or

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.880 
submarine along with a new jet ski or
something<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.260> some<00:03:31.650> water

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
something like that and some water

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130 
something like that and some water
clothing<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.670> maybe<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.209> diving<00:03:33.630> suit<00:03:33.959> or

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
clothing and maybe a diving suit or

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.110 
clothing and maybe a diving suit or
stuff<00:03:34.380> like<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.590> for<00:03:34.890> GT<00:03:35.190> online<00:03:35.489> they<00:03:35.940> would

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
stuff like that for GT online they would

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.630 
stuff like that for GT online they would
all<00:03:36.300> be<00:03:36.330> really<00:03:36.840> also<00:03:37.050> for<00:03:37.260> DLC<00:03:38.040> part<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.430> think

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
all be really also for DLC part I think

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.830 
all be really also for DLC part I think
that'd<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:38.880> an<00:03:38.970> awesome<00:03:39.270> idea<00:03:39.540> if<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.750> could

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
also add the boat document that water

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.729 
also add the boat document that water
