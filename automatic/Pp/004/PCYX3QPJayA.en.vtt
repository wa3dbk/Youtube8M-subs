get accustomed to the machine first all

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.070 
get accustomed to the machine first all
this<00:01:59.970> is<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.360> bit<00:02:00.450> messy<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:00.899> i

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
this is a little bit messy because i

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.180 
this is a little bit messy because i
forgot<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.319> bring<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:03.860> straps<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.069> me

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.120 
forgot to bring the the straps with me
so<00:02:05.429> I<00:02:05.459> found<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:05.910> in<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.119> boot<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> car

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
so I found these in the boot of the car

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.889 
so I found these in the boot of the car
that's<00:02:08.130> why<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.849> using<00:02:09.030> these<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.750> looks

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that's why I'm using these and it looks

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.410 
that's why I'm using these and it looks
extremely<00:02:10.380> messy<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.250> effective<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
extremely messy but it's effective and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:42.590 
extremely messy but it's effective and
keeps<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.750> battery<00:02:12.989> from<00:02:13.080> flying<00:02:13.319> else
