like a feather from a Phoenix or a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.880 
like a feather from a Phoenix or a
unicorn<00:01:06.570> hair<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.530> one's<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
unicorn hair I think this one's like a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160 
unicorn hair I think this one's like a
kinder<00:01:08.340> egg<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> probably<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.720> candy

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
kinder egg so it probably has some candy

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
kinder egg so it probably has some candy
inside<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.650> something<00:01:11.040> probably

now<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.030> one's<00:01:12.210> made<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> wood<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.990> it's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
now this one's made of wood so it's

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170 
now this one's made of wood so it's
pretty<00:01:13.680> sturdy<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.460> tape<00:01:14.670> does<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> pretty

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
pretty sturdy the tape does a pretty

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.850 
pretty sturdy the tape does a pretty
good<00:01:15.299> job<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.689> protecting<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> could

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
good job at protecting it but you could

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.499 
good job at protecting it but you could
never<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.189> too<00:01:17.220> safe<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:18.150> why<00:01:18.270> we're<00:01:18.390> gonna

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
never be too safe just why we're gonna

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.260 
never be too safe just why we're gonna
put<00:01:18.780> these<00:01:18.869> pads<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> little<00:01:20.939> extra

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
put these pads on it just a little extra

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.789 
put these pads on it just a little extra
safety<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.049> maybe<00:01:22.200> we'll<00:01:22.409> wrap<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
safety and maybe we'll wrap it in

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
safety and maybe we'll wrap it in
something<00:01:23.070> soft<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.600> notice

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
something soft like this you notice

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.210 
something soft like this you notice
things<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:25.080> breaking<00:01:25.409> anytime<00:01:25.770> soon

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
things not breaking anytime soon

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.590 
things not breaking anytime soon
now<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.670> standard<00:01:26.970> rifle<00:01:27.150> weighs<00:01:27.420> about

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
now it's standard rifle weighs about

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
now it's standard rifle weighs about
three<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.140> half<00:01:28.170> pounds<00:01:28.680> which<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.159> think

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
three and a half pounds which I think

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.130 
three and a half pounds which I think
that's<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.150> weighs<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:30.990> can

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that's what this one weighs but they can

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.609 
that's what this one weighs but they can
reach<00:01:31.290> weights<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.970> probably<00:01:32.990> about<00:01:33.990> 40

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
reach weights up to probably about 40

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
reach weights up to probably about 40
pounds<00:01:34.799> although<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> doesn't<00:01:35.640> hurt<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:35.939> all

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
pounds although it doesn't hurt at all

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.640 
pounds although it doesn't hurt at all
if<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.450> drop<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.869> your<00:01:37.020> hand<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.350> your<00:01:37.409> foot

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
if you drop it on your hand to your foot

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
what I mean if you're wondering about

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.400 
what I mean if you're wondering about
alto<00:02:27.549> clef<00:02:29.640> only<00:02:30.640> flags<00:02:31.000> use<00:02:31.269> that<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.930> you

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
alto clef only flags use that so you

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.610 
alto clef only flags use that so you
don't<00:02:32.709> have<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.010> worry<00:02:33.160> about<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.500> let's

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
don't have to worry about it so let's

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:44.670 
don't have to worry about it so let's
use<00:02:35.769> an<00:02:35.860> example<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.280> us<00:02:43.140> yeah<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.560> would

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
use an example to us yeah that would

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.550 
use an example to us yeah that would
probably<00:02:44.709> be<00:02:45.400> an<00:02:46.180> e<00:02:48.540> sharp<00:02:51.540> minor<00:02:52.540> yeah<00:02:53.470> that

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
probably be an e sharp minor yeah that

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.319 
probably be an e sharp minor yeah that
sounds<00:02:53.829> about<00:02:53.859> right<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.609> anything<00:02:55.120> below

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
sounds about right and anything below
