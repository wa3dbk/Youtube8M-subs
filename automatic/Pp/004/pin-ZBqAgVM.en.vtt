one that we we should reconsider and I

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.570 
one that we we should reconsider and I

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
think it's one that we should walk away

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.909 
think it's one that we should walk away
from<00:06:20.849> real<00:06:21.689> diversity<00:06:22.050> isn't<00:06:22.439> about<00:06:22.620> being
