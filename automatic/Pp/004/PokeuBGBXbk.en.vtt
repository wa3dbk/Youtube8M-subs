 seat 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.700
 it is better to ask the jury 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.399
 his authorization with a formula any 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.160

 installed two scenarios of the jury 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.510
 invites you to start with a simple 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.949

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.220
 either you read the subject heading if 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.299
 this one is short 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.700
 why even just because if 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.670
 you come across a relatively text 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.369
 long the jury will ask you to pass 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.970
 directly to the consideration of the motion

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.399
 Note the key points a party plan 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.920
 or in three parts during your 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.530
 presentation the jury can you 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.130
 interrupt and ask yourself one or two 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.759
 even three questions at the end of this 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.710
 presentation be the chain jury on 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.450
 personal questions are they 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.130
 wish to return to certain points 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.460
 which you will have evoked during two 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.780
 representations of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.050
 of the sanitary and social theme 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.420
 that you have in mind the idea according to 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.670

 sanitary and social theme represents 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.120
 10 to 12 minutes on the 30 minutes of 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.920
 oral presentation at the end of the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.630
 health and social theme 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.550
 the jury asks you a multitude of 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.180
 questions you have to know that from one point 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.180
 statistically
