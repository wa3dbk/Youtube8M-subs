navigating I'm not even looking at the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.200 
navigating I'm not even looking at the
guide<00:02:58.720> just<00:02:59.720> kind<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.960> doing<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.680> by<00:03:01.210> ear

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
i'm doing it by eye sight huh that was

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.530 
i'm doing it by eye sight huh that was
stupid<00:03:09.400> because<00:03:10.400> i<00:03:10.550> can't<00:03:10.760> go<00:03:10.850> back<00:03:11.030> there<00:03:11.060> so

stupid because i can't go back there so
how<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:12.140> should<00:03:13.040> probably<00:03:13.250> go<00:03:13.640> through<00:03:13.850> the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
how we should probably go through the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.080 
how we should probably go through the
