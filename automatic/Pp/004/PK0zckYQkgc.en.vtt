well<00:00:17.910> it'll<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> same<00:00:18.630> sort<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.050> design

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
well it'll have the same sort of design

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.540 
well it'll have the same sort of design
except<00:00:19.740> it'll<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:19.920> constructed<00:00:20.460> differently

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
except it'll be constructed differently

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.759 
except it'll be constructed differently
so<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.810> hole<00:00:21.990> will<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.289> well<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
so that the hole will be well that it

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
so that the hole will be well that it
won't<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.070> pop<00:00:23.310> riveted<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:23.850> example<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
won't be pop riveted for example the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.660 
won't be pop riveted for example the
power<00:00:24.990> will<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.560> both<00:00:25.769> large<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.460> amount

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
power will not be both large the amount

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.400 
power will not be both large the amount
of<00:00:26.789> coal<00:00:27.000> it'll<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> biodiesel<00:00:27.779> electric

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
of coal it'll be a biodiesel electric

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.439 
of coal it'll be a biodiesel electric
will<00:00:28.590> still<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.949> three<00:00:29.550> propellers<00:00:29.910> because

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
will still have three propellers because

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.510 
will still have three propellers because
that<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.660> part<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.320> original<00:00:31.470> ship<00:00:31.830> will

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
that was part of the original ship will

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
that was part of the original ship will
have<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.940> additional<00:00:33.239> deck<00:00:33.690> which<00:00:33.899> will<00:00:34.079> mean

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
have an additional deck which will mean

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.020 
have an additional deck which will mean
that<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.530> bridge<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> high<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.880> see

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
that the bridge is high and we can see

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.639 
that the bridge is high and we can see
over<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> bow<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.290> course<00:00:37.469> we'll<00:00:37.620> have

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
over the bow and of course we'll have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
over the bow and of course we'll have
safety<00:00:38.129> lifeboats<00:00:38.610> Atlantic<00:00:39.120> first-class

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
safety lifeboats Atlantic first-class

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.660 
safety lifeboats Atlantic first-class
lifeboats<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.649> sail<00:00:41.309> around<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
lifeboats that will sail around the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.220 
lifeboats that will sail around the

be right we'll have radar we'll have

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
be right we'll have radar we'll have
satellite<00:00:45.750> navigation<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.649> we'll<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
satellite navigation and we'll have you

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220 
satellite navigation and we'll have you
conditioning<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.000> everybody<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.719> but

conditioning for everybody you know but
of<00:00:49.320> course<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.680> utilize<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.280> designs<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
of course will utilize the designs and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.729 
of course will utilize the designs and
then<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> same<00:00:51.660> Titanic<00:00:52.199> experience

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
then we have the same Titanic experience

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:25.330 
then we have the same Titanic experience

their passengers other words I think if

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.219 
their passengers other words I think if

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
something we've got to turn the clock

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:18.780 
something we've got to turn the clock
back<00:01:51.829> in<00:01:51.979> time<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.369> do

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.550

well thanks for coming everybody to well
it's<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.370> we're<00:02:25.490> not<00:02:25.580> going<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
it's a it's that we're not going to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.850 
it's a it's that we're not going to
divulge<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.840> cost<00:02:27.080> because<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.530> not<00:02:27.650> about

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
divulge the cost because it's not about

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.100 
divulge the cost because it's not about
money<00:02:28.210> I've<00:02:29.210> got<00:02:29.360> enough<00:02:29.540> money<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.900> pay<00:02:30.050> for

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
money I've got enough money to pay for

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.270 
money I've got enough money to pay for
it<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.410> think<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.770> that's<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.070> really

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
it I think so that's all that really

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.960 
it I think so that's all that really
matters<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.900> it's<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.320> it's<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:34.400> important

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
matters it's a it's a it's a important

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.940 
matters it's a it's a it's a important
project<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:35.660> not<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:36.620> costly

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
project but it's not that costly

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.350 
project but it's not that costly
compared<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.550> other<00:02:37.670> things<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.030> I've<00:02:38.120> done

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
compared to other things that I've done

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.660 
compared to other things that I've done
we're<00:02:38.570> building<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:39.110> ships<00:02:39.380> now<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:40.100> Jinling

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
we're building for ships now in Jinling

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.250 
we're building for ships now in Jinling
shipyards<00:02:41.210> in<00:02:41.300> China<00:02:41.600> which<00:02:41.840> are<00:02:41.960> all<00:02:42.020> bigger

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
shipyards in China which are all bigger

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.710 
shipyards in China which are all bigger
than<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.560> Titanic<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.220> know<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.210> cost<00:02:44.450> isn't

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
than the Titanic you know so cost isn't

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.570 
than the Titanic you know so cost isn't
what<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.050> about<00:02:45.080> it's<00:02:45.950> about<00:02:46.070> creating

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
what it's all about it's about creating

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.600 
what it's all about it's about creating
a<00:02:47.530> memory<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.560> guess<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.920> past<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.459> an

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
a memory I guess to the past and an

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:58.900 
a memory I guess to the past and an
experience<00:02:50.150> for<00:02:50.270> people<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:56.860> think<00:02:57.860> if<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.190> if

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
experience for people I think if you if

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.270 
experience for people I think if you if
you<00:02:59.240> anything<00:03:00.170> will<00:03:00.320> sink<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.770> make<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> hot

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
you anything will sink if you make a hot

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.640 
you anything will sink if you make a hot
put<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> hole<00:03:01.640> in<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.030> know<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:03.440> think

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
put a hole in it you know you think

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.960 
put a hole in it you know you think
you'd<00:03:03.740> be<00:03:03.860> very<00:03:03.980> cavalier<00:03:04.490> decide<00:03:04.790> make

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
you'd be very cavalier decide make

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.130 
you'd be very cavalier decide make
something<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.840> know<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:05.930> think

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
something like that you know I think

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.270 
something like that you know I think
people<00:03:06.380> have<00:03:06.440> done<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.770> in<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.890> past<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
people have done that in the past and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.010 
people have done that in the past and
lived<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.490> regret<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.330> wouldn't<00:03:08.780> want<00:03:08.930> to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
lived to regret it so I wouldn't want to

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:32.690 
lived to regret it so I wouldn't want to
justify<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.620> future<00:03:10.010> story<00:03:10.250> by<00:03:10.459> Orson

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.229 

I<00:03:38.480> see<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.630> as<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.930> great<00:03:40.470> tribute<00:03:40.920> to

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
I see this as a great tribute to

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.260 
I see this as a great tribute to
everyone<00:03:42.239> who<00:03:43.430> perished<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.730> also<00:03:45.060> those<00:03:45.239> who

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
everyone who perished and also those who

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.690 
everyone who perished and also those who
survived<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.380> don't<00:03:46.860> think<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.099> lot<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.310> people

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
survived I don't think a lot of people

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.300 
survived I don't think a lot of people
give<00:03:47.910> enough<00:03:48.720> credit<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.350> what<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.010> people

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
give enough credit to what the people

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.840 
give enough credit to what the people
who<00:03:50.459> survived<00:03:50.880> went<00:03:51.360> through<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:52.069> think<00:03:53.069> there

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
who survived went through I think there

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.000 
who survived went through I think there
was<00:03:54.000> an<00:03:54.150> element<00:03:54.300> of<00:03:54.810> what<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.530> might<00:03:55.709> call

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
was an element of what you might call

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.350 
was an element of what you might call
now<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.340> PTSD<00:03:57.560> survivor's<00:03:58.560> guilt<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.819> know

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
now is PTSD survivor's guilt and I know

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.479 
now is PTSD survivor's guilt and I know
my<00:04:00.660> great-grandmother<00:04:01.230> never<00:04:01.560> had<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:02.130> day

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
my great-grandmother never had a day

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.050 
my great-grandmother never had a day
that<00:04:03.269> she<00:04:03.540> didn't<00:04:03.780> relive<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.850> she<00:04:05.850> told

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
that she didn't relive it and she told

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.130

the family that that the worst sound she

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.190 
the family that that the worst sound she
ever<00:04:10.319> heard<00:04:10.680> were<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.100> screams<00:04:11.989> until<00:04:12.989> they

as gentlemen that way of thinking is

as gentlemen that way of thinking is
going<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.900> think<00:05:00.169> that's<00:05:00.380> one<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.650> the

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
going and I think that's one of the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.770 
going and I think that's one of the
things<00:05:01.100> that<00:05:01.400> this<00:05:01.640> is<00:05:01.940> going<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.330> bring<00:05:02.510> back

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
things that this is going to bring back

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.420 
things that this is going to bring back
is<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.910> maybe<00:05:05.180> just<00:05:05.510> for<00:05:05.660> five<00:05:05.900> days<00:05:06.200> but<00:05:07.100> I

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
is and maybe just for five days but I

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.010 
is and maybe just for five days but I
think<00:05:07.730> there's<00:05:08.330> going<00:05:08.480> to<00:05:08.540> be<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.720> whole

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
think there's going to be a whole

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.140 
think there's going to be a whole
attitude<00:05:09.500> change<00:05:09.980> when<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.610> board<00:05:10.910> the

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
attitude change when you board the

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.870 
attitude change when you board the
Titanic<00:05:11.330> at<00:05:12.050> least<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.440> would<00:05:12.590> hope<00:05:12.740> so<00:05:12.950> I<00:05:13.190> would

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
Titanic at least I would hope so I would

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.180 
Titanic at least I would hope so I would
hope<00:05:14.000> so
