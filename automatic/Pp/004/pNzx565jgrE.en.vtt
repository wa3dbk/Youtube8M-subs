00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:08.890
 hello everyone I bring a cable 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.030
 that I bought in Chinese is a 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.230
 imitation of lightning 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.500
 of the cable for data connection of the 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.669
 charging phone iphone 5 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.869
 good the cable is pretty enough 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.919
 similar I've been looking at it in the 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.110
 I shop for a while because it even seemed like 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:33.110
 even too perfect and good at 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.480
 touch could not open it there but at 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.640
 touch yes it seems like it has another 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.950
 touch to the cable that comes with the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.550
 iphone 5 that is what I have 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.390
 but but it's pretty 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.340
 it's pretty much the same is pretty much like 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.949
 I'm going to take the other cable so you can see 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.450
 the difference that this is the one that came to me 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.329
 with the iphone 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.039
 and good 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.579
 position is one next to the other 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.710
 they seem to look alike but they do 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.409
 note the touch of this is the cable 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.680
 original and this is the imitation cable yes 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.549
 that you feel the touch more like more than 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.000
 plastic more rubber the pirate and good 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.250
 here we have the two yes yes that 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.250
 they look pretty much the same 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.320
 here the entrance as you can see in the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.080
 original that is this the bulk of the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.940
 part is white is more is thicker 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.940
 that the pirate 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.710
 and good if they have the same length has 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.260
 the same piece of rubber here in the part 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.420
 of the cable yes that which is not 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.280
 original dances a little more in which 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.950
 bought the chinese but good is 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.480
 quite pretty well finished and then 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.580
 in the part of lightning the part that goes 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.980
 connected to the phone 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.230
 this 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.580
 as you can see is the original this is 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.580
 the Chinese 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.690
 and well, yes they are quite similar if the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.650
 finish of the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.250
 the pirate's finish is not not so 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.800
 as good as as Apple but 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.160
 well it 's pretty quite the same as 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.160
 you can see 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.620
 the finishing of the connections is quite 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.900
 good 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.450
 in the profile they are also pretty 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.160
 same 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.110
 and the truth is that I still believe that 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.690
 nine euros is a good purchase and I 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.140
 I recommend because it really works and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.770
 good as part of 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.920
 of accessory for our and of vis 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.750
 this is really fine without more 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.760
 see you in the next video thanks 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.760
 for seeing me and greetings to all
