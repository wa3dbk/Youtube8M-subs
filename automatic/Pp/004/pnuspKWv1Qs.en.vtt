00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
a quick level or two and it's always

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
a quick level or two and it's always
good<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.660> aware<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.110> options<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.789> also

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
good to be aware of your options I also

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.940 
good to be aware of your options I also
personally<00:00:45.180> find<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> quite<00:00:45.960> fun<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.469> farm<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
personally find it quite fun to farm and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
personally find it quite fun to farm and
sometimes<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.670> worth<00:00:47.820> dropping<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sometimes it's worth dropping the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
sometimes it's worth dropping the
efficiency<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.200> bit<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> fun

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
efficiency a little bit to up the fun

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.970 
efficiency a little bit to up the fun
factor<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.079> makes<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.440> forest<00:00:52.770> worth

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
factor so what makes the forest worth

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.889 
factor so what makes the forest worth
farming<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> sheer<00:00:54.059> number<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.510> mobs<00:00:54.690> your

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
farming is the sheer number of mobs your

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.779 
farming is the sheer number of mobs your
face<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.739> way<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.190> group<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.640> as
