going to you um battlefield hasn't so I

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.470 
going to you um battlefield hasn't so I

our<00:04:02.870> warfare<00:04:03.260> 3<00:04:04.239> so<00:04:05.239> my<00:04:05.540> thoughts<00:04:05.840> on<00:04:06.080> the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
our warfare 3 so my thoughts on the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.839 
our warfare 3 so my thoughts on the
perks<00:04:07.010> lots<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:07.670> tier<00:04:08.569> 1<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:09.739> don't<00:04:10.549> really<00:04:10.730> see

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
perks lots of tier 1 I don't really see

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.970 
perks lots of tier 1 I don't really see
myself<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.750> be<00:04:11.870> honest<00:04:12.200> using<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.590> Recon

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
myself to be honest using the Recon

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.270 
myself to be honest using the Recon
which<00:04:13.280> is<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:14.000> explosive<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.100> bullet<00:04:16.100> damage

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
which is the explosive and bullet damage

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.729 
which is the explosive and bullet damage
on<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.790> HUD<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.660> don't<00:04:18.049> think<00:04:18.109> that'd<00:04:18.350> be<00:04:18.470> too

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
on the HUD I don't think that'd be too

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.270 
on the HUD I don't think that'd be too
useful<00:04:19.040> for<00:04:19.459> me<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:19.790> guess<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.449> depends<00:04:20.810> um<00:04:21.109> if<00:04:21.949> I

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
useful for me I guess it depends um if I

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.770 
useful for me I guess it depends um if I
don't<00:04:22.520> know<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.850> don't<00:04:23.150> really<00:04:23.360> see<00:04:23.510> myself

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
don't know I don't really see myself

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.129 
don't know I don't really see myself
using<00:04:24.169> not<00:04:24.440> too<00:04:24.650> much<00:04:24.800> blind<00:04:25.639> eye<00:04:25.940> is<00:04:26.270> um<00:04:27.080> like

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
using not too much blind eye is um like

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.439 
using not too much blind eye is um like
I<00:04:27.949> already<00:04:28.100> gave<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.430> guys<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.580> definition<00:04:29.240> I

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
won't be using that too much because the

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.250 
won't be using that too much because the
enemy<00:04:31.340> team<00:04:31.760> doesn't<00:04:32.180> really<00:04:32.330> get<00:04:32.570> hairs<00:04:32.900> or

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
very often and the faster faster

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.340 
very often and the faster faster
launcher<00:04:37.010> walk<00:04:37.250> on<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:38.090> don't<00:04:38.900> really<00:04:39.050> have<00:04:39.169> a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
launcher walk on I don't really have a

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.550 
launcher walk on I don't really have a
problem<00:04:39.710> with<00:04:39.949> the<00:04:40.190> time<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.639> takes<00:04:40.820> two<00:04:41.120> to

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
problem with the time it takes two to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.379 
problem with the time it takes two to

connect to the air support it's not

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.180 
connect to the air support it's not
really<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.870> long<00:04:45.110> I<00:04:45.380> don't<00:04:45.650> know<00:04:45.979> why<00:04:46.130> you

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
really that long I don't know why you

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.939

I<00:04:52.190> could<00:04:52.460> see<00:04:52.580> myself<00:04:52.760> using<00:04:53.180> scavenger<00:04:53.960> and

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
I could see myself using scavenger and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.080 
I could see myself using scavenger and
this<00:04:54.680> is<00:04:54.860> one<00:04:55.130> point<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.550> want<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.760> make<00:04:55.820> about

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
this is one point I want to make about

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.719 
this is one point I want to make about
scavenger<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:56.870> believe<00:04:57.500> it<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.680> in<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.039> second

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
scavenger I believe it is in the second

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.629 
scavenger I believe it is in the second
tier<00:04:59.030> slot<00:04:59.330> hardline<00:04:59.990> is<00:05:00.320> one<00:05:00.650> less<00:05:00.949> kill<00:05:01.310> for

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
tier slot hardline is one less kill for

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.430 
tier slot hardline is one less kill for
a<00:05:01.669> kill<00:05:01.940> streak<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.510> pro<00:05:02.840> version<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:03.260> it

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
a kill streak and the pro version of it

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.650 
a kill streak and the pro version of it
is<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:04.160> assist<00:05:04.520> count<00:05:04.910> towards<00:05:05.360> one<00:05:05.810> kill<00:05:06.139> so

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
is to assist count towards one kill so

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.960 
is to assist count towards one kill so
if<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.900> get<00:05:09.050> two<00:05:09.320> assists<00:05:09.889> in<00:05:10.010> one<00:05:10.430> life<00:05:10.700> it

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
if you get two assists in one life it

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.940 
if you get two assists in one life it
has<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.270> be<00:05:11.389> in<00:05:11.479> one<00:05:11.660> life<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.229> it<00:05:12.500> counts<00:05:12.860> as

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
has to be in one life and it counts as

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.820 
has to be in one life and it counts as
one<00:05:13.190> kill<00:05:13.490> now<00:05:14.150> if<00:05:14.599> scavenger<00:05:15.349> you<00:05:15.680> can

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830

replenish<00:05:16.099> stun<00:05:16.550> grenades<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:17.960> just

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
replenish stun grenades you can just

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.540 
replenish stun grenades you can just
throw<00:05:18.200> them<00:05:18.500> everywhere<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.160> be<00:05:19.280> running

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
hard line and getting assists like

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.990

crazily<00:05:21.530> right<00:05:22.010> just<00:05:22.250> throw<00:05:22.310> them<00:05:22.669> in<00:05:22.820> there

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
crazily right just throw them in there

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.930

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
getting kills just by throwing stun

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.070 
getting kills just by throwing stun
grenades<00:05:27.889> all<00:05:28.099> day<00:05:28.310> so<00:05:28.669> it<00:05:29.479> depends<00:05:29.870> on<00:05:30.050> a

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
grenades all day so it depends on a

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.469 
grenades all day so it depends on a
scavenger<00:05:30.470> lets<00:05:31.400> you<00:05:31.520> get<00:05:31.639> stuns<00:05:32.030> in<00:05:32.300> like

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
scavenger lets you get stuns in like

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:32.830 
scavenger lets you get stuns in like
your

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
your

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.080 
your
women<00:05:33.290> frag<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:34.250> names<00:05:34.460> and<00:05:34.669> stuff<00:05:34.850> like<00:05:35.030> that

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
women frag the names and stuff like that

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.640 
women frag the names and stuff like that
back<00:05:35.480> I<00:05:35.690> think<00:05:35.930> that's<00:05:36.080> going<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.290> be<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.440> big

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
back I think that's going to be a big

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.980 
back I think that's going to be a big
part<00:05:36.949> they<00:05:37.400> haven't<00:05:37.610> really<00:05:37.910> confirmed<00:05:38.840> that

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
part they haven't really confirmed that

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.860 
part they haven't really confirmed that

as you can are not yet which um I think

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.050 
as you can are not yet which um I think
it's<00:05:42.110> going<00:05:42.199> to<00:05:42.260> be<00:05:42.320> a<00:05:42.440> big<00:05:42.740> game<00:05:43.460> changer<00:05:43.910> for

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
it's going to be a big game changer for

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.150 
it's going to be a big game changer for
me<00:05:44.120> if<00:05:44.449> you<00:05:44.479> can<00:05:44.840> and<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:45.139> might<00:05:45.350> run<00:05:45.560> scavenger

me if you can and I might run scavenger

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.129 
me if you can and I might run scavenger
more<00:05:46.370> often<00:05:46.729> then<00:05:46.970> if<00:05:47.210> you<00:05:47.660> wouldn't<00:05:47.930> be<00:05:47.990> able

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
more often then if you wouldn't be able

go-to Kirk I would say faster reload

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.530 
go-to Kirk I would say faster reload
faster<00:05:59.449> webbing<00:05:59.960> swapping<00:06:00.850> over<00:06:01.850> any<00:06:02.300> other

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
faster webbing swapping over any other

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.500 
faster webbing swapping over any other
perk<00:06:02.930> from<00:06:03.410> myself<00:06:03.830> personally<00:06:04.520> I<00:06:05.060> think<00:06:05.090> that

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
perk from myself personally I think that

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.990 
perk from myself personally I think that
right<00:06:05.810> there<00:06:06.050> sleight<00:06:06.350> of<00:06:06.380> hand<00:06:06.680> is<00:06:07.000> more

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
right there sleight of hand is more

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.870 
right there sleight of hand is more
useful<00:06:08.270> and<00:06:08.840> it<00:06:09.229> like<00:06:10.070> in<00:06:10.310> my<00:06:10.550> personal

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
useful and it like in my personal

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.690 
useful and it like in my personal
opinion<00:06:11.150> it<00:06:11.660> is<00:06:11.720> on<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:13.070> perp<00:06:13.310> it's<00:06:13.490> going<00:06:13.639> to

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
opinion it is on the perp it's going to

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.330 
opinion it is on the perp it's going to
be<00:06:13.820> most<00:06:14.060> useful<00:06:14.210> for<00:06:14.780> me<00:06:14.990> some<00:06:15.830> people<00:06:16.130> say

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
be most useful for me some people say

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.040 
be most useful for me some people say
that<00:06:16.520> sleight<00:06:16.760> of<00:06:16.790> hands<00:06:17.030> is<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.330> waste<00:06:17.600> of<00:06:17.780> perk

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
that sleight of hands is a waste of perk

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.500 
that sleight of hands is a waste of perk
I<00:06:18.229> don't<00:06:18.410> understand<00:06:18.830> that<00:06:19.040> because<00:06:19.220> i<00:06:19.729> find

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
I don't understand that because i find

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.840 
I don't understand that because i find
the<00:06:20.750> reload<00:06:21.139> faster<00:06:21.919> it's<00:06:22.400> very<00:06:22.610> useful

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
the reload faster it's very useful

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.029 
the reload faster it's very useful
because<00:06:23.150> i<00:06:23.900> like<00:06:24.080> to<00:06:24.200> get<00:06:24.380> up<00:06:24.530> in<00:06:24.680> people's

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
because i like to get up in people's

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.070 
because i like to get up in people's
faces<00:06:25.280> i<00:06:25.520> don't<00:06:25.700> sit<00:06:25.970> back<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.510> camp<00:06:26.780> all<00:06:26.960> the

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
faces i don't sit back and camp all the

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.080 
faces i don't sit back and camp all the
time<00:06:27.289> i<00:06:27.440> like<00:06:27.590> to<00:06:27.710> run<00:06:27.950> around<00:06:28.100> and<00:06:28.550> you<00:06:28.970> know

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
time i like to run around and you know

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.029 
time i like to run around and you know
get<00:06:29.360> my<00:06:29.510> kill<00:06:29.750> streets<00:06:30.080> fast<00:06:30.350> and<00:06:30.680> stuff<00:06:30.860> like

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
get my kill streets fast and stuff like

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.520 
get my kill streets fast and stuff like
that<00:06:31.120> so<00:06:32.120> I<00:06:32.150> think<00:06:32.720> sleight<00:06:33.080> of<00:06:33.110> hands<00:06:33.350> gonna

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
that so I think sleight of hands gonna

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.260 
that so I think sleight of hands gonna
be<00:06:33.620> really<00:06:33.740> good<00:06:33.949> and<00:06:34.160> i<00:06:34.400> think<00:06:34.639> i<00:06:34.789> will<00:06:34.910> also

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
be really good and i think i will also

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.150 
be really good and i think i will also
be<00:06:35.419> using<00:06:35.539> extreme<00:06:36.169> conditioning<00:06:36.740> sprint

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
be using extreme conditioning sprint

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.580 
be using extreme conditioning sprint
longer<00:06:37.940> distances<00:06:38.510> and<00:06:38.750> climb<00:06:38.990> obstacles

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
longer distances and climb obstacles

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.050 
longer distances and climb obstacles
faster<00:06:39.950> so<00:06:40.100> it's<00:06:40.220> pretty<00:06:40.340> much<00:06:40.520> marathon

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
faster so it's pretty much marathon

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.980 
faster so it's pretty much marathon
marathon<00:06:41.780> I<00:06:42.229> like<00:06:42.440> marathon<00:06:43.810> there<00:06:44.810> was<00:06:44.960> a

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
marathon I like marathon there was a

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.719 
marathon I like marathon there was a
phase<00:06:45.350> where<00:06:45.560> I<00:06:45.650> went<00:06:45.770> through<00:06:46.039> where<00:06:46.460> I

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
phase where I went through where I

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.190 
phase where I went through where I
always<00:06:47.120> thought<00:06:47.330> well<00:06:47.630> you<00:06:47.870> don't<00:06:48.020> really

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
always thought well you don't really

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.710 
always thought well you don't really
need<00:06:48.440> marathon<00:06:49.099> because<00:06:49.370> you<00:06:50.300> don't<00:06:50.510> need<00:06:50.630> to

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
need marathon because you don't need to

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.170 
need marathon because you don't need to
be<00:06:50.810> running<00:06:50.990> around<00:06:51.229> everywhere<00:06:51.620> but<00:06:52.250> the
