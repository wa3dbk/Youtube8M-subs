good<00:00:43.940> silicon<00:00:44.420> glue<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:47.660> first<00:00:47.930> step<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.260> to

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
good silicon glue the first step is to

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.619 
good silicon glue the first step is to
solder<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:48.920> resistors<00:00:49.820> in<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.059> way<00:00:50.330> I'll

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
solder the resistors in the way I'll

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:58.119 
solder the resistors in the way I'll
show<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:55.809> it's<00:00:56.809> quite<00:00:56.960> easy<00:00:57.199> after<00:00:57.829> all<00:00:57.949> you

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
show you it's quite easy after all you

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.630 
show you it's quite easy after all you
will<00:00:58.309> have<00:00:58.640> some<00:00:59.030> some<00:01:00.020> kind<00:01:00.199> of<00:01:00.410> child<00:01:01.010> or

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
will have some some kind of child or

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.120 
will have some some kind of child or
string<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.360> loop<00:01:02.600> ideas

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.219 

the<00:01:09.670> next<00:01:09.970> thing<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:10.420> need<00:01:10.600> is<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:12.990> glue<00:01:13.990> them

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
the next thing you need is to glue them

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.990 
the next thing you need is to glue them
to<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.440> rubber<00:01:14.770> material<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.700> way<00:01:18.820> I'll

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
to the rubber material in the way I'll

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.930 
to the rubber material in the way I'll
show<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:21.100> quite<00:01:21.430> easy<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:22.830> glue<00:01:23.940> takes

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
show you is quite easy the glue takes

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.219 
show you is quite easy the glue takes
time<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.950> begin<00:01:26.950> solid<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.990> meantime

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
time to begin solid so in the meantime

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.109 
time to begin solid so in the meantime
we'll<00:01:29.770> create<00:01:30.070> power<00:01:30.490> chart

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
we'll create power chart

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.749 
we'll create power chart
I<00:01:31.150> used<00:01:31.780> power<00:01:32.560> supply<00:01:32.979> from<00:01:33.220> my<00:01:33.369> car<00:01:33.580> because

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
I used power supply from my car because

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.880 
I used power supply from my car because
mostly<00:01:34.300> I<00:01:34.630> should<00:01:34.869> like<00:01:35.080> night<00:01:35.500> scapes

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
mostly I should like night scapes

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.370 
mostly I should like night scapes
setting<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.729> triple<00:01:37.090> on<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.630> roof<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.930> my<00:01:37.990> car

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
setting a triple on the roof of my car

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.609 
setting a triple on the roof of my car
that's<00:01:38.830> why<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.009> will<00:01:39.520> use<00:01:39.910> supply<00:01:40.300> from<00:01:40.810> my<00:01:41.050> car

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
that's why I will use supply from my car

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.790 
that's why I will use supply from my car
I<00:01:41.649> use<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.750> litter<00:01:44.020> socket<00:01:45.660> it's<00:01:46.660> here<00:01:47.590> you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
I use the litter socket it's here you

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.510 
I use the litter socket it's here you
have<00:01:48.220> some<00:01:48.670> glue<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:50.830> can<00:01:51.130> put<00:01:51.340> into

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
have some glue that you can put into

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.820 
have some glue that you can put into
your<00:01:51.729> litter<00:01:52.030> socket<00:01:52.570> we<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:53.500> collect<00:01:53.770> it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
your litter socket we have to collect it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.300 
your litter socket we have to collect it
with<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.399> cable

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
with the cable

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.560 
with the cable
after<00:01:57.310> all<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.759> have<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:58.090> connect<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.450> other

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
after all you have to connect the other

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.880 
after all you have to connect the other
end<00:01:58.899> all<00:01:59.410> this<00:01:59.680> to<00:02:00.039> your<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.800> hitter<00:02:04.890> it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
end all this to your to the hitter it's

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.890 
end all this to your to the hitter it's
extremely<00:02:06.399> easy

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.530 

we<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.650> install<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.099> zip<00:02:13.550> also<00:02:14.330> nothing

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
we have to install the zip also nothing

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.839 
we have to install the zip also nothing
special<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:18.200> check<00:02:18.470> if<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.739> fits<00:02:19.129> to<00:02:19.700> your

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
special then check if it fits to your

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:27.610 
special then check if it fits to your
lens<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:23.500> use<00:02:24.500> kit<00:02:25.220> lens<00:02:25.550> from<00:02:25.940> Canon<00:02:26.209> as<00:02:26.660> 400<00:02:27.349> D

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
lens I use kit lens from Canon as 400 D

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.080 
lens I use kit lens from Canon as 400 D
to<00:02:28.610> check<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:30.519> if<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.580> are<00:02:31.819> shooting

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
to check it if you are shooting

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.199 
to check it if you are shooting
extremely<00:02:32.810> long<00:02:33.440> exposures<00:02:34.280> it's<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.910> good

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
extremely long exposures it's a good

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.470 
extremely long exposures it's a good
idea<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.720> add<00:02:36.319> access<00:02:37.010> which<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.549> prevent<00:02:37.879> your

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
idea to add access which to prevent your

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.580 
idea to add access which to prevent your
nests<00:02:38.690> from<00:02:38.870> overheating

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
nests from overheating

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.880 
nests from overheating
depending<00:02:40.519> on<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.760> weather<00:02:41.030> conditions<00:02:41.890> it's

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
depending on the weather conditions it's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.440 
depending on the weather conditions it's
also<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.220> good<00:02:43.310> idea<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.670> put<00:02:43.970> some<00:02:44.000> cloth

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
also a good idea to put some cloth

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.900 
also a good idea to put some cloth
between<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.930> last<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.380> heater<00:02:45.910> thanks

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
between the last and the heater thanks

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.540 
between the last and the heater thanks
for<00:02:47.060> watching
