for<00:00:14.099> landing<00:00:14.929> you<00:00:15.929> only<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.440> layer<00:00:16.710> with

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
for landing you only have one layer with

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.260 
for landing you only have one layer with
each<00:00:17.010> colony<00:00:17.400> red<00:00:18.170> green<00:00:19.170> white<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:20.520> yellow

so use them only my necessary set the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.160 
so use them only my necessary set the
are<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.470> 28<00:00:26.070> which<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.730> our<00:00:26.880> DHF<00:00:27.359> one<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
are a 28 which is our DHF one to the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.609 
are a 28 which is our DHF one to the
desired<00:00:28.500> channel<00:00:28.970> ours<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.090> there<00:00:30.269> already

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
desired channel ours is there already

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.810 
desired channel ours is there already
and<00:00:31.619> let's<00:00:31.769> perform<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> r22<00:00:33.090> ADF<00:00:33.930> test<00:00:34.820> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and let's perform the r22 ADF test this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.549 
and let's perform the r22 ADF test this
test<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.300> conducted<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.809> two<00:00:36.989> different<00:00:37.200> steps

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
test is conducted in two different steps

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.459 
test is conducted in two different steps
one<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.850> checks<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> ADF<00:00:39.660> compass<00:00:40.110> needle

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
one that checks the ADF compass needle

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.450 
one that checks the ADF compass needle
while<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.190> other<00:00:41.340> checks<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.969> ADF<00:00:42.300> oral<00:00:42.780> tone

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
while the other checks the ADF oral tone

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.130 
while the other checks the ADF oral tone
before<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.760> initiate<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> test<00:00:45.539> let's<00:00:45.989> make

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
before we initiate the test let's make

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.420 
before we initiate the test let's make
sure<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> ADF<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.640> Thomas<00:00:48.059> mode<00:00:49.430> then

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
sure the ADF is in Thomas mode then

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.779 
sure the ADF is in Thomas mode then
press<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> red<00:00:51.030> past<00:00:51.449> button<00:00:52.219> on<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.520> edge<00:00:53.640> of

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
press the red past button on the edge of

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.420 
press the red past button on the edge of
sign<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.570> yellow<00:00:54.780> ADF<00:00:55.350> needle<00:00:55.770> should<00:00:56.129> swing

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
sign the yellow ADF needle should swing

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.840 
sign the yellow ADF needle should swing
to<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> relative<00:00:57.030> bearing<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.510> zero<00:00:57.539> 60<00:00:58.320> degrees

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
to a relative bearing of zero 60 degrees

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.630 
to a relative bearing of zero 60 degrees
yep<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.480> looks<00:01:00.510> good<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.890> let<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> test

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
yep it looks good so let go of the test

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.170 
yep it looks good so let go of the test
