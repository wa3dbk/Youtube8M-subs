though you currently do not drive your
bike<00:01:09.759> that's<00:01:10.210> correct<00:01:10.569> I<00:01:10.810> ride<00:01:11.229> my<00:01:11.259> bike

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
bike that's correct I ride my bike

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.559 
bike that's correct I ride my bike
everywhere<00:01:11.950> I've<00:01:12.249> been<00:01:12.490> biking<00:01:12.729> for<00:01:13.329> about

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
everywhere I've been biking for about

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:16.080 
everywhere I've been biking for about
two<00:01:13.810> years<00:01:14.020> now<00:01:14.200> as<00:01:14.679> my<00:01:14.890> sole<00:01:14.950> means<00:01:15.909> of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
two years now as my sole means of

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.090 
two years now as my sole means of
transportation<00:01:16.569> but<00:01:17.530> I<00:01:17.560> do<00:01:17.649> think<00:01:17.979> that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
transportation but I do think that

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.219 
transportation but I do think that
freedom<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.640> travel<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:19.329> an<00:01:19.630> important<00:01:20.079> issue

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
freedom to travel is an important issue

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.889 
freedom to travel is an important issue
because<00:01:20.649> I<00:01:20.979> feel<00:01:21.249> like<00:01:21.459> travel<00:01:22.329> would<00:01:22.539> happen

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
because I feel like travel would happen

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.230 
because I feel like travel would happen
much<00:01:23.679> differently<00:01:24.159> than<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.520> does<00:01:24.670> today<00:01:24.850> if

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
much differently than it does today if

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.929 
much differently than it does today if
we<00:01:25.420> lived<00:01:25.630> in<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.899> free<00:01:26.109> market<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.700> few

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
we lived in a free market just a few

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.760 
we lived in a free market just a few
examples<00:01:27.969> I<00:01:28.479> think<00:01:28.689> there<00:01:28.840> would<00:01:28.990> be<00:01:29.020> more

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
examples I think there would be more

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.580 
examples I think there would be more
taxi<00:01:30.250> services<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.090> fewer<00:01:31.959> people<00:01:32.319> owning

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
taxi services and fewer people owning

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.130 
taxi services and fewer people owning
cars<00:01:32.890> themselves<00:01:33.219> there<00:01:34.000> would<00:01:34.179> be<00:01:34.209> the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
cars themselves there would be the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.559 
cars themselves there would be the
ability<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.679> carpool<00:01:36.359> there<00:01:37.359> are<00:01:37.450> already

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
ability to carpool there are already

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.959 
ability to carpool there are already
websites<00:01:38.259> where<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.560> can<00:01:38.709> plan<00:01:39.129> trips<00:01:39.489> online

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
websites where you can plan trips online

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.679 
websites where you can plan trips online
so<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.539> can<00:01:40.659> carpool<00:01:41.170> with<00:01:41.229> others<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:42.689> there

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
so you can carpool with others and there

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.130 
so you can carpool with others and there
would<00:01:43.989> be<00:01:44.020> roads<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:45.039> are<00:01:45.189> better<00:01:45.340> designed

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
would be roads that are better designed

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.529 
would be roads that are better designed
to<00:01:47.140> limit<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.369> amount<00:01:48.489> of<00:01:48.729> traffic<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.270> is

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
to limit the amount of traffic that is

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.690 
to limit the amount of traffic that is
going<00:01:50.110> through<00:01:50.379> them<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:51.189> keep<00:01:51.340> people

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
going through them and to keep people

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.760 
going through them and to keep people
moving<00:01:51.879> so<00:01:52.329> that<00:01:52.509> there<00:01:52.659> are<00:01:52.689> fewer<00:01:52.989> stops<00:01:53.349> we

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
moving so that there are fewer stops we

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.459 
moving so that there are fewer stops we
would<00:01:53.920> wear<00:01:54.459> out<00:01:54.670> fewer<00:01:55.030> breaks<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.899> get

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
would wear out fewer breaks and get

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.949 
would wear out fewer breaks and get
better<00:01:56.619> gas<00:01:56.829> mileage<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.700> way<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.899> you

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
better gas mileage that way can you

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.660 
better gas mileage that way can you
think<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.379> solution<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.009> issue<00:02:00.250> that

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
think of a solution to this issue that

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.580 
think of a solution to this issue that
would<00:02:00.819> address<00:02:01.509> both<00:02:01.989> the<00:02:02.049> government's

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
would address both the government's

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.139 
would address both the government's
concerns<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.340> people's<00:02:03.670> concerns

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
concerns and the people's concerns

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.639 
concerns and the people's concerns
you're<00:02:04.629> going<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.840> be<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:04.929> win-win<00:02:05.109> solution

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
you're going to be a win-win solution

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.069 
you're going to be a win-win solution
for<00:02:05.799> both<00:02:05.859> sides<00:02:06.129> well<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.759> win<00:02:07.179> win<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.750> to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
for both sides well the win win is to

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.589 
for both sides well the win win is to
take<00:02:08.410> personal<00:02:08.859> responsibility<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:10.090> your

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
take personal responsibility for your

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.930 
take personal responsibility for your
driving<00:02:11.139> and<00:02:11.380> your<00:02:12.280> your<00:02:12.639> means<00:02:12.819> of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
driving and your your means of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.140 
driving and your your means of
transportation<00:02:13.329> so<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:13.870> own<00:02:14.170> yourself<00:02:14.410> and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
transportation so you own yourself and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.319 
transportation so you own yourself and
so<00:02:16.150> if<00:02:16.359> you<00:02:16.480> own<00:02:16.630> your<00:02:16.870> self<00:02:17.739> then<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.489> can<00:02:19.120> of

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
so if you own your self then you can of

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.620 
so if you own your self then you can of
course<00:02:19.389> own<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.019> property<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:21.370> vehicle<00:02:21.849> and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
course own the property of a vehicle and

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.539 
course own the property of a vehicle and
so<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.380> own<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.769> property<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.370> vehicle

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
so if you own the property of a vehicle

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.970 
so if you own the property of a vehicle
it's<00:02:25.329> just<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.750> means<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.410> you're<00:02:26.620> getting

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
it's just the means that you're getting

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.180 
it's just the means that you're getting
around<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.819> green<00:02:28.060> earth<00:02:28.299> then<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.440> don't<00:02:29.889> see

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
around the green earth then I don't see

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.740 
around the green earth then I don't see
why<00:02:30.400> anyone<00:02:30.730> would<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.389> ask<00:02:31.540> permission

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
why anyone would have to ask permission

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.150 
why anyone would have to ask permission
to<00:02:32.700> travel<00:02:33.700> but<00:02:34.510> with<00:02:35.440> Liberty<00:02:35.919> comes

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.760 
to travel but with Liberty comes
responsibility<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.450> if

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
responsibility so if

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.820 
responsibility so if
traveling<00:02:39.580> be<00:02:40.270> aware<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.600> others<00:02:41.200> around<00:02:41.530> you

all<00:04:03.920> these<00:04:04.069> turning<00:04:04.879> cars<00:04:05.530> well<00:04:06.579> hypocrisy<00:04:07.579> is

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
all these turning cars well hypocrisy is

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.309 
all these turning cars well hypocrisy is
rather<00:04:08.030> than<00:04:08.239> right<00:04:08.569> folks<00:04:08.989> who<00:04:09.140> call

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
rather than right folks who call

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.349 
rather than right folks who call
themselves<00:04:09.439> government<00:04:10.220> but<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.700> don't<00:04:11.269> think

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
themselves government but I don't think

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.059 
themselves government but I don't think
that<00:04:11.569> changes<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:12.079> fact<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:12.409> most<00:04:12.739> people

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
that changes the fact that most people

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.039 
that changes the fact that most people
see<00:04:13.280> them<00:04:13.489> as<00:04:13.639> a<00:04:13.670> protective<00:04:14.209> force<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.840> so

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
see them as a protective force and so

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.319 
see them as a protective force and so
they<00:04:15.349> want<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.100> keep<00:04:16.250> up<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.459> image<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:17.239> you

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
they want to keep up that image and you
