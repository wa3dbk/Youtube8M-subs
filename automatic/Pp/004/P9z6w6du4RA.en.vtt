00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.840
 welcome again a workshop 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.970
 informative the lord orchid birds them 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.620
 I will talk about utricularia care 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.749
 qualifies one of the most circulars 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.749
 Easy to care for useful and cool area 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:16.379
 warm likes a compound substrate at 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:18.179
 one hundred percent of pit bulls and or peat 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.800
 sfax what I do also for 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.050
 increase humidity is the following 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 as we can see in this part of here 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.449
 are beginning to grow the mosses what 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.759
 what I do when preparing this the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.650
 rhythm I put a little mezcal a 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.680
 tap of mezcal for each cubic liter 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.469
 of pitbulls I turn it over I leave it in a 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.050
 fish tank without placing the plants until 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.030
 begin to grow disproportionately 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.550
 fast in it can also be 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 apply the beer method that is 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.420
 when we already established in the pot 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.109
 put a stream of beer with a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.930
 atomizer or we can also place 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.359
 this together with the pine in its preparation 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.710
 a little bit of buttermilk that you can 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.320
 To extract from oaxaca cheese is that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 they are draining of good serum the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.009
 careful to circulate and qualify is very 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
 simple takes care of the same as a 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.670
 rude and that's all 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.689
 we need to put you in the shade 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.430
 a lot of humidity 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.390
 what I recommend if you want this see 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.860
 the holder is already of medium size 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.350
 the leaves are not very big because if we 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 they steal space between more roots plus leaves 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.890
 large but the amount of leaves 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.869
 it is less 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.840
 I recommend having them in a tupper 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.509
 transparent with a little bit taller than the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.970
 same plant with half of the top you are 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.090
 this 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.040
 full of water the circular recasting already 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.410
 rate is very simple we start a 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.720
 leaf a leaf that leaves from that 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.020
 point as grayish it has in the 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.400
 medium 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.920
 thus we will facilitate its rooting and 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.350
 we will place it slightly buried 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.600
 somewhere on the substrate or what 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.330
 we can stop in another way that is 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.140
 directly floating in water and in 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.700
 many times this but stuck to what 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.369
 which is the lateral part of the top 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.890
 and many times they take you out they start 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.690
 take root as you see is floating the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.090
 part of where they should take out the roots 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.890
 in which it is more submerged and by 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.660
 superficial attention is not going to sink and 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.300
 by the weight of a weight difference of 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.430
 of water against the goblet and life 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.989
 particular already qualifies there are different 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.330
 variants among which we can 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.209
 find mainly the flowers 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.489
 of roses with orange and a yellow dot 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.660
 what is this that we have here that is not 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.610
 designed very well for the quality of my 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.230
 camera we also find the orange 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.849
 with yellow that is a bit of a variety 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.519
 bigger and white with yellow 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.799
 depending on the weather will be the size of 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.910
 our warm utricularias is a 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.530
 tricolor that prevents them from 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.709
 they find atizapán de zaragoza so 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.120
 it's not too big because it's a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.510
 plant that likes more moisture more 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.390
 shadow and a little bit of wind and this is 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.700
 a little windy place we see that it is 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.769
 accompanied by a rude song and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.329
 utricularia the mini folk and those 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.549
 little plants that are there is your 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.099
 holder and grammy or folk already since the 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.090
 two can be taken care of in the same way 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.220
 utricularia chalice and fida area of ​​the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.170
 easier utricularias plants 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.300
 look after 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.760
 and to make flowering you just have to 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.620
 take care of her as a rude or accompany her 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.780
 in the flowerpots of the rude ones since not 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.700
 It is a very invasive species with moss 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.130
 live preferably to increase the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.680
 humidity and so we will have a 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.110
 beautiful utricularia flowering between 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.989
 months of its season that is understood 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.700
 center and July until November and 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.310
 depending on our climate will be the size 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.870
 of our circular would rate that is 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.700
 everything on my part I say goodbye I'm your 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.700
 friend the orchid lord see you later
