of like advanced but you'd have to flash
your<00:01:50.670> BIOS<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.299> him<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.600> work<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.229> kind

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
your BIOS for him to work so it's kind

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.620 
your BIOS for him to work so it's kind
of<00:01:52.470> stupid<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.210> anyway<00:01:54.210> you're<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> go

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
of stupid and anyway you're going to go

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.340 
of stupid and anyway you're going to go

right here unlock 650 so it 69 70 and it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.380 
right here unlock 650 so it 69 70 and it
says<00:02:03.469> only<00:02:04.469> work<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> reference<00:02:06.299> design<00:02:08.390> so

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
says only work on a reference design so

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.699 
says only work on a reference design so
if<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.690> great<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> reference

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
if it's great you don't have a reference

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.980 
if it's great you don't have a reference
design<00:02:11.190> you're<00:02:11.849> too<00:02:12.030> late

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
design you're too late

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.440 
design you're too late
or<00:02:13.200> he<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.130> wanted<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.910> car<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.330> could

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
or he just wanted a car you could

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.800 
or he just wanted a car you could
overclock<00:02:16.020> which<00:02:17.000> fair<00:02:18.000> enough<00:02:18.240> there<00:02:18.570> Polly

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
overclock which fair enough there Polly

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.720 
overclock which fair enough there Polly
choir<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.850> reference<00:02:21.210> design<00:02:22.400> 69.50<00:02:23.400> or

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
choir and so a reference design 69.50 or

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.860 
choir and so a reference design 69.50 or
6.50<00:02:24.420> anyway<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.920> has<00:02:27.230> 1408<00:02:28.230> shaders<00:02:29.190> or

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
6.50 anyway and has 1408 shaders or

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.210 
6.50 anyway and has 1408 shaders or
processing<00:02:30.870> cores<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.850> 69<00:02:32.850> 70<00:02:33.360> has<00:02:35.990> 1536

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
processing cores and 69 70 has 1536

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.610 
processing cores and 69 70 has 1536
processing<00:02:38.220> cores<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:40.020> very<00:02:40.140> simple<00:02:40.470> you

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
processing cores so it's very simple you

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860 
processing cores so it's very simple you
need<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.890> do<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.100> click<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:42.000> click<00:02:42.030> save

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
need to do is click this and click save

files and I guess I'll just need mini
with<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.800> there<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.400> I'll<00:02:50.520> just<00:02:50.640> click

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
with this there is so I'll just click

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.140 
with this there is so I'll just click
exit<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:52.130> always<00:02:53.130> comes<00:02:53.430> up<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.930> and

exit and always comes up with this and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.090 
exit and always comes up with this and
we're<00:02:57.150> going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.360> know<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.900> open<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.500> key<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> win

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
we're going to know is open a key I win

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.370 
we're going to know is open a key I win
flash<00:02:59.340> again<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.930> probably<00:03:04.110> guess

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
flash again and you can probably guess

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.910 
flash again and you can probably guess
lower<00:03:05.190> image<00:03:05.460> load<00:03:06.360> your<00:03:06.780> bio<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.650> just

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
lower image load your bio so you just

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.260 
lower image load your bio so you just
saved<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:10.260> one<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.740> then<00:03:11.610> click<00:03:11.790> program

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
saved this one and then click program

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.480 
saved this one and then click program
I'm<00:03:13.260> not<00:03:13.890> going<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.190> do<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.490> because<00:03:16.490> because

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
I'm not going to do that because because

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.630 
I'm not going to do that because because
I've<00:03:17.670> already<00:03:17.850> done<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:20.370> would<00:03:20.460> have

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
I've already done it and it would have

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.250 
I've already done it and it would have
to<00:03:20.880> ask<00:03:21.660> me<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.080> reboot<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:23.690> would<00:03:24.690> not<00:03:24.870> want

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
to ask me to reboot and I would not want

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.420 
to ask me to reboot and I would not want
to<00:03:25.380> do<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:26.810> yeah<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:28.650> pretty<00:03:29.190> much<00:03:29.310> it

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
to do that yeah that's pretty much it

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.840 
to do that yeah that's pretty much it
and<00:03:31.580> if<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:33.540> flash<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.900> with<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> 69<00:03:34.830> 70<00:03:35.250> bios<00:03:35.580> so

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
and if you flash it with a 69 70 bios so

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.370 
and if you flash it with a 69 70 bios so
overclock<00:03:36.420> sit<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.810> that's<00:03:36.930> what's<00:03:37.170> been

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
overclock sit and that's what's been

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.020 
overclock sit and that's what's been
given<00:03:37.560> people<00:03:37.860> issues<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.810> or<00:03:39.810> facts<00:03:40.440> and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
given people issues and or facts and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.210 
given people issues and or facts and
this<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.240> this<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.660> much<00:03:42.900> safer<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.890> do<00:03:44.010> and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
this is this is much safer to do and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.610 
this is this is much safer to do and
this<00:03:44.640> bits<00:03:45.030> still<00:03:45.540> unlocking<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.470> do

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
this bits still unlocking it and you do

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.970 
this bits still unlocking it and you do
get<00:03:46.800> it<00:03:47.060> for<00:03:48.060> example<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.900> then<00:03:49.380> crisis<00:03:49.800> you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
get it for example and then crisis you

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.200 
get it for example and then crisis you
get<00:03:50.160> Crysis<00:03:50.940> 2<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.240> get<00:03:51.480> 10<00:03:51.810> frames<00:03:52.200> more<00:03:52.560> in

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
get Crysis 2 you get 10 frames more in

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.880 
get Crysis 2 you get 10 frames more in
max<00:03:54.210> settings<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.920> that's<00:03:56.660> that's<00:03:57.710> quite<00:03:58.710> an

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
max settings so that's that's quite an

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.230 
max settings so that's that's quite an
increase<00:03:59.250> I'm<00:03:59.550> going<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.760> say<00:03:59.880> um<00:04:00.350> so<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:02.240> can't

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
increase I'm going to say um so I can't

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.810 
increase I'm going to say um so I can't
really<00:04:03.780> do<00:04:03.990> much<00:04:04.350> I've<00:04:04.830> tried<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> few<00:04:05.760> things
