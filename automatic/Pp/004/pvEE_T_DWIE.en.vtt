tutorial we're going to be adding the
crafting<00:00:10.349> recipes<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.460> if<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.670> didn't<00:00:11.820> watch

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
crafting recipes so if you didn't watch

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.669 
crafting recipes so if you didn't watch
the<00:00:12.030> first<00:00:12.240> part<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.660> added<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.110> all<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> tools

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the first part we added in all the tools

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
the first part we added in all the tools
into<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> game<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:15.000> tested<00:00:15.450> them<00:00:15.570> out

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
into the game and we tested them out

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.390 
into the game and we tested them out
we're<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.740> adding<00:00:16.949> crafting

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
we're going to be adding crafting

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.980 
we're going to be adding crafting
recipes<00:00:17.789> into<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> game<00:00:18.420> now<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.869> thought

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
recipes into the game now and I thought

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.140 
recipes into the game now and I thought
I<00:00:19.050> would<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.439> cover<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.670> video<00:00:20.820> just

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
I would just cover this in a video just

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.820 
I would just cover this in a video just
because<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.570> might<00:00:21.689> guys<00:00:21.960> might<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.380> confused

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
because you might guys might be confused

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.410 
because you might guys might be confused
but<00:00:23.430> if<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.670> already<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.210> good

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
but if you already got a good

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
but if you already got a good
understanding<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:25.199> how<00:00:25.289> crafting<00:00:25.890> recipes

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
understanding of how crafting recipes

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.120 
understanding of how crafting recipes
work<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.300> should<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:28.109> already<00:00:28.380> done

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
work and you should have already done

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.519 
work and you should have already done
this<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:30.060> yeah<00:00:30.210> we're<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.510> go<00:00:30.720> add<00:00:31.019> some

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this but yeah we're going to go add some

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.049 
this but yeah we're going to go add some
crafting<00:00:31.920> recipe<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> initialization

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
crafting recipe so in the initialization

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.690 
crafting recipe so in the initialization
method<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:33.930> gameregistry<00:00:36.469> dot<00:00:37.469> add<00:00:37.710> recipe

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
method right gameregistry dot add recipe

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.360 
method right gameregistry dot add recipe
then<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> app<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.200> item<00:00:40.500> stack<00:00:40.710> output<00:00:41.219> is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
then the app the item stack output is

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.470 
then the app the item stack output is
new<00:00:41.790> item<00:00:42.780> stack<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:44.309> inside<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.149> item

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
new item stack then inside the item

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
new item stack then inside the item
stack<00:00:45.719> brackets<00:00:46.110> they're<00:00:46.379> copy<00:00:47.340> your

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
stack brackets they're copy your

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.970 
stack brackets they're copy your
variable<00:00:48.180> put<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.870> inside<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> brackets<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
variable put it inside the brackets and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670 
variable put it inside the brackets and
then<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> params<00:00:51.539> we're<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> type

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
then for the params we're going to type

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.600 
then for the params we're going to type
new<00:00:53.149> object<00:00:54.289> square<00:00:55.289> brackets<00:00:55.770> open<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
new object square brackets open and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.910 
new object square brackets open and
close<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.329> squiggly<00:00:57.840> brackets<00:00:58.260> put

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
close it and then squiggly brackets put

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.450 
close it and then squiggly brackets put
a<00:00:58.949> semicolon<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> end<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:01.320> inside<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
a semicolon on the end and inside the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
a semicolon on the end and inside the
squiggly<00:01:03.059> brackets<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.750> want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> type<00:01:04.229> in

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
squiggly brackets we want to type in

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.980 
squiggly brackets we want to type in
three<00:01:04.680> quotation<00:01:05.309> marks<00:01:05.610> separate<00:01:06.000> separated

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
three quotation marks separate separated

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.060 
three quotation marks separate separated
by<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> comma<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:12.590> then<00:01:13.590> we're<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> put

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
by a comma and then we're going to put

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.429 
by a comma and then we're going to put
them<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.430> two<00:01:14.640> new<00:01:14.820> lines<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.659> directly

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
them on two new lines so that directly

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.830 
them on two new lines so that directly
under<00:01:16.770> each<00:01:16.920> other<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.369> space<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.630> not

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
under each other so just space it not

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.990 
under each other so just space it not
tab<00:01:19.110> now<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.860> quickly<00:01:20.009> edit<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> item

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
tab now I just quickly edit the item

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.760 
tab now I just quickly edit the item
cheese<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> food<00:01:22.049> tutorial<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
cheese from the food tutorial just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
cheese from the food tutorial just
because<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.580> bit<00:01:23.820> want<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> be

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
because I want that bit want that to be

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.730 
because I want that bit want that to be
the<00:01:25.170> material<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:26.250> craft<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:28.020> tool

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the material to actually craft the tool

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.609 
the material to actually craft the tool
so<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.369> back<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.939> our

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
so I'm going to go back down to our

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.859 
so I'm going to go back down to our
recipe<00:01:31.619> down<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.720> we're<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.750> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
recipe down here and we're going to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.600 
recipe down here and we're going to
first<00:01:34.049> start<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> pickaxe<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
first start with the pickaxe so if you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.580 
first start with the pickaxe so if you
guys<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> pickaxe<00:01:36.420> shape<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
guys know a pickaxe shape it's like a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.510 
guys know a pickaxe shape it's like a
t-shape<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.540> top<00:01:39.750> bit<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.770> material

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
t-shape so the top bit is the material

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.850 
t-shape so the top bit is the material
and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.390> support<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and then like the the support bit is the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
and then like the the support bit is the
sticks<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.970> we're<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.450> exactly<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
sticks so we're going to do exactly that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.310 
sticks so we're going to do exactly that
so<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> goes<00:01:47.060> we're<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> put<00:01:48.390> cheese<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
so it goes we're going to put cheese in

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.190 
so it goes we're going to put cheese in
there<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.860> our<00:01:50.040> material<00:01:50.600> cccc<00:01:51.600> doesn't<00:01:52.049> have

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
there for our material cccc doesn't have

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.530 
there for our material cccc doesn't have
to<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.409> CCC<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.790> any<00:01:54.000> character<00:01:54.450> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
to be CCC it can be any character that

that's<00:06:28.740> how<00:06:28.860> you<00:06:28.920> add<00:06:28.950> the<00:06:29.190> crafting<00:06:29.610> recipes

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
that's how you add the crafting recipes

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.380 
that's how you add the crafting recipes
for<00:06:30.690> your<00:06:30.810> tools<00:06:31.140> I<00:06:31.470> and<00:06:32.070> quick<00:06:32.310> Nick<00:06:32.490> I<00:06:32.730> want

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
for your tools I and quick Nick I want

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.850 
for your tools I and quick Nick I want
to<00:06:33.450> show<00:06:33.570> you<00:06:33.630> what<00:06:33.810> that<00:06:33.840> meant<00:06:34.170> when<00:06:34.800> I

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
to show you what that meant when I

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.110 
to show you what that meant when I
removed<00:06:35.310> these<00:06:35.520> spaces<00:06:35.910> see<00:06:36.390> and<00:06:37.700> if<00:06:38.700> you

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
removed these spaces see and if you

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.500 
removed these spaces see and if you
think<00:06:39.390> about<00:06:39.660> it<00:06:39.900> why<00:06:40.890> can't<00:06:41.100> I<00:06:41.370> move<00:06:41.640> this<00:06:42.270> I

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
think about it why can't I move this I

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.420 
think about it why can't I move this I
why<00:06:42.720> can't<00:06:42.960> a<00:06:43.020> nudge<00:06:43.230> this<00:06:43.500> to<00:06:43.770> the<00:06:43.890> right<00:06:44.130> one

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
why can't a nudge this to the right one

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.720 
why can't a nudge this to the right one
one<00:06:45.120> time<00:06:45.900> it<00:06:46.140> still<00:06:46.620> should<00:06:46.890> create<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.370> same

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
one time it still should create the same

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.700 
one time it still should create the same
recipe<00:06:48.660> and<00:06:48.870> that's<00:06:48.930> why<00:06:49.140> I<00:06:49.170> kind<00:06:49.410> of<00:06:49.530> got<00:06:49.650> rid

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
recipe and that's why I kind of got rid

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.950 
recipe and that's why I kind of got rid
of<00:06:49.830> the<00:06:49.890> spaces<00:06:50.100> so<00:06:50.370> we<00:06:50.520> can<00:06:50.820> actually<00:06:51.390> go<00:06:51.780> over

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
of the spaces so we can actually go over

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.270 
of the spaces so we can actually go over
there<00:06:52.140> like<00:06:52.290> that<00:06:52.350> and<00:06:52.710> put<00:06:53.370> it<00:06:53.460> in<00:06:55.250> same<00:06:56.250> a

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
there like that and put it in same a

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.880 
there like that and put it in same a
place<00:06:56.580> for<00:06:56.880> the<00:06:57.000> sword<00:06:57.300> as<00:06:57.510> well<00:06:57.540> and<00:06:57.960> you<00:06:58.770> can

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
place for the sword as well and you can

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.220 
place for the sword as well and you can
put<00:06:59.070> it<00:06:59.160> in<00:06:59.250> any<00:06:59.430> line<00:06:59.760> or<00:07:00.510> any<00:07:00.690> column<00:07:01.110> that

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
put it in any line or any column that

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.710 
put it in any line or any column that
you<00:07:01.290> want<00:07:01.380> too<00:07:01.710> so<00:07:02.700> hopefully<00:07:02.940> enjoyed<00:07:03.570> this

supporting it and I'll see you for the
next<00:07:11.640> tutorial<00:07:11.820> we're<00:07:12.330> probably<00:07:12.690> going<00:07:12.930> to<00:07:13.200> go

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 
next tutorial we're probably going to go

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.160 
next tutorial we're probably going to go
over<00:07:14.010> adding<00:07:14.400> ores<00:07:15.150> into<00:07:15.690> the<00:07:15.780> game<00:07:15.990> because

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.170 
over adding ores into the game because

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.050 
over adding ores into the game because
you<00:07:16.500> guys<00:07:16.650> probably<00:07:16.920> want<00:07:17.190> to<00:07:17.280> be<00:07:17.880> able<00:07:17.970> to

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
you guys probably want to be able to

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.960 
you guys probably want to be able to
create<00:07:18.270> ores<00:07:18.540> to<00:07:18.960> mine<00:07:19.200> and<00:07:19.700> actually<00:07:20.700> use

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
create ores to mine and actually use

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.990 
create ores to mine and actually use
these<00:07:21.180> ores<00:07:21.680> smelt<00:07:22.680> them<00:07:22.950> and<00:07:23.190> then<00:07:23.670> create

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
these ores smelt them and then create

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.640 
these ores smelt them and then create
them<00:07:24.180> into<00:07:24.480> these<00:07:24.600> tools<00:07:24.960> here<00:07:25.320> so<00:07:25.530> we're

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
them into these tools here so we're

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.680 
them into these tools here so we're
going<00:07:25.740> to<00:07:25.830> try<00:07:26.010> and<00:07:26.070> implement<00:07:26.370> that<00:07:26.760> in<00:07:27.360> a<00:07:27.540> way

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.690 
going to try and implement that in a way

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.730 
going to try and implement that in a way
so<00:07:27.750> we're<00:07:27.960> going<00:07:28.050> to<00:07:28.140> probably<00:07:28.320> create<00:07:28.560> a

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
so we're going to probably create a

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.130 
so we're going to probably create a
cheese<00:07:29.100> or<00:07:29.490> so<00:07:30.480> see<00:07:30.690> you<00:07:30.750> guys<00:07:30.870> for<00:07:30.990> the<00:07:31.110> next

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.140 
cheese or so see you guys for the next

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.130 
cheese or so see you guys for the next
tutorial<00:07:31.950> bye
