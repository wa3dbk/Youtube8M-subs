 To offer oneself also is no problem 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.270
 That's why we're doing a little today 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.670

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.770

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.110

 everyone under the video posted that there 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.409
 two days time as always I can unfortunately 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.000
 I will not say endless time 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.619
 slap that someone after two 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.750
 months, eu I still have huber 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.610
 from here must always get because of that 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.369
 A deadline then people should be 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.920
 stop reporting faster is me right 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.479
 then I'll say the whole thing 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.950
 done but today it is about 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.979
 I also like other pokémon 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.810
 will give away today and not 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.720
 once that would see now how 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.989
 often I'll give it away 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.000
 and there isses in a shiny variant and 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:03.369
 it's level 1 it's an event pokemon 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 and yes I can unfortunately now 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.319
 Do not do much but you can do it 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.970
 do a lot because it 's level 1 it has 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.340
 a lot of potential you can do with it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.900
 Do whatever you want if you like the attacks 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.390
 want to maintain or stop something 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.230
 make it more beautiful out of you is 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.569
 leave 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.489
 I will give away the good things respectively 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.640
 not just once but let's have a look 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.930
 the same time in the pokémon center as I often do 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.330
 the lottery will be 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.180
 and then we have a short easy time 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.760
 But this time around, good times 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.810
 to see what's going on here so well 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.519
 sometimes as my beautiful attack it is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.040
 In any case, I say a lot 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.650
 nice pokémon 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.069
 which I definitely recommend everyone 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.250
 can 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.870
 It is also justified because it can too 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.239
 make good damage in any case 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.489
 I just want to pack a few 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.510
 we'll show you how it works 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.069
 show a demo 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.069
 hopefully will not take directly 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.189
 and then again that we are global 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:12.420
 action people a bit at this 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:16.420
 good fairy I am very nice exactly clear 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.819
 very nice and now is the time for 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.019
 global action and you can do that now 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.379
 a little bit, let's say that I hurt someday 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.609
 also doing so is already good 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.709
 the good thing though one thing 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.049
 There is a difference here in the whole of Europe 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.659
 and almost there and almost down so once 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.609
 blogger and on the bass a very brave 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.909
 Of course, Pokemon is natural 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.389
 also perfect perfect values ​​and me 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.669
 believe ev must usually only values ​​one must 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.159
 clear distribute is clearly level 1 though 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.939
 otherwise it's perfect perfect 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.359
 bauwerte 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:51.069
 that means you can not immediately 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.760
 you're off to a good start right now, I say 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:04:00.699
 So I'll go down for a while 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.669
 pokémon center which course down here 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:06.819
 colleague zac is having a debate with you 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:11.199
 so pokémon i do not mind now 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.000

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.199
 just a little bit upwards 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.760
 fly there already fits 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.139
 what do i have to do for that at all 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.659
 Gewinnspiel come right now to the 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.000
 the topic of the last competition had changed 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.870
 Video thus share the requirements 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.510
 to participate here at all are easy 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.270
 Going for it actually requires nothing at all 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.599
 but first we go into the box 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.490
 and watch pokemon all the time 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:40.570
