than or equal to R is less than 3 this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.560 
than or equal to R is less than 3 this
implies<00:02:03.650> R<00:02:04.280> takes<00:02:04.760> values<00:02:05.330> 0<00:02:06.110> 1<00:02:07.010> &amp;<00:02:07.479> 2<00:02:10.570> therefore

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
implies R takes values 0 1 &amp; 2 therefore

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.830 
implies R takes values 0 1 &amp; 2 therefore
let<00:02:12.260> us<00:02:12.290> first<00:02:12.770> take<00:02:14.440> R<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.860> equal<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.250> 0<00:02:16.840> this

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
let us first take R is equal to 0 this

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.150 
let us first take R is equal to 0 this
implies<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.980> equal<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.660> 3q<00:02:20.660> plus<00:02:20.959> 0<00:02:21.440> which<00:02:22.010> is

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
implies a is equal to 3q plus 0 which is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.210 
implies a is equal to 3q plus 0 which is
equal<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.640> 3<00:02:22.880> cube

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
equal to 3 cube

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:36.420 
equal to 3 cube
now<00:02:26.020> let<00:02:27.020> us<00:02:28.390> square<00:02:29.390> on<00:02:29.630> both<00:02:29.660> sides

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.150 

therefore<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.610> square<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.180> equal<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.720> 3<00:02:39.500> Q<00:02:39.800> whole

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
therefore a square is equal to 3 Q whole

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.140 
therefore a square is equal to 3 Q whole
square<00:02:40.750> which<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.780> 9<00:02:42.560> Q<00:02:43.010> square<00:02:45.070> if<00:02:46.070> 9<00:02:46.520> Q<00:02:46.850> square

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
square which is 9 Q square if 9 Q square

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.500 
square which is 9 Q square if 9 Q square
can<00:02:47.390> be<00:02:47.420> written<00:02:47.660> as<00:02:47.900> 3<00:02:48.410> times<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:49.120> 3q<00:02:50.120> square

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
can be written as 3 times of 3q square

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.820 
can be written as 3 times of 3q square
so<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:51.920> form<00:02:52.070> 3<00:02:52.700> m<00:02:53.500> where<00:02:54.500> m<00:02:54.530> is

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
so this is of the form 3 m where m is

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:05.500 
so this is of the form 3 m where m is
equal<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.580> 3<00:02:55.910> Q<00:02:56.180> Square<00:03:00.310> now<00:03:01.630> let<00:03:02.630> us<00:03:02.660> take<00:03:04.150> R<00:03:05.150> is

equal to 3 Q Square now let us take R is

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.320 
equal to 3 Q Square now let us take R is
equal<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.019> 1<00:03:07.090> therefore<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.360> is<00:03:08.720> equal<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:10.030> 3<00:03:11.030> Q

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
equal to 1 therefore a is equal to 3 Q

equal to 1 therefore a is equal to 3 Q
plus<00:03:11.810> 1<00:03:15.010> now<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> square<00:03:16.730> on<00:03:16.940> both<00:03:16.970> sides

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.000 

we<00:03:21.320> have<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.560> square<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.730> equal<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.540> 3<00:03:24.440> Q<00:03:24.680> plus<00:03:24.980> 1

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
we have a square is equal to 3 Q plus 1

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.860 
we have a square is equal to 3 Q plus 1
whole<00:03:25.489> Square<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:28.280> implies<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:29.030> square<00:03:29.720> is

remaining with 3 times 3 Q square plus 2
Q<00:04:21.449> plus<00:04:22.449> 1<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.770> this<00:04:24.070> is<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.580> form<00:04:28.979> 3<00:04:29.979> m<00:04:30.220> plus

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
Q plus 1 so this is of the form 3 m plus

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.750 
Q plus 1 so this is of the form 3 m plus
1<00:04:31.260> where<00:04:32.260> m<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:33.760> equal<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:34.210> 3<00:04:34.690> Q<00:04:34.960> square<00:04:35.400> plus<00:04:36.400> 2

Q<00:04:38.699> now<00:04:39.699> let<00:04:40.030> us<00:04:40.060> take<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.660> value<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.199> r<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.880> is

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
Q now let us take the value of r that is

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.000 
Q now let us take the value of r that is
2<00:04:43.949> so<00:04:44.949> we<00:04:44.979> have<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.580> is<00:04:45.850> equal<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.979> 3<00:04:47.979> Q<00:04:48.250> plus<00:04:48.520> 2

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
2 so we have a is equal to 3 Q plus 2

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:59.730 
2 so we have a is equal to 3 Q plus 2
squaring<00:04:51.010> on<00:04:51.190> both<00:04:51.460> sides<00:04:57.810> we<00:04:58.810> have<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:59.260> square

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
squaring on both sides we have a square

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.450 
squaring on both sides we have a square
