00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.769
 angela hewitt make a quality jump 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:11.099
 to be able to win a title and on 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.099
 all good 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.210
 but I liked I liked 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.270
 much with the premier from Spain I saw 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.610
 always all parties and I liked 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.380
 a lot of watching him play do not have a way of 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.960
 play a style very similar to many 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.399
 Spanish teams and 7 attracts me a lot 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.460
 see them because because I think it's a 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:35.809
 very nice football for the viewer 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.660
 dt queen all this speaks wonders of 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.809
 the land that I would enjoy a lot and 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.649
 good bad that I'm very happy 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:49.220
 be here and it's for the best and it's clear 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.449
 it is necessary is also everything easier 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.710
 It is clear that I am a player who 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.110
 I really like to be in contact with the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.640
 ball not how much more ball since I 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.339
 I think as you know more comfortable I feel 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.110
 more with confidence I'm in this team 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.239
 at home, I do not know it's a team 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.469
 who always has control of the game 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.239
 that has a lot of that position 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.030
 ball and where I want to be important 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.410
 there I do not want to be a bit in that 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.360
 line between midfield and forward and 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.460
 a little bit of that freedom that you give me and I 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.780
 above all I will try that in all the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.490
 effort that they have made for me to be 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.770
 here then rewarded inside the field 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.950
 with conte make it a little because 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.929
 provide those last two parts of the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.310
 field a bit is last pack will be 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.310
 try to help the team with google 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.300
 I'm in prison already, and then 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.890
 that's why I think I've scored more goals 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.330
 why but not but I hope this 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 year can above all bring work 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.920
 to help the team and and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 iniesta 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.909
 and he has said it is not clear that the day of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.799
 today 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.220
 and I always only have devotion for AndrÃ© 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.470
 iniesta 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.650
 of what I read messi is today the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.420
 world player 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.170
 I've always liked a lot 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.640
 tour is not an elegance 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.110
 I've been lucky to play against him and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 he also looked like players 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.120
 different from what I've seen before 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.880
 the feeling is that we have all have 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.560
 been good where the team has made a 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.640
 good match to take control of the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.770
 ball that is what I know that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.020
 requires here and well then we want to be 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.340
 the improved because the time then has 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.790
 much room for improvement we are at 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.790
 beginning 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.480
 does not exist 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.489
 because any lack of throw-in 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.310
 they create danger because because 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.810
 it's practically corner and showing us 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.030
 and it's going to be an equal match 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.670
 a little different than usual because 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.650
 they are a team that bases its full potential 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.109
 in the Aryan game they have players like 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.700
 peter klaus as very tall that the best 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.819
 that you can be dangerous and you have to 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.670
 be very attentive by putting 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.810
 the match can be complicated 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.810
 let's see, I want
