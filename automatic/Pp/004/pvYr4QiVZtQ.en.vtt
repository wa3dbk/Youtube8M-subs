stuff<00:01:27.810> I'm<00:01:27.990> seeing<00:01:28.290> fully<00:01:28.590> wired<00:01:28.920> engines<00:01:29.400> I'm

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
stuff I'm seeing fully wired engines I'm

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.730 
stuff I'm seeing fully wired engines I'm
seeing<00:01:30.030> hydraulic<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.930> electrical<00:01:31.320> cables

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
seeing hydraulic and electrical cables

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.490 
seeing hydraulic and electrical cables
this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.610> hand<00:01:32.909> fabricated<00:01:33.000> scope<00:01:33.810> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
this is all hand fabricated scope it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
this is all hand fabricated scope it's
amazing<00:01:35.180> aluminum<00:01:36.180> work<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.540> well<00:01:36.689> I've<00:01:36.840> got<00:01:36.900> a

of the other ones they're basically what

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.200 
of the other ones they're basically what
I<00:01:52.590> call<00:01:52.829> cheater<00:01:53.250> cars<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> some<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I call cheater cars and some of the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.790 
I call cheater cars and some of the
larger<00:01:54.659> conventions<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.710> in

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
larger conventions they have in

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.430 
larger conventions they have in
and<00:01:56.920> on<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.370> East<00:01:57.550> Coast<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.930> a<00:01:59.170> mild

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
and on the East Coast they have a mild

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.670 
and on the East Coast they have a mild
category<00:01:59.980> so<00:02:00.370> what<00:02:00.550> I've<00:02:00.640> done<00:02:00.670> has<00:02:01.620> sort<00:02:02.620> of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
category so what I've done has sort of

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.610 
category so what I've done has sort of
bent<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.890> rules<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.220> little<00:02:03.250> bit<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.940> speak

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
bent the rules a little bit so to speak

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.500 
bent the rules a little bit so to speak
they<00:02:05.620> have<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.800> mild<00:02:06.280> category<00:02:06.790> which<00:02:07.030> consists

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
they have a mild category which consists

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.810 
they have a mild category which consists
of<00:02:07.660> no<00:02:07.930> body<00:02:08.200> modifications<00:02:09.040> whatsoever<00:02:09.280> just

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
of no body modifications whatsoever just

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.050 
of no body modifications whatsoever just
straight<00:02:10.330> paint<00:02:10.600> job<00:02:10.810> basically<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.550> body<00:02:12.790> on

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
straight paint job basically the body on

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.210 
straight paint job basically the body on
these<00:02:13.270> cars<00:02:13.570> has<00:02:13.840> not<00:02:14.170> been<00:02:14.410> altered<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:15.040> any

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
these cars has not been altered in any

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.790 
these cars has not been altered in any
way<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:16.600> only<00:02:16.780> thing<00:02:16.930> that's<00:02:17.140> been<00:02:17.410> done<00:02:17.560> is

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
way the only thing that's been done is

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.190 
way the only thing that's been done is
the<00:02:17.980> chassis<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.390> what's<00:02:19.720> what<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:19.960> call<00:02:20.170> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the chassis so what's what I call a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.870 
the chassis so what's what I call a
cheater<00:02:20.500> car<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:20.980> they<00:02:21.250> didn't<00:02:21.460> like<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.640> but

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
cheater car so they didn't like it but

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.430 
cheater car so they didn't like it but
invent<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> rules<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.780> bit<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.380> an

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
invent the rules and a bit of an

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.870 
invent the rules and a bit of an
eye-opener<00:02:23.590> for<00:02:23.980> some<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.370> organizers

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
eye-opener for some of the organizers

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.110 
eye-opener for some of the organizers
but<00:02:25.780> no<00:02:26.320> body<00:02:26.560> modifications<00:02:27.280> whatsoever<00:02:27.490> so

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
but no body modifications whatsoever so

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.730 
but no body modifications whatsoever so
it's<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.360> strictly<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.840> paint<00:02:29.140> if<00:02:29.410> you've<00:02:29.590> done

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
it's a strictly a paint if you've done

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.500 
it's a strictly a paint if you've done
custom<00:02:30.280> painting<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> custom<00:02:31.030> graphics<00:02:31.360> on

and<00:02:39.250> chassis<00:02:39.810> underpinnings<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:41.260> piece

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
and chassis underpinnings this piece

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.410 
and chassis underpinnings this piece
looks<00:02:41.830> like<00:02:42.100> something<00:02:42.520> from<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.790> whole<00:02:43.090> nother
