00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
then we have a guy here now if it was

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.040 
then we have a guy here now if it was
drawn<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> scale<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.510> guy's<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.809> almost

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
drawn to scale this guy's like almost

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.720 
drawn to scale this guy's like almost
halfway<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.530> tall<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> tree<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.489> he'd<00:01:02.640> be

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
halfway as tall as the tree so he'd be

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.210 
halfway as tall as the tree so he'd be
like<00:01:02.879> fifteen<00:01:03.359> feet<00:01:03.690> tall<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.530> didn't<00:01:05.070> draw

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
it to scale because I'm lazy but let's
say<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.549> dude<00:01:08.790> cast<00:01:09.240> his<00:01:09.450> shadow

on the tree or how long's the shadow on

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
on the tree or how long's the shadow on
the<00:01:24.240> dude<00:01:24.450> alright<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.740> set<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.130> up

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the dude alright so you just set it up

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.840 
the dude alright so you just set it up
you<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.990> there's<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.680> cast<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.100> shadow<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.610> six

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
you go there's they cast a shadow of six

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.399 
you go there's they cast a shadow of six
feet<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.240> we're<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> put<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> shadow<00:01:31.200> on

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
feet so we're going to put the shadow on

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.740 
feet so we're going to put the shadow on
top<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.860> both<00:01:31.890> sides<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.270> we're<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
top on both sides of the we're going to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.690 
top on both sides of the we're going to
make<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> proportion<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
make a proportion and on we're going to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.990 
make a proportion and on we're going to
put<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.619> shadow<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.770> top<00:01:37.950> over<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.700> foot

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
put the shadow on top over here one foot

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.950 
put the shadow on top over here one foot
and<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> both<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> shadows<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.509> top<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and so both the shadows are on top the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.600 
and so both the shadows are on top the
six-foot<00:01:43.439> tree<00:01:43.619> shadow<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.369> foot

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
six-foot tree shadow and the one foot

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
six-foot tree shadow and the one foot
dude<00:01:44.880> shadow<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> tree<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
dude shadow and then the tree is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.200 
dude shadow and then the tree is
actually<00:01:46.829> thirty<00:01:47.340> feet<00:01:47.490> tall<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.000> I'll<00:01:48.090> put

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
actually thirty feet tall so I'll put

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.960 
actually thirty feet tall so I'll put
that<00:01:48.240> over<00:01:48.479> thirty<00:01:49.430> but<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.520> don't<00:01:50.729> know<00:01:50.850> how

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that over thirty but we don't know how

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.130 
that over thirty but we don't know how
tall<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.329> dude<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:52.049> we're

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
tall the dude is and that's what we're

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.389 
tall the dude is and that's what we're
trying<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> find<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.040> I'll<00:01:53.130> put<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.340> in

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
trying to find out so I'll put that in

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.700 
trying to find out so I'll put that in
as<00:01:53.610> X<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.930> simply<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.439> cross

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
as X and then we simply just cross

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.429 
as X and then we simply just cross
multiply<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:57.060> 6<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.600> X<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:58.259> cross

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
multiply the 6 and the X we cross

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.780 
multiply the 6 and the X we cross
multiply<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:59.630> and<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:01.189> multiply<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.250> 30<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
multiply that and we multiply the 30 and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.490 
multiply that and we multiply the 30 and
the<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.439> six<00:02:04.860> x<00:02:06.740> equals<00:02:07.740> 30<00:02:09.500> divide

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the one so it's six x equals 30 divide

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.230 
the one so it's six x equals 30 divide
both<00:02:10.649> sides<00:02:10.920> by<00:02:11.039> six<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:11.700> X<00:02:11.849> by<00:02:12.030> itself

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
both sides by six to get X by itself

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.290 
both sides by six to get X by itself
and<00:02:13.330> X<00:02:13.950> equals<00:02:14.950> 5<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.840> dude<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:18.090> 5<00:02:19.090> feet

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
and X equals 5 so the dude is 5 feet

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:31.770 
and X equals 5 so the dude is 5 feet
tall<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.850> dude<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:26.280> 5<00:02:27.900> feet<00:02:28.900> tall<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:31.600> is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
tall the dude is 5 feet tall and that is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.280 
tall the dude is 5 feet tall and that is
how<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.930> solve<00:02:32.260> dude<00:02:32.950> tree<00:02:33.700> problems<00:02:34.600> whether

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
how you solve dude tree problems whether

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.570 
how you solve dude tree problems whether
they<00:02:35.380> give<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:35.860> one<00:02:36.100> or<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.310> one<00:02:36.370> or

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
they give you this one or this one or

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.070 
they give you this one or this one or
that<00:02:36.700> one<00:02:36.820> or<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.150> one<00:02:37.210> you<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.630> create<00:02:38.020> a

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
that one or that one you just create a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.230 
that one or that one you just create a
proportion<00:02:38.620> with<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.950> shadows<00:02:39.370> or<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
proportion with the shadows or that the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.640 
proportion with the shadows or that the
shadows<00:02:40.600> on<00:02:40.750> top<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.020> can<00:02:41.140> do<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.290> people<00:02:41.560> on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
shadows on top you can do the people on

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.680 
shadows on top you can do the people on
top<00:02:41.830> -<00:02:42.070> as<00:02:42.310> long<00:02:42.460> as<00:02:42.580> it's<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.270> long<00:02:43.390> as<00:02:43.480> it's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
top - as long as it's as long as it's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.750 
top - as long as it's as long as it's
consistent<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.430> how<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.580> solve

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
consistent and that is how you solve

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.660 
consistent and that is how you solve
those<00:02:45.970> kinds<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.300> problems
