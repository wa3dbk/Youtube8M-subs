 Everybody is happy You are flying once I took part 2 but there is a game pc on the next day 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.030
 There is a problem that white smoke is raised and broken 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 It became about 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.980

 Ne this is good 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:40.840
 It looks like we can do a lot of bad things 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:47.690
 I feel that one more new one was caught 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:53.840

 It 's right here , though 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.080
 Do you want to find a fishing spot 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.580
 On top of this kind of bridge to suddenly think whether I

 You child 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.980

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.200
 Someday- another school's human oil country 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.830
 Lara Fell fishing seems to go to the king 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.370
 It is an assumption 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.370
 Uh, oh, oh, if you think it's too bad you'll be very angry at Fell's person 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.670
 There This I over 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.600

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.740
 Still like to be together 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.180
 It's naturally because the difference of the above or below If you think well well I'm so 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.180
 This is the cherry tree that I just noticed 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.060
