00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
these had to go and so that led me to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.990 
these had to go and so that led me to
these<00:01:38.579> these<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.570> LG<00:01:40.049> tone<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.579> gotta

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
these these the the LG tone and I gotta

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.090 
these these the the LG tone and I gotta
say<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.329> great<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> negatives

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
say it's great now one of the negatives

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120 
say it's great now one of the negatives
but<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.520> doesn't<00:01:44.820> affect<00:01:45.090> me<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:46.649> probably

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
but it doesn't affect me is you probably

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.460 
but it doesn't affect me is you probably
if<00:01:47.520> you're<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> runner<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.570> jogger<00:01:48.990> this

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
if you're a runner or a jogger this

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.889 
if you're a runner or a jogger this
would<00:01:49.680> probably<00:01:49.860> flap<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.060> you're<00:01:51.329> running<00:01:51.689> or

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
would probably flap as you're running or

this works great and I just love how I
can<00:02:10.660> just<00:02:11.020> have<00:02:11.200> one<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.890> my<00:02:12.130> ear<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.760> know

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910

what it's pretty darn comfortable now it

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.199 
what it's pretty darn comfortable now it
might<00:02:16.480> look<00:02:16.780> weird<00:02:16.840> because<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.739> have<00:02:17.920> this

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
might look weird because you have this

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.600 
might look weird because you have this
cord<00:02:19.209> flapping<00:02:19.840> out<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.560> if<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.890> have<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:21.310> I

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
cord flapping out and if I have this I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.420 
cord flapping out and if I have this I
have<00:02:22.000> another<00:02:22.599> cord<00:02:22.989> flapping<00:02:23.440> out<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:23.980> I'm

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
have another cord flapping out but I'm

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.680 
have another cord flapping out but I'm
not<00:02:24.489> necessarily<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.900> concerned<00:02:26.410> with<00:02:26.739> that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
not necessarily so concerned with that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.040 
not necessarily so concerned with that
how<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.720> look<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:30.160> regards<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.790> some<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.930> know

some headphones on so anyways and then

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.750 
some headphones on so anyways and then
it<00:02:34.660> has<00:02:34.810> like<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.989> magnet<00:02:35.739> on<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.099> ends<00:02:36.519> there

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
it has like a magnet on the ends there

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.240 
it has like a magnet on the ends there
that<00:02:37.000> just<00:02:37.209> snaps<00:02:37.959> into<00:02:38.319> place<00:02:38.620> there<00:02:39.040> and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
that just snaps into place there and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.000 
that just snaps into place there and
holds<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:40.000> there<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.480> that's<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.590> cool

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
holds it in there so that's really cool

talk about the video for a second I did
notice<00:04:56.120> if<00:04:56.690> you're<00:04:57.169> watching<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.129> video<00:04:58.250> on<00:04:58.699> a

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
notice if you're watching the video on a

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.480 
notice if you're watching the video on a
mobile<00:04:59.240> device<00:04:59.389> and<00:05:00.080> you're<00:05:00.770> using<00:05:01.039> any

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
mobile device and you're using any

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.899 
mobile device and you're using any
Bluetooth<00:05:02.120> headsets<00:05:03.069> there's<00:05:04.069> a<00:05:04.129> slight

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
Bluetooth headsets there's a slight

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.670 
Bluetooth headsets there's a slight
delay<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:05.599> you<00:05:05.659> notice<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.259> because<00:05:06.530> you're

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
delay and you notice it because you're

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.749 
delay and you notice it because you're
watching<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.250> video<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.909> you<00:05:08.840> see<00:05:09.259> the<00:05:09.830> when

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
watching the video and you see the when

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.369 
watching the video and you see the when
someone's<00:05:11.090> talking<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:11.569> see<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.870> out<00:05:11.960> of<00:05:12.020> sync

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
someone's talking you see it out of sync

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.390 
someone's talking you see it out of sync
I<00:05:12.620> think<00:05:13.129> that's<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.370> problem<00:05:13.759> with<00:05:13.940> every

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
I think that's a problem with every

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.100 
I think that's a problem with every
every<00:05:16.400> one<00:05:16.879> of<00:05:16.940> these<00:05:17.180> stereo<00:05:17.599> Bluetooth

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
every one of these stereo Bluetooth

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.409 
every one of these stereo Bluetooth
headsets<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:19.009> Motorola<00:05:19.580> though<00:05:19.879> was<00:05:20.090> worse

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
headsets the Motorola though was worse

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.719 
headsets the Motorola though was worse
so<00:05:21.520> anyways<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:23.150> one<00:05:23.389> was<00:05:23.990> just<00:05:24.460> probably<00:05:25.460> a

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
so anyways this one was just probably a

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.570 
so anyways this one was just probably a
few<00:05:25.909> milliseconds<00:05:26.479> better<00:05:26.919> or<00:05:27.919> more<00:05:28.159> in<00:05:28.279> sync

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
few milliseconds better or more in sync

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.999 
few milliseconds better or more in sync
and<00:05:28.819> also<00:05:29.599> just<00:05:29.900> one<00:05:30.080> comment<00:05:30.500> on<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.740> range

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
and also just one comment on the range

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.580 
and also just one comment on the range
the<00:05:31.759> range<00:05:31.789> was<00:05:32.300> phenomenal<00:05:33.050> with<00:05:33.229> this<00:05:33.409> I

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
the range was phenomenal with this I

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.589 
the range was phenomenal with this I
could<00:05:33.650> leave<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.550> phone<00:05:34.729> on<00:05:34.880> my<00:05:35.000> desk<00:05:35.240> and<00:05:35.509> I

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
could leave the phone on my desk and I

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.320 
could leave the phone on my desk and I
can<00:05:35.810> walk<00:05:35.990> pretty<00:05:36.830> far<00:05:37.340> in<00:05:37.759> even<00:05:38.060> through
