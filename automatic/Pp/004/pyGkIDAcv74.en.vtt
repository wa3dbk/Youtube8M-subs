00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
have a countertop in the downstairs

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.279 
have a countertop in the downstairs
bathroom<00:00:26.699> which<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.779> want<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.050> change

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
bathroom which I really want to change

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.640 
bathroom which I really want to change
and<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:30.029> color<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:31.199> looked

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and they have a color that really looked

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.380 
and they have a color that really looked
like<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.070> could<00:00:32.189> work<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.820> sandstone

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
like it could work it's like a sandstone

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.240 
like it could work it's like a sandstone
so<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> figured<00:00:34.500> why<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.710> give<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.219> shot

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
so I figured why not give it a shot

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.639 
so I figured why not give it a shot
again<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> watch<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.630> videos<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.170> thought<00:00:37.350> hey

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
again I watch the videos and thought hey

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
again I watch the videos and thought hey
this<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.460> could<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.000> interesting<00:00:39.120> so

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
this this could be really interesting so

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.190 
this this could be really interesting so
in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> box<00:00:40.620> you'll<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.670> comes<00:00:41.960> with<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
in the box you'll see what comes with it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.139 
in the box you'll see what comes with it
we<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.010> special<00:00:44.340> texture<00:00:44.820> sponge<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
we got a special texture sponge here a

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
we got a special texture sponge here a
couple<00:00:48.149> different<00:00:48.450> rollers<00:00:48.840> roller

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
couple different rollers roller

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.740 
couple different rollers roller
application<00:00:50.300> applicators<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.680> roller<00:00:56.750> another

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
application applicators a roller another

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.939 
application applicators a roller another
sponge<00:00:58.140> brush<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:59.809> DVD<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> guess<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.770> should

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
sponge brush a DVD so I guess we should

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
sponge brush a DVD so I guess we should
probably<00:01:01.980> watch<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.809> don't<00:01:03.930> screw

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
probably watch that so I don't screw

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
probably watch that so I don't screw

countertops<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.000> lot<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.210> times<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.570> would

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
countertops a lot of times if you would

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
countertops a lot of times if you would
leave<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.320> counter<00:01:37.619> top<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.060> try<00:01:39.060> to

leave just a counter top and try to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
leave just a counter top and try to
paint<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:39.990> work<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.950> have

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
paint it it would not work so we have

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.679 
paint it it would not work so we have
our<00:01:41.280> step<00:01:41.579> one<00:01:41.610> step<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:43.189> step<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.759> then

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
our step one step one step one and then

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.830 
our step one step one step one and then
words<00:01:45.930> let's<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.259> step<00:01:46.619> two<00:01:47.210> step<00:01:48.210> three<00:01:48.240> step

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
words let's see step two step three step

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.340 
words let's see step two step three step
four<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.130> Step<00:01:51.090> five<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.899> got<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.229> follow

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
four and Step five so you got to follow

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.289 
four and Step five so you got to follow
it<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.740> these<00:01:52.920> ways<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> top

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

it all these ways and they have the top
coat<00:01:54.570> clear<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> gives<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.649> shiny<00:01:55.890> look

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159

so we're going to go ahead we're going
to<00:01:57.780> try<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.469> we're<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.670> how

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
to try this and we're going to see how

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:10.169 
to try this and we're going to see how
it<00:01:59.969> turns<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.320> stick<00:02:01.530> around

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.580 
okay so in the final part in clearcoat
as<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.549> can<00:04:12.700> see<00:04:12.909> how<00:04:13.359> shiny<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:14.019> is<00:04:14.230> an

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
as you can see how shiny it is is an

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.189 
as you can see how shiny it is is an
animal<00:04:14.980> con<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.909> very<00:04:16.239> easy<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.509> apply<00:04:16.720> just

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
animal con is very easy to apply just

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.659 
animal con is very easy to apply just
follow<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.590> directions<00:04:17.650> we<00:04:18.220> need<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.519> watch

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
follow the directions we need to watch

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.640 
follow the directions we need to watch
the<00:04:18.699> video<00:04:19.120> but<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.900> directions<00:04:20.380> were

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
the video but the directions were

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.850 
the video but the directions were
actually<00:04:20.979> very<00:04:21.130> easy<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:22.500> follow

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
actually very easy to follow

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.180 
actually very easy to follow
so<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.400> declare<00:04:24.729> code<00:04:24.940> across<00:04:25.240> everything<00:04:25.720> and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
so to declare code across everything and

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.360 
so to declare code across everything and
it's<00:04:27.190> looking<00:04:27.520> really<00:04:27.760> really<00:04:28.330> good

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
it's looking really really good

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.760 
it's looking really really good
you<00:04:30.370> click<00:04:30.580> on<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.970> side<00:04:31.180> here<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:32.199> mean<00:04:32.530> I

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
you click on the side here and I mean I

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.659 
you click on the side here and I mean I
really<00:04:33.340> really<00:04:33.820> like<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.449> way<00:04:34.570> this<00:04:34.690> came<00:04:34.930> out

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
really really like the way this came out

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.830 
really really like the way this came out
there<00:04:36.669> are<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:36.789> couple<00:04:36.940> spots<00:04:37.300> maybe<00:04:37.600> that

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
there are a couple spots maybe that

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.610 
there are a couple spots maybe that
could<00:04:37.990> have<00:04:38.080> been<00:04:38.199> a<00:04:38.229> little<00:04:38.350> bit<00:04:38.500> better

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
could have been a little bit better

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.770 
could have been a little bit better
taking<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.100> little<00:04:39.220> more<00:04:39.370> time<00:04:39.430> but<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.389> you<00:04:40.600> know

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
taking a little more time but I you know

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.450 
taking a little more time but I you know
that's<00:04:40.990> all<00:04:41.169> just<00:04:41.440> personal<00:04:41.889> preference<00:04:42.130> and

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
that's all just personal preference and

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.540 
that's all just personal preference and
how<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:42.699> actually<00:04:43.150> do<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.630> but<00:04:44.199> I<00:04:44.979> think

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
how you actually do it but I think

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.540 
how you actually do it but I think
already<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.030> looks<00:04:46.199> much<00:04:47.199> better<00:04:47.470> than<00:04:47.800> just<00:04:48.370> a

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
already it looks much better than just a

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.040 
already it looks much better than just a
white<00:04:48.699> countertop<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.360> was<00:04:49.479> there<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:49.840> with

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
white countertop that was there so with

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.659 
white countertop that was there so with
the<00:04:50.259> sink<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.770> then<00:04:50.860> once<00:04:51.099> I<00:04:51.280> clock

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
the sink and then once I clock

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.939 
the sink and then once I clock
everything<00:04:52.180> again<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:53.680> going<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.889> look

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
everything again it's going to look

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.960 
everything again it's going to look
really<00:04:54.009> nice<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:56.380> this<00:04:56.470> was<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:56.680> very<00:04:57.010> very<00:04:57.160> easy

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
really nice so this was a very very easy

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.400 
really nice so this was a very very easy
project<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.599> definitely<00:04:58.900> took<00:04:58.960> about<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.229> day

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
project it definitely took about a day

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.640 
project it definitely took about a day
to<00:04:59.440> do<00:04:59.910> but<00:05:00.910> I'm<00:05:01.419> very<00:05:01.900> happy<00:05:02.110> with<00:05:02.380> it<00:05:02.410> would

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
to do but I'm very happy with it would

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.830 
to do but I'm very happy with it would
highly<00:05:03.070> recommend<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.639> and<00:05:03.940> especially<00:05:04.599> if

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
highly recommend this and especially if

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.810 
highly recommend this and especially if
you<00:05:04.930> do<00:05:05.080> have<00:05:05.289> some<00:05:05.650> some<00:05:06.370> background<00:05:06.729> of

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
you do have some some background of

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.520 
you do have some some background of
doing<00:05:07.090> like<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.389> paint<00:05:07.750> stamping<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:08.349> stuff

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
doing like the paint stamping and stuff

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.390 
doing like the paint stamping and stuff
like<00:05:08.650> that

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
like that

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.129 
like that
probably<00:05:10.030> very<00:05:10.060> easy<00:05:10.510> for<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:10.840> this<00:05:10.930> for<00:05:10.990> the

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
probably very easy for you this for the

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.980 
probably very easy for you this for the
first<00:05:11.349> time<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.620> did<00:05:11.979> this<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:13.389> still<00:05:13.870> really

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
first time I did this and I still really

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.370 
first time I did this and I still really
think<00:05:14.110> it<00:05:14.380> came<00:05:14.530> out<00:05:14.710> really<00:05:15.400> cool<00:05:15.699> so<00:05:16.479> the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
think it came out really cool so the

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.600 
think it came out really cool so the
last<00:05:17.560> time<00:05:17.800> we're<00:05:17.979> going<00:05:18.070> to<00:05:18.159> look<00:05:18.220> at<00:05:18.340> this<00:05:18.400> is

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
last time we're going to look at this is

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.250 
last time we're going to look at this is
after<00:05:19.000> I<00:05:19.030> caught<00:05:19.449> up<00:05:19.510> everything<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.020> put<00:05:20.199> it

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
after I caught up everything and put it

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.290 
after I caught up everything and put it
all<00:05:20.380> back<00:05:20.560> together<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:20.949> take<00:05:21.220> it<00:05:21.340> down<00:05:21.520> but

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
all back together and take it down but

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.860 
all back together and take it down but
so<00:05:23.139> far<00:05:23.409> this<00:05:23.979> really<00:05:24.430> came<00:05:24.580> out<00:05:24.729> excellent<00:05:25.720> I

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870
